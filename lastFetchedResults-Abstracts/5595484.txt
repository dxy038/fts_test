This paper proposes a new method for estimating software based on the size of each use case. It aims to reduce some limitations of the original Use Case Points method with more objective and accurate estimates. The proposed method uses technical variables that can be measured from a brief description of use cases and related system requirements. The size of each use case of the system is derived from three technical variables: UCTP (Use Case Type Points), NBR (Number of Business Rules) and NUIR (Number of User Interface Requirements). The total size of the project is the sum of use cases sizes adjusted by technical and environmental factors. This method was utilized in the Labor Court of Santa Catarina - Brazil to provide support to the negotiation process with third party companies that outsource software development.

The 3-substituted phenyl-5-isoxazolecarboxaldehydes have been identified as activated aldehydes for the generation of isoxazole-based combinatorial libraries on solid phase through automation. Three highly functionalized isoxazole-based libraries comprising of 32, 96 and 45 compounds each have been synthesized in parallel format using Baylis Hillman reaction, Michael addition, reductive amination and alkylation reactions. With an objective of lead generation all the three libraries were evaluated for their antithrombin activity in vivo.

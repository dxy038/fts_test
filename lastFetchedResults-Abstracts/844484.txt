Recently, global optimization methods using chaotic dynamics have been investigated. In
those methods, it is significant what kind of chaotic dynamical system is selected. However,
the system used in most existing methods for generating a chaotic sequence is sometimes
not suitable for solving the problem because the system often has some windows
and a generated sequence tends to overconcentrate around the boundary of the feasible
region. In this paper, in order to improve them, we propose a new dynamical system which
generates a chaotic sequence by the steepest descent method for minimizing an objective
function with additional sinusoidal perturbation terms. In addition, we theoretically show
the sufficient condition under which an approximated dynamical system of the proposed
model at any local minimum or the global minimum is chaotic. Through numerical experiments
we analyze properties of the proposed model for optimization to overcome these
drawbacks. Furthermore, we compare the proposed method with the existing method
through computational experiments by applying them to some global optimization
problems.

A new structurally balanced model reduction algorithm that leads to a stable reduced-order system with improved approximation error is proposed. The algorithm is developed by formulating the problem at hand as an unconstrained optimization problem in which the objective function includes a term that depends on the sum of discarded 2-D Hankel singular values. An example is given to illustrate the performance of the reduced-order system obtained using the new algorithm

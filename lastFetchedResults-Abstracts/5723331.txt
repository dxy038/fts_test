In smart grids, a communication network with bidirectional data transmission between network components is required for functionalities, such as grid monitoring, control and protection. These functionalities set different requirements for communication. This paper focuses on the use of power-line communication (PLC) as a data transmission method for monitoring, control and protection functions in a proposed novel smart grid concept - low-voltage direct current (LVDC) distribution system. Hence, a PLC-based communication architecture for the LVDC system is proposed, its feasibility analyzed theoretically and verified by measurements. Channel capacity and practical data transmission tests are performed in a laboratory environment. Finally, the suitability of the proposed network architecture for the LVDC system and its compliance with the set requirements are analyzed.

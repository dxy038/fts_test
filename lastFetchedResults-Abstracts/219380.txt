Background: Post open cardiac surgery is associated with rises in fever, blood pressure and heart rate. The objective of the present study was to determine the changes in temperature, blood pressure and heart rate in first week after open cardiac surgery of non-complicated cyanotic and noncyanotic congenital heart diseases.Patients and Methods: Temperature, blood pressure and heart rate were obtained from 100 patients with different congenital heart disease after open cardiac surgery. The patients divided in two groups, 40 cyanotic CHD
and 60 noncyanotic CHD. Result: Half of patients had fever in first day after surgery. Cyanotic patients became afebrile earlier than noncyanotic group. Cyanotic patients had higher heart rate and lower blood pressure than noncyanotic group. 
Conclusion: The study suggests that post open heart surgery body temperature, blood pressure and heart rate are
different in patients with cyanotic and non cyanotic congenital heart diseases.

The objective was to assess the antiemetic activity of granisetron, dexamethasone and droperidol in the otologic surgeries. Sixty patients in ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) I and II risk groups who underwent surgery for chronic otitis media were assessed in a double blind and randomized trial. The patients were divided into three equal groups. Single intravenous dose of granisetron (3 mg), granisetron (3 mg) plus dexamethasone (8 mg) and droperidol (1.25 mg) were prophylactically administered to the patients in group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively, and their antiemetic actions were compared. The antiemetic effects of the drugs were not significantly different between the groups (P>0.05). The antiemetic effects also did not differ significantly in the early and late postoperative periods (P>0.05). In conclusion, the results of prophylactic use or side effects of granisetron, granisetron plus dexamethasone or droperidol are similar in middle ear surgery. Therefore, cost effectivity of the antiemetic prophylaxis should be reconsidered in otologic surgery in the light of the results of this study.

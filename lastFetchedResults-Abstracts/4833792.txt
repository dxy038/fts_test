With the formation´s method of self-similar system, deduced a ergodic way of Internet address, designed basic iteration piece and a network address ergodic algorithm which begin with integrating of iterative algorithm and recursive algorithm. At the same time, completed demonstration of the algorithm, and analyzed the entire course of the study, have given some parameter adjustment ways to meet different requirements.

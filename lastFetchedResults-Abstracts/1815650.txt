High and low antibody responder lines of mice from Selections I, III and G were assayed for two-step skin tumorigenesis using a protocol consisting in initiation with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and promotion with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Concordant results were obtained in the three selections: low antibody responder mice were shown to be significantly more resistant to tumor induction than the high responder counterparts. The difference was observed for all parameters: kinetics and percentages of tumor incidence and tumor multiplicity. The three bidirectional selective breeding experiments differed in several respects namely, the origin of the foundation populations, the antigens and immunization protocols used during the selection, as well as the breeding unit environments. Therefore, the consistent results relative to tumorigenesis strongly suggest that some of the alleles relevant to multispecific ‘low’ antibody production could contribute to the resistance to cutaneous chemical tumorigenesis.

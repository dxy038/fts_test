Information technology systems provide a wide variety of different user interfaces in terms of hardware, software and interface technology. This is not always helpful for users. Therefore, one of the most important objectives of user interface standardisation is to ensure that IT equipment is fit for purpose and suits the tasks and characteristics of its intended users. A second objective is to reduce unnecessary or inappropriate variation in user interface hardware or software which can cause major learning problems for users, increase error rates and reduce efficiency. A third objective is to ensure that IT systems can be used safely and comfortably. Indeed, the Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations 1992 require all employers to minimise the risks to users of display screen equipment. In addition, employers are required to ensure that display screen equipment, its associated furniture and interface software meet minimum requirements specified in the Schedule to the Regulations. As part of the Health and Safety at Work etc., Act 1974, these obligations are placed on all employers and are part of the legal responsibilities of individual managers. The Health and Safety Executive Guidance points out that display screen equipment which meets the relevant standards (BS 7179 and BS/EN 29241) is deemed to meet and in most cases exceed the minimum requirements set out in the Schedule to the Regulations. Thus, although compliance with the standards is not the only way to meet the Schedule, it is the most certain and straightforward way for employers to ensure that they purchase suitable display screen equipment

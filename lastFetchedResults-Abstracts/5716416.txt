Dynamic function allocation (DFA) refers to the variable distribution of functions in real time between the system and the operator(s) to achieve optimal system performance. In order to explore the application of DFA in Naval command and control systems, DERA has developed a new research environment, the Naval Dynamic Allocation Research Testbed (N-DART), which is based on the tasks performed by an anti-air warfare controller. Experimental studies are currently being conducted to examine explicit DFA utilising N-DART. The overall system performance is being evaluated in terms of a number of objective measures. N-DART is being further developed to incorporate an implicit mode of DFA based upon a hybrid model of three potential control mechanisms. Implementation issues surrounding system-controlled dynamic allocation of functions in this context are discussed

In this paper a new topology of high step-up converters is proposed based on flyback conversion concept, which is applicable in distributed energy resources, such as Photovoltaics. The input stage of the converter includes a bidirectional boost cell which its PWM switching strategy results in a wide load ZVS of switches. Leakage inductance of coupled inductor limits currents of diodes and results in ZCS of diodes. We analyze the converter and present gain calculations. Also Soft switching conditions are discussed and Dynamic relations of converter required for controller design are represented. Finally we simulate the proposed converter for validation of the converter.

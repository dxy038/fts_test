Objective To examine in a nationally representative
sample (a) the differential association of specific anxiety
and depressive disorders defined according to DSM-IV
with pain disorder (PD) and pain symptoms, and (b)
whether pain-associated anxiety and depressive disorders
and their comorbidity have different implications in terms
of impairment, disability, health care utilization, and substance
use.
Method A nationally representative community study
was conducted in Germany. Symptoms, syndromes and
diagnoses of mental disorders, and pain were assessed in
N = 4,181 participants aged 18–65 years using the DSMIV/
M-CIDI.
Results Logistic regressions revealed that pain is associated
with both specific anxiety and depressive disorders,
with increasing significant odds ratios (OR) for medically
explained pain symptoms (EPS; OR range: 1.9–2.0), to
unexplained pain symptoms (UPS; OR range: 2.4–7.3), to
PD (OR range: 3.3–14.8). PD and UPS persistently showed
associations after adjusting for comorbid other anxiety and
depressive disorders and physical illnesses. All types of
pain, particularly PD/UPS, are associated with decreased
quality of life, greater impairment in role functioning,
disability, health care utilization, and substance use.
Depressive disorders, even more so anxiety disorders and
their comorbidity account for a substantial proportion of
variance in these functional correlates.
Conclusions Pain is strongly associated with specific
anxiety and depressive disorders. In light of the individual
and societal burden due to pain, and the demonstrated role
of comorbid anxiety or/and depression, our results call for
further investigation of the underlying mechanisms for this
association as well as targeted treatments for these
comorbidities.

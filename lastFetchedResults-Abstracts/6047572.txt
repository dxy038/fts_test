Two objective measures, computed from received digital images, that can be used to assess video quality are proposed. These measures, based on Laplacian and Sobel gradient operators, are developed and applied to video teleconferencing (VTC) sequences of live desktop scenes and conference table scenes with motion present. The measured results are then compared over a range of transmission bit rates. The sensitivity and reliability of the measures are enhanced by determining the optimum gray level thresholds for computing the measures. Both measures are shown to monotonically increase with transmission rate and corresponding illustrative subjective evaluation of the images. These measures have been proposed for possible inclusion into a draft National VTC Standard under development in the ANSI T1Q1.5 teleconferencing standards group

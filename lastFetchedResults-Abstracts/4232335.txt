For the controlling of the speed and/or torque of the induction motor (IM) this paper represents the development of a PI-controller for the control of induction motor. The PWM drive system of an induction motor and its controller have been modelled and analyzed. The objective of this control is to ensure the stability of the controller when subjected to the variations in a load torque and reference speed. To gain the required results for the whole system, in system parameters, open loop and closed loop have been considered. Through simulation, the performance of the controller has been investigated using MATLAB/Simulink. The basic framework of the induction motor which is drive controlled via a PI-controller performed as intended when a series of tests were conducted.

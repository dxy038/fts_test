The objective of this study is to investigate the location of the gas–liquid interface at various temperatures in a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell under non-isothermal conditions. A mathematical model, coupled with the electrochemical process, two-phase flows, species transfer, and heat transfer is employed. A finite volume-based CFD approach is applied to investigate the species transport behavior in a fuel cell. The effects of two model parameters, namely cell temperature (Tcell) and humidification temperature (Th), on the gas–liquid interface and cell performance are presented. Simulation results indicate that variations of these two parameters influence the location of the gas–liquid interface, the cell performance, and the distribution of liquid water saturation. At lower cell temperatures, the gas–liquid interface moves toward the inlet port of the channel when the humidification temperature is greater than the cell temperature. Therefore, the cell performance decreases as the liquid water clogs the passage for the transport of oxygen. Furthermore, these two factors are closely related to the membrane temperature distribution. Obvious variations in magnitude are seen at a cell temperature of 323 K and a humidification temperature of 343 K.

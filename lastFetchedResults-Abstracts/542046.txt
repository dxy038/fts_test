The need assessment is not a certain situation in instructional research, but it is an important and effective method of instructional planning and designing in the Kemp model, the instructional development institute model, developing instructional systems, and criterion referenced instructional model. 
Need assessment provides a good situation for creating strategies, policies, aims and logical activities to satisfy needs. The aim is to introduce applied methods for a comprehensive need assessment method for institutional, instructional and cultural programmers, researches, scholars, and students. 
In order to this, the present work studies the nature, aim, and process of objective-oriented methods (with classical, analogue, inductive, Klein proposed techniques), adaptive-oriented methods (along with the techniques of Delphi, Fishbowl, Telstar), and problem-oriented methods (with techniques of Foul Tree, key tasks test, job analysis, and compound methods in macro-level subject-free needs assessment, centered long-term, the micro-regional and the micro-institutional levels).

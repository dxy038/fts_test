      Objective(s): Because of the high total phenolic contents of Feijoa sellowiana , its nephroprotective effect was determined in 3,4-methylene dioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) treated mice.    Materials and Methods: Animals received 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg doses of aqueous or methanol extract of F. sellowiana  leaves, intra-peritoneally. After one hour, an acute administration of MDMA (20 mg/kg, IP) was injected. Nephroprotective effect was assayed by determination of serum creatinine, serum urea and kidney glutathione level. Histopathological study was also used.    Results   : Both extracts at 40 mg/kg resulted in a significant reversal in the raised serum creatinine levels (P <0.05). Not statistically significant was observed in effect of two extracts (P>0.05). A decrease in urea/ creatinine ratio was observed following aqueous extract treatment. Methanolic extract showed higher activity in increasing kidney glutathione (P  Conclusion:   F. sellowiana extract resulted in a markedly decrease in the nephrotoxicity of MDMA in mice.

With the objective of developing films for advanced systems, a photo-assisted sol–gel method has been used to form an anti-reflection/anti-static thin film on an organic film (PET) that has no heat-resistance, and the properties of the film have been evaluated. This method makes it possible to form a layered ITO/SiO2 structure on the film at 60 °C, which is a good condition for such film formation. This film has a surface resistance of 2.0 × 106 Ω/□ and a surface reflectivity of 0.35% (at 574 nm), which are good anti-reflection and anti-static properties for a thin film. Observation of the cross-sectional structure of the film by transmission electron microscope (TEM) reveals that the layer formed on the film is both flat and uniform.

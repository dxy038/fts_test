This article focuses on an alternative technology for attitude control called shape change actuation and control. The objective is to control the spacecraft attitude by purposefully changing the mass distribution of the spacecraft. Shape change actuation and control is not useful for momentum dumping or storage. Rather, it is intended for efficient, low-authority attitude control, possibly as a backup for thrusters and reaction wheels.

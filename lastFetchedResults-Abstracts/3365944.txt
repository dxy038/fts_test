Simultaneous bidirectional optical link operation has been demonstrated using a single multiquantum well (MQW) electro-optic modulator as a combined detector and remodulator to implement a remote, optically passive, downstream terminal. Using a nominal downstream carrier of 100 MHz with an upstream return carrier for 10 MHz, a remodulation depth as great as -10 dB has been demonstrated.

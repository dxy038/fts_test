The finite element method is one of the most common tools for the comprehensive analysis of structures with applications reaching from static, often nonlinear stressâ€“strain, to transient dynamic analyses. For single calculations the expense to generate an appropriate mesh is often insignificant compared to the analysis time even for complex geometries and therefore negligible. However, this is not the case for certain other applications, most notably structural optimization procedures, where the (re-)meshing effort is very important with respect to the total runtime of the procedure. Thus it is desirable to find methods to efficiently generate mass and stiffness matrices allowing to reduce this effort, especially for structures with modifications of minor complexity, e.g. panels with cutouts.

ore, a modeling approach referred to as Energy Modification Method is proposed in this paper. The underlying idea is to model and discretize the basis structure, e.g. a plate, and the modifications, e.g. holes, separately. The discretized energy expressions of the modifications are then subtracted from (or added to) the energy expressions of the basis structure and the coordinates are related to each other by kinematical constraints leading to the mass and stiffness matrices of the complete structure. This approach will be demonstrated by two simple examples, a rod with varying material properties and a rectangular plate with a rectangular or circular hole, using a finite element discretization as basis. Convergence studies of the method based on the latter example follow demonstrating the rapid convergence and efficiency of the method. Finally, the Energy Modification Method is successfully used in the structural optimization of a circular plate with holes, with the objective to split all its double eigenfrequencies.

Reclamation of sandy land in arid and semi-arid areas has a high potential in increasing carbon sequestration and improving soil quality. The objective of this study was to assess the amount of soil carbon sequestration and enhancement of soil properties under plantation of two well-adapted species to desert environment, i.e Atriplex and Haloxylon. This study was conducted in Shahid Zenderuh Research Station in Jupar city of Kerman Province. In this region Atriplex canescens and Haloxylon ammodendron species have been planted for wind erosion control. According to the research objectives, 24 soil samples were taken from each depth (under canopy cover and control sites) through systematic-random method. Soil carbon sequestration was determined using Walkley-Black method. The results showed that the reclamation of severe sandy desertified land with these plants significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC). SOC concentration in areas planted with Haloxylon and Atriplex species increased by 16.2 and 18.1 ton/ha respectively as compared to control. However, this amount in Atriplex plantation site was more than that observed in Haloxylon plantation area. Therefore, it is concluded that A.canescens has better performance in soil carbon sequestration in the sandy study area compared to that of H.ammodendron.

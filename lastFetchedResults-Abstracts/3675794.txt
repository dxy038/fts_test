The purpose of this paper is to present a robust and fast beamforming algorithm for the low-cost mobile phased array antennas. The proposed beamforming algorithm uses a sequentially perturbation gradient estimation method to update the control voltages of the phase shifters, with the objective of maximizing the received power by the array. This algorithm does not require either the knowledge of phase shifter characteristics or signal direction-of-arrival. Moreover, in this paper, the algorithm parameters are derived for the stationary and mobile platform configurations. For the stationary array, it is shown how the proper selection of the beamforming parameters limits the noise effects and increases the array output power. For the mobile array, a condition for the fast convergence is derived and the advantage of using nonuniform step size to update the control voltages is illustrated. When phase shifters suffer from the imbalanced insertion loss the proposed beamforming technique perturbs the phase-conjugate condition to increase the total received power. This algorithm has been implemented with the low-cost microwave components and applied to a Ku-band phased array antenna with 34 sub-arrays. The experimental results verify the broadband performance, and the fast convergence of the algorithm for different platform maneuvers.

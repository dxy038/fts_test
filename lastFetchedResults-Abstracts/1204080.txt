This study attempts to investigate how a player's position in an online gaming community leads to his or her continuance intention toward a Massive Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG) from the perspective of social capital theory. Using subjective and objective data collected from 340 players in a representative MMOG, our results reveal that community position significantly affects community trust and perceived social value, which in turn positively influence MMOG continuance intention. Furthermore, this study provides support for the moderating effects of game knowledge and community size on the proposed model. This study concludes with research limitations and theoretical and managerial implications.

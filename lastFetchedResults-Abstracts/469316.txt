Objective
This study was undertaken to determine effects of male aging on sperm parameters, fertilization, pregnancy, and live birth rates among in vitro fertilization (IVF) or gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) couples. The impact of female age was also investigated.
Study design
Prospective study was made up of 221 IVF and GIFT couples.
Results
Pregnancy rates declined as the male subjects aged. Each additional year of paternal age was associated with 11% increased odds (P = .007) of not achieving a pregnancy, and 12% odds (P = .01) of not having a successful live birth. For first-time IVF/GIFT recipients, each additional year of paternal age was associated with a 5% increased odds of not achieving a pregnancy, whereas for repeaters it was 40% (P = .01). Advancing maternal age was associated with decreased numbers of oocytes retrieved or fertilized. Women 40 years or older compared with younger than 35 years had greater than 4-fold risk of not becoming pregnant, and greater than 20-fold risk of not achieving a live birth.
Conclusion
Advancing paternal (and maternal) age had a deleterious effect on IVF and GIFT outcomes.

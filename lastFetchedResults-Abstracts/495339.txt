Background and objective: Coronary heart diseases (CHD) are one of the most causes of morbidity and mortality in industrial and developing countries such as Iran. Recent studies have suggested that chronic infections with Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn) may be associated with the risk of CHD. Determining risk factor of the CHD is of huge significance, so we burden the comparative study of antibody level Chlamydia pneumoniae in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and healthy subjects in Gorgan.

Materials and methods: The present study was Case-Control that carried out in 2006. Seroprevalence was assessed by commercial ELISA tests measuring IgA and IgG antibodies to Cpn.

Results: Among CHD patients, %7.3 was seropositive for Anti- Cpn IgA, %89.0 were seropositive for Anti- Cpn IgG. Our finding indicated that among normal controls %17.6 was seropositive for Anti- Cpn IgA, %77.6 were seropositive for Anti- Cpn IgG. The present study shows that occurrence of IgG without IgA in serum, have case-control significance differences (P < 0.005).

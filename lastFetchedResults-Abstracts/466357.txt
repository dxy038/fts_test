Objective: Our purpose was to determine the rates of recurrence, persistence, and progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in women who were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus after excisional therapy with and without highly active antiretroviral therapy. Study Design: The records of 118 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, 56 of whom were infected with human immunodeficiency virus and 62 of whom were not infected, were examined to compare outcomes. Demographic, behavioral, and clinical indices were analyzed. Results: Of 54 women infected with human immunodeficiency virus, 31 (57.4%) had persistent or recurrent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, in comparison with 10 (16.7%) of 60 noninfected women (P< .01). Progression occurred in 4 (16.7%) of 54 in the infected group and in 3 (5.0%) of 60 in the noninfected group (P< .05). In 21 (60.0%) of 35 infected women, in comparison with 8 (32%) of 25 noninfected women, disease persisted 6 months after diagnosis if treatment was not given (P< .05). Of 19 infected women, 10 (52.6%) had recurrent disease after treatment, compared with 2 (5.7%) of 35 noninfected women (P< .01). Risk factors for recurrence in women who were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus included margin involvement of specimens obtained by loop electrosurgical excision (87.5% vs 20.0%l; P< .05). Exposure to highly active antiretroviral therapy, including therapy with protease inhibitors, was associated with a lower recurrence or persistence rate (17.6% vs 70.3%; P< .05) and a lower progression rate (0% vs 24%; P< .05). Conclusion: Women infected with human immunodeficiency virus had high rates of recurrent and persistent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia despite standard therapy. Low CD4+ levels and margin involvement of specimens obtained by loop electrosurgical excision are risk factors for recurrence. The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy is associated with a lower risk of recurrence, persistence, and progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.

The present article studies Prototype of transitive structure in Persian verbs. So far, transitivity has been studied from different aspects. However, in Persian language it has been studied limitedly from a cognitive perspective. The main objective of the present article is to get to a precise and clear definition of transitivity regarding Persian speakersâ€™ cognition. To do so, the author defines prototype of transitive structure based on seven major criteria, and one minor criterion. According to the findings of the research, to define transitivity we have to consider both form and function. Transitivity can be defined on a continuum, ranging from prototypical transitive verbs to non-prototypical transitive verbs, and intransitive verbs.

As Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications become more popular in every day life, the importance of flexible communication protocols rises higher. The limited resources and time-critical nature of WSN must be addressed by the network layer, as one of the most mandatory communication components to support routing capabilities in multi-hop mobile sensor nodesÂ´ topologies. WSNs application particularities are analyzed in order to form the design framework for an adaptive routing algorithm that can address all WSN needs. Simulation tests have shown that A.MO.R (Adaptive Multi-Objective Routing) can achieve the WSNs objectives with low communication and energy overhead while meeting QoS and congestion requirements.

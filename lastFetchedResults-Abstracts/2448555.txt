The objective of the ITER TBM Program is to provide the first experimental data on the performance of the breeding blankets in the integrated fusion nuclear environment. Such information is essential to design and predict the performance of DEMO and future fusion reactors. It foresees to test six mock-ups of breeding blankets, called Test Blanket Module (TBM), in three dedicated ITER equatorial ports from the beginning of the ITER operation. The TBM and its associated ancillary systems, including cooling system and tritium extraction system, forms the Test Blanket System (TBS) that will be fully integrated in the ITER machine and buildings. This paper describes the main features of the six TBSs that are presently planned for installation and operation in ITER, the main interfaces with other ITER systems and the main aspects of the TBM Program management.

A role for adenosine in ischemic preconditioning and hypoxic preconditioning (HP) has been established in several species but is controversial in rats, due in part to the inconsistency of the data from the different experimental design. Our objective was to investigate the role of adenosine in the protection of the ischemic myocardium by HP in rats. Methods: perfused hearts isolated from Sprague–Dawley rats were exposed to 5 min of hypoxic perfusion before 25 min of global ischemia followed by 20 min of reperfusion. The effects of adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-(p-sulfophenyl)-theophylline (8SPT) on HP-based changes in left-ventricular function, energy metabolites, and release of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were determined. To minimise non-specific effects of 8SPT, low concentrations of agent (0.5 or 1.0μmol/l) were used. Results: 8SPT alone had no deleterious effects on normoxically perfused hearts or on ischemic/reperfused hearts. HP improved the recovery of LV function and creatine phosphate, and reduced the release of enzymes during reperfusion. 8SPT (1.0μmol/l) ameliorated the beneficial effect of HP on cardiac function, but did not reverse the reduction in release of enzymes by HP completely. Conclusion: results suggest that the protective effect of HP on myocardial contractile function may be mediated by receptor(s) that can be inhibited by low concentrations of antagonist but may not have a primary role in the reduction of cellular damage by HP in rats.

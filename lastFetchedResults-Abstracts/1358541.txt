Background and objective: Acinetobacter is common in nosocomial pathogen and it is a health care associated opportunistic multidrug resistant pathogen. The purpose of this study is to determine the sensivity and resistance of Acinetobacter strains that was isolated from clinical samples of patients who was admitted to Arad hospital in Tehran.
Materials and methods: In this descriptive examination, after extracting Acinetobacter derivations from clinical samples (Urine, sond fuli, sputum, wound, blood and bronchial), Their sensitivity was measured using standard Kirby-Bauer test, in contract with following antibiotics Amikacin, Ciprofloxacin, Gentamicin, Imipenem, Ceftriaxone Sulfametoxazole Trimetoprime, Piperacilin and Cefotaxime and then the results analayzed.
Results: In this study of 225 samples of Acinetobacter derivation isolated from clinical specimens, the most amount of sensivity was Piperacilin and Ciprofloxacin and the most amount of resistance was to Gentamicin and Amikacin.
Conclusion: The results of this study are indicating that Acinetobacter strains resistance has increased against Gentamycin and Amikacin; presumably due to excessive consumption of these antibiotics. It is obvious that, with increasing consumption of antibiotics, and consequently, augmentation of antibacterial resistance, control of this resistance factor is necessary and inevitable, we recommended to avoid unnecessary usage of antibiotics.

This paper presents a new analysis and synthesis filters design method for achieving nearly perfect reconstruction low group delay cosine-modulated filter bank (CMFB). The objective is to show how far we can reduce the overall group delay of this proposed CMFB by using this new analysis and synthesis filter prototypes. Simulation results show that the overall group delay of our proposed approach can be reduced to about 45% of the original CMFB group delay. In addition, the mean-square-error-reconstruction performance of our new method is also 3.9 dB superior compared to that for the original CMFB

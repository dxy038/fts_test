Global gravity field is commonly modelled in spherical harmonic basis functions to a certain degree of spectral and spatial resolution. Nonuniformdistribution and differentquality data limited these function in local gravity field modeling.Spherical harmonic basis functions show more global property that mean they are suitable for showing low frequency gravityfield. In localscale studies, radial basis functions on the sphere with quasilocal support can improve gravity fields up to a high spatial/spectral resolution.The local modelsare usually more accurate than global modelsin the desired location.These functions are usually not orthogonal on a sphere, which makes the modelling process more complex.In this study we evaluated the radial basis functions: pointmass kernel, radial multipoles, Poisson and Poisson wavelet and then we compare their performance in regional gravity field modelling on the sphere using real gravity acceleration data in Fars coastal area. A leastsquares technique has been used to estimate the gravity field parameters. Iterative LevenbergMarquardtalgorithm is applied for nonlinear inverse problem solving and minimization of differences between calculated and observed values. These parameters include number, location, depth and scaling coefficients in radial basis function.In order to increase efficiency LevenbergMarquardt algorithm for solving gravity field modelling, the initial valueof the regularization parameter determined with a relation based on objective function Jacobian and also a method is provided for this parameter updates. The results showed that the accuracy of gravity field modelling for any types of radial basis function would be almost the same, if the depths of SRBFs are chosen properly.

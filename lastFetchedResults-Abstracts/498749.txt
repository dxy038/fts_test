The objective of the research was to validate the AOT for estimation of V02max in healthy pupils. Subjects included 80 boys and 102 girls selected by purposeful stratified sampling based on age criteria. Subjects participated in both AOT and a criterion test during a one week period. Age sub-groups were 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 years of age, each consisting of at least 10 volunteers. The criterion measures were directly obtained from gas-analyzer outputs during a treadmill workout. Statistical analysis was based on multiple regression analysis. For boys, mean (±standard deviation) of weight, height, maximal heart rate, BMI, and relative V02max were 55 (±17kg), 163 (±15cm), 201 (±8 beat), 20.19 (±3.84kg/m2), 38 (±6ml/kg/min), respectively. The same measures for girls were 46 (±10kg), 156 (±9cm), 199 (±9beat), 18.60 (±2.95 kg/m2), 34 (±4ml/kg/min), respectively. The study showed that there was no significant relationship between age and relative VC^max for girls, whilst it was significant for boys (P < 0.01). For both boys and girls, increase in BMI was accompanied by decrease in maximal heart rate and VC^max. Calculating formulas were produced in order to estimate VC^max from measures obtained of field AOT or Lab treadmill protocol. Compared to similar studies, produced formulas were scientifically acceptable, and the estimations were sufficiently accurate. High determination coefficients (Min = %45 and Max = %65) and low standard errors of estimate (Min=2.97 and Max=3.78 ml/kg/min) indicated that V02max estimations by AOT protocols were considerably trustworthy. It is noteworthy that in comparison to adults, estimating formulas of VC^max in adolescents generally have less determination coefficients.

Nonmetallic inclusions are harmful to the mechanical properties of every kind of steel produced worldwide. The greater the size of the inclusion present in the structure of a determined kind of steel, the greater its negative effect on the quality of the steel. Therefore, the objective of this work was to investigate the size, the quantity, the shape and the chemical composition of nonmetallic inclusions formed throughout the refining process of silicon-killed, low-carbon steel, as a function of the treatment time in a ladle furnace, trying to ensure the flotation of inclusions bigger than 25 Î¼m. This investigation was carried out using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), with an analysis system using energy dispersive spectometry (EDS). Based on this work, it was possible to know more precisely the nature of the inclusions, the necessary time to ensure flotation of large inclusions, the efficiency of the slag to capture the inclusions, and the inclusion level of the steel throughout its refining process to try to obtain a higher quality steel product.

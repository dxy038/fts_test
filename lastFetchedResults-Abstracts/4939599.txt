Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology is employed in monitoring system to prevent the spontaneous combustion of coal gangue. A temperature monitoring system was designed, which monitor environment of gangue and prevent the occurrence of spontaneous combustion networking strategy through the collection of temperature in real-time or fix time. According to the energy-constrained problem of WSN, pseudo-parallel genetic algorithms (PPGA) is used in the multi-objective optimization problem of coal gangue detection with WSN. ItÂ´s for designing networking strategy of coal gangue detection system. Appropriate encoding mechanism is worked out. Combining with various important parameters, the fitness function is established. Simulation results show: Energy management is optimized with the WSN base on PPGA and guarantee maximum life span of the network.

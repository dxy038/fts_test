Evoked potentials are usually evaluated subjectively, by visual inspection, and considerable differences between interpretations can occur. Objective, automated methods are normally based on calculating one (or more) parameters from the data, but only some of these techniques can provide statistical significance (p-values) for the presence of a response. In this work, we propose a bootstrap technique to provide such p-values, which can be applied to a wide variety of parameters. The bootstrap method is based on randomly resampling (with replacement) the original data and gives an estimate of the probability that the response obtained is due to random variation in the data rather than a physiological response.

thod is illustrated using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to detecting hearing thresholds. The flexibility of the approach is illustrated, showing how it can be used with different parameters, numbers of stimuli and with user-defined false-positive rates. The bootstrap method provides a new, simple and yet powerful means of detecting evoked potentials, which is very flexible and readily adapted to a wide variety of signal parameters.

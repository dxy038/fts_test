After a brief review of the literature on the more general aspects of colour in television, attention is drawn to the subjective aspects of picture quality, both in monochrome and in colour. Reference is made to earlier work on a somewhat similar problem of colour rendering in which the binocular matching technique has given promising results. Based on this experience, apparatus and methods are described which should facilitate the study of the subjective requirements under different conditions of presentation and view. These subjective requirements could then be related to the objective photometric and colorimetric measurements carried out by physical instruments indicating directly in the C.I.E. system. Reference is made to the interest shown by the C.I.E. in colour television and their 1951 resolutions on this subject are recorded.

A method for deriving an objective video quality metric that emulates the human video quality metric is described. The objective metric comprises a family of measurements that quantify spatial, temporal, luminance, and chrominance distortions, followed by a prediction algorithm. The intent is that the derived metric will work well over a wide range of digital and analog video transmission and storage technologies. After describing the need for these measures, a detailed description of the derivation process and some preliminary results are given

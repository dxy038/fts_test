Farmers usually control cattleÂ´s serum vitamin A level to improve beef meat fat quality. They sometimes conduct blood tests, but that is invasive and another measurement system is desirable. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum vitamin A level and pupil colors of beef cattle for developing a vitamin A monitoring system by machine vision. Images of cattle eyes were collected and chromaticity values of pupil color were calculated. Although the values had variability, it was found that serum vitamin A had a negative correlation with red component, while it had a positive correlation with blue component.

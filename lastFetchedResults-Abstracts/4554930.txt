The paper designs a driving circuit of high sensitive, wide dynamic for CCD sensing imaging system which adopts a Dalsa-made high resolution full-frame 33-mega pixels area CCD FTF5066M. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is used as the main detechniquevice to accomplish the timing design of the circuits and power driver control of the sensor. By using the Correlated Double Sampling (CDS) technique, the video noise is reduced and the SNR of the system is increased. The output rate of the imaging system designed with integrated chip can reach to 1.3 frames per second through bi-channel output. We use the histogram specification to adjust the brightness of the captured image. And then use the median filtering to suppress the noise. The traditional gray mean gradient (GMG) and the objective evaluation method based on Human Visual System (HVS) used to verify the effect of image enhancement.

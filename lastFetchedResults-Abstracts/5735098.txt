This paper explores the possibility of using common types of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) test antennas to perform high-resolution time-domain site attenuation measurements. The objective of this research is to provide EMC engineers with a tool to perform evaluations of radiated emissions test sites. Numerical simulations are used to site attenuation behavior using biconical antennas, log-periodic dipole arrays, and dipoles. A two-step measurement procedure and data processing sequence are used to generate high-resolution time-domain waveforms. The results are promising, and demonstrate that high-resolution waveforms can be obtained using models of conventional EMC antenna types.

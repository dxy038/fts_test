Online Examination System is an effective solution for mass education evaluation. The novel online examination system based on Browser/Server framework which carries out the examination and auto-grading for objective questions and operating questions has been successfully applied to the distance evaluation of basic operating skills of computer science. But most system still use username/password mode to identify the candidates. In this article, we describe a fingerprint based technology to identity authentication instead of the traditional username/password methods. A fingerprint identify/classify application and a load balance service are implemented on the examination server cooperated with the online examination system to accomplish authentication. The interfaces between the examination system and the identity authentication application can use code embed methods or SDK invoking methods to adapt different fingerprint sensors. The identity authentication works well in the Internet/intranet online examination systems.

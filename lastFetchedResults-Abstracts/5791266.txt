Nowadays online videos are one of the most popular and powerful communication tools. But, still online videos provide only a passive user-experience and in more precise terms, the only thing user can do is to watch the videos. The main objective of this work is to leverage the existing video contents and turn them into transactional content marketing. For example, user can select items shown while playing the video and without making any interruption, the selected items are displayed in a special merchandised page where you can purchase them or can know more details about that selected item later on. TLD technique which is designed for long-term tracking is used for obtaining items location in the video stream. With that extracted location information, we draw bounding box around the items in each frame and the user can select those items displayed within the bounding box. In our system, user finger gestures are used for selecting the items using the Leap Motion Controller.

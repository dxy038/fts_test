Background and Aim: Safety climate is a psychological phenomenon and a sub-component of safety culture, which is usually reflected in the shared workforce's perceptions about the state of safety at any particular time. It can provide an indication of the priority of safety in an organization with regard to other priorities such as production or quality. The objective of this study was to assess the safety climate profile in a steel manufacturing plant in Iran and using the results to improve the level of safety. 
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the UK Loughborough University Safety Climate Assessment Toolkit was used to assess the safety climate in a steel-manufacturing industry in Iran. Information was collected through interviews and questionnaires, focus group discussions, and direct observations in the filed. Safety climate scores were calculated in 17 themes.
Results: A graphic representation of the safety climate scores obtained showed that safety climate in the company is at the medium level (4.80 ± 2). The highest and lowest scores were for dimensions of personal priority and need for safety (8.6± 0.8) and accidents and incidents (1±0.00). A non-significant correlation was found between worker's education and work experience on the one hand and their attitude towards safety on the other hand (p>0.05). Both management commitment and personal priority were associated with the workers' age (p= 0.03 and 0.02, respectively), while work environment was associated only with employment status (p = 0.04). 
Conclusion: Safety climate assessment can be a proactive safety performance indicator used to improve the level of safety in an organisation.

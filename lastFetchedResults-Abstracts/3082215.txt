With the increased interest of m-business, there have been a lot of studies about the business model (BM) on m-business in not only academic field but also commercial field. Among them, the classification of m-BM and analysis of BM patents are some of the main topics in the BM research areas. Previous researches on the classification of m-BM and BM patents can give us the initiating issues of BM on m-business but they are subject to some limitations. The main objective of this paper is to suggest an inductive taxonomical approach for classifying BMs on m-business with a view point of BM structure and compare it with some typological classifications. Specifically, the approach applies a quantitative analysis by employing BM patents. 9 clusters are found by clustering analysis with SOM (self-organizing map) and they are analyzed with citation analysis. They are also compared with some typologies. The result of this study could be used as a basic framework or starting point of the quantitative analysis of BM on m-business

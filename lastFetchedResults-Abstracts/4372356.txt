An adaptive segmentation based joint source-channel coding scheme for wireless video transmission is proposed. In particular, for a given standard source encoder, such as H.263, the image frames are adaptively segmented into regions in terms of rate-distortion characteristics. Then, bit allocation is optimally performed for the regions taking into account objective visual distortion sensitivity and channel condition. Furthermore, an efficient algorithm with low computational complexity is contrived to ease the optimization process. Simulations confirm that the proposed scheme is an effective way to support a reliable video transmission in various harsh environments

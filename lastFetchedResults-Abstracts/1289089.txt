New series of 5-methyl/trifluoromethoxy-1H-indole-2,3-dione 3-thiosemicarbazones 3a-t, 1-methyl-5-methyl/trifluoromethoxy-1H-indole-2,3-dione 3-thiosemicarbazones 4a-y and 5-trifluoromethoxy-1-morpholinomethyl-1H-indole-2,3-dione 3-thiosemicarbazones 5a-m were synthesized. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by spectral data and elemental analysis. The new 5-methyl/trifluoromethoxy-1H-indole-2,3-dione derivatives, along with previously synthesized 5-methyl-1H-indole-2,3-dione 3-thiosemicarbazones 6a-l, were evaluated for in vitro antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. 5-Methyl-1H-indole-2,3-dione 3-thiosemicarbazones (3b, 3d, 3f, 6c, 6d, and 6f), 5-trifluoromethoxy-1H-indole-2,3-dione 3-thiosemicarbazones (3q–s) and 5-trifluoromethoxy-1-morpholinomethyl-1H-indole-2,3-dione 3-thiosemicarbazones (5e and 5j–l) were found to be the most potent inhibitors of M. tuberculosis growth described in this study.

This paper presents a new method for multifocus image fusion. We formulate the problem as an optimization framework with three terms to model common visual artifacts. A reconstruction error term is used to remove the boundary seam artifacts, and an out-of-focus energy term is used to remove the ringing artifacts. Together with an additional smoothness term, these three terms define the objective function of our framework. The objective function is then minimized by an efficient greedy iteration algorithm. Our method produces high quality fusion results with few visual artifacts. Comparative results demonstrate the efficiency of our method.

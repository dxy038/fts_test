It is planned that the LUNA-GLOB spacecraft will deliver an orbiter and 14 landers to the Moon.

hematic diagram of the spacecraft flight to the Moon is shown in Fig. 1. The flight time is estimated at 4.5 days. Some 33 h before the spacecraft approaches the Moon a container with 10 small high-velocity penetrators (SHVP) will be separated from the spacecraft. It will continue the flight to the Moon autonomously. When the container is at a close distance to the Moon it will intensively rotate, and the penetrators will be separated from it. They will continue their flight to the Moon, and at a rate of 2.6 km⧸s, they will penetrate the surface.

two large penetrators (LP) will separate and continue the flight autonomously. In due time they will decelerate and penetrate the surface at a rate of 80–100 m⧸s.

y, after leaving the satellite orbit the polar station (PS) will land to the South Polar Region at a rate of 80–100 m⧸s.

 penetrators, which will be dropped from the spacecraft, have seismometers. They are intended for the research into the internal structure of the Moon that is one of the main scientific objectives of the project. The (PS) accommodates a complex of instruments intended for the solution of another objective of the project: the search for volatiles.

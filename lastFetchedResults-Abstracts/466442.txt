Objective: We sought to determine the pregnancy and infant outcomes of women with gestational diabetes who attempted vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery. Study Design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to compare women with gestational diabetes with matched control subjects without diabetes who attempted vaginal birth after cesarean at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, from January 1, 1989, through December 31, 1999. One hundred fifty-six women with gestational diabetes were matched with 272 control subjects. Data were analyzed with the Student t test, Ï‡2 analysis, and the Fisher exact test. Results: The parities of the women with gestational diabetes and the control subjects were similar, with most having had only one previous pregnancy. Women with gestational diabetes were significantly older than control subjects and more likely to be white or Hispanic. Women with gestational diabetes who attempted a trial of labor were significantly more likely than control subjects to be delivered abdominally. Women with gestational diabetes who had a successful vaginal birth after cesarean were significantly more likely than control subjects to have an operative delivery with forceps or vacuum. Conclusion: Women with gestational diabetes are less likely than those without diabetes to have a successful trial of labor. Women with gestational diabetes considering vaginal birth after cesarean should be appropriately counseled about the risk of attempting a trial of labor after previous cesarean delivery.

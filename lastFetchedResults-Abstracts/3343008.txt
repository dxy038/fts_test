The objective of this study is to investigate the nanomechanical and nanotribological properties, especially wear resistance of ultrathin silicon doped diamond-like carbon (DLC) films for different silicon contents in atomic scale. In addition, the effect of density along with the Sp<sup>3</sup>/Sp<sup>2</sup> ratio on the wear resistance of Si doped DLC films is also studied.

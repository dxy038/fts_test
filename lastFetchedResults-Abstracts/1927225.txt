The hypothesis tested was that availability of glucose modulates the control of luteinizing hormone (LH) release. A second objective was to determine the role of testicular hormones in the control of pulsatile LH secretion during depressed blood glucose. Serial blood samples were collected at 15 min intervals for 8 h from intact pubertal Suffolk rams (n=8; 7 months old) on consecutive days (Days 1, 2 and 3). Rams were castrated after sampling on Day 3 and samples were collected 3 weeks later on consecutive days (Days 4, 5 and 6). Insulin (120 units, iv) was given at Hour 4 of each of the six days to lower blood glucose. On Days 1 and 4, no other treatments were given (Control). On Days 2 and 5, LH releasing hormone (LHRH; 5 ng/kg, iv) was given at Hours 5, 6 and 7 to assess the ability of the pituitary to release LH. On Days 3 and 6, N-methyl-d,l-aspartate (NMA; 5 mg/kg, iv) was given at Hours 5, 6 and 7 to assess the ability of the hypothalamus to release LHRH. Insulin reduced plasma glucose by 52% for at least 3 h (P&lt;0.001). Insulin reduced the mean LH concentration (P&lt;0.05) and tended to reduce the LH response area (P&lt;0.10) in castrated animals during the control period. LHRH increased LH pulse number (P&lt;0.001) in intact rams and increased mean LH concentration (P&lt;0.01), LH pulse amplitude (P&lt;0.05) and LH response area (P&lt;0.01) in castrated animals compared to respective control periods. NMA increased mean LH concentration in intact rams (P&lt;0.0001) but did not affect mean LH in castrates. NMA increased LH pulse number in rams (P&lt;0.0001) but decreased number of pulses in castrates (P&lt;0.0001) compared to control periods. NMA increased LH pulse amplitude in both intact (P&lt;0.001) and castrated animals (P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, these results support the hypothesis that blood glucose concentrations influence the control of LH release in sheep. In addition, LH release in response to the LHRH secretagogue, NMA, is positively influenced by testicular hormones.

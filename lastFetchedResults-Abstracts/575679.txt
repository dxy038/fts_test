Introduction & Objective: Physical activity (PA) is inversely associated with obesity but the effect has been difficult to quantify using questionnaires. Pedometers provide an opportunity to better characterize the association. The aim of present study was to examine the relationship between pedometer-determined PA (steps/day) and anthropometric risk factors of the cardiovascular system (CVS) in Hamadanian middle aged men.
Materials & Methods: Anthropometric variables, total daily energy expenditure and Vo2rest were measured in 101 apparently healthy men (40-65yr). Subjects wore a pedometer (Hj-113 Omron, Japan) throughout the day for 2 consecutive weeks.
Results: A significant negative correlation was found between average steps per day and weight (-0.574), %BF (-0.484), BMI (-0.721) WC (-0.584), HC (-0.369), AC (-0.559) and WHR (-0.568) P=0.0000. There was a significant difference in body composition variables, Daily Energy Expenditure and Vo2rest among activity groups (G1: ?10,000step/day and 
G2 : <  10,000step/day), with higher values found in the less active groups (P > 0.005).
Conclusion: Anthropometric risk factors of the CVS in the active men with more daily steps are lower than the inactive counterparts. This point from clinical strategy, especially in the body composition parameters (BMI, WHR and central obesity) is important.

In Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) optical networks, the failure of network resources (e.g., fiber link or node) can disrupt the transmission of information to several destination nodes on a light-tree based multicast sessions. Thus, it is essential to protect multicast sessions by reserving resources along back-up trees. So that if primary tree fails to transmit the information back-up tree will forward the message to the desired destinations. In this paper, we address the problem of survivable of multicast routing and wavelength assignment with sub-wavelength traffic demands in a WDM mesh networks. In this work, we extend the approach of segment disjoint protection methodology to groom the multicast sessions in order to protect them from single link failures. We have proposed an efficient approach for protecting multicast sessions named light-tree based shared segment protection grooming (LTSSPG) scheme and compared with existing multicast traffic grooming with segment protection (MTG-SP) approach. In case of MTG-SP, each segment of primary tree is protected by dis-joint segment in the back-up tree to share the edges or segment. Whereas in case of LTSSPG approach, the segment are shared between the primary as well as back-up trees. The main objective of this work is to minimize the cost in terms of number of wavelengths requirement and optical splitters as well as minimizing the blocking probability of network resources. The performance of various algorithms are evaluated based on extensive simulations in standard networks.

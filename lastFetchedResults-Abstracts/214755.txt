Objective- To present a new technique of suturing fresh massive wounds with skin flap in equine regardless of the flap direction and/or location.
Design- Experimental in vivo study and clinical trial.
Animals- Nine healthy donkeys for experimental study and 28 horses with different injuries that varied in shape and location for clinical trial.
Procedures- All injuries were repaired using the new technique. Flap survival length and viability were assessed over three week's period both clinically; through observing skin texture and appearance, hair depilation as well as wound healing; and histologically through skin biopsy at 7, 14 and 21 days after surgery to evaluate the healing process.
Results- Clinical cases showed excellent wound healing in all flaps. Histologically, all flaps showed good healing by day 7, and at 21 days all the underlying space was filled with normal s.c. tissue.
Conclusion and Clinical Relevance- This new technique is a rapid and successful fieldprocedure for the treatment of fresh massive wounds with skin flap in equine without the need of sophisticated equipments yet with good results.

The objective of this paper is to clarify the valid range of extrapolation of discrete kinetic parameters for species evolved in coal pyrolysis, obtained by three different experimental techniques. The three techniques were thermogravimetric analysis, grid heater and Curie-point pyrolyser. The original kinetic parameters for the first two experimental techniques were obtained by applying the non-isothermal ‘model of decomposition of functional groups in independent parallel reactions’ and for the Curie-point pyrolyser an isothermal expression of the model was used. Data obtained with each technique have been extrapolated to the conditions of the other two techniques. Effects of differences in heating rate, experimental emvironment, analysis and amount of sample are discussed, as well as the influence of assumed reaction order in the models. The results provide criteria for the range of validity and possible extrapolation of experimental kinetic data.

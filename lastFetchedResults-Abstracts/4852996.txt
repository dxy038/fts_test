Aiming at the difficulty in selecting the maintenance mode for power plant equipment with ration, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method based on entropy weight and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is suggested. It combines entropy weight with AHP for against the casualness and subjectivity in traditional method. With the method, the mode is divided into some layers composed of index factors, and then the subjective and the objective weights can be calculated to fit the comprehensive weights based up on the corresponding matrix. Finally with the principle of evaluation, the maintenance mode can be decided by the comprehensive weight and judgment matrix. The calculating result of applying the proposed method to the example demonstrates that the method is valid and feasible, and it is capable of evaluating the maintenance mode for supplying the gist for the condition maintenance decision.

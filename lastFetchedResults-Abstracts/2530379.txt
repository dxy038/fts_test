There is a dearth of epidemiologic studies that provide important information to understand the incidence, prevalence and severity of oral lesions in patients with tuberculosis (TB). This study aimed to determine the prevalence of oral mucosal lesions and adverse habits among hospitalized TB patients. The study was conducted on all the TB patients (n = 118) admitted to the Tuberculosis and chest diseases Sanitarium in Udaipur City, Rajasthan, India, during April-May 2014. Oral mucosal lesions along with adverse habits were assessed according to world health organization, 1980. Demographic characteristics of the subjects were recorded. Data were analyzed using the chi-square. The prevalence of oral mucosal lesions and adverse habits among study population accounted for 58.4% and 95% respectively. Among all the habits, bidi smoking was most prevalent (30.5%), followed by habits in combination (23.7%). Oral lesions were found to be significantly highest among those who were on combination of habits and also among those who were suffering from the habit for more than 10 years duration. The findings of the current study indicate a high prevalence of oral mucosal lesions and adverse habits among the patients with TB disease. Hence, there is an urgent need of probing this public health problem by the health authorities.

We propose a new convenient method for making nanocarbon/ceramic composites, which combines gel casting and firing in an inert atmosphere. The objective of this work was to clarify the effect of the alumina matrix on the carbonization process of the gel content in the gel-casted green body. The presence of the alumina matrix was found to assist the survival of functional groups such as amide groups during the thermal decomposition of the polymers. Consequently, the carbon content was in a form such that it could be easily graphitized at low temperatures. The prevention of the thermal decomposition of amide groups through the interaction between the surface of the ceramic grains and the polymers was found to be important in the graphitization of the carbon content and the attainment of high conductivity during the synthesis of nanocarbon/ceramic composites.

In this paper, we use the S-curve membership function methodology in a real life industrial problem of mix product selection. This problem occurs in production planning management whereby a decision maker plays an important role in making decision in a fuzzy environment. As an analyst, we try to find a solution which is good enough for the decision maker to make a final decision. We have considered this problem because all the parameters such as objective coefficient, technical coefficient and resource variables are uncertain. This is considered as one of sufficiently large problem involving 29 constraints and 8 variables. A decision maker can identify a performance measure for making a decision that is suitable for achieving satisfactory profit. The decision maker can also suggest to the analyst some possible and practicable changes in fuzzy intervals for improving the satisfactory profit. This interactive process has to go on an on among the analyst, the decision maker and the implementer till an optimum satisfactory decision is achieved and implemented.

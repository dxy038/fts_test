In this paper, an agent based demand side management framework is proposed for microgrids with responsive end-users. The main objective of the framework is to facilitate the customers to take part in supply-demand management through demand side management techniques, more specifically demand response. The framework maintains two auction markets, divisional and zonal to facilitate the energy trading within and among the microgrids. The framework allows the customers experiencing the high cost of electricity are allowed to participate in DR with the customer satisfaction being the primary concern. For this, the framework offers two types of demand response participation option to end-users. The first option is suitable for the customers having non-critical loads that may not require continuous supply of electricity, while the other option is suitable for the loads that require continuous supply. Under the former demand response option customers can also give their affordable price ranges under which their non-critical loads are to be operated. The framework detailed in this paper is developed using Java Agent DEvelopment (JADE) framework. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified on a distribution feeder network system with two microgrids. The case study system is simulated in (Open source Distribution System Simulator) OpenDSS and is linked to the agent framework.

Introduction & Objective: Tinea versicolor is a common
superficial fungal infection caused by normal skin flora and many
topical and oral anti-fungal medications have been used for its
treatment. The aim of this study was to compare the fherapeutic
effects of 10% sodium sulfacefamide lotion with 1% clotrimazole
lotion in treatment of tinea versicolor.
Materials & Methods: In this single-blind clinical trial 67 patients
were divided into two groups using block randomization method.
The first group consisted of 33 patients who were treated with 1%
clotrimazole lotion. The second group included 34 patients who
received 10% sodium sulfacetamide lotion. After 2 weeks of
treatment, both groups were evaluated for clinical and paraclinical
responses. The collected data were recorded in a data sheet and
analyzed by X' and independent T tests, using SPSS software.
Results: After 2 weeks of treatment, clinical and paraclirucal
responses were seen in 22 patients (66.7%) and 28 patterns
(848%) in the first group (clotrimazole lotion) and in 7 (20.6%) and
8 (23.5%) patients of the second group (sodium sulfacetamide
lotion), respectively. Statistical analysis showed that the
differences are significant.
Conclusion: The therapeutic effect of 10% sodium sultacetamide
lotion is much less than that of 1% clotrimazole lotion in treatment
Of tinea versicolor.

The authors describe a STREAMS communication buffer allocation algorithm based on the blocking probability, given the total amount of communication buffer memory. Memory requests are modeled as Erlang B traffic characterized by the mean interarrival time and mean buffer holding time for each size. The objective function to be minimized is the total number of blocked requests for the given traffic subject to the memory constraint.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

It is pointed out that the objective of powering voice lines over fiber with the same service quality goals as POTS (plain old telephone service) raises several technological and business issues. The economic impact of these issues is addressed. In order to power the optical network unit (ONU) and provide backup power for it during commercial power outages, three strategies are identified: (1) providing loop powering from a -48-V CO/CEV power plant (conventional twisted pair topology); (2) providing power and backup power locally, from or near the end of the loop in proximity to the ONU (locally powered and backup powered architecture); and (3) providing power from the curb or a power node (locally powered and backed-up at the curb). Strategies that can be used to lower the energy consumption of the ONU and its powering costs are described

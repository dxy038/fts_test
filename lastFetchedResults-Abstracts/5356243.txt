Today, there are a lot of Web sites and tools that introduce and propose cooking recipes for a diet. However, it is difficult to be on a diet by following those recipes because many of them do not consider user´s circumstances. So, in this study, we propose a method to recommend cooking recipes for a diet considering user´s schedule. Concretely, the evaluation value of either intake or consumption calorie is assigned to each event in the user´s schedule, and then based on the calculation with the values, some candidates of recipes with calorie to make the user easily lost weight for the objective weight are selected considering the user´s schedule during the period of a diet. In addition, to recommend more healthy recipes among the selected recipes, we use linear programming with the constraints of carbohydrate, lipid, protein, salt, and increasing the amount of vegetable intake.

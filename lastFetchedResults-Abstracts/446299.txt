Background: Early complications of laparoscopic fundoplication, if immediately recognized, may be promptly treated laparoscopically with minimal morbidity. A suggested strategy for identification is a routine postoperative esophageal transit study.

Objective: To investigate the role of early postoperative esophagogram with Gastrografin in predicting major complications, failures, or severe dysphagia.

Design: Esophagograms performed in 92 patients, 24 hours after laparoscopic fundoplication, were correlated to major complications. Esophageal transit time was scored and correlated with dysphagia.

Results: Esophagogram detected two of three observed complications: acute paraesophageal hernia and intrathoracic migration, but not a fundic perforation. Only a severe transit impairment predicted a disabling dysphagia (specificity 82%, sensitivity 70%).

Conclusions: Postoperative swallow is an appropriate investigation to diagnose anatomical abnormalities but may be deceptive for perforations. Severe transit delay may predict the risk of severe dysphagia. Although useful, postoperative routine transit studies would probably not change the therapeutic strategies in most patients.

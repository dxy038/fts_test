To improve education, teachers need to apply strategies based in research on how people learn, and then use technology and other means to leverage these strategies to meet the needs of an ever growing population. This paper briefly surveys proven approaches for active learning, and describes initial efforts to analyze activities to identify reusable patterns that could help researchers understand how activities work and how to improve them. The objective is to inspire teachers to learn more about active learning and explore ways to help people learn more effectively.

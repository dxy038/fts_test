This paper proposes a systematic approach to conduct system-level optimal parameter design for laser electrophotographic systems. Besides system performance, we incorporate two other practical indices, i.e., cost and energy consumption, into design objectives and formulate a multi-objective optimization problem. Fuzzy logics are employed to provide the nonlinear or linguistic mapping between the decision variables and the design objectives. For comparison purpose, the problem is solved using both single-objective and multi-objective optimization algorithms. A conventional monochrome laser printer serves as the platform for verification of the proposed optimal design approach.

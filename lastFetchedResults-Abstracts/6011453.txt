The authors investigate the relationship between respiration and postural sway in regular relaxed breathing and after exercise. The objective is to determine if there is a respiratory component in postural sway. The authors´ study differs from two previous studies by examining the effect of non-paced respiration on quiet standing. Seven healthy young adults aged 19 to 30 years´ participated in the study. Magnitude squared coherence was found to be lower before exercise then after exercise. Three possible reasons are discussed.

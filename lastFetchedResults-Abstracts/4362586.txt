A model is presented for treatment planning of multiprobe cryosurgery. In this model a thermal simulation algorithm is used to generate temperature distribution from cryoprobes, visualize isotherms in the anatomical region of interest, and provide tools to assist estimation of the amount of freezing damage to the target and surrounding normal structures. Calculations may be performed for any given freezing time for the selected set of operation parameters. The thermal simulation is based on solving the transient heat conduction equation using finite element methods for a multiprobe geometry. As an example, a semi-empirical optimization of 2D placement of 6 cryoprobes and their thermal protocol for the first freeze cycle is presented. The effectiveness of the optimized treatment protocol was estimated by generating temperature-volume histograms and calculating the objective function for the anatomy of interest

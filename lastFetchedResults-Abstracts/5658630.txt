The paper presents a smart assistive technology to improve the life quality of the people with severe mobility disorders by giving them independence of motion despite the difficulties in moving their limbs. The objective of this paper is to develop an Opto-electronic sensor based gaze tracker apparatus to detect the eye gaze direction based on movement of iris. Eventually this detection helps the user to control and steer the wheel chair by themselves through their eye gaze. The principle of operation of this system is based on the reflection of incidental light in the iris and sclera regions of eye. The userÂ´s gaze tracker is in the form of eye-goggle embedded with infrared source and detectors. The performance of various optical sources and detectors are tested and the results are graphically represented. A template database and also an algorithm is generated to provide real time computational analysis.

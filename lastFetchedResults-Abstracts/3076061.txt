Automation for precision agriculture will lead to more precise maneuvering, more consistent performance, higher efficiency, and less labor costs in operation. The objective of this research is to create a dynamic model for estimating trajectories of a tractor-implement system traveling in the field to provide necessary information for supporting accurate tractor automated guidance and precision farming decision-making. This research investigated the dynamic response of a tractor-implement system via a dynamic model of the system. The simulation results obtained from this model were validated by field tests. The cornering stiffness of the wheels was found to be the critical system parameter in this model. Field validation test results indicated that the tractor system dynamic trajectory model developed could accurately estimate the trajectories of a tractor-implement system at various traveling speeds

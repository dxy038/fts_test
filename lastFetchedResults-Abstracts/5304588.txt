Objective: Investigate the effects of TSA on MCF-7 cell growth in vitro and the expressions of fragile HiT (Fhit) and Survivin gene in human breast cancer cell strain MCF-7. Methods: Cultured cells were divided into control group and TSA groups, and treated with DMSO and different concentration of TSA (50, 100, 200, 500nmol/L) respectively. Then the cell activity was observed by trypan blue stain assay and the transcription level of Fhit and Survivin were analyzed by using real-time PCR. The change of Fhit protein was analyzed by western bolt. Results: The proliferation of breast cancer cell MCF-7 was inhibited significantly after culture with TSA. TSA inhibited the breast cancer cell growth in dosedependent and time-dependent manners. The expression of Fhit mRNA and protein were all increased significantly (3.12 vs 1, P&lt;;0.05 ) and the transcription of Survivin mRNA decreased under the treatment of TSA Conclusion: TSA can restrain the growth of MCF-7,which may be associated with up-regulating the expression of Fhit gene and down-regulating the expression of Survivin gene.

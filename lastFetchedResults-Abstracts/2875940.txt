This paper focuses on work done in Conference Domain. The overall objective of our project is to create and maintain the information in Conference domain by introducing semantic technologies. This paper analyzes the limitations in keyword based search techniques and the need for semantic based intelligent information retrieval for Conference domain. The Semantic web is an evolution of current WWW and aims to establish meaning of data such that it can be shared and reused via machine readable operations. The crux of the Semantic Web is in semantic representation and reasoning of data using ontologies and its retrieval. In this paper, we emphasis more about Prote&#769;ge&#769; tool and an architecture based on the tool and its addressing issues are presented. We used the Prote&#769;ge&#769; tool for deploying a convenient mechanism in order to create and edit ontology for conference domain system. Search activities carried out by system and meaningful results are extracted and performances are evaluated.

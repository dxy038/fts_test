The Pareto front (Pareto set) of a continuous optimization problem with m objectives is a (m-1) dimensional piecewise continuous manifold in the objective space (the decision space) under some mild conditions. Based on this regularity property in the objective space, we have recently developed several multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). However, this property has not been utilized in the decision space. Using the regularity property in both the objective and decision space, this paper proposes a simple EDA for multiobjective optimization. Since the location information has not efficiently used in EDAs, a combination of EDA and differential evolution (DE) is suggested for improving the algorithmic performance. The hybrid method and the pure EDA method proposed in this paper, and a DE based method are compared on several test instances. Experimental results have shown that the algorithm with the proposed strategy is very promising.

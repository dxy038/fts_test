Objective: This cross-sectional study was performed to give us a comprehensive view on the prevalence of
cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, psychostimulants, and cannabinoid drug abuse among teenagers and
adults ranging 15 to 35 years old residing in Tehran during the first 6 months of the year 2005.
Methods: Eight thousand one hundred and seventy five individuals from the 22 city councils participated in
a survey from January to June 2005.

"Yes" and 3.6% did not answer this question. The prevalence of cannabinoid drug abuse was 3.8%,
psychostimulant drug abuse 7.2%, and alcohol consumption 25.7%. Mean age in each group of substance
abusers was similar to that of the whole sample and significantly higher in males. Marriage was a variable which
had a significant correlation with low prevalence of drug abuse and alcohol consumption.

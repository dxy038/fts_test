In this paper, the potential of an avionic polarimetric weather radar is shown. The simulator used for such a purpose is a statistical simulator capable of reproducing complex signals as those gathered by an onboard radar, along with polarimetric and Doppler observables. The simulator, developed in the framework of the CleanSky European program, can be an useful tool to evaluate the radar prototypes that in a near future will be mounted on real aircrafts to enhance pilotsÂ´ environmental awareness, which is declared as a major CleanSky objective.

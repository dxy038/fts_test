Low frequency electromechanical oscillations are inevitable characteristics of power systems and they greatly affect the transmission line transfer capability and power system stability. PSS and FACTS devices can help the damping of power system oscillations. The objective of this paper is to design an advanced PSS and propose a systematic approach for damping controller design for FACTS devices. This paper presents a control scheme, comprehensive analysis and result obtained for the dynamic control of power transmission, damping of oscillations with Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) on the basis of theory and computer simulations through MATLAB software. In this paper Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) is not designed, but the effect of UPFC on the system under the fault conditions, disturbance, major block outs is being verified.

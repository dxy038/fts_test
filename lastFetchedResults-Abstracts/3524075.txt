Abstract: The evaluation of the color rendition in existing systems and the design of color rendition for new systems will be considered in this paper. The first topic has recently been of considerable interest. One proposal is to extend the concepts of the CIE color rendering index for illuminants to the evaluation of color reproduction. An example evaluation of a commercial color transparency system shows that this is not a viable approach. The reason lies in the incorrect assumption that the objective in all color reproduction systems is to match the CIE tristimulus values of the reproduction to those of the original scene.

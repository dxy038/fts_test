The main objective of a solar power plant is to collect maximum amount of solar energy available. To enhance the performance and achieve a controlled condition with an optimized system a more precise modeling for collectors´ field is needed. In this study, we focus on oil cycle behavior, and the oil cycle of Shiraz solar power plant is modeled and simulated. The collector field is modeled by Genetic algorithm. A prime control is required to maintain oil temperature of the collectors´ field at a desired level to enhance efficiency and produce a stable condition. Adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was employed to control collectors´ field. Furthermore, fuzzy switching control is utilized in order to prevent chattering phenomena of this multi-loop plant. Simulation results of the solar power plant and the control system show that the applied control system can manage the oil cycle in different situations with safe operating conditions and with better performances.

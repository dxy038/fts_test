This research was primarily conducted to verify the presence of synergistic effects in ternary cementitious systems containing portland cement (OPC), class C fly ash (FA) and silica fume (SF). A subsequent objective of the study was to quantify the magnitude of the synergy and to determine its source. For a ternary mixture containing 20% FA and 5% SF by mass, the synergistic effect was observed mostly at later ages (7 days onward) and it resulted in an increased compressive strength and resistance to chloride ion penetration as well as a reduced rate of water absorption (sorptivity) compared to predictions based on individual effects of FA and SF in respective binary systems. The observed synergy was attributed to both chemical and physical effects. The chemical effect manifested itself in the form of an increased amount of hydration products. The physical effect associated with packing density was, somewhat contrary to general belief, not due to an optimized particle size distribution of the binder components of the ternary cementitious system. Instead, it was the result of smaller initial inter-particle spacing caused by lower specific gravities of both FA and SF which, in turn, led to a lower volumetric w/cm. If the mixture design was adjusted to account for these differences, the physical effect would be diminished.

Bidirectional transmission of data over 218 km of dispersion shifted fiber has been demonstrated. A wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) scheme is used in which both laser wavelengths are within the 1.5 micron region. Fused fiber WDMs with channel separations of 16 nanometers are used to multiplex signals from two DFB lasers, and erbium-doped fiber amplifiers are used at each end of the link in a simultaneous pre/post amplifier configuration.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

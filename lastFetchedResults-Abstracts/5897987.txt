This paper describes an operating principle and features of a newly-developed parallel resonant DC link circuit with an active voltage clamped PWM control scheme. In particular, a new conceptual design procedure of the resonant DC link treated here is illustrated and discussed including a practical design example under zero voltage and zero current soft switching. In this paper, a bidirectional power flow three-phase voltage-fed PWM power converter using a resonant DC link which is applied to a utility-interfaced battery energy storage system is analyzed for load leveling, battery charging, reactive current compensation and active filtering schemes. Finally, the system performances of this converter mode or inverter mode and the effectiveness of this resonant DC link circuit topology and resonant DC link power processor are demonstrated on the basis of simulation results

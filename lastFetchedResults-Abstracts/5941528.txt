The management of electric submersible pumps (ESPs) at well sites can be improved using expert system technology to combine real-time sensor information with production engineering rules. When abnormal conditions exist on an artificial lift well, the problem is not always evident until significant production loss and/or pump damage become apparent. By applying expert system technology, operators see the well performance in relation to the pump manufacturers´ operating limits in real time. Well performance and production is optimized once the operating constraints are known. Real-time analysis and expert rules provide early warnings of well production difficulties and permit pro-active corrective measures. The expert application described was written for production at ARCO Alaska´s West Sak field. The primary objective was to reduce operating and maintenance costs by providing virtual operations assistance so that new wells could be operated and optimized using existing operations personnel

Most of the control engineering applications involves solving of fuzzy linear equations. A method using modal interval arithmetic is suggested to solve first order fuzzy linear equations, for each &#194;&#191;-cut, which is computationally efficient. The membership value a represents a degree of confidence. Some basic definitions and operations of modal interval arithmetic are included here. Using these modal interval operations, an inverse controller is designed for fuzzy parametric uncertainties which are represented as fuzzy intervals. The output is a given fuzzy trajectory. The control objective is to maintain the system output around this desired trajectory for various &#194;&#191;-cuts.

Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) method is applied in the control of main steam temperature system. To facilitate the selection of ADRC parameters, an optimizing objective function is proposed, which is associated with both the dynamic and static performances and energy requirements. By the proposed optimizing objective function, genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the ADRC parameters, and simulation research is conducted under large-scale variety of load. The simulation results demonstrate that the strategy has strong load adaptability and disturbance rejection ability.

This article presents a study on the machinability in turning processes of fiber reinforced plastics (FRPs) using polycrystalline diamond cutting tools. Controlled machining experiments was performed with cutting parameters prefixed in the workpiece. A statistical technique, using orthogonal arrays and analysis of variance, was employed to investigate the influence of cutting parameters on specific cutting pressure and surface roughness. The objective is to evaluate the machinability of these materials as a function of manufacturing process (filament winding and hand lay-up). A new machinability index has been proposed.

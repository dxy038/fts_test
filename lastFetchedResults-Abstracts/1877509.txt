Objective
marily sought to evaluate home care nurses’ knowledge of evidence-based education topics in managing heart failure (HF). Moreover, we wanted to determine if differences were evident in nurses’ knowledge based on education and work experience, and to identify home care nurses’ specific educational needs.
s
s-sectional survey design was used. Home care nurses (n = 94) were recruited from 4 home care agencies. A previously published 20-item HF knowledge questionnaire was administered to participants, and an open-ended question determined participants’ need for further HF-related education.
s
are nurses’ scores demonstrated a 78.9% knowledge level in overall HF education principles. The mean HF knowledge score was 15.78 (SD, ±1.69) out of a possible 20 points. Nurses scored lowest on knowledge related to asymptomatic hypotension (24.5% answered correctly), daily weight monitoring (26.6% answered correctly), and transient dizziness (30.9% answered correctly). Nurses requested further information on all HF topics addressed in the survey as well as on psychosocial issues, research evidence, and more information from other healthcare providers.
sion
ndings suggest that home care nurses may not be sufficiently knowledgeable in evidence-based education topics for managing HF. The results help confirm the need to develop educational programs for home care nurses in managing HF, which may lead to improved quality of patient education. Further research is needed to address specific deficits in the knowledge of home care nurses, and to determine if HF educational programs for nurses would enhance and sustain nurses’ knowledge of HF management education.

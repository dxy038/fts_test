This paper develops and designs a fuzzy PID controller using PLC for a setpoint pressure control problem in the collecting main pressure system. The controller objective is to make the collecting pressure attain to the desired techniques range. The collecting main pressure control system uses programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to implement the pressure control action. The proposed fuzzy controller has a combinative structure: a conventional basic PID and a fuzzy compensating controller. There is an inherent interacting effect between two collecting pressure control loops in the collecting main pressure process. In order to reduce the pressure error and oscillating in the collection pressures control process, the fuzzy compensating controller configures the control signal based on interacting effect and implement good pressure control performance. The proposed fuzzy PID controller has been tested on a practical collecting pressure control system in Coke-oven. The experience results demonstrate the proposed control method provides an enviable control performance under the practical operating conditions.

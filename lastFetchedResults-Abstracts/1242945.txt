
Background & Aims: Eethambutol is a key drug to treatment of tuberculosis; and resistance against it has been increasingly reported. In this study, Polymerase Chain Reaction -Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method in rapid detection of tuberculoses mycobacterium strains against the ethambutol has been investigated. 
Materials & Methods: This study was conducted on 60 strains that were selected from 127 strains in Tuberculosis and Pediatric Infections Research Center. DNA was extracted by Chelex 100 method. PCR test was performed using specific primers for embB gene. Digestions of PCR products with HaeIII and NlaII restriction enzymes, then the pattern of restriction fragments generated were analyzed. The section was sequenced in a few samples, and it was compared to the presented method as golden standard.
Results: Out of 60 studied stains, 43 were phenotypically resistant to ethambutol, and 17 were sensitive. PCR revealed that the band 167 showed the correct selection of primers and the appropriate plan of amplification. Out of 43 resistant strains, 19 stains were diagnosed to have mutation in ATG-Met codon 360 using RFLP method, and 24 were found to be non-mutant.      
Conclusion: According to the findings, that PCR-RFLP can be a simple and rapid method to diagnose the ethambutol -sensitivity in tuberculosis mycobacterium strains.

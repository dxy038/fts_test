Manual calculation is still mostly used for the offset in general cargo terminal, rather than some supporting software. With the analysis of import process in general cargo terminals, this paper established a multi-objective model for automatically offsetting the loss bill of cargos by the wrong-marked cargos. We develop a decision-making system to do the offsetting calculation work. The feasibility and effectiveness have been proved by a deal of numerical experiments and actual system test. Moreover, the system provides a user-friendly graphical interface and has high application value.

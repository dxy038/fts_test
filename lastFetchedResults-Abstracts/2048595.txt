As a mathematician, Frege enters a disputable discussion that has preoccupied important philosophical schools – including realism, idealism and empiricism – for years. This discussion that can be generally called ‘the relationship between mind and entity’ is put forward by Frege in order to present an acceptable explanation on the basis of mathematics. In Frege’s view, a disciplined thinker who finds himself interacting with others in the world, the theories put forward in this regard are not satisfying. These theories – which lead to psychologicism,  subjectivism, relativism, and restricting beings to sensible ones – are not capable of explaining the basis of knowledge and perception and their relationship. Frege seeks a basis of thought that is not merely restricted to some postulates and works on objective things available for all, a basis that can strengthen the scientific explanation. In this essay, while stating a background of objectivity on Kant’s thought, we investigate the explanation of objectivity in Frege’s thought, referring, accordingly, to availability of objective meaning, unlike what is common among the hermeneutists.

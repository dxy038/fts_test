The objective of this paper is ultrasonic measurement and characterization of solid particles in liquid (20–40 μm glass beads in water) in high shear flow (1.5–2 m/s). Ultrasonic time dependent signals as well as frequency spectra are analyzed, for simultaneous determination of average particle concentration and average flow speed. As a result, the distribution of sound energy in such concentrated systems at given flow speeds is measured. Influence of flow turbulence is demonstrated in measurements. Also, characteristic behaviors of liquid–particle mixtures like particle clustering and influence of gas bubbles have been investigated. Experimental results are complemented with a discussion of factors that influence measurement uncertainty.

Critical chain project management, proposed by Goldratt, has proven to be a good methodology to schedule the resource-constrained projects in the past decades. Buffer management is one of the main features of the CCPM. There are a lot of researches about the buffer size methods, however not so much on the rescheduling after inserting the buffer. AS we know, there might be resource or precedence conflict after inserting the feeding buffer. It is the objective of this paper to introduce how to reschedule after inserting the buffer in the project. We propose two reschedule methodologies-local repaired reschedule and global reschedule to solve the resource and precedence contentions and some computation results are provided to compare those methodologies.

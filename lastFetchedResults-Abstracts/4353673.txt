This paper presents mathematical modeling for manufactured product disassembly planning. It takes into account the recent research that has been done with regard to environmental aspects, economic constraints and actual operational disassembly factories. The method is based on a linear programming formalism and aims to integrate in a single model: product, system and context data. These data represent structural and end-of-life description of product, organization and resources of disassembly system, and the political and economical conjunctures. This model serves to find the optimal disassembly plan by optimizing the disassembly process profit as an objective function within an optimization problem. A set of constraints represents many product, system and context features.

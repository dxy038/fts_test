The objective of electrical impedance tomography is to reconstruct images representing the electrical
impedance properties within a region from measurements on its surface. The region of interest is usually Þrst
discretized into Þnite elements and its impedance distribution updated using an iterative process. This
iterative process comprises two problems: the forward problem and the inverse problem. The inverse
problem is the term given to the procedure to Þnd the internal impedance distribution from a set of
boundary measurements, and the forward problem is the determination of the internal voltages given the
impedance distribution and boundary conditions. In this paper several Þnite element labelling algorithms,
implemented by the authors in C, are investigated and their impact on the forward problem solver e¦ciency
analysed. The algorithms investigated are: Nested Dissection (ND), Minimum Degree (MDG), Minimum
DeÞciency (MDF) and Simulated Annealing for Fill-in (SAFR) Reduction during Cholesky Factorization.
These renumbering strategies were applied to a collection of representative two-dimensional meshes used in
electrical impedance tomography and a number of sparse symmetric matrices from the HarwellÐBoeing
sparse matrix collection for comparison purposes

This paper discusses the result of research on the valid range of passenger arrival rate for dispatching method. During up-peak traffic, some rules of dispatching scheme in elevator-group under variant arrival rates are summarized on the basis of simulations of three different conventional dispatching methods including none-zoning method, two-fixed-zoning method and four-fixed-zoning method. Afterwards, the equation for the average journey time is deduced theoretically by using queuing theory. And then a method is presented to obtain the valid arrival rate range of dispatching methods whose objective is the optimization of average journey time. By simulation in our laboratory VSE, the effectiveness of those dispatching rules and the correctness of the method are proven.

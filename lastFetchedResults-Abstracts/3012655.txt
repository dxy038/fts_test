The objective of this article is to analyze from a temporal point of view the use of a communication aid for people with disabilities. This study is based on the software EDITH (Digital Teleaction Environment for Disabled people) intended for people who can only actuate one on-off sensor to interact with their environment. The temporal analysis uses the Model Human Processor applied to a panel of four valid experimenters.

When producing a new component there is usually a trial and error stage to tune the process in order to obtain a part without defects, using the right quantity of raw material. At this stage, the previous experience of designers and manufacturers should give an important aid to reduce trials. However, the use of new materials associated with new shape designs creates the possibility of new behaviours. For this reason, while producing a component it is very important that we get some directions in order to avoid possible defects in it. For such an objective, the finite element simulation has been proving that, at the design stage, it can give important answers in analysing the process and predicting the defects that may occur. Therefore, modifications can be made easily, before tool manufacturing and part production, reducing the trial and error stage and its associated costs. This paper presents the modelling of components with complex shape to be manufactured by closed die forging and sheet metal forming and one tries to show how numerical simulation may help in defining the shape and size of initial material or blank and predict the forces needed to define the press to be used in the process, as well as the possible defects.

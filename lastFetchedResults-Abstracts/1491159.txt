Experimental and numerical investigations were carried out to optimize thin-walled conical shells for their use in design for energy absorption. Geometrical parameters, such as bottom diameter, height, and semi-apical angle were considered to obtain the design space. The numerical analysis and impact experiments were designed using design of experiments (DOE). A three-level, second-order Boxâ€“Bhenken technique was used to select the design points from the design space. Various set of numerical simulations were carried out using LS-DYNA. To investigate the influence of flow stress of the material on the energy absorption, numerical simulations were carried out using frusta made of aluminium, zinc, and mild steel. From the numerical results, mathematical models were created using response surface methodology (RSM). With the help of impact experiments carried out on specimens made of zinc on a drop mass test rig, a mathematical model has been developed using RSM. The mathematical models developed using experimental data and the numerical data were used as objective functions for optimization of the design. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm code NSGA II was used to optimize the design. The mathematical models were also used to predict the energy absorbed and deformation. The influence of various design parameters on energy absorption has been analysed and is discussed.

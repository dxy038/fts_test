In space environment, the power supply for space manipulator is limited because of lower ratio of the solar array. Therefore, the space manipulatorÂ´s trajectory should be optimum so that the torque of manipulator can be minimized in order to save the power. This paper presents a minimum-torque path planning scheme for space manipulator. In this formulation, genetic algorithm (GA) is used to minimize the objective function. The planning procedure is performed in Joint space and with respect to all constraints, such as joint angle constraints, joint velocity constraints, torque constraints. We use a GA to search the optimal joint inter-knot parameters in order to realize the minimum-torque. These joint inter-knot parameters mainly include joint angle and joint angular velocities. The simulation results test that the proposed minimum-torque path planning method has satisfactory performance

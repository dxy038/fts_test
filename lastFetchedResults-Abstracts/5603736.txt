JPL is starting a new program that targets the exploration of the outer planets in our Solar System. The Advanced Deep Space System Development Program (ADSSDP) is to provide a spacecraft system for a series of missions exploring the outer planets. The first objective of the program is to provide an engineering model of the spacecraft system by the year 2000. The engineering model, dubbed the X2000, is basis for the first series of missions. The program will continue to advance the &#8220;state of the art&#8221; in spacecraft system development with a new engineering model every three years to benefit the missions that follow. The X2000 power system must answer the challenge of an outer planets spacecraft by reducing its power, mass and volume envelope. A power system architecture is required that can reduce the requirements on the spacecraft loads. The architecture can reduce the number of power converters on the spacecraft by providing load specific voltages and by increasing capability in de-coupling loads. The architecture also needs the modularity to accommodate multiple missions while maintaining a low recurring cost. Although the focus has been on shrinking the power system volume and mass, the efficiency and functionality cannot be ignored. Increased efficiency and functionality will only enhance the power systems capability to reduce spacecraft power requirements. The combination of the New Millennium packaging technology with the X2000 power system architecture produces a product capable of meeting a wide range of mission requirements with a low system recurring cost

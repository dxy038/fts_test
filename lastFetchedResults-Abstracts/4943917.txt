This paper deals with the improvement of the output voltage of the DC/DC chopper interface of fuel Cell (FC) source. The main objective is to overcome the drawback of voltage/current ripple which can be achieved by the reduction or elimination of the low harmonics frequency from the output voltage/current, to fulfill this requirement the SHE-PWM control algorithm is used, where the choice of the switching angles is based on the heuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, therefore a new objective function is proposed presenting minimizing problem and the constraints of the switching angles sequences and the length of the chopping period. Finding the global minimum of this function leads to the elimination of the selected harmonics, whereas, keeping the average value of the output voltage equals to the desired value or the reference value.

Summary form only given, as follows. Research activities across all the engineering fields pave the way for the industrial world to strive forward with huge advancements. As an educational institution, encouragement and support to research can be provided by establishing a suitable platform for the research community, to interact with each other and to share the knowledge. Having this objective, "International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics - 2012," was organized last year which received an overwhelming response. ICCCI 2013 has been planned to provide the same benefits and learning experience to all the participants. Sessions on different domains, key note addresses from eminent professors and opportunity to network with the researchers will help the participants immensely in their research career. This proceeding of the conference has been documented with utmost care. I believe strongly that, this will stand as a great sourceof knowledge and researchers. With great pleasure and pride, I welcome all the participants and convey my best wishes for ICCCI 2013.

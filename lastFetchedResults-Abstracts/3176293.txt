This paper investigates the semi-online scheduling problems on m parallel identical machines with non-simultaneous machine available times. The objective is to maximize the minimum machine completion time. For the semi-online version with jobs arrived in non-increasing processing time order, LS is showed an optimal algorithm for three and four machines cases and the lower bound 10/7 is presented when m is greater than or equal to five.

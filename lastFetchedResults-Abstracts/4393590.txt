The objective of this paper is to study the detection algorithms of line centers. These algorithms are used to precise the positions of such lines on the scales of high precision measuring instruments. Based on previous simulation and on the implementation of the algorithms that were simulated in the actual images of the scale and crosshair lines of a Nikon 6D autocollimator, we studied a line segmentation and center detection algorithm built using the Hough transform. We also present the algorithm behaviour when working with noise images.

In this paper, a novel nonlinear programming (NLP) approach for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) localization in severe multipath environments is proposed. It leverages on the bidirectional estimation of the angle of arrival (AOA) and the time of arrival (TOA) of signals between the mobile station (MS) and the reference stations (RSs), and has the ability to work with just two paths. Basic approach (BA) and extended approach (EA) are addressed, and the latter employs a simple method to identify one-bound path with high probability. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can improve the localization accuracy greatly, especially when only few one-bound scattering paths exist.

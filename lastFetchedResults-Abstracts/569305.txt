In this paper, A Novel Stochastic Algorithm using Pythagorean means for minimization of the objective function is described. The algorithm is initially tested with Rastrigin's function and compared with Genetic algorithm results for the function with the same initial conditions. After this, it is used in tuning the gains of fuzzy PD + I controller for trajectory control of PUMA 560 robot manipulator. The results are again verified with the results of genetic algorithm

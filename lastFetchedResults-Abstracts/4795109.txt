This paper introduces a graph grammar based approach to automated topology synthesis of analog circuits. A grammar is developed to generate circuits through production rules, that are encoded in the form of a derivation tree. The synthesis has been sped up by using dynamically obtained design-suitable building blocks. Our technique has certain advantages when compared to other tree-based approaches like GP based structure generation. Experiments conducted on an opamp and a vco design show that unlike previous works, we are capable of generating both manual-like designs (bookish circuits) as well as novel designs (unfamiliar circuits) for multi-objective analog circuit design benchmarks.

A automatic test pattern generator (ATPG) algorithm is proposed that reduces switching activity (between successive test vectors) during test application. The main objective is to permit safe and inexpensive testing of low power circuits and bare die that might otherwise require expensive heat removal equipment for testing at high speeds, Three new cost functions, namely transition controllability, observability, and test generation costs, have been defined. It has been shown, for a fanout free circuit under test, that the transition test generation cost for a fault is the minimum number of transitions required to test a given stuck-at fault. The proposed algorithm has been implemented and the generated tests are compared with those generated by a standard PODEM implementation for the larger ISCAS85 benchmark circuits. The results clearly demonstrate that the tests generated using the proposed ATPG can decrease the average number of (weighted) transitions between successive test vectors by a factor of 2 to 23

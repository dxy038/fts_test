Simulation of Inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging of space targets and reconstruction under sparse sampling via compressed sensing (CS) are investigated. The numerical method of bidirectional analytic ray tracing (BART) is employed to compute the polarized scattering from an electrically large target. With multi-orbit and multistation imaging mode, two-D and three-D (dimensional) ISAR images are acquired. CS is introduced into the reconstruction of the ISAR image under sparse sampling. As example, a simple satellite model for the Aura satellite is presented.

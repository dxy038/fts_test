NTT has been carrying out a &#8220;total power up&#8221; (TPU) campaign since 1987. The objective of the &#8220;TPU&#8221; campaign is to ensure profits by increasing revenues and reducing expenses. The introduction of cogeneration systems has been an effective part of the TPU campaign. As pilot plants, NTT introduced a cogeneration system using a diesel engine-generator into the Okayama Network Center in 1989, and a gas engine-generator system into the Osaka Network Center in 1990. The authors describe how full-scale introduction based upon these operation results has begun, and cogeneration systems using a diesel engine-generator have been introduced into the Sendai-tsutsujigaoka Branch Office and Tomakomai Branch Office in 1993

Objective
luate the independent risk factors for late extubation after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
s
rative, intraoperative, and postoperative characteristics of patients undergoing isolated CABG between June 2005 and June 2008 at the Tongji Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Elapsed time between CABG and extubation of more than 8 hours was defined as late extubation.
s
cidence of late extubation after CABG was 69.23% (288/416). Through univariate and logistic regression analysis, the independent risk factors for late extubation after CABG were older age (odds ratio [OR] = 4.804), duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (OR = 2.426), perioperative use of intra-aortic balloon pump (OR = 1.451), preoperative arterial oxygen partial pressure (OR = .204), and postoperative hemoglobin level (OR = .793).
sion
age, prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time, perioperative intra-aortic balloon pump requirement, low preoperative arterial oxygen partial pressure, and low postoperative hemoglobin level were identified as the 5 independent risk factors for late extubation after CABG.

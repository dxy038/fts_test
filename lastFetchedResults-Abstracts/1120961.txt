This investigation presents a heuristic method for consumable resource allocation problem in multi-class dynamic Project Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) networks, where new projects from different classes (types) arrive to system according to independent Poisson processes with different arrival rates. Each activity of any project is operated at a devoted service station located in a node of the network with exponential distribution according to its class. Indeed, each project arrives to the first service station and continues its routing according to precedence network of its class. Such system can be represented as a queuing network, while the discipline of queues is first come, first served. On the basis of presented method, a multi-class system is decomposed into several single-class dynamic PERT networks, whereas each class is considered separately as a minisystem. In modeling of single-class dynamic PERT network, we use Markov process and a multi-objective model investigated by Azaron and Tavakkoli-Moghaddam in 2007. Then, after obtaining the resources allocated to service stations in every minisystem, the final resources allocated to activities are calculated by the proposed method.

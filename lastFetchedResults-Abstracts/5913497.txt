The continuing developments of a non-interactive surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter design automation system, called SAWCOM, are presented. An automation system has been developed by S.M. Richie and D.C. Malocha (1989) for the design and analysis of SAW bidirectional transducers and filters. All dominant SAW acoustic and electrical effects have been modeled for non-reflecting transducers in a modular architecture. Synthesis and analysis tools form the core of the design automation system around which an automation shell is used to form the basis of a SAW compiler which is capable of non-interactive SAW filter design. The SAW filter design rules are implemented in a declarative language which provides logical decision control of the CAD system. The design automation system controls the execution and iteratively evaluates options, corrects errors, and decides on an optimal design choice within the set of design rules

In cellular systems, base stations are considered the components that mostly drain energy. Hence, recent attempts have been made to reduce the power consumed by base stations by several methods such as "micro" sleep modes, where some parts of the transceiver can be temporarily switched off in short intervals where no information is transmitted. The objective of this study is to exploit the sleep mode feature of base stations and to use rate allocation techniques in order to minimize the energy spent to satisfy the demands of its users and their QoS requirements such as delay. In order to understand the behavior of the rate allocation method, the case where there is only a single active user in the cell is first considered. Then, the problem is extended to the case when several active users are present.

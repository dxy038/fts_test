The purpose of this study was to show that multipolar electrographic recordings along the subeustachian isthmus (SI) can better differentiate slow conduction from complete isthmus block after atrial flutter ablation, leading to a lower incidence of recurrent atrial flutter (Afl). Despite the presence of various techniques to identify bidirectional conduction block (BDB) after isthmus ablation for typical Afl, several studies, including a report from a national registry, suggest that radiofrequency ablation is still associated with a 15% recurrence rate. Thus, techniques that can distinguish slow conduction from complete isthmus block have the potential for reducing long-term recurrences. We evaluated patients who underwent radiofrequency ablation for typical isthmus-dependent Afl. Patients were separated into 2 groups. Group A underwent assessment of BDB with conventional methods. In group B, BDB was assessed by placing a multipolar catheter along the floor of the SI, pacing adjacent to the line of radiofrequency application, and assessing electrographic activation on either side. One hundred thirty-one cases of Afl ablation were analyzed (86 in group A, 45 in group B). Over a mean follow-up period of 17 months, recurrence rates of Afl were 16.5% in group A and 4.3% in group B (p = 0.043). Thus, assessment of BDB by placement of a multipolar catheter across the SI after ablation of typical Afl is associated with a significant reduction in long-term recurrence of Afl.

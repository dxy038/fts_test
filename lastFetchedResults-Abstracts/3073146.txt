This paper introduces an exploratory research program on different types of hybrid classes to answer those and other questions around its efficacy and applicability for training and education. Our objective is to develop and perform an initial test of a new model designed to trace the influence of individual and technical characteristics on learning outcomes through their effect on in-class and computer training phases of knowledge and skills acquisition and testing. The overall research question is: "Which and how much do CBT, individual student, class, instructor, and CBA factors affect student learning outcomes?" This paper proposes a research model based upon the Leidner and Jarvenpaa (2001) work where they introduce a research model that helps instructors determine the best teaching method depending on course content, available technology, an individual instructor, and student factors. Thirty-six questions were posed to over 400 students with direct and current experience using CBT and CBA for course credit. The findings show that there is a strong potential for student as well as corporate benefits in training using online assessment tools. Online assessment effectiveness should be given further research study given the explosive jump in reported learning.

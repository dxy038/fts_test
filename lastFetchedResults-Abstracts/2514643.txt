Purpose: The objective of this study was to develop, characterize, and comparatively investigate the ketotifen fumarate (KF) nanosuspensions (NSS) to enhance the permeability of KF. Methods: In the present work, the NSP and NSE were prepared by double-emulsion solvent evaporation/nanoprecipitation methods with poly (D,Llactide-co-glycolide) and Eudragit RL100 polymers, respectively. The loading efficiency, particle size, and polydispersity index of prepared different NSs were evaluated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and in vitro release and transcorneal permeation . NSs were also compared on the basis of particle size and polydispersity index. Results: Particle size, polydispersity index, and loading efficiency of NSP1 and NSE3 showed the best value (158 nm, 117 nm, 0.21, 0.43 and 43%, 95.23%, respectively). SEM showed spherical globules and DSC results showed the reduction in crystallinity. The NSE3 formulations demonstrated significantly (p<0.05) higher drug release rates than the NSP1 due to increases in the surface area. Comparative studies showed that NSE release and permeability are higher than NSP. Conclusion: It is concluded that both NSP and NSE provide a useful dosage form for the ocular drug delivery which can enhance the permeability of KF.

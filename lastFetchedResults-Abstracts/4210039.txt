This paper describes the Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T), the US ArmyÂ´s objective replacement for the legacy tri-service tactical communications (TRI-TAC) system and the mobile subscriber equipment (MSE). These systems, known collectively as the area common user system (ACUS) are now nearing the end of their planned life cycle. Their replacement, WIN-T, will provide an advanced seamless multimedia transport system that will connect and serve all Army echelons. It will be a mobile high capacity secure and survivable network. This paper describes the existing systems and the way in which WIN-T will provide an operational replacement. The paper also addresses the cost as an independent variable (CAIV) acquisition method that will be used by the Army to acquire the new system

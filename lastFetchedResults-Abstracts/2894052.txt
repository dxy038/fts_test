The objective of this paper is to propose a multi-input converter (MIC) for hybrid PV/wind power charger application which can simplify the power system, reduce the cost and deliver continuous power with higher reliability to the load. The proposed MIC consists of a forward-type pulsating voltage source cell (PVSC) and a buck-boost prime converter can realize the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) function for each PV/wind source. Moreover, due to the isolated configuration, the MIC can adopt PV/wind power sources with larger operation voltage difference. In this paper, the small-signal ac model is derived and the controller design is developed. Computer simulations and experimental results are presented to verify the accuracy of the proposed small signal ac model and the performance of the proposed MIC.

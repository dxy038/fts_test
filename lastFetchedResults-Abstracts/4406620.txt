This paper presents a new multi-objective optimization methodology, using an evolutionary algorithm for solving a multi-objective design of advanced power distribution system by extending the powerful meta-heuristic approach based on multi-objective seeker optimization algorithm (MOSOA). Normally, reliability issues are of major importance while planning of an advanced power distribution system. This paper introduces an efficient planning including distribution automation devices to enhance the reliability and efficiency of the power distribution system. The proposed algorithm can determine the set of non-dominated solution by simultaneous optimization of economic cost and overall system reliability using the pareto-optimality based trade-off analysis. Furthermore, the proposed approach is suitable for the multi-objective optimization of &#8220;n&#8221; number of conflicting objectives simultaneously. The performance of the proposed approach is assessed and illustrated on a 54-bus distribution system, considering real-time design constraints and meeting the additional requirements that the designer imposes. Furthermore, a qualitative comparison is made with NSGA-II and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), to show the efficacy of the proposed planning approach.

Abstract
Inroduction & Objective: Perch (Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus) is from Percidae and one of the valuable fishes in terms of ecological & economical and have limited habitat in iran, stands for the highest stocks in Amirkelayeh & Anzali wetlands, there lived a group mature at age 2-3.
Materials and Methods: The studies of  biometry and gonadosomatic index are the important indicators of reproduction biology in fishes. The present study was conducted in November 2011& December,January, February& March 2011 in Amirkelayeh wetland and 126 specimens caught by gillnet while they were 2,3,4,5 years old, respectively. 
Results: In Lahijan Amirkelayeh wetland to investigate  gonadosomatic index  and  biometry  in this male species.  According to the results obtained  highest average total length (22.5 cm), fork length (21.5 cm), standard length (19 . 5 cm), body weight (158 g) and gonad weight (7.15 g) of 5 year old fish and the lowest average total length (13 cm), fork length (12.5 cm), standard length (11 cm), body weight (28.7 g) and gonad weight (1.82 g) belonged to 2 year old fish. There was significant different in mean of total length, fork length, standard length, body weight and gonad weight among differente group of age (P  < 0.05). But, did not abserve in gonadosomatic difference gonadosomatic index between these male brood (P > 0.05).
 Key words: Amirkelayeh Wetland, Perca fluviatilis, biometry, Gonadosomatic index.

By integrating the system dynamics (SD) and multi-objective programming (MOP), the new approach which is the termed SD-MOP model is proposed. The model is characterized by fully reflecting the initial trends of the system development, accurately explaining both of the structure and function of the system, objectively finding the sensible points of the system, and achieving the optimum solutions of the model, the according the solutions the optimal plan can be designed according practical situation. By applying SD-MOP integrated model, the designed planning proposal can be guaranteed operable, available and optimal level. SD-MOP integrated model is a very useful support tool in optimal decision-making. The new planning approach of SD-MOP integrated model can be used in regional resources planning, especially in formulating sustainable development strategies. In addition, the model can be used to estimate the trends of the system development when the planning program has been implemented.

We consider in this paper relay assignment for cooperative systems with mutiple source-destination pairs. The objective here is to assign relays to the source-destination pairs in such a way that all pairs achieve the maximum diversity. In networks with mutiple source-destination pairs, it is normally difficult for destinations to acquire the channel state information (CSI) of the entire network without feedback. To this end, we design a practical limited feedback strategy in conjunction with two relay assignment schemes, i.e., fullset selection and subset selection, which are based on maximizing the minimum end-to-end (E2E) signal to noise ratio (SNR) among all pairs. In this strategy, each destination acquires its SNR, quantizes it, and feeds it back to the relays. The relays then construct the E2E SNR table and select the relay assignment permutation from all possible relay assignment permutations or only a subset of these permutations. We analyze the performance of these schemes over independent Rayleigh fading channels in terms of the worst E2E SNR. We derive closed-form expressions for the E2E bit error rate (BER) and investigate the asymptotic performance at high SNR. We show that relay assignment with quantized CSI can achieve the same first-order diversity as that of the full CSI case, but there is a second-order diversity loss. We also demonstrate that increasing the quantization levels yields performance that is close to that of having full knowledge of the CSI.

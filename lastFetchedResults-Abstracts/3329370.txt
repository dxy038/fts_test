A new suite of Matlab-compatible robust analysis and synthesis design tools for digitally-controlled switched-mode power supplies has been developed. The objective of developing this tool suite is to assist control engineers to design and/or assess digital compensators that are robustly stable. The tool suite comprises of nonlinear, linearized and discrete-time continuous conduction mode and discontinuous conduction mode models, robust analysis algorithms and robust synthesis algorithms. To promote ease of use and adoption, a front-end graphical user interface has also been developed.

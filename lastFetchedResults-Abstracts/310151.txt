Objective
To verify the effect of and to date the unknown T677C mutation of the human N-acetylaspartoacylase (hASPA) gene on the function of the mutated enzyme.
Design and methods
Wild type and I226T-mutated proteins were expressed and purified from a transformed Escherichia coli colony. Enzymatic activities were measured in the presence of varying substrate concentrations.
Results
Whilst kinetic parameters of wild type hASPA were in line with data in literature, I226T-mutated hASPA showed no enzymatic activity.
Conclusion
Data indicated that this new mutation might be responsible in homozygosis for the phenotype corresponding to Canavan disease.

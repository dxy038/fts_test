CONTEXT: Previous work suggests that half of the companies that have tried global software development (GSD) have failed to realise the anticipated outcomes, the root cause of which is often related to requirements problems. Despite the importance of this problem, little research has been carried out to improving requirements engineering process in the GSD projects. OBJECTIVE: In this paper an ongoing project is discussed which will bring together the work of researchers and software development experts to develop a framework for the requirements engineering process of global software development projects (GlobReq). Managers of GSD projects will be able to use GlobReq to plan a requirements engineering process suitable for a specific GSD project. In this paper the need for such a framework along with the proposed methodology, novelty and the preliminary results are discussed. METHODOLOGY: The basis of the GlobReq framework is Sommerville et alÂ´s framework of 66 requirements best practices as well as our empirical study with GSD organisations. INITIAL RESULTS: The initial findings from 5 organisations are interesting to observe that not all 66 RE best practices are perceived as high value practices for GSD projects.

After revealing that both late reverberation and noise are additive interference components in the residual domain, this paper proposes to suppress these additive interference components by using a constrained minimum mean square error linear prediction (LP) residual estimator, where the optimal filter can be obtained by the generalized singular value decomposition. We propose to estimate the LP residuals for both late reverberation and noise continuously, which is based on the non-VAD related noise power spectral density estimator and the incessant late reverberant spectral variance estimator. The non-intrusive objective measure and the PESQ show that the proposed algorithm is better than traditional LP residual-based algorithms and spectral subtraction-based algorithms.

Hot spring thermal energy conversion (STEC) is a system to convert the thermal energy into the electrical power using the temperature difference between spring water and sea/river water. In this paper, the diffuser multi-objective control problem of STEC plant is described. Based on the step test, the nonlinear separation model of working fluid dryness and pressure difference between turbine inlet and outlet for STEC plant has been identified. According to the concept of back-off and based on the nonlinear programming, a multi-objective coordination algorithm using the information of process static constraints is proposed. Using the nonlinear separation control method, a solution for STEC diffuser multi-objective control has been proposed. The application results have verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution.

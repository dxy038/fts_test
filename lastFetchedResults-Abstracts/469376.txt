Objective
The aim of this study was to determine the long-term effects of chronic placental insufficiency on the metabolic state and organ structure in the fetal and adolescent guinea pig.
Study design
The maternal uterine artery was ligated at day 28â€“30 to reduce placental function and restrict fetal growth. Whole body and tissue weights and plasma metabolites were determined at 60 days of gestation and 8 weeks of age; tissue structure was determined at the latter age in restricted and control offspring.
Results
Fetal growth restriction increased fibrosis in the heart and kidneys (P< .05), increased aortic wall thickening (P< .01), reduced the number of glomeruli in the kidneys (P< .05), and increased the plasma urea and chloride in adolescent offspring.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates that diseases in the heart, aorta, and kidneys that result from an adverse prenatal environment are evident at adolescence and may contribute to subsequent adult disease.

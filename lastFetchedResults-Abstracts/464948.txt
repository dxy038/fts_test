Objective: Our purpose was to evaluate the null hypothesis that dual tocolysis with magnesium sulfate and indomethacin does not alter the rate of grade III or IV intraventricular hemorrhage.
Study Design: Fifty-six neonates weighing 500 to 800 gm from mothers who received tocolytic therapy with magnesium sulfate alone or in combination with indomethacin were the subjects of this retrospective study. Demographic variables were evaluated with a Student t test, 2 analysis, Fisher exact test, or Mantel-Haenszel 2 as appropriate.
Results: There was an increased incidence of grade III to IV intraventricular hemorrhage among patients treated with dual therapy (p=0.02). Logistic regression showed that fetal age and dual tocolysis with indomethacin were the only independent prognostic factors for severe intraventricular hemorrhage.
Conclusion: The results indicate that dual tocolysis with indomethacin may place extremely low-birth-weight infants at increased risk for grade III to IV intraventricular hemorrhage.

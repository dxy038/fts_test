The Ad hoc network is one of the multistep-based self-organizing networks, which are dynamically changing and are taken more into account as the ways of connecting the terminals through the development of wireless communication terminals. We are faced with numerous challenges in designing a wireless network such as the dynamic topology, common and limited bandwidth, and the limited energy. The nodes are moving according to the continuous changes in the topology and the source-to-destination paths are completely broken. Therefore, the repeated route discovery enhances the delay and overload of routing. Thus, it is essential to consider the link stability while designing the path in order to choose the routing protocol. Providing the multiple paths may lead to the better performance than a path. The transmission energy control in the wireless Ad hoc networks is the option for the level of transmission energy in order to transmit each node packet in this system. Therefore, transmission energy control affects the wireless medium interface. Because of choosing the appropriate protocol, the routing operation can be improved and the energy consumption can be controlled properly as well as enhancing the durability and longevity of network. The main objective of this study is to enhance the network longevity. The proposed algorithm in this research considers the combination of 2 parameters including the rate of node energy and number of steps in Fuzzy System applied on AOMDV Protocol, which is a Multipath Routing Protocol. The results of simulation also indicate the improved performance of proposed algorithm (AOMDV-F) compared to AODV and AOMDV Protocols in NS2 simulator.

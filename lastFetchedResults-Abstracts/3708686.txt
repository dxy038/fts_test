An effective method is proposed for the design of recursive digital filters in the time/spatial domain. The method is based on the computation of an eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector of an appropriate real symmetric and positive-definite matrix derived from the objective error function of the impulse response in the least-squares sense. The method can be used to design 1D IIR digital filters as well as 2D IIR digital filters. The method is easy and the performance is comparable to those of the existing methods. One of the main advantages of the proposed method is that the solution is obtained directly without the need for iteration

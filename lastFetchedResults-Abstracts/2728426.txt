The Jiles-Atherton (J-A) model is suitable for modeling ferrite-core-based inductors and transformers but relies on accurate identification of the relevant parameters from experimental data. In this paper, a differential evolution method is utilized to extract the seven parameters required for the dynamic J-A model. An appropriate set of objective functions for the differential evolution algorithm is proposed, which includes optimization around six critical points on the B-H curve. These critical points include the coercive force, the maximum magnetic field and flux densities, and the remanence force. By doing so, the stability and efficiency of the optimization process have been significantly increased and convergence is guaranteed. Both pseudonumerical modeling and parameter extraction based on experimental data are used to verify the proposed technique. A dual-frequency optimization technique is also proposed such that the influence of inaccuracy in the experimental data can be reduced. The accuracy of the extracted seven parameters in the dynamic J-A model is improved. Finally, the seven parameters are used in the dynamic J-A model to calculate the B-H curve at frequencies other than those used in the parametersÂ´ extraction. Very good agreement is obtained between the measured and modeled characteristics.

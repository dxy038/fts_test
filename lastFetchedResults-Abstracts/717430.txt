Thiomorpholine analogues of U-100480 with the biphenylmethyl group replacing the acetamidomethyloxazolidinone moiety have been synthesized and tested as antimycobacterial agents together with various related derivatives. Some biphenyl derivatives were endowed with high activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other non-tuberculous mycobacteria.

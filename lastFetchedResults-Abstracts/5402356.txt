Every department that has &#8220;ownership&#8221; of biomedical devices must designate one or more persons to be responsible for device control. Everyone that uses a biomedical device in the course of their work is part of the safety process too. HereÂ´s how Devices cannot be put into service until completion of an initial safety test and they cannot stay in service if they are past due for preventive maintenance or inspection. The test procedures are designed to find out if equipment has deteriorated from its original design specification. In many cases this specification and the appropriate test method are set out in British Standards. It will be safe to test equipment to those standards by the test method specified in the relevant standard. A life case study was carried out on a very common and widely used syringe pumps malfunction and a major cause of patient/user electrical safety with analysis a pilot was run and huge important reason to avoid patient risk was observed. The objective of the Study is to find out the prevalence of health hazards in the local hospital of my area and awareness level in the health care professionals to establish best practices and process.

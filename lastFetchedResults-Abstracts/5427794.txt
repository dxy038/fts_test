In this paper, a model-following controller (MFC) using time-varying sliding surface (TVSS) instead of fixed sliding surface is proposed. We will introduce a strategy that combines MFC and TVSS. The objective of MFC is to minimize the differences of the states of the reference model and the controlled plant. The TVSS ensures the sliding mode occurrence from an arbitrary initial state, whereas the fixed sliding surface can not achieve the robustness subject to parameter variations and disturbances before the sliding mode occurs. The proposed controller applied to single-phase inverters can attain the accurately sinusoidal tracking in the presence of load disturbance and plant parameter variation. Design procedures, and computer simulations for an inverter system are presented to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed controller.

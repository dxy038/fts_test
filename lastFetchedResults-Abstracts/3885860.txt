Invertible transforms with integer coefficients are highly desirable because of their fast, efficient, VLSI-suitable implementations and their lossless coding capability. In this paper, a large class of lapped regular transforms with integer coefficients (ILT) is presented. Regularity constraints are also taken into account to provide smoother reconstructed signals. In other words, this ILT family can be considered to be an M-band biorthogonal wavelet with integer coefficients. The ILT also possesses a fast and efficient lattice that structurally enforces both linear-phase and exact reconstruction properties. Preliminary image coding experiments show that the ILT yields comparable objective and subjective performance to those of popular state-of-the-art transforms with floating-point coefficients

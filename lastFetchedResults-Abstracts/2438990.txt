This paper is concerned with analysis of neopragmatist attitude of Richard Rorty about objective truth. According to Rorty, the aim of inquiry is not discovering of "objective truth "as considered by previous thinkers. Rorty believed that conceptions like Truth, Reality and Realism are similar conceptions. Hence rejecting objective truth requires the rejection of realism. Objective truth in metaphysics has been described as ahuman and ahiostorical features. Therefore, Rorty believes that the aim of inquiry is empowerment of human situation and creation of solidarity and untimely intersubjectivity agreement. But this article wants to show that the solidarity and intersubjectivity agreement have some features which objective truth has them.

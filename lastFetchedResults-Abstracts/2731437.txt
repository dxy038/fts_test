This paper introduces a research site for a low-voltage direct current (LVDC) distribution system. The research site was established to enable practical studies concerning different areas of the LVDC distribution. Because the LVDC distribution is a novel approach to public electricity distribution, the objective is to combine a fully functional LVDC system and a flexible research platform, where various measurements and tests can be conducted. The scope of this paper is to discuss the design, structure, functionalities, and operation of the site. Experiences of use and measurement results are provided to demonstrate the major functionalities and other important system properties. Finally, future research tasks and the development of the site towards the LVDC &#956;Grid are presented.

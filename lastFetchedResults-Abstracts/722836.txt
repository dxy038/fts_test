Pursuing our search program for new antitubercular drugs we decided to explore the potentiality of oxazolidinone moiety by synthesizing novel 3-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-2-oxazolidinone analogues of PNU-100480. The new derivatives were tested against atypical mycobacteria as well as against drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and some of them exhibited a fairly good activity against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC).

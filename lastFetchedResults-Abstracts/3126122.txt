The collaborative optimization of supply chain system is studied based on complex needs in this paper. The multi-objective collaborative optimization model is established. This model takes profits and customer satisfaction as the goal, and designs differential evolution algorithm to improve the model. At last the model was practically analyzed through empirical study, and the result shows that this model is reasonable and effective.

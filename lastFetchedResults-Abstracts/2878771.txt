Modeling artifact flow in learning design of CSCL processes can be helpful, since it aims to handle effectively dependencies among group or individual activities. However, the cognitive overload problem for the teacher-designer may impede efficient modeling. Therefore, it is convenient to assess such an overload issue through objective metrics, adopted from the process modeling field, and to detect the underlying causes. Such an analysis may allow the proposal of alternative ways of handling the modeling process without incurring in excessive work and cognitive load. Our findings through an analysis of a set of significant CSCL scenarios, suggest that artifact assignment, access mode and size of collaborative scenarios are important influencing factors.

Background: In recent years, a new view has been stablished toward pharmaceutical plants
and applicational use of them all over the world and researchers, in various medical courses
are investigating about this issue.
Objective: On this basis, antibacterial effect of Humulus lupulus, the pharmaceutical plant
which has an important place in traditional medicine of Iran, was evaluated on some of
bacteria.
Methods: Based on scientific methods after being dried, prepared extract by using
macerasion method. Antibacterial effects of ethanol extract were studied on Staphylococcus
aureus (1112PTCC), Escherichia coli (1276PTCC), Bacillus subtilis (1023PTCC), Psedomonas
aeroginosa (1430PTCC), by using spreading method, well plate method and MIC.
Results: The ethanol extract of Humulus lupulus showed antimicrobial activity on S. aureus
and B. subtilis. The extract exhibited antimicrobial activity at a range of 125 mg/ml to 62/5
mg/ml against S. aureus and B. subtilis respectively.
Conclusion: With the increase of worldwide antibiotic resistance of many strains of disease
producing bacteria, there is a need to access new and complementary approaches to antibiotic
therapy. Extract of Humulus lupulus has antibacterial effect. The antimicrobial activity of
Humulus lupulus against a variety of gram positive bacteria confirm its use for treatment of
infectious.

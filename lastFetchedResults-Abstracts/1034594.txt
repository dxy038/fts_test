This paper presents a study on the experimental physical model of the orthogonal cutting on the composite polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and PEEK CF30 (reinforced with 30% of carbon fiber). The objective of this study is evaluating the influence of the reinforcement on the chip thickness ratio (R), chip deformation (ε), friction angle (ρ), shear angle (ϕ), normal stress (σ) and shear stress (τ) under prefixed cutting parameters (cutting velocity and feed rate). The experimental physical model was compared with the Merchant equation.

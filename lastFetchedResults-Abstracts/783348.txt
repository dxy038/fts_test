Background: The objective of the study
is to describe the community prevalence of psychiatric
disorder, mainly posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) 3 years after a
devastating earthquake. Methods: Three years after
the Marmara Earthquake, 683 individuals from the
epicentre were randomly selected to form a representative
sample and were assessed with Composite
International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), General
Health Questionnaire (GHQ), Traumatic Stress
Symptom Checklist (TSSC) and Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI). Results: The 36 months prevalence
of PTSD and MDD after the Marmara Earthquake were
19.2% and 18.7% respectively. The current prevalence
of PTSD and MDD in the affected community was
found to be 11.7% and 10.5%, respectively. PTSD and
MDD were the most prevalent disorders after the
disaster and showed a decrease over time. However,
only 38.9% of the PTSD cases identified at any time
over the 3 years were in remission at the 3rd-year. The
co-occurrence of MDD with PTSD resulted in a decrease
in the rate of recovery from PTSD. MDD was
also the most prevalent disorder accompanying PTSD.
Of all the subjects 37.5% with PTSD still met the MDD
criteria at the 3rd year postearthquake. Conclusions:
In comparison with the data from pre-earthquake
national mental health profile, the present study
showed that the prevalence of MDD, panic disorder,
OCD, GAD, social phobia and special phobias were
still higher in the affected region 3 years after the
earthquake.

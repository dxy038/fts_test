The 1232 family of standards were developed to provide standard exchange formats and software services for reasoning systems used in system test and diagnosis. The exchange formats and services am based on a model of information required to support test and diagnosis. The standards were developed by the Diagnostic and Maintenance Control (D&amp;MC) subcommittee of IEEE SCC20. The current efforts by the D&amp;MC are a combined standard made up of the 1232 family, and a standard on Testability and Diagnosability Metrics, P1522. The 1232 standards describe a neutral exchange format so one diagnostic reasoner can exchange model information with another diagnostic reasoner. In addition, software interfaces are defined whereby diagnostic tools can be developed to process the diagnostic information in a consistent and reliable way. The objective of the Testability and Diagnosability Metrics standard is to provide notionally correct and mathematically precise definitions of testability measures that may be used to either measure the testability characteristics of a system, or predict the testability of a system. The end purpose is to provide an unambiguous source for definitions of common and uncommon testability and diagnosability terms such that each individual encountering it can know precisely what that term means. This paper describes the 1232 and P1522 standards and details the recent changes in the Information models, restructured higher order services and simplified conformance requirements

The objective of this work is primarily aimed at investigating the behavior of the CERTS Microgrid test bed with the integration of smart loads. The smart loads are primarily employed to relieve the system frequency as soon as it begins to deteriorate. The installed smart load assembly is modeled in this paper and its performance with the different distributed energy resources (DERs) in the existing CERTS Microgrid test bed is analyzed. This paper also evaluates the benefits of using these smart loads as a means to prevent the DERs from stalling in the islanded mode of operation.

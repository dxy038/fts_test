The traditional research of resource balanced optimization is based on the uniform distribution of resources and the sacrifice of maneuver time. However, in the actual construction, resources have diversity and the emergent events always exist. So to take account of the diversity of resources and be given some maneuver time to deal with these emergencies is necessary. Based on the analysis of the resource balanced optimization, this paper increased maneuver time as one of the optimization goals in objective function, to construct a balanced optimization model of multi-resource allocation. In addition, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the better effectiveness and practicality of this model.

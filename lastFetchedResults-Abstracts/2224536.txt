In the context of supply chain management, supplier selection plays a key role in reaching desirable production planning. In today's competitive world, many enterprises have focused on selecting the appropriate suppliers in an attempt to reduce purchasing costs and improve quality products and services. Supplier selection is a multi-criteria decision problem, which includes different qualitative and quantitative criteria such as purchase cost, on time delivery, quality of service, etc. In this study, a fuzzy multi-objective mathematical programming model is presented to select appropriate supplier and assign desirable order to different supplies. The proposed model was implemented for an organization by considering 16 different scenarios and the results are compared with two other existing methods.

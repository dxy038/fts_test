It is difficult to carry out quantitative measurements of the persuasive power of business communications (i.e., persuasive skills) and such communications are likely to involve difficult to understand, unseen and unknown knowledge. However, using unstructured recorded communication data based on conversations with business customers, we have been developing explicit knowledge concerning skills necessary for effective communications in the form of an expression framework. The objective of this research is to generate a framework and a process for explicit management knowledge concerning understandable communication skills as opposed to the tacit, hard to understand the negotiating skills related to overdue payment collection personnel and to verify the actual usefulness of this knowledge using the accumulated data in a company. Using this process we have developed, it is possible to discover the special characteristics of the communication content of high success overdue payment collection personnel.

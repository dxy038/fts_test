Objective
The ultimate success or failure of a restored tooth is largely dependent on clinical management. Clinicians may choose from a number of restorative materials, different clinical techniques and cavity preparation procedures. The purpose of this study was to specifically examine aspects of the material choice holding other factors constant.
Methods

The current paper adopts a fundamental result in the linear theory of elasticity on the singular stress distribution in a bi-materials wedge to analyze the fracture susceptibility of different materials used for the restoration of a tooth.
Results

Comparable results are reported for amalgam, gold alloys and ceramic materials. It is shown that due to a wide variety of mechanical properties the application of resin-based composites could lead to improved or less fracture resistance of the restored tooth.
Significance

This variety in the mechanical properties for resin-based composites could be partially responsible for the contradictory evidences reported by different clinical studies. The present work contributes evidence from an analytical model to assist the restorative dentist in selection of an appropriate restorative material and guide the manufacturing companies on the preferred physical properties of newer designed materials.

Web services (WS) empower centralization of computer-based services for broadly offering them over a network. Additionally, WSs can be combined to implement new services which are called composite WSs. This enables enterprises and private users to realize complex Web applications by putting different, existing services together. The objective of this paper is to generate test cases for testing interactions of WSs within a composite WS. Dependencies among transferred data as well as conditions in control flow and real-time constraints are modeled by concurrent event sequence graphs (cESG) which are augmented by decision tables (DT). This novel approach allows a precise fault modeling that leads to an efficient test process. Thus, the novelty of the approach stems from (i) its simplicity and lucidity in representing complex real-time composite WSs, (ii) its modeling that considers a comfortable fault management and (iii) its unique systematic methodology for testing composite WSs.

Tourism is one of the major sources of income for many countries. Therefore, providing efficient, real-time service for tourists is a crucial competitive asset which needs to be enhanced using major technological advances. The current research has the objective of integrating technological innovation into an information system, in order to build a better user experience for the tourist. The principal strength of the approach is the fusion of context-aware pervasive systems, GIS systems, social networks and semantics. This paper presents the SPETA system, which uses knowledge of the userâ€™s current location, preferences, as well as a history of past locations, in order to provide the type of recommender services that tourists expect from a real tour guide.

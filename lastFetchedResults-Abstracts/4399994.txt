Many patients experience the congestion in the healthcare system. In this case, the primary care (e.g. outpatient, MRI) usually provides appointment for patient in order to make better schedule. Patients´ behavior, such as last-minute cancellations or &#8220;no-shows&#8221;, will lead to the capacity waste, and then overall social welfare. We use a single server M/D/1/K queueing approach to obtain a stationary distribution of the patients who have chance to behave no-shows and may rejoin the queue when no-show take place. A social welfare function which includes the trade-off between patients´ reward and cost is developed. We try to figure out the impact of some queueing variables such as no-show rate on the outcome of social welfare. The experimental result shows that we should take no-show into account when decision objective is a good social welfare outcome.

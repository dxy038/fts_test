The term “simultaneity” means the exhibition of various spaces without time and place sequences in an image using the principle of synchronicity. The term “spatial simultaneity” has been used for referring to Persian painting and Cubist paintings of Picasso. For this reason, the main objective in present paper is to identify similar and different aspects of the two aesthetic systems of Persian painting and Picasso painting each of which displays spatial simultaneity in its visual structure. Moreover, it is tried to show that “spatial simultaneity” lacks enough precision for describing Persian painting. Accordingly, similar and different aspects of the concept and visual structure of “spatial simultaneity” in Persian and Picasso paintings are explored. To fulfill the objectives of this paper, library sources and descriptive-analytical method are used to explore the concept of space and the manner of showing perspective in these two visual systems. The results of observations in this paper show that spatial simultaneity in aesthetic system of Persian painting and Picasso painting involves similarities and differences. For instance, in Persian painting, space is devoid of material constraints and it is in relation to the World of Ideas, whereas, in Picasso painting, space is perceptual and dependent on the material world. For this reason, it can be concluded that the term “spatial simultaneity” is not sufficiently precise to define visual structure of Persian painting because such term has been used for the first time to define Cubism style in painting which is not in complete correspondence with Persian painting.

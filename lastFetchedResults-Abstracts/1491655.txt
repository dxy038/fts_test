Investigation of elasto-plastic stability of reticulated shells has gradually become more and more attractive to researchers. However, the analysis of the elasto-plastic stability is much more complicated than the elastic analysis, because of the involvement of both the geometrical nonlinearity and the material nonlinearity and the interactions of the two. Taking into consideration of material nonlinearity, the elasto-plastic stability behaviour of reticulated shells will be significantly different, which can only be revealed by large amount of geometrically and material nonlinear analysis of the structures. The elasto-plastic stability of seven types of commonly used single-layer reticulated shells (Kiewitt-8, Kiewitt-6, Geodesic, Schwedler Bidirectional, Schwedler Monoclonal, Sunflower, and Radial Rib) was investigated systematically with ANSYS, in which more than 2000 cases of geometrically and material nonlinear analysis were conducted with different initial geometrical imperfections, geometrical, structural and load parameters. Based on the analytical results and via comparison between elastic and elasto-plastic buckling loads, the plasticity influence coefficients were summarized for each type of the reticulated domes. These coefficients can be used to predict accurately the elasto-plastic buckling load in design practice of the reticulated domes, which is an easy way for designers to evaluate stability of the reticulated shells.

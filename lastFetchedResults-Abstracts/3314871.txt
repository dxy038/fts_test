Monitoring and supervision of power systems ISAN important aspect in view of security of an interconnected power system. This paper presents a comparison of various state estimation techniques based on the implementation of Phasor Measurement Units at the network buses. These techniques were implemented to meet two requirements i.e., to ensure the complete system observability and find the optimal locations of PMUs with the minimum cost. The problem is formulated as a mono-objective optimization problem and its resolution is made by implementing seven algorithms which are mentioned in this paper. The proposed algorithms are demonstrated using five test networks, including a practical system and the results are compared.The simulation results ensure the complete system observability.

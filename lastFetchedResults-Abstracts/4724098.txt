An optimal control strategy for the operation of a power distribution system is proposed. The objective is to meet all load demands while maintaining a desired profile and achieving minimization of power losses in the distribution system. A set of control objects of the distribution system consisting of security, operational and economical control laws (constraints) is integrated into the strategy formulation. The problem is formulated at the subnetwork level where local optimal control strategies can be implemented. An example system is solved to illustrate the procedure

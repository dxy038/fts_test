The objective was to compare pregnancy rates following fixed-time AI (FTAI) in beef cattle given a new or previously used CIDR insert and injections of estradiol, with or without progesterone, to synchronize follicular wave emergence. In Experiment 1, heifers (n=616) received a new or once-used CIDR insert for 9 days and were given 1 mg estradiol cypionate (ECP), with or without 100 mg of a commercial progesterone preparation (CP4), at CIDR insertion. Heifers were treated with PGF at CIDR removal and 0.5 mg ECP i.m. 24 h later, with FTAI 55 to 60 h after CIDR removal. Pregnancy rate was not affected by either the number of CIDR uses (P=0.59; 48.3% versus 46.2% for new versus once-used CIDRs, respectively) or the addition of progesterone (P=0.42; 45.6% versus 48.8% for ECP+CP4 and ECP, respectively). In Experiment 2 (replicated at two locations), heifers (n=56) and lactating beef cows (n=307) received a once- or twice-used CIDR and an i.m. injection of 1 mg estradiol benzoate (EB), with or without 100 mg progesterone, at CIDR insertion. Cattle received PGF in the ischiorectal fossa at CIDR removal (Day 7) and 1 mg EB i.m. 24 h later, with FTAI 52 to 56 h after CIDR removal. Pregnancy rate was affected by location (P&lt;0.002; 46.0% versus 61.1% for Locations A and B, respectively), parity (P&lt;0.04; 67.9% versus 53.1% in heifers and cows, respectively), and numbers of times the CIDR had been used (P&lt;0.03; 62.4% versus 48.4% for once- and twice-used CIDRs, respectively). However, the addition of progesterone to the injection of EB at CIDR insertion did not affect pregnancy rate (P=0.6). In Experiment 3, heifers (n=187) received one new, one once-used, one twice-used or two twice-used CIDRs for 7 days and 2 mg EB plus 50 mg of CP4 at the time of CIDR insertion. Heifers were treated with PGF at CIDR removal and 1 mg EB i.m. 24 h later, with FTAI 52â€“56 h after CIDR removal. Pregnancy rate was not affected by treatments (P=0.28, 57.5, 63.8, 47.9, 47.9% for one new, one once-used, one twice-used, or two twice-used CIDRs, respectively). In summary, pregnancy rate to FTAI did not differ between cattle synchronized with a new or once-used CIDR, but pregnancy rate was lower in cattle synchronized with a twice-used CIDR; however, the insertion of two twice-used CIDRs did not affect pregnancy rates. The addition of an injection of progesterone to the estradiol treatment at CIDR insertion did not enhance pregnancy rate to FTAI.

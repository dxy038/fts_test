The changes to VHSIC hardware description language (VHDL) 1076-1987 for restandardization in 1992 are described. Emphasis is placed on the actual changes which have been made to the language. These are grouped into five topics: syntax and consistency; modeling; synthesis; packages; and visibility. The objective of the language design phase is to produce language change specifications (LCSs) that satisfy the requirements for change. Forty-eight LCSs were written, most of which provided input to the documentation team who were writing a new language reference manual (LRM)

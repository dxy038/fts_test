Background: Short-bowel syndrome is a state of severe malabsorption resulting from absence or removal of the small bowel for several causes. A number of short-bowel patients develop hyperphagia. Leptin, a protein secreted from adipose tissue, signals the amount of energy stores to the brain. Objective: To study body composition and leptin regulation in short-bowel patients and to determine whether or not leptin concentrations are linked with hyperphagia.Design : We studied 25 short-bowel patients (remnant bowel less than 150 cm) and 31 controls and 10 oral nutrition. Fifteen patients received total parenteral nutrition and 10 oral nutrition. Anthropometric measurements, body composition (by bioelectrical impedance), and cholesterol, triacylglycerol and leptin concentrations were studied in all subjects. Results: There were no differences between short-bowel patients and controls in anthropometric variables, body composition, or leptin concentrations. Leptin concentrations were higher in short-bowel women than men (9.21±8.54 vs. 3.22±1.86 ng/ml,P =0.01). Leptin concentrations correlated positively with age (r=0.4, P=0.045), body mass index (r=0.52, P=0.007), fat mass (r=0.67, P=0.001) and body fat (r=0.68,P =0.0001); there were no correlations with other body composition parameters. We found no correlations between parenteral or oral nutrition and body composition parameters, or between leptin concentrations and the presence of hyperphagia. Logistic regression analysis showed that body fat correctly identified leptin concentrations in 60% of patients.Conclusions : Body composition, leptin concentrations and leptin regulation in patients with short-bowel syndrome are similar to those of controls. Leptin concentrations do not correlate with hyperphagia in short bowel-patients

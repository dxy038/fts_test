This paper briefly presents the architectural considerations, and details of the technical implementation of an integrated prehospital health emergency management system. Subsequently, the paper focuses on a critical review of the experiences gained through the deployment and use of the system with the objective of analyzing the factors influencing IT adoption in healthcare. In doing so, the &#8220;Fit between Individuals, Task and Technology&#8221; (FITT) framework has been adopted and used in the retrospective analysis of our case study in an attempt to better analyze the socio-organizational-technical factors that influence IT adoption.

A mapping technique is introduced to expand the capabilities of current control field design procedures. The maps relate the control field to the logarithm of the time evolution operator. Over the dynamic range of the maps, which begins at the sudden limit and extends beyond, they are found to be more accurate than field â†’ observable maps. The maps may be used as part of an iterative computational algorithm for field design. This process is illustrated for the design of a field to meet a population transfer objective.

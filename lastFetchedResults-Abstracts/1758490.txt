Objective
mine injuries among children treated in an emergency department (ED) related to use of a children's wagon.
s
ere obtained from the 2002 through 2007 National Electronic Injury Surveillance System. National estimates of ED visits associated with the use of a children's wagon were analyzed among children aged birth through 6 years in the United States.
s
002 through 2007, there were an estimated 24 339 visits for injuries related to the use of children's wagons among children aged birth through 6 years, with an average annual injury visit rate of 14.5 per 100 000. Among injured children, 12% had a fracture and 17% had a closed head injury; most of these injuries were treated and the child released. The most frequently cited body part injured was the head (40%); the arm/wrist/hand was the most common body site to receive a fracture injury (48%). Boys had a higher injury visit rate than girls, and most patients (97%) were treated and released from the ED.
sions
jury patterns noted in this study are similar to those found with other wheeled vehicles and toys. More detailed information on the circumstances surrounding wagon injuries and a better understanding of the patterns of play associated with wagons would be helpful in designing effective risk reduction strategies.

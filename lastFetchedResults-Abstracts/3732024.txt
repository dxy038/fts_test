The principal features of a co-operative planning study by the Arizona Public Service Company and the General Electric Company are described. Objective of the joint study is to determine optimum design of distribution and subtransmission systems to serve a large load area. To accomplish this objective a series of four digital computer programs have been developed. These programs generate the costs and characteristics of systems designed to serve a specified area for fixed load conditions.

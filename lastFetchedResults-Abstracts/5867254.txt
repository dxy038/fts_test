The use of video watermarking is increasing as multimedia communication becomes more popular. In this paper, we propose a watermarking technique for H.264 compressed video. The principal component is used and embedded with a binary watermark. The embedding process is done in the middle frequency subband as a result of applying a two dimensional wavelet transform. Furthermore, the watermark extraction process does not need the original video sequence. Our experimental results confirm both subjective, such as human visual system (HVS) and objective quality, such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR).

The objective of this paper is twofold: firstly it aims at analyzing two acceptance criterions independently proposed by Taipale and Pursley (in 1989) and by Barros, Godoy and Wille (in 1993); and secondly to present the Real-Time Modified Information Set (RT-ISA) soft-decision decoding algorithm for block codes that is based on the BGW criterion. The theoretical analysis is followed by results from computer simulation in order to evaluate the algorithm performance.

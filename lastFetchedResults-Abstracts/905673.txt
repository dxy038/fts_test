The Dardanelles Strait is a remarkable example of a long, narrow, shallow, and strongly stratified strait
with bidirectional exchange that is governed by both baroclinic and barotropic forcing with a wide
spectrum of variability. A three-dimensional free surface primitive equation model is applied to study
seasonal hydrodynamics variability in this strait. The calculated vertical structure of temperature,
salinity, and velocity fields agrees well with available survey data. Seasonal monthly values of the volume
exchange at the Aegean and Marmara exits are estimated. It is found that the seasonal exchange
dynamics is governed by the turbulent friction and entrainment at the Nara Passage area. The mean
annual water transport in the upper layer is increased by 80% after the Nara Passage. About 25% of
water entering in the Dardanelles bottom layer reaches the Marmara Sea in winter, and 50% reaches
it in summer. The estimate of the Dardanelles hydrodynamics according to hydraulic and viscous–
advective–diffusive regime classification shows significant deviation from the two-layer hydraulic
asymptotic. However, according to three-layer hydraulic theory, the flow is found to be critical in the
Nara Passage area.

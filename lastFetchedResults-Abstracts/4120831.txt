This article is based on a case study with the objective to characterize the entrepreneurial behavior of a outsourced small company businessman in the telecommunications industry. To achieve this goal we carried out a literature review on outsourcing and entrepreneurship. The privatization of the telecommunications sector in the nineties in Brazil, global competition among dealers of these services, the core business focus as a trend in business administration, rationalization and specialization of companies, and the rise of outsourcing economy as a keyword in the pursuance for increased profitability and reduced costs, have meant that telecommunications service providers outsource much of their services, especially those relating to sales and installation of products and services. This is the context where the small business developed from the businessman entrepreneurial vision. The behavior of the investigated entrepreneur was identified through the application of an opened question interview with qualitative approach.

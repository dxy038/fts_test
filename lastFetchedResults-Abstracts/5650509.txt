Background: Despite the number of empirical studies that assess Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD) techniques, more research is required to investigate, for example, how software maintainability is impacted when these techniques are employed. One way to minimize the effort and increase the reliability of results in further research is to systematize empirical studies in Aspect-Oriented Software Maintainability (AOSM). In this context, metrics are useful as indicators to quantify software quality attributes, such as maintenance. Currently, a high number of metrics have been used throughout the literature to measure software maintainability. However, there is no comprehensive catalogue showing which metrics can be used to measure AOSM. Aim: To identify an AOSM metrics suite to be used by researchers in AOSM research. Method: We performed a systematic mapping study based on Kitchenham and ChartersÂ´ guidelines, which derived a research protocol, and used well known digital libraries engines to search the literature. Conclusions: A total of 138 primary studies were selected. They describe 67 aspect-oriented (AO) maintainability metrics. Also, out of the 575 object-oriented maintainability metrics that we analyzed, 469 can be adapted to AO software. This catalogue provides an objective guide to researchers looking for maintainability metrics to be used as indicators in their quantitative and qualitative assessments. We provide information such as authors, metrics description, and studies that used the metric. Researchers can use this information to decide which metrics are more suited for their studies.

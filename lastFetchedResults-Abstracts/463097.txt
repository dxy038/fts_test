Background
The role of aspirin in prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular complications among people with diabetes has been examined. A Healthy People 2010 objective calls for increasing the proportion of people with diabetes aged ≥40 years who take aspirin ≥15 times per month.
Methods

Data from 2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were used to examine (1) the prevalence of aspirin intake, (2) aspirin use among those with CVD, (3) aspirin use among those with diabetes, (4) current status with respect to Healthy People objective 5-16, and (5) changes in aspirin intake from 1999.
Results

Daily or every-other-day aspirin use was reported by 36.2% of participants in 2003. Aspirin intake among those with CVD and diabetes was 82.8% and 62.6%, respectively. The Healthy People 2010 objective of increasing the proportion of adults with diabetes aged ≥40 years who take aspirin to 30% was achieved. The prevalence of aspirin intake was higher in 2003 compared to 1999 among all participants, those with CVD, and those with diabetes (relative increase of about 20%, 12%, and 36%, respectively). Most participants (74%) reported cardiovascular reasons for aspirin use. Among those without CVD or diabetes, the prevalence of aspirin intake increased with the increasing number of CVD risk factors.
Conclusions

Regular aspirin use increased over a 4-year period. Greater use of inexpensive and easily accessible interventions to prevent cardiovascular events is encouraging. Increased efforts to continue preventive uses of available treatment and reduction in risk by modifying other risk factors will help lower future disease burden.

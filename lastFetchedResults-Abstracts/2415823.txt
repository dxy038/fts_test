Objective(s):There is much evidence indicating that depression is influenced by the levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, GABA and adrenaline. The current study we designed to investigate the effect of exposure of pregnant rats to different colors on neurotransmitters level, as indicators of mood disorders in off springs.
Materials and Methods:Five groups of pregnant female Wistar rats (eight rats in each group) were enrolled in this study. Dopamine, adrenaline and GABA concentration in sera of rats were measured using ELISA.
Results:The colors black and red elevated the GABA levels in serum and CSF while the colors green and blue decreased the GABA levels. The colors black and red also decreased the sera and CSF levels of dopamine compared to the control group. The concentration of adrenaline was increased following exposure to the colors black, red and blue but decreased only following color green exposure. These results showed serious changes in neurotransmitter levels due to exposure to different colors which can be translated as mood Â and behavior changes.
Conclusion:It can be concluded that exposure during pregnancy can lead to postpartum behavioral changes even at adulthood and such changes can be made by colors.

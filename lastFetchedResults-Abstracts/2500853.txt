<p><strong>Objective: </strong>The purpose of this study was to examine the prediction of depression on a group of ‎Iranian older adults based on components of health locus of control.‎<br /><strong>Method:</strong> Sixty-six men and 42 women over the age of 55 were recruited from the retirement ‎clubs in Shiraz, using convenience sampling. The participants completed the research ‎questionnaires including the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the ‎Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLC).‎<br /><strong>Results:</strong> The findings on health locus of control revealed that the highest score was on internal ‎locus of control followed by God, powerful others and chance. The mean score on ‎depression was on a normal range. Multiple regression analysis showed that two ‎independent variables including internal control (ß = -.32, p &lt; 0.01) and God control ‎‎(ß = -.20, = p &lt; 0.03) significantly predicted depression. The other components of ‎health locus of control such as chance and powerful others as well as age did not ‎predict depression. Findings also revealed that the independents variables explained ‎‎26% of the total variance of depression (R2 = .26, p &lt;0.001).‎<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study provides more support for the application of theory of health locus of ‎control on depression.‎‎</p>

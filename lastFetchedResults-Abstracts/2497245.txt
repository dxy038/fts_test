Objective: The Sheehan ‎Disability Scale (SDS) assesses ‎disability in four domains of ‎home management, work ‎responsibilities, close ‎relationships and social life. The ‎main objective of this study was ‎to develop the Persian version of ‎the SDS‏.‏
Method: Two steps of field work ‎followed the Persian translation ‎and cultural adaptation of the ‎tool: First, the internal consistency ‎and convergent validity was ‎examined in 104 clinical cases ‎recruited from inpatient and ‎outpatient psychiatric services, ‎using 36-item Short Form Health ‎Survey (SF-36) and Global ‎Assessment of Functioning ‎‎(GAF). Then 88 individuals were ‎randomly selected from the adult ‎general population to assess ‎internal consistency, inter-rater ‎reliability and known group ‎validity‏.‏
Results: In the clinical settings, ‎Cronbach’s ? coefficient was ‎‎0.88 and item-total correlation ‎ranged from 0.71 to 0.78 in ‎various domains. The correlation ‎between SDS and SF-36 ‎‎(P < 0.001) was significant in all ‎the areas of the performance; ‎and neither of the correlations ‎was statistically significant when ‎SDS and GAF were compared. In ‎the general population study, the ‎SDS met a good internal ‎consistency (? = 0.81) and known ‎group validity, and the inter-rater ‎reliability was perfect for ‎‎“school/work responsibility‏”. ‏
Conclusion: The Persian ‎translation of the SDS is a simple ‎and short scale, and it seems to ‎be a valid scale for the ‎measurement of disability in ‎clinical settings and in the Iranian ‎general population‏.‏

he objective of this paper is to deal with the fuzzy conic programming problems. The aim here is to derive weak and strong duality theorems for a general fuzzy conic programming. Toward this end, The convexity-like concept of fuzzy mappings is introduced and then a specific ordering cone is established based on the parameterized representation of fuzzy numbers. Under this setting, duality theorems are extended from crisp conic optimization problems to fuzzy ones

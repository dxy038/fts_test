Results: Results of factor analysis of DES using Varimax rotation method, yielded 2 factors which explained 69.91% of the total variance. Convergent validity was confirmed by computing a correlation coefficient between subscales together and with total scale, which was significance between 0.62 until 0.91 (p < 0.01). And the reliability of the scale by test-retest, spilt-half and Cronbach Alpha, were consecutively 0.89, 0.85 and 0.89.

Source and channel coding techniques are widely employed in many communication systems. In source coding, the objective is to retain the essential information of the source by removing its redundancy. Channel coding, on the other hand, introduces redundancy in order to provide protection against channel noise. When designing channel codes, it is common to assume that the source encoder has removed all of the source redundancy. In some practical situations, however, the source encoder fails to entirely eliminate the source redundancy. In these cases, the redundancy remaining at the output of the source encoder, the residual redundancy, may be used to combat channel noise

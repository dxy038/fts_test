Communication networks are complex systems demonstrating a wide range of variation in architectures and implementations. Robustly modeling and simulating (M&amp;S) these COMM networks is both a science and an art. What are the characteristics of a good M&amp;S study in this area? Taxonomy of COMM network phenomenology and discussion of requisite levels of fidelity are provided toward the development of an objective quality standard for the discipline.

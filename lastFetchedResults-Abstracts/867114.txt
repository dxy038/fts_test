In this paper, we deal with an assembly line production system in which an automated guided vehicle (AGV) delivers parts to each workstation of assembly lines from a miniload automated storage/retrieval system (AS/RS). Each assembly production line is characterized by a sequence of workstations linked together for the production of a given type of product. We consider simultaneously the design problem of miniload AS/RS and the problem of determining a unit load size of the AGV. First, a non-linear mathematical model is formulated under a proposed AGV dispatching policy. And then, we determine an appropriate sequence of lines of the vehicle visits. Finally, based on the characteristics of the objective function and feasible region of the decision variables, a heuristic solution procedure is developed to find a near optimal solution. To examine the validity of the model, an example problem is solved.

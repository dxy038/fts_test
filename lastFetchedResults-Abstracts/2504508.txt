Background: Endometriosis is a common hormone-dependent gynecologic disease with a high recurrence. Laparotomy or laparoscopy is the standard surgery for the large endometrioma. Also, sclerotherapy is basically used to treat different diseases one of which is endometrioma. Objective: The study was designed to assess the value of transvaginal ultrasound-guided ethanol sclerotherapy in patients with a recurrent endometrioma. Materials and Methods: In a randomized clinical trial, an interventional group of 20 patients underwent transvaginal ethanol sclerotherapy for recurrent ovarian endometrioma. The patients were followed up first after one and two weeks and then after one, two, and three months. If the patients had no endometrioma, they were treated with in vitro fertilization (IVF) (standard long protocol). A control group of 20 patients with endometrioma were enrolled for an IVF protocol. They had no treatment by ethanol sclerotherapy. IVF parameters, pregnancy rates, and implantation rates were compared in both groups. Results: The demographic data showed no difference between the two groups. The initial mean endometria size was 41.45±15.9 cm, the recurrence rate after 6 months was 4 (20%), FSH before and after sclerotherapy was 6.97±2.25 IU/L and 6.78±1.88 IU/L (p=0.343). The clinical pregnancy rate was 6 (33.3%) vs. 3 (15%), (p=0.616). The fertilization rate emerged 63.06% in study group vs. 60.38%, (p=0.57). The implantation rate turned out 12.9% in study group vs. 7.5%, (p=0.52). None of these results were significant. However, the data pointed to a better trend toward the ethanol sclerotherapy group. Conclusion: Ethanol sclerotherapy could be an effective strategy for the treatment of recurrent endometrioma especially before IVF.

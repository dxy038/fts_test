The objective of this study was to investigate concentrations of atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazine), deethylatrazine (DEA) (2-amino-4-chloro-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazine), deisopropylatrazine (DIA) (2-amino-4-chloro-6-ethylamino-1,3,5-triazine) and deethyldeisopropylatrazine (DEIA) (6-chloro-2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazine) in groundwaters of Vojvodina Province. A study was conducted during April 2001. Some 110 samples of groundwater were taken from near surface aquifers. The water samples were first passed through a disk containing solid matrix coated with a chemically bonded C-18 organic phase. The disk was then eluted with supercritical carbon dioxide to remove compounds from the sorbent. Finally the extract was injected into capillary gas chromatograph. Average concentrations were 0.198 μg L−1 for atrazine, 0.116 μg L−1 for DEA, 0.043 μg L−1 for DIA and 0.077 μg L−1 for DEIA.

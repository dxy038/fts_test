The NoC paradigm is one, if not only one, fit to enable the integration of an exceedingly large number of computational, logical and storage blocks in a single chip. The paper presents a novel technique called CGMAP,which finds a mapping of the vertices of a task graph to the tiles of a mesh based NoCarchitecture, with an objective of improving the Quality of Service (QoS) in networks-on-chip.The proposed algorithm is basically a genetic algorithm, which takes the advantage of the chaotic systems by using them instead of the random processes used in the GA. Different one-dimensional chaotic maps are introduced and applied to the proposed algorithm in order to compare the performance of each map in finding the best solution for the NoC mapping problem. The results confirm an increase in some performance indexes, due to chaotic sequences.

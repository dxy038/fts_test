The objective of this paper is to present the
modeling and design of SMES system for Azarbaijan
electrical network for damping of dynamic vacillation by
using SMES and fuzzy controller. In this case we well can
to control of P & Q to decrease power loss. The results
show that we can optimize the electrical factors of
transmission line and network.

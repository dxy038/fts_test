The passive and active system designs for hard disk suspension assemblies are formulated as multiobjective optimization problems. The maximization of natural frequencies is treated as a set of objectives in the passive design, subject to side constraints on the design variables that describe the dimensions of the suspension system. The active design integrates both structural and control objectives, and is characterized by a set of objective natural frequencies and an optimal control performance index with weighted system state regulation errors and control efforts. Preloading and air bearing effects are both considered in the optimal design. An interface program is used to communicate between the finite element analyzer and the optimizer using the multiobjective optimization techniques of goal programming and compromise programming. The feasibility of the optimal design is demonstrated and the frequency responses of the proposed designs are investigated.

We consider the problem of generating and tracking a trajectory between two arbitrary parabolic profiles of a periodic 2D channel flow, which is linearly unstable for high Reynolds numbers. Also known as the Poisseuille flow, this problem is frequently cited as a paradigm for transition to turbulence. Our approach consists in generating an exact trajectory of the nonlinear system that approaches exponentially the objective profile. A boundary control law guarantees then that the error between the state and the trajectory decays exponentially in the L<sup>2 </sup> norm. The result is first proved for the linearized Stokes equations, then shown to hold for the nonlinear Navier-Stokes system

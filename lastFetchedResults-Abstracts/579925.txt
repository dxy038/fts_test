The main objective of this paper is to investigate the trade impact on pollution emission. Data for selected developing countries including Iran was applied as pooled dataset for period of 1990-2008. For comparison Carbone-dioxide was used as pollution emission index. Findings showed that increase in capital would not result increase in pollution emission. But pollution emission increased as a result of increase in trade level. In addition, increase in trade is expected to raise income. The emission elasticity with respect to trade showed that increase in trade by 10 percent would cause pollution to increase by 2.2 percent in selected developing countries in the long run.

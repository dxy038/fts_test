A multiple objective optimization model subject to a system of fuzzy relation equations with max-average composition and a reduction procedure in order to reduce problem dimension are presented. Furthermore, a genetic algorithm is reviewed and some of its components are modified to solve the problem. Finally, the algorithm is performed on different problems and its major components role in detecting the solution is examined.

The purpose of this study was to determine the status of self-directed learning and its related factors in dentistry and medical students based on individual and social characteristics.
Guilan University of medical sciences in different courses were selected by systematic random sampling method and participated in this study, for collecting data, a questionnaire of self-directed learning readiness Guglimino was used. This scale consists of 8 domains including 58 items, with 5 point likert type. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (frequency distribution, mean, and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (anova.t-test). Also multiple logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with self-directed learning readiness. 
Results: based on findings self-directed learning readiness status was in moderate level in 42% of credit-research. Regression results showed that factors includings the amount of time allocated to lesson study daily between 3 to 4 hours (P=0.006) groups discussion as an interested teaching methodology, (P=0.018) also mothers education diploma and upper diploma (P=0.006) and undergraduate (P=0.41) were considered as predictive factors in self-directed learning.
Conclusion: According to the results, attention to codified program to promote this skill in students as well as participating educational workshop, adapting principles in lesson course and selecting appropriate methodology are necessary for students.

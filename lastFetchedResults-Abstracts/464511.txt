OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate whether prolonged or irregular bleeding during Norplant implant use could be alleviated with the use of oral hormonal medication. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred fifty users of the Norplant levonorgestrel contraceptive implant with prolonged or frequent bleeding were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, comparative study and assigned to one of three treatment groups for 20 days: ethinyl estradiol 50 μg, an oral contraceptive (50 μg ethinyl estradiol and 250 μg levonorgestrel), and placebo. Total days of bleeding during treatment and length of the bleeding-free interval were analyzed. RESULTS: Women treated with the levonorgestrel - ethinyl estradiol pill bled an average of 2.6 days during treatment compared with 5.4 and 12.3 days in the ethinyl estradiol and placebo groups, respectively. Differences between both hormonal groups and placebo were significant (p< 0.00001); moreover, the combined pill was more effective than ethinyl estradiol alone (p< 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The combined pill proved to be an excellent palliative treatment and is a more practical approach because of availability at all clinic sites. (AM J OBSTET GYNECOL 1996;174:919-22.)

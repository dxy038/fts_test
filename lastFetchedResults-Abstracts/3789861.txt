The objective of daily hydroelectric scheduling is to generate power as much as possible in accordance with changes in electricity demand under highly constrained conditions. A highly efficient layered network model is proposed and applied to the Kiso river hydroelectric system, which is one of the most complicated hydropower systems in Japan. First, the practicality of the proposed model is demonstrated by its ability to cope with power increases at peak demand periods, and second by the easy handring of its major operational constraints and objectives.

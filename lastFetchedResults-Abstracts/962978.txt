
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hyperglycemia and oxidative stress are found in patients with diabetes. Pyrus boissieriana Buhse leaves extract has many biological activities such as antioxidant, antilarva, antibacterial and antifungal in vitro. The aim of this study was to evaluate the preventive effect of Pyrus biossieriana Buhse leaves extract (PbBLE) on lipid and protein peroxidation in hyperglycemic rats.
METHODS: In this experimental study 120 adult male rats of Wistar strain, weighing 150 to 200g were randomized into normal control, extract control (500mg/kg), hyperglycemic and hyperglycemic+ extract (500mg/kg) groups. Each group divided into 3 subgroups (24, 48, 72h). Serum and tissues (liver, kidney, pancreas), total antioxidant capacity, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), carbonyl content and serum glucose measured by spectrophotometry and compared.
FINDINGS: Pretreatment with Pyrus boissieriana Buhse leaves extract exhibited a significant reduction in elevated serum glucose induced by alloxan in all subgroups. The extract increases total antioxidant after 72h.  Mean of liver total antioxidant was 831±147 in alloxan+ extract group vs. 428±25 in alloxan group (p=0.045). Administration of Pyrus boissieriana Buhse leaves extract decreased serum, tissues and serum carbonyl.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that Pyrus boissieriana Buhse leaves extract caused a decrease in serum glucose level, TBARS, some tissues and serum carbonyl, also it caused an increase in ferric reducing antioxidant power  (FRAP) levels in some tissues.

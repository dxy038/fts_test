In many modern radar application, as, for example, Time Modulated Array or High Power Devices [1-3, 5-6], the availability of switches with very low transition time, very low light resistance, very high dark resistance and supporting high powers are required. The objective of this work is to design a photoconductive switch able to generate short pulses with very high amplitude for designing new front-end radar architectures exploiting time domain. To this aim, a feeding network based on the Blumlein lines will be taken into account.

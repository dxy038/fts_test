With the development of theory and technology of Web service, Web service composition has become the core service-oriented computing technology. It is important for business process to select the best service components with multi-dimensional QoS assurance to construct a complex one. In this paper we propose a Web service composition model with multiple QoS constraints. We define the utility function as the evaluation standard considering all QoS parameters of each service component and use subjective-objective weight mode to set the weight of each QoS metric

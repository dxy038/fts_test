This research investigates slice-based architecture for biometrics. A service slice is an aggregation of resources for a specific biometric objective; e.g., speaker verification. Slice-based architecture is attractive as a framework for modeling service-oriented biometric applications. In order for it to be usable, slice-based architecture must adequately address privacy, security, and standard based interoperability. We propose to incorporate secure computation mechanism and BioAPI standard into slice-based architecture. We discuss why secure computation is information-theoretic secure, and how it can be used to realize a private computation for the exchange of biometric data between two parties in slice-based architecture. For proof-of-concept, open source software is developed for realizing a privacy preserving voice verification prototype based on slice-based architecture, and will be released for experimentation by the public. The result of our initial experimentation is reported.

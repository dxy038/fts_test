The objective of this paper is to analyse the sectoral impacts that Spanish international trade relations have on present levels of atmospheric pollution using an inputâ€“output model. We try to evaluate the exports and imports of the Spanish economy in terms of the direct and indirect CO2 emissions (CO2 embodied) generated in Spain and abroad. The results show a slightly exporting behaviour in the Spanish economy which, nevertheless, hides important pollution interchanges. Moreover, the sectors transport material, mining and energy, non-metallic industries, chemical and metals are the most relevant CO2 exporters and other services, construction, transport material and food the biggest CO2 importers, and those whose final demands also embody more than 70% of the CO2 emissions.

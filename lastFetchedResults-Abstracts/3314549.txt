In this paper, a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based perfect secure and high capacity image steganography method is presented. This method is used for steganography of the pictorial messages in a cover image (carrier data). First, the message data and the cover image data are transformed using Haar filters based DWT, and then, the message DWT coefficients are embedded to the cover image DWT coefficients. Therefore, some DWT based different message data embedding approaches are studied. The robustness and image brightness are considered as the main criteria. Hence, the PSNR is considered as an objective criteria and the image brightness is considered as a subjective criteria for evaluation. The simulations results confirm that not only the proposed method is a high capacity image steganography method, but also using this method, the cover image data remains unchanged. Furthermore, if the message data size to be increased, after the message data extraction, there will be existing high PSNR cover image data.

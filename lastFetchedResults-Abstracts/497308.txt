The Fourth Wave of Development is a term coined to denote a period of scientific
and technological developments in which the combined powers of four newly
emerging and pioneer science and technology, namely Nano, Bio, Info and Cogno,
are acting as the driving engine for progress and cause extensive changes in all aspect
of human life. Changes whose ramifications and consequences are partially and to a
little extent have already become visible but their true extents are yet to emerge. The
present paper is a brief account of a project which was carried out at the National
Institute for Science Policy in 2008 with the objective of assessing the impact of the
four emerging and convergent sciences and technology on socio-cultural aspects of
life in Iran. It was hoped that through this project, a number of policies and
recommendations for the best ways of dealing with the convergent sciences and
technologies could be developed.

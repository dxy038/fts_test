The benefits of biomedical engineering technician (BMET) internship programs are described. Three basic objectives for internship programs are discussed. The first objective is to provide a program that will influence the growth and technical competence of the BMET technicians in the internship program. The second objective is to allow the biomedical engineering department coordinating the internship program to grow and expand its services. The third is to provide trained and competent technicians that can be used as an employment resource for the coordinating BME department and other BME departments. The objective of the internship program can be met by creating a schedule of events that are used as program goals

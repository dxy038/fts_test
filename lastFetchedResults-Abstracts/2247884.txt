Materials and Methods: In this descriptive â€“ comparative study, 57 faculty members and postgraduate students participated in virtual workshops. As a first step, 42 materials based on participants' needs assessment were prepared. These materials were put on www.farasa.net website and participants had access to them for three months. After three months, participants' viewpoints on variables were collected through questionnaire which consisted of three parts (demographic information, visual continuum of assessment of satisfaction from face to face to virtual, and 35 items to investigate the usefulness and efficacy of virtual workshops, etc.). Reliability was calculated using Cronbach's alpha (0.937). SPSS 19 was used to analyze the data.

In addition  to be able to use the educational system, the efficiency of virtual method, the designed material, interactive learning activities, learning environment, ease of use, value perception, satisfaction, usefulness, and behavioral intention of learning in a range of (38.0 to 90.0) showed a significant positive correlation.

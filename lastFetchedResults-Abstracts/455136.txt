The main objective of this study was to determine the influence of the degree of low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and the location of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) on expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells (EC). OxLDL preparations 1–4 with different degrees of oxidative modification were studied. All preparations of oxLDL, after addition to the medium, stimulated the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as determined by cell-ELISA. Concentration-dependent studies examining ICAM-1 expression by HUVEC showed that the minimal concentration of oxLDL which significantly stimulated ICAM-1 expression was 5 μg/ml, suggesting that the predicted physiological concentration of oxLDL in plasma may be not high enough to elicit a substantial increase of ICAM-1 expression in EC. In contrast, very small amounts (0.15 μg/well) of oxLDL-3 and 4, the more heavily oxidized LDL preparations, stimulated effectively ICAM-1 expression by HUVEC when located below the endothelial cell monolayer by immobilizing to type I collagen. The results suggest that the increased expression of ICAM-1 induced by accumulated oxLDL may be one of the mechanisms by which oxLDL contributes to atherogenesis.

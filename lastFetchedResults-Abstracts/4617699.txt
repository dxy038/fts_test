The results of the Phase A study of AMIR are presented. AMIR might be an Italian contribution to the international Polar Platform program for EarthÂ´s Observation. Its objective is to bring into a pre-operational or operational level all experiences previously achieved by means of microwave imaging radiometers. It should provide global daily coverage in five frequencies, dual polarization, ranging from 5 to 40 GHz, with a resolution near to 5 Km at the highest frequency. It will be based on reasonably proven technology (e.g., mechanical scanning), but all factors will be advanced to the limit of the state of the art (e.g., the antenna diameter will be of the order of 3-4meters).

This paper proposes an adaptive multi-objective bacterial swarm optimizer (AMBSO) for multi-objective problems. The proposed AMBSO method implements the search for Pareto optimal set of multi-objective optimization problems. The AMBSO has been compared with the MBFO over a test suite of five ZDT numerical benchmarks with respect to the two performance measures: Generational Distance and Diversity Measure. The simulation results show that the AMBSO is able to find a much better Pareto front solutions.

The authors discuss the local asymptotical stability problem of continuous bidirectional associative memory (BAM) and present some sufficient conditions which appear as a set of piecewise-linear inequality relations. Some sufficient conditions for a desired equilibrium to be asymptotically stable are examined. For <e1>M</e1> library vector pairs to be memorized, the conditions appear as <e1>M</e1>(<e1>N</e1>+<e1>P</e1>) linear equations and <e1>M</e1>(<e1>N </e1>+<e1>P</e1>) piecewise-linear inequalities in <e1>N</e1>+<e1>P</e1>+2<e1>NP</e1> unknowns of entries of <e1>a</e1>, <e1>b</e1>, <e1>W</e1> and <e1>V</e1>. These results have practical significance in the hardware implementation of the BAM

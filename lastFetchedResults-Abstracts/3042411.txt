A miniaturized dual-band Hilbert slot antenna is introduced. The antenna is printed on a 0.813 mm thick dielectric substrate with dielectric constant, &#949;<sub>r</sub>, of 2.2. The slot antenna is cut on the ground plane of the substrate and fed using a microstrip transmission line located on the opposite side. The proposed antenna resonates at 2.19 GHz and 3.17 GHz with bandwidths of 1.8% and 1.9%, respectively, with a return loss of 10 dB. Radiation patterns of the antenna are bidirectional. Such antennas can be ideal candidates for wireless LAN applications at 5 GHz when antenna dimensions are scaled to suit for such operation.

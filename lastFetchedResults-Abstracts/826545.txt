Water distribution network system includes multiple sources of supply and demand centers. Uncertainty in the amount of demand and supply on these systems causes many problems for decision-makers and designers. Various methods were proposed to overcome the uncertainty problem in these systems. In this study, to allocation of water in the water supply network of Zayandehrud basin, optimization with degree of conservative (degree of uncertainty) controller parameters were used. The objective function of the study was to minimize the water distribution network costs. A 15-year design and operation period (2024-2009) including two 5-year course designed to expand and create new facilities and a 10-year period of operation in the water distribution network was considered. The results showed that the total cost of development of water distribution networks in the study area is 1/31 billion dollars. Based on the findings, increased groundwater fed ponds to compensate for water shortage in the groundwater resources is recommended. In addition, Increase irrigation efficiency reduces costs related to the water distribution network of agricultural sector.

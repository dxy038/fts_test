UK offshore legislation has just been introduced that requires monitoring of pollutants from gas turbines. This has meant a marked change in culture and technology as traditionally there has been a `fuel is free´ mentality. Also emissions have rarely been measured. The remote location of offshore platforms means that unique solutions are required, especially regarding any changes in the plant that are necessary to install instrumentation. Accuracy and reliability of the instrumentation is crucial. No solutions are proposed in this paper. The objective is to review the background to the user´s requirements in light of the change in culture and the new legislation. A challenge is set to the industry to produce cost effective and accurate monitoring methods

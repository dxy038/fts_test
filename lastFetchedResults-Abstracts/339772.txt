Objective
Optimization of the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) isolation and expansion method.
Materials and Methods

Mononuclear cells (MNC) from bone marrow aspirates were obtained by both density gradient centrifugation (standard method) and gravity sedimentation. Cells were cultured in standard conditions (10% fetal calf serum and normal oxygen tension [21% O2]) and expansion results compared to those obtained with the same culture conditions to which platelet lysate (PL) preparations were added; in addition, the 21% O2 concentration was compared to a lower (5%) concentration (hypoxia) until the fourth cell passage. Time of expansion, number of cells obtained, morphology, cell surface markers, and differentiation potential were evaluated.
Results

MSC obtained by any of the different culture conditions expressed comparable immunophenotype and were able to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. When the number of MSC obtained at fourth passage was analyzed, the highest cell numbers were obtained with gravity sedimentation isolation and PL-supplemented culture and the expansion time was the shortest when cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions.
Conclusion

MSC isolation by MNC gravity sedimentation together with culture medium supplementation with 5% of PL in a hypoxic atmosphere (5% O2) significantly improved MSC yield and reduced expansion time compared to the standard accepted protocols.

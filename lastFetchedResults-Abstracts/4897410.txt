This paper presents a novel self regulating tri loop self tuned multi-Stage incremental action controller for a hybrid PV-FC-Diesel-Battery powered all-wheel drive electric vehicle using four Permanent Magnet DC (PMDC) motors, which are modeled to include existing nonlinearities in motor plus load inertia (J) and viscous friction (B). A Tri Loop dynamic error driven scheme is proposed to regulate motor current against high inrush currents and motor overloading conditions, in addition to motor speed dynamic reference tracking. The Proposed tri loop dynamic error driven self tuned controller is also used to ensure energy efficiency, control loop decoupling, stability and system efficient utilization while maintaining full speed tracking capability. The integrated scheme is fully stabilized using a novel FACTS based green filter compensators developed by First Author that ensures stabilized DC bus voltage, minimal inrush current conditions, and damped load excursions. The paper presents a novel application of Multi Objective Genetic search Algorithms MOGA optimization for online tuning is used to optimally tune the gains of the different controllers.

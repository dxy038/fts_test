We consider the problem of cross-layer resource allocation for wireless networks operating with rechargeable batteries under general arrival, channel state and recharge processes. The objective is to maximize total system utility, defined as a function of the long-term rate achieved per link, while satisfying energy and power constraints. A policy with decoupled admission control and power allocation decisions is proposed that achieves asymptotic optimality for sufficiently large battery capacity to maximum transmission power ratio (explicit bounds are provided). We present first a downlink resource allocation scenario; the analysis is then extended to multihop networks. The policy is evaluated via simulations and is seen to perform very well even in the non-asymptotic regime. This policy is particularly suitable for sensor networks, which typically satisfy the asymptotic conditions required by our methodology.

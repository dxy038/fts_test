Summary form only given. It is noted that a technical product evaluation function is different from traditional design or project functions. It is a balance between internal requirements and external events. The staff must have the analytical skills to perform testing and integration. End user requirements must be gathered and close coordination with product vendors is necessary. Sometimes the entire process must be frequently justified to upper management. Evaluation is an up-front cost that can produce benefits in terms of higher quality and lower downstream costs. Technical evaluation applies to products with diversity, complexity, and compatibility issues, cases where the selection criteria are more than just price and delivery. The evaluation function must work closely with both the procurement organization and the end users. A product evaluation function is sometimes difficult to justify to upper management. The value and objective are in problem prevention rather than in problem solving

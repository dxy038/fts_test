The objective of this paper is to examine the issue of non-admissibility of the principle
of therapeutic privilege in clinical trials. In medical treatment, doctors could decide not
to disclose information for the best interest of the patients by adopting the principle of
therapeutic privilege. This principle exempts doctors from disclosing risky information at
his discretion especially if by doing so will cause harm or trauma to patients. However, this
principle is not recognised in clinical trials. Instead, the need to obtain patientâ€™s consent by
way of informed consent has been mandatorily imposed as a way to protect the patients.
The doctor-investigator must disclose full information pertaining to the trial to the patient.
This paper is a library based collating literature review data. Qualitative methodology
and analysis were used in this paper. This paper revealed that despite the fact that the
principle of therapeutic privilege has not been recognised in clinical trials, the attitude of
patients that placed high hopes on doctor-investigator has indirectly encouraged the latter
not to disclose information by adopting this principle. This paper implies that the doctorinvestigator
practices the principle of therapeutic privilege, an act of paternalism that has
been brought into the process of consent taking in clinical trials.In conclusion, the Good
Clinical Practice Training Curriculum by the Ministry of Heath Malaysia is suggested to
be improvised and further enhanced.

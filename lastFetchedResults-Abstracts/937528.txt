Before World War II, the mortality pattern in the Arctic was characterized by very high mortality due to infectious diseases, in particular tuberculosis, and to injuries. Life expectancy was low and chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease were rare. Improved living conditions and health services have drastically altered health conditions since then. The circumpolar population groups are small and scattered, and the burden of pathogenic factors is high. The impact of environmental contaminants is therefore difficult to study epidemiologically. In the absence of local industrial sources of pollution, mercury and organochlorines in the traditional diet are presently the most serious environmental threats to human health in Greenland. Although we observe no effects on human health at present, the situation is potentially serious and should be closely monitored.

The objective of this study was to improve bending strength properties of three-layer woodâ€“porcelain stone composite board. The focus of this study was on the effects of orientations and weight ratios of bamboo fiber in face layer on physical and mechanical properties of the board. Three types of board with different orientation of bamboo fibers in the face layer were manufactured: one in which the fibers were oriented at random orientation (R board), another in which the fibers were oriented at unidirectional orientation (U board), and a third in which the fibers were oriented at cross orientation (C board). The physical and mechanical properties of the boards were evaluated based on the Japanese Industrial Standard for Particleboards. The main results obtained were as follows: Bending strength properties of the board were strongly affected by both orientation and weight ratio of bamboo fibers. Perpendicular specimen of C board has larger bending strength properties than U board and the value become larger with increased weight ratio of bamboo fibers. Internal bond strength value decreased with increasing weight ratio of bamboo fibers. The effect of orientation and weight ratios of bamboo fiber on thickness swelling of the board was not significant.

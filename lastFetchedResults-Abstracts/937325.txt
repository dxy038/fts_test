The interest in the association between human health and air pollution has grown substantially in recent years.
Based on epidemiological studies in several countries, there is conclusive evidence of a link between particulate air
pollution and adverse health effects. Considering that particulate matter may be the most serious pollutant in urban
areas and that pollution-related illness results in financial and non-financial welfare losses, the main objective of this
study is to assess the economic benefits of reducing particulate air pollution in Lebanese urban areas. Accordingly,
the extent and value of health benefits due to decreasing levels of particulate in the air are predicted. Health impacts
are expressed in both physical and monetary terms for saved statistical lives, and productivity due to different types
of morbidity endpoints. Finally, the study concludes with a range of policy options available to mitigate particulate air
pollution in urban areas

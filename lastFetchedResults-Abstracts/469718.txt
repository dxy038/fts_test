Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of counseling to wear seat belts during pregnancy and seat belt use among women of reproductive age.
Study design
Self-reported data from 2 population-based surveys were used to examine counseling to wear seat belts during pregnancy and seat belt use among reproductive-aged women.
Results
The prevalence of counseling to wear seat belts during pregnancy ranged from 36.7% to 56.5% across 19 states. The prevalence of seat belt use among reproductive-aged women ranged from 69.5% to 91.4% across 19 states. Younger, non-Hispanic black, and less educated pregnant women were more likely to report counseling, but reproductive-aged women with these characteristics were less likely than older, non-Hispanic white, and more educated women to use seat belts.
Conclusion
Most women are not counseled about seat belt use during pregnancy. Providers should ensure that this topic is discussed with each patient.

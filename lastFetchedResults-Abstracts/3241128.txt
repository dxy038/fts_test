Considering constraints of uncertain customersÂ´ demands and uncertain price of raw materials in different time periods of the planning horizon, a problem of multi-time period integrated planning of supply chain under uncertain environment was studied in this paper. According to characteristics of the problem, an optimal stochastic chance constraint programming model with objective of minimum costs was presented, and a real number matrix encoding and stochastic sampling constraints verifying based PSO algorithm was proposed. A numeric example is performed, and the results illustrate the feasibility and the effectiveness of proposed model and algorithm.

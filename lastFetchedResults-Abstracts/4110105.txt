In this paper, we study the joint allocation of three types of resources, namely, power, subcarriers and relay nodes, in multi-relay assisted dual-hop cooperative OFDM systems. All the relays adopt the amplify-and-forward protocol and assist the transmission from the source to destination simultaneously but on orthogonal subcarriers. The objective is to maximize the system transmission rate subject to individual power constraints on each node or a total network power constraint. We formulate such a problem as a subcarrier-pair based resource allocation that seeks the joint optimization of subcarrier pairing, subcarrier-pair-to-relay assignment, and power allocation. Using a dual approach, we solve this problem efficiently in an asymptotically optimal manner. Specifically, for the optimization problem with individual power constraints, the computational complexity is polynomial in the number of subcarriers and relay nodes, whereas the complexity of the problem with a total power constraint is polynomial in the number of subcarriers.We further propose two suboptimal algorithms for the former to trade off performance for complexity. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the average transmission rate and outage probability of the proposed algorithms. The impact of relay location is also discussed.

Water resources system is the coupling of complex living system which joint formed by nature, society, economic and technology. It has the characteristics of open, stochastic, dynamic and can show different combination relationship in space and function. As the behavior subject of development and utilization of water resources, the objective of human activities on water resources development and utilization of the structure evolution has exerted considerable influence. This paper takes Jiangsu Province as an example to analyze the total volume of water consumption and water use behavior of Jiangsu Province, then taking 2005 as the base year, simulate the water use behavior from the year 2011 to 2020 by system dynamics model, and observe the changes of water use behavior. And all in all to analyze the interaction mechanism between regional water use behavior and regional economic development.

The main objective of this paper is to examine the impact of economic growth on coefficient of cardinal welfare in Iranâ€™s economy. Hence, we employ the Bayesian approach and the estimation of forward and backward density functions in order to measure the effect of economic growth spillovers on the social welfare. The paper has applied the Gibbs sampling algorithm which is a rigorous tool for forward simulation so as the results rising from this simulation indicate that there is a positive relationship between economic growth and welfare variables in Iran. It means that the flow of economic growth has had a positive impact on the rise of welfare in the country, such that the average of Bayesian coefficient is near to 0.17 per cent for the change of welfare during the period 1985- 2011. Accordingly, it is recommended that: 1- the policy makers should follow the growth-based strategies 2- the respective officials should identify the effective variables on growth in order to increase growth rate for the economy and eventually, 3- design more efficient institutions for the poor so as they enjoy greater gaining from the growth.

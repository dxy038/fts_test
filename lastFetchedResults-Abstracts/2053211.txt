X-ray imaging microscopy with a sputtered-sliced Fresnel zone plate (SS-FZP) has been developed at an X-ray energy of 25 keV. Objects were imaged in transmission with the SS-FZP as an objective with a magnification of 10.2 times, and detected with a X-ray image sensor. The performance of the imaging microscope has been tested with a gold mesh and a resolution test pattern at an undulator beamline 47XU of SPring-8. The resolution test patterns up to 0.5 Î¼m line-and-space structures have been resolved.

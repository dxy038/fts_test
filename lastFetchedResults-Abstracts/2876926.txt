This paper presents a high payload watermarking method for audio signals to accommodate biometric based watermarks generated from iris images. The watermark generated from biometric features has a large size and hence the proposed method is capable of accommodating this high payload under perceptual transparency constraints. In this paper, watermark generated from the biometric features can be efficiently embedded in an audio signal under fixed perceptual constraints with good robustness against signal processing attacks using a QR based decomposition method. An algorithm using the QR decomposition in third level detailed coefficients of wavelet decomposition is used to achieve this objective. Experimental results indicate that the extracted biometric watermark can be identified easily even under signal processing attacks such as low pass filtering and Gaussian noise. An optimum balance to embed high payload biometric watermark data is achieved in this paper under various signal processing attacks while maintaining the perceptual transparency of audio signal.

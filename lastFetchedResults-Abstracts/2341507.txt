Objective
Although the use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) has been
evaluated globally, there are few studies in our country on this subject. The
purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence, pattern of use, parental
sources of information, and benefits of CAM in epileptic children in Tehran.
Materials & Methods
One hundred thirty-three parents or relatives of epileptic children who were
referred to outpatient clinics or admitted in neurologic ward of four major
hospitals in Tehran, were interviewed by our researcher based on a structured
questionnaire; from 2009 to 2010. The information obtained comprised the
demographic data of patients and their parents, frequency and morphology of
convulsions, the type and sources of CAM and finally, the benefits and adverse
effects of this practice.
Results
Forty-four percent of the respondents had used CAM methods either alone or in
combination with other methods. The most frequently used CAM was written
prayers followed by oral herbs and special diets. CAM was mainly introduced
to them by relatives. Only 16.7% of these parents had discussed this matter with
their childrenâ€™s physicians. No efficacy to control seizure was observed for most
of these methods.
Conclusion
This study showed that use of CAM in our study group is relatively common
and may have a potentially hazardous role in the treatment process. So, it is
necessary for physicians to have enough information about CAM practice in
their patients.

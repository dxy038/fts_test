Dead-beat, direct torque (and flux) control of an induction machine is experimentally achieved at a 10 kHz sampling frequency. The inverse solution utilized lends itself to a very insightful graphical representation. This allows for an objective experimental evaluation of voltage vector choices in the operational voltage limits. The parameter sensitivity of the control algorithm is also investigated.

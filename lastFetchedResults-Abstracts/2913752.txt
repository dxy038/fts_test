An important aspect of any scientific discipline is the objective and independent comparison of algorithms which perform common tasks. In image analysis, this problem has been much neglected. In this paper, the authors present the results and conclusions of a comparison of four Hough transform, HT, based line finding algorithms on a range of realistic images from the industrial domain

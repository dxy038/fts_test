In this paper, synchronization for multi-agent systems subject to external disturbances is studied, and the notion of H<sub>&#8734;</sub> almost synchronization&#8221; is introduced. The objective is to suppress the impact of disturbances on the synchronization error dynamics in terms of the H<sub>&#8734;</sub> norm of the corresponding closed-loop transfer function to any arbitrarily value. We focus on networks of non-identical linear, right-invertible agents under directional communication links. The key assumption is that agents are introspective; that is, they have a partial knowledge about their own states.

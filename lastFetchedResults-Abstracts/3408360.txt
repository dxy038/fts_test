Electron trap generation in the gate oxide is a severe problem for the reliability of MOS devices, since it can cause stress-induced leakage current (SILC) and eventually lead to oxide breakdown. Although much effort has recently been made to understand the mechanism for the trap generation, the properties of the generated traps have received relatively less attention. The objective of this paper is to present unambiguous results, showing that two different types of neutral electron traps can be created by the same stress and to compare the properties of these two types of traps. Differences have been found in terms of their generation kinetics, trap filling, detrapping, and refilling after detrapping. The results also indicate that the energy levels of these two types of traps are different.

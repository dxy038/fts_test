An algorithm of effectiveness evaluation decision rules is proposed based on the Variable Precision Rough Fuzzy Sets (VPRFS) theory. Fuzzy membership functions are acquired automatically by using of similarity clustering method, which transforms the continuous attribute values into the fuzzy values. With the concepts of fuzzy similarity relations and fuzzy similarity classes, lower and upper approximations expressions of VPRFS are given. Also, Ant Colony Algorithm is introduced for attribute reduction, and decision rules of effectiveness evaluation are acquired. Finally, by one instance, the algorithm is applied to decision rules acquisition of satellite navigation system combat effectiveness evaluation, and the result shows that the algorithm can find more objective and effective decision rules from the evaluation data and is a good method in applications to effectiveness evaluation decision.

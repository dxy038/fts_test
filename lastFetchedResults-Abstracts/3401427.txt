High peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) is a particular disadvantage of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems and can significantly degrade the power efficiency at the transmitter. The aim of this paper is to propose a post-inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) PAPR reduction method based on intelligent linear symbol combining with the objective to minimize the PAPR at the transmitter. Unlike the methods so far reported in the literature, the proposed method has a relatively low complexity and does not require external randomization sequences. This paper will also investigate the impact of the proposed method on the systemÂ´s bit error rate (BER) performance and provide a closed-form analytical expression that takes into account the BER dependency on the side information bits and multiblock combination. It will be shown that the proposed technique can provide significant PAPR reductions at manageable levels of signal processing requirements while the BER degradation is relatively small.

The instrument for this research is adapted and modified from the Training Transfer Model and Model for Excellence (American Society of Training and Development Competency Research). Training transfer determinants: training design (training content, training delivery and trainer´s competency) and work environment (opportunity to use) as the independent variables and goal setting as the dependent variable formed the framework for this research. Preliminary findings from a survey of 133 small business owners who attended training programs organized by government agencies showed that there is a strong correlation between training transfer determinants: training content, training delivery, trainer´s competency and opportunity to use towards goal setting of small businesswomen. The result of this research appears that training content shows strongest correlation towards goal setting. Awareness on the issues of barriers and d- terminants on training transfer can assist stakeholders (organizers and trainers) in developing more effective training programs. Results of findings will create a win-win situation for the organizers and trainers as well as to human resource personnel to maximize their return on investment and achieve their training objectives and for the trainees to be able to apply the knowledge and skills to their own businesses which will indirectly influence the success of their businesses.

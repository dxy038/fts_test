High frequency operation of fluorescent lamps is a technique with increasing use, with the objective of upgrading the quality of fluorescent lighting systems. Main objectives are: elimination of flickering and stroboscopic effect, low level of harmonic distortion, high power factor and dimming features. High-frequency fluorescent-lamp models are used for optimization studies on conception of electronic ballasts. Existing literature refers to different PSpice fluorescent-lamp models. In this paper, a systematic approach is developed to derive lamp parameters from experimental data, and simulation studies are performed for electronic ballasts supplying fluorescent lamps using MATLAB SIMULINK. A first set of studies shows an initial approach that was made to the low and high-frequency behaviour of fluorescent lamps, with similar results to the ones presented in other papers that make use of PSpice fluorescent-lamp models. A second set of studies shows the implementation of the fluorescent lamp plasma model using a MATLAB-SIMULINK environment. Results show good agreement between experimental results and results from other papers.

Supplier selection is understood as one of the key processes in strategic decision making level in Supply Chains (SC). This paper develops a comprehensive multiple products and multiple suppliers model for this process. Moreover, various targets are discussed and analyzed in the form of objectives, in addition to related constraints. Such model development is fulfilled in a real-world situation with wide ranges of uncertainties. In this paper, a fuzzy decision making model is presented. In the proposed Fuzzy Multiple Objectives Decision Making (FMODM) model, all goals, constraints, variables and coefficients are fuzzy. It is shown that with the application of the fuzzy methodology, the complex multi-objective problem is converted to a single one that can be solved and interpreted easily.

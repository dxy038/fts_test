This letter proposes a new intelligent semiconductor transformer (IST) which consists of a bidirectional ac/dc resonant converter, dc/dc converter, and dc/ac converter. This structure provides good voltage-balancing performance on the high-voltage side and a simple control method for bidirectional power flow. The proposed IST was verified though building and testing a single-phase 2 kVA (1.9 kV rms/127 V rms) prototype. A three-phase transformer can be implemented with three units of the proposed IST.

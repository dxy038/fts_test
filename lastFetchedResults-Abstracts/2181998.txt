Nephrotoxicity is the most prominent toxicological effects of ochratoxin A (OTA). We have previously shown that autophagy might be involved in OTA-induced early renal cytotoxicity, but the mechanisms of action are unknown. Since OTA is known to induce mitochondrial damage and Nix is a selective autophagy receptor for mitochondrial clearance, the objective of this study was to investigate whether Nix mediates autophagic response to OTA-induced renal cytotoxicity. Our results showed that OTA induced autophagic and mitophagic activitits. Nix shRNA HEK 293 cells were more sensitive than scrambled shRNA cells to OTA-induced cell death, and differentially affect the mRNA expression of SDHA, AIFM1, and Bad and protein expression of AIF, VDAC, SDHA and LONP1 after OTA treatment. In particular, up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic Bad and AIF after OTA treatment was prominent only in Nix shRNA cells, which might explain the higher ratio of cell death. These results might indicate that Nix plays a critical role in the cellular protection against OTA toxicity through autophagy and mitochondria.

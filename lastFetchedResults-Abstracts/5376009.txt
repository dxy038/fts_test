Electrical energy conversion is increasingly used in actual electrical systems. Also, the reduction of energy losses during energy conversion has become an important objective. Thus, the electronic switch speed has been increased and allowed to reduce losses, but the technological implantation of components induces some electromagnetic compatibility problems. This is the reason of the interest of static converter designers in electromagnetic compatibility. The study concerns the different risks of static converter malfunctioning due to its technology. Connections between energy sources (receiver and transmitter) and electronic switches (power unit and control unit) are often constituted of printed circuit traces, wires and copper bars. This connection is not perfect and its parasitic elements can disturb the static converter, even sometimes causing it to malfunction. The proposed study remains qualitative and unfolds in two ways. In the first way, malfunctioning causes are shown according to the technology. For each case, risks are evaluated and design rules outlined. In the second way, proposed rules are applied to a power static DC/DC converter, allowing improvement of the layout for better operating safety

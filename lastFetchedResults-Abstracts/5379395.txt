Tag antenna can make RFID tags be read at a distance and do not require a line of sight between tag and reader. This paper describes design and optimization aspects of antenna coil of tag for RFID system in High Frequency (HF) band. An equivalent circuit of tag is established and a new detailed design method is demonstrated. An experimental formula with high efficiency is used to calculate the inductance of the coil. It also presents a method for inductor optimization for tag antenna design which can set different objective functions and constraints for corresponding purpose in different conditions easily. Through the calculation of Matlab, the result of this method is feasible and globally convergent.

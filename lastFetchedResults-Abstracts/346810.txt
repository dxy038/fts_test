Objective: This study examined the effects of posture on the resting electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of sleep-deprived volunteers.
Methods: EEG data were collected under two conditions at 13 separate time points. Testing was performed while subjects remained in a normal seated position and then repeated while subjects stood upright.
Results: Results indicated that delta and theta activity progressively increased as a function of sleep loss, and that standing upright attenuated this effect.
Conclusions: These results suggest that an upright posture increases EEG arousal and may be useful for counteracting fatigue in sleep-deprived individuals

Hydrokinetic turbines can provide a source of electricity for remote areas located near a river or stream. The objective of this paper is to describe the design, simulation, build, and testing of a novel hydrokinetic turbine. The main components of the system are a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), a machined H-Darrieus rotor, an embedded controls system, and a cataraft. The design and construction of this device was conducted at the Oregon Institute of Technology in Wilsonville, Oregon.

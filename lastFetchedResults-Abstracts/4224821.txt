Rolls-Royce and Associates have designed plant which incorporates microprocessor based systems, including software, which control operations critical to the plants safety. It has therefore been necessary both to develop software in such a way as to ensure its correct operation, and then to further demonstrate that this objective has been achieved. From this basis a revised set of software development methods were presented. This development is now complete, and using these methods RRA have been successful in achieving high quality code generation. This work is now supporting plant operation. These methods provide the means for developing a safety critical software product which can be shown to be fit-for-purpose, and can be produced reliably to estimated cost and timescale, with minimum project risk

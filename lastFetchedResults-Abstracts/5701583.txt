This paper presents a simple yet efficient technique to reduce computations of bidirectional block-matching motion estimation. Unlike existing formulations, we reuse motion vectors obtained for P-frame to omit unnecessary motion vector calculations for bi directionally predicted B-frame. Experimental results show that such an enhancement lowers complexity of bidirectional motion estimation as much as 1/3 without visible impact on subjective picture quality.

A novel method based on HMT model by the use of Fourier Wavelet Regulation Deconvolution (ForWaRD) algorithm is presented and compared with some conventional image restoration algorithms using complex wavelets are discussed. In the suggested method, we first apply the Wiener filter on the blurring image in the Fourier domain, and next use the hidden Markov tree model (HMT) to remove the unwanted noise in wavelet domain. Simulations for solving the typical convolution and noised linear degraded model are made, in which the performances based complex wavelets and real orthogonal wavelets are detailedly compared. Results show that the suggested method using complex wavelets performs better in the view of visual effects and objective criterion than the conventional methods.

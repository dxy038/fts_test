 Background <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, the etiologic
                            agent of toxoplasmosis, is the most prevalent protozoan parasite in the
                            world. Objectives Due to high prevalence of toxoplasmosis as well
                            zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis with <i>Leishmania
                            major</i> origin in Isfahan, the main objective of this study was
                            to determine, whether there is any correlation between these two
                            protozoan infections and the intensity of the high prevalence of
                            co-infection. Methods All the case and control samples (80 individuals),
                            collected from suspected patients that had referred for a skin test to
                            the Isfahan dermatology and Leishmaniasis research center from August to
                            November 2014, were investigated. About 2 mL of venipuncture blood was
                            taken from each case and control group member, and serum was separated
                            and stored at -20Â°C until the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
                            for detection of anti-<i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> specific IgM
                            and IgG antibodies. Results Overall, 27 (33.8%) candidates in the
                            control group and 33 (41.3%) patients with Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL)
                            were positive for Toxo-IgG. All samples were found to be Toxo-IgM
                            negative. The prevalence difference of <i>Toxoplasma</i>
                            infection in healthy controls and CL patients was not significant.
                            Conclusions The results of the present study showed that the prevalence
                            difference of <i>Toxoplasma</i> infection in healthy
                            controls and CL patients was not significant. This means, there was no
                            relationship between infection with CL and toxoplasmosis, thus infection
                            with <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> wasn't a risk factor for
                            infection with Leishmaniasis; <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>
                            didn't show a preventive or inhibitory role against
                            <i>Leishmania</i> infection.

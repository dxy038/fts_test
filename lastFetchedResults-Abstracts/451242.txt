Purpoe
To evaluate the effect of moking on ocular urface.
Deign
Propective, comparative, interventional cae erie.
Method
etting: Intitutional. tudy population: ixty moker (33 men, 27 women) and 34 healthy ubject (18 men, 16 women) were enrolled into thi tudy. Patient with aociated ophthalmic or ytemic dieae, and hitory of contact len ue and ocular urgery were excluded. The duration of average moking wa 13.1 year (range 5 to 35 year). intervention:Ocular urface wa evaluated by meauring corneal and conjunctival enitivity, urface taining with fluorecein, tear film breakup time, chirmer 1 tet, and conjunctival impreion cytology. Dry eye ymptom were cored by quetionnaire. Kinetic analyi of equential tear interference image obtained by a DR-1 tear lipid layer interferometry wa ued to invetigate the precorneal lipid layer pread. Reult were compared with a control group. main outcome meaure: Comparion of ubjective complaint with objective parameter in cigarette moker and normal ubject.
Reult
In the moker group, the mean chirmer 1 tet value wa 10.8 mm (range 8 to 14 mm). The mean breakup time wa 5.3 econd (range 1 to 10 econd), the average conjunctival enitivity wa 26.2 mm (range 0 to 45 mm), and the average central corneal enitivity wa 37.6 mm (range 5 to 60 mm). There wa no tatitically ignificant difference in goblet cell denitie or in chirmer 1 tet value between moker and control (P > .05). Higher grade of lipid layer change were oberved in moker by DR-1 interferometry kinetic analyi.
Concluion
moking ha deteriorating effect on the lipid layer of precorneal tear film.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between preterm birth and 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes that encode cytokines and mediators of apoptosis and host defense.
Study design
Two hundred two white women with a spontaneous preterm birth of <35 weeks of gestation were compared with 185 white women with term births. Genotyping was performed with polymerase chain reaction and sequence specific primers. Multivariable analyses included demographic and genetic variables.
Results
Alcohol (multivariable odds ratio, 2.3; P = .001] and substance use (multivariable odds ratio, 3.7; P = .01) were associated with preterm birth at <35 weeks of gestation. Smoking (multivariable odds ratio, 2.3; P = .03), haplotypes IL10 −1082A/−819T/−592A (multivariable odds ratio, 2.1; P = .04), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)+488A/−238G/−308G (multivariable odds ratio, 2.4; P = .04), and IL4 −509C/C (multivariable odds ratio, 3.4; P = .02), and the presence of MBL2 codon 54Asp (multivariable odds ratio, 2.3; P = .02) were associated independently with preterm birth at <29 weeks of gestation. Homozygosity for IL10 −1082G/−819C/−592C haplotype (multivariable odds ratio, 1.9; P = .02) was more common in women with preterm premature rupture of membranes.
Conclusion
Polymorphisms in immunoregulatory genes may influence susceptibility to preterm birth or premature rupture of membranes.

The objective of this research was to develop a method for segmenting rice seedlings from background in a multispectral image of paddy field. Multispectral images of paddy field were taken by a high resolution multispectral camera. The DVI (Difference vegetation index) image which could reduce the image noises was suitable for seedlings recognition by analyzing spectral characteristics of the objects in near infrared, red, and green wavebands. The difference vegetation index was calculated by subtracting a red image from a near infrared image and the segmentation threshold was confirmed based on fuzzy C clustering arithmetic. 212 images were acquired to do validated test and 210 images got satisfied segmentation results. The accuracy of image segmentation was above 99%.

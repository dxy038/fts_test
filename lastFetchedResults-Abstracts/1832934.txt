ABSTRACT:  One case of adenoma of appendix was diagnosed at our Pathology department, Medical College (VIMS), Bellary. Karnataka, which is an uncommon tumor and was discovered incidentally. Histologically showing, villous like structure of mucus secreting epithelium. The histologic nature and literature is reviewed here.
Background : Neoplasms of appendix accounts for 0,5%. Most appendiceal adenomas are incidental findings and the macroscopic appearance of appendix may be normal. A cystadenoma is a dilated mucus filled appendix, lined by adenomatous mucosa. Appendiceal adenomas are uncommon.
Objective: To know the histogenesis of the lesion, as it may progress to adenocarcinoma.
Method : An appendecetomy specimen was received at our Pathology department, Medical College (VIMS), Bellary. Grossly the appendix was edematous and cut section showed lumen with mucus. Multiple sections were cut and stained.
Results : Histologically, showed thickened mucosa, which was replaced by villi, lined by mucus secreting cells and pools of mucin in the luminal part.
Conclusion: It is rare tumor of appendix, also it is associated with tumors of other sites, hence a through search for other neoplasms should be made. Also 20% of these cases are prone for colonic cancer and hence to be investigated clinically and histologically.

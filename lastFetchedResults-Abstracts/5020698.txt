In this paper, a new formulation for real-time capacitor control in unbalanced distribution systems is developed. This method employs the exact three-phase unbalanced model, rectangular-form voltages and current injection transformations. By the transformations, a linearized sensitivity relationship between the incremental control variables and the state variables is developed, and then the sensitivity-based objective function and network constraints can be obtained. The linear formulation can be solved by the commonly used linear programming technique. The proposed method is tested on the unbalanced distribution system to verify its validity. Test results show that the proposed method has great potential for real-time operation

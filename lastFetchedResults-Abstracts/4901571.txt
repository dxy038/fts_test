A simplified protocol and associated metrics based on Signal Detection Theory (SDT) for subjective Video Quality Assessment (VQA) is proposed with the aim of filling the gap existing between the lack of discrimination abilities of objective Quality Estimates (specially when perceptually motivated processing methods are involved) and the costly normative subjective quality tests. The proposed protocol employs a reduced number of assessors and provides a quality ranking of the methods being evaluated. It is intended for providing the rapid experimental turn around necessary for developing algorithms. We have validated our proposal by corroborating with our test a well-known result for the video coding community: the quality benefits of including an in-loop deblocking filter. A software interface to design and administrate the test is also made publicly available.

It has long been known that zinc is an important trace element which has a major role in a number of biochemical reactions and systems in human body. The significance of zinc on the course and outcome of pregnancy has been studied in many countries. The objective of the present study was to determine the status of serum zinc in pregnant Iranian women in the third trimester and compare these findings to healthy controls in an effort to find out first if expectant Iranian mothers are zinc deficient and if this deficiency has a detrimental effect on the outcome of pregnancy. Our study group comprised 100 pregnant women all in the third trimester of pregnancy. Blood samples were taken from both study and control groups and assayed for serum levels of Zn, albumin, alkaline phosphatase and hemoglobin. The results showed significantly lower levels of zinc(P<0.0001) and albumin(P<0.0001). A significant correlation was also found between serum zinc level of mother and weight of neonate(P<0.0001). The correlation between the fall in serum albumin with that of serum zinc in this study supported low serum zinc in late pregnancy. These findings indicate deficient level of zinc in the latter third of pregnancy which suggest a tendency for insufficient maternal nutrition. However, it is premature to recommend a reinforcement of routine zinc supplementation for healthy mothers.

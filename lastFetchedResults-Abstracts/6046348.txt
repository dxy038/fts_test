The objective of this paper is to propose an approach to decentralized stabilization with sampled-data delayed feedback for a class od networked continuous-time complex systems. Such a class is composed of identical nominal subsystems, symmetric nominal interconnections, and nonlinear perturbations. The proposed method employs the structural properties of the system to construct a low order control design model and the convex optimization approach. The effect of data-packet dropout and communication delays between the plant and the controller is included in the controller design. It is shown how this methodology can lead to a reduced-order control design with time-varying delay in the input. For such a purpose, a delay-dependent approach is considered in order to obtain a robustly delay-dependent stable overall closed-loop system with a decentralized controller.

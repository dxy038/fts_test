Multimode reconfigurable terminals can route through or receive traffic stream from co-operating heterogeneous systems, simultaneously or individually, according to the restrictions and advantages of each system, e.g., wireless wide area network (WWAN) supports wide coverage but with limited data rate. In contrast, wireless local area network (WLAN) provides high bandwidth but only in "hot spot" areas. The objective of this paper is to propose a joint admission control and scheduling scheme based on fairness, available bandwidth and user mobility characteristics in the context of cdma-2000 and IEEE 802.11 wireless technologies. The aim is to provide, at a minimum, the basic data service for all admitted calls routed through any of the co-existing radio technologies. Vertical channel sharing approach is also included in the scheme. The analytic and simulation results show that new call blocking probability is reduced with the proposed scheme. The results also show that a considerable number of active users use the two radio interfaces at the same time, thus improving the communication quality

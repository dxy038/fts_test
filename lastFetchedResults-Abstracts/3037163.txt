The final objective of the authors is to realize mobile robot navigation in walkway of outdoor environment. The path along the walkway which is measured correctly together with landmarks must be given in the framework in this paper. The robot identifies its position by means of odometry, DGPS and laser range finder (LRF) during the motion along the path. This work contributes to the map building of landmarks along the walkway. To make the map, RTK-GPS, odometry and LRF are used for the sensory devices and Kalman smoothing technique is also incorporated to interpolate trajectory of the scanning LRF equipment between the two point that RTK-GPS measurement took place. The scanning by LRF is performed to acquire the 3-D shape of objects along the walkway. The trajectory presumed properly and well organized shapes of the objects are reconstructed.

The general objective of the present work was to perform numerical tests for the inverse analysis of various plastometric tests. Uniaxial compression, plane strain compression and ring compression were investigated for different materials. The experimental results, in the form of load vs. displacement measurements carried out in two laboratories for various sample dimensions, were used as input for inverse calculations. As a result, a large number of data was obtained and the comparison of flow stress values determined in various tests and in various laboratories was possible. The capabilities of the inverse analysis as well as the influence of the method of testing on the material properties were examined. It is shown, in general, that when the inverse analysis is applied to the interpretation of the plastometric tests, the properties of the material are insensitive to the method of testing and to the sample dimensions.

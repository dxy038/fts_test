This paper proposes a dispatching rule that guarantees a predetermined minimum quality level for nonidentical
parallel machines with multiple product types. Manufacturers are focusing on improving the
overall quality of their products, as the demand for top quality products is increasing. Such changes
increase the possibility of neglecting another crucial factor in manufacturing schedules, namely due date.
Traditionally, jobs are dispatched with the focus on meeting due dates. That is, jobs are assigned to
machines without consideration of product quality. This approach opens the possibility of manufacturing
poor quality products. Realizing the shortcomings of the existing dispatching rules, manufacturers are
tempted to dispatch jobs with the objective of maximizing product quality. With such an attempt, jobs
are likely to be assigned to high performance machines only. In turn, waiting times will increase and
job delays are inevitable. This research proposes a dispatching rule that satisfies both criteria, reducing
due date delays, while ensuring a predefined product quality level. A quality index is introduced to standardize
various product qualities. The index is used to ensure a predetermined quality level, whilst minimizing
product delays. Simulations compare various dispatch methods, evaluating them based on mean
tardiness and product quality.

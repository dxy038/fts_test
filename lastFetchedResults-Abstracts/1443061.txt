Effects of type and time of electrical stimulation on the calpain system, sensory and objective meat quality in the M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum from 38 pasture-fed carcasses, were investigated under conventional chilling conditions. High voltage stimulation was applied to whole carcasses at 3 min post-mortem (pm) and to sides at either 40 or 60 min pm, whilst low voltage stimulation was applied to whole carcasses at 3 min pm and to sides at 40 min pm. Unstimulated sides served as controls. The levels of extractable μ-calpain and calpastatin decreased during stimulation by 28–44% and 8–17%, respectively. Shear force and adjusted tenderness score showed that stimulation at 3 min, irrespective of type of stimulation, resulted in significantly tougher meat (P&lt;0.05) which was associated with an rapid rate of pH decline, compared to stimulation at 40 min. Higher calpastatin levels soon after stimulation at 3 min (P &lt; 0.05) and lower μ-calpain level at 24 h pm for high voltage stimulation at 3 min (P&lt;0.05) coincided with the tougher meat. On the other hand, high voltage stimulation at 40 and 60 min resulted in similar tenderness and levels of μ-calpain and calpastatin post-stimulation and 24 h pm. Significantly tougher meat from the control sides, with a higher μ-calpain levels at 24 h pm and similar sarcomere length, compared to those from low voltage stimulation at 40 min (P&lt;0.001), appeared to be linked to the later activation of the calpain system. Results from the current study suggest that early application of stimulation may be associated with a very rapid decline in pH and consequently a reduction in meat quality.

Background[G1]; and Objective: Posterolateral hip musculature weakness and impaired knee joint proprioception can be seen in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). The aim of this study was to investigate core muscle strength and dynamic balance in such patients and to compare them with healthy individuals.

Materials and Methods: Thirtytwo individuals (Mean &± SD: Age 25.3&±3.9 yrs.; Height 178.6&±8.7 cm; Weight 82.4&±8.9 kg); including 16 patients with PFPS and 16 healthy persons entered in our study. Bent knee lowering test and Y balance test were utilized to evaluate core muscle strength and dynamic balance. To analyze the data, Independent Samples t Test was used.

Results: The average core muscle strength was significantly higher in healthy subjects compared to the patients with PFPS (P&lt;0.01); however, despite the better dynamic balance scores in anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral directions in healthy individuals compared to the patients, this difference was not significant (P&gt;0.05).

Conclusion: Compared to healthy controls, core muscle strength was weakened in patients with PFPS. There was no difference in dynamic balance between such patients and healthy individuals.

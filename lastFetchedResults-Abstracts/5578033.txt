Compressed-domain automatic speaker recognition is based on the analysis of the compressed parameters of speech coders. The objective is to perform low-complexity on-line speaker recognition for VoIP in the compressed domain, without the need to decode or resynthesize the speech bitstream. In this paper, we present initial results in determining the recognition accuracy that can be achieved with five widely used speech coding standards. Experiments with a database of 14 speakers obtain a recognition ratio close to 100% after the analysis of 30 seconds of active speech for most of the considered speech coders and rates. In particular, the results show that performance does not strictly depend on coding rate or codec speech quality

Recently the transmission of the multimedia data under Internet environment has been widely used in many applications. However, the video data is very sensitive to the transmission error caused by packet lost. This induces decoded video data with error propagation and makes the video quality very poor. In this paper we proposed a low complexity error concealment algorithm using progressive interpolation and boundary matching for object-based video coding. By use of the bidirectional frame as the referenced frame, error propagation in inter frame coding mode can be reduced largely. Our approach has the advantage of better video quality within a small search range and low complexity requirement.

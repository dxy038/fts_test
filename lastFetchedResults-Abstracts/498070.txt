Background and objective: Lymphadenitis is one of the presenting signs of toxoplasmosis. The aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic effects of Co -trimoxazole (CTM) on toxoplasmic lymphadenitis.

Materials and methods: Forty six patients with toxoplasmic lymphadenitis were enrolled in this controlled clinical trial study. Diagnosis was based on serological tests and histopathological examinations. Patients were divided in 2 groups. Tested group were treated by CTM (48 mg/kg/day divided in 2 doses) for 1 month. Control group were only observed for 1 month. The patients were followed up by physical and serological examination in month 1, 3 and 6.Results were analyzed in SPSS 11.5 software using chi-square test.

Results: Of the 23 patients in tested group 15(65.2%) respond to treatment whereas 5 patients of 23 (21.7%) in control group resolved without treatment. There was significant difference in therapeutic effect between 2 groups (p<0.05).There was no difference in age, sex and site of infection between 2 groups (p>0.05).

Conclusion: CTM has a good therapeutic effect on toxoplasmic lymphadenitis and may be used in selected patient who treatment is required.

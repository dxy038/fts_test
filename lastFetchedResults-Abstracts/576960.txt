Background: Regarding the increasing number of acanthamoebiasis cases in recent decades, investigating the environmental pollution of this amoeba is now a focus of more attention.  Surface stagnant water is considered as one of the important sources of human infections.
Objective: The aim of this study was isolation and molecular identification of Acanthamoeba spp in surface stagnant waters of Qazvin. 
Methods: This was a descriptive study carried out in the autumn of 2010. A total of 40 samples of surface stagnant waters from the city parks and squares in Qazvin were collected. Samples were initially filtered using 0.45Âµ nitrocellulose membrane filters and later the residual components left on filter membrane cultured on non-nutrient agar. The cultures media were microscopically examined for the presence of trophozoites and cysts of free-living amoebae. Positive cultures for amoebae were examined by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) method using specific primers for the genus of Acanthamoeba.
Findings: Free-living amoebae were identified in 32 (80%) samples by culture method. In addition, Acanthamoeba was identified by PCR method in 14 (43.8%) cases of positive cultures showing a nearly 500bp band.     
Conclusion: considering the prevalent of Acanthamoeba in surface stagnant waters of Qazvin, more attention to the potential role of such waters in transmission of infection by the regional clinicians and health practitioners is necessary.

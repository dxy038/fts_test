The spatiotemporal spectra of a movie that contains a moving object form a plane in the three-dimensional (3-D) frequency domain. This plane, which is referred to as the theoretical motion plane, reflects the velocity and calculating the slope of the moving objects. However, if the resolution of the frequency analysis method is not high enough to obtain the actual spectra from the objective signal, the spatiotemporal spectra disperse away from the theoretical motion plane. In the present paper, we propose a infinite frequency resolution method, referred to as three-dimensional (3-D) Non-harmonic analysis (NHA), which is only weakly influenced by the analysis window. In addition, we estimate the motion vectors of objects in a movie using the clustering method in conjunction with the least squares method (LSM) for the spatiotemporal spectrum of 3-D NHA.

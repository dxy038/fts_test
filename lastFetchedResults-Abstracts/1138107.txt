This paper deals with the multi-objective path placement optimization for Parallel Kinematics Machines (PKMs) based on energy consumption, actuator torques and shaking forces. It aims at determining the optimal location of a given test path within the workspace of a PKM in order to minimize the electric energy used by the actuators, their maximal torque and the shaking forces subject to the kinematic, dynamic and geometric constraints. The proposed methodology is applied to the Orthoglide, a three-degree-of-freedom translational PKM, as an illustrative example.

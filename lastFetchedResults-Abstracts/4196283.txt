The main objective involved with this paper consists of presenting the results obtained from the application of technical strategies for high-impedance fault practical experiments in power distribution systems for automation purposes. Such results can also be used to valid several methodologies employed in automatic identification and classification processes of faults in distribution lines, which can still contribute to increase both reliability and safety when practical experiments are necessary. The compilations of the results obtained from the application of these strategies are presented for validation purposes.

In the current paper, we suggest a new no-reference (NR) objective video quality assessment model. The proposed method can provide continuous quality values at a rate of two scores per second, according to data obtained from subjective assessment tests under the Single Stimulus Continuous Quality Evaluation (SSCQE) method. Moreover, the proposed method is based on a frame quality measure due to the fact that digital video consists of the time series of frame (still) images. Because the frame quality measure alone is not sufficient for an objective video quality assessment, it is necessary to adjust the frame quality value to the information from contents and motion respectively, such as Spatial Infornation (SI) and Temporal Infornation (TI). Our experiments using MPEG-2 coded video sequences indicate that the objective assessment scores obtained by the proposed method are in concordance with the subjective assessment scores.

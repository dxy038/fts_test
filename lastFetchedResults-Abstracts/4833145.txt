In this paper we propose a model for multichannel audio recordings that can be utilized for revealing the underlying interchannel similarities. This is important for achieving low bitrates for multichannel audio and is especially suitable for applications when there is a large number of microphone signals to be transmitted (such as remote mixing or distributed musicians collaboration). Using this model, we can encode a multichannel audio signal using only one full audio channel and some side information in the order of few KBits/sec per channel, which can be used to decode the multiple channels at the receiving end. We apply objective and subjective measures in order to evaluate the performance of our method.

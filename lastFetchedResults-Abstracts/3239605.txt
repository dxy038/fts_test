One of the core issues for robust cryptographic systems is to deal with the rate of diffusion and distribution of keys. We try to strengthen this aspect by increasing the length of block ciphers. We present a new encryption and decryption algorithm for block cipher that supports 27 bit block size. All components in our system are chosen to be based on cellular automata so as to achieve higher parallelism and to simplify the in hardware and software implementation for applications with high degree of security. The main objective of this paper is to increase the complexity by novel schemes of mixing (reversible cellular automata) RCA and (non-uniform reversible cellular automata) NRCA. We apply set of different bit permutation methods for this purpose .This paper establishes the proof for existence of yet another approach for a high quality pseudorandom bit sequences generated by non uniform cellular automata.

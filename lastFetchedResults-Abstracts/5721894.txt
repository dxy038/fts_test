Optical networks are crucial to support increasingly demanding cloud services. Delivering the requested quality of service is key to successfully provisioning end-to-end services in clouds. Therefore, as for traditional optical network services, it is of utter importance to guarantee that clouds are resilient to any failure of either network infrastructure or data centers. A crucial concept in establishing cloud services is that of network virtualization: the physical infrastructure is logically partitioned in separate virtual networks. Also, combined control of the network and data center (IT) resources is exploited. To guarantee end-to-end resilience for cloud services in such a set-up, we need to simultaneously route the services and map the virtual network, while ensuring that an alternate routing is always available. Note that the anycast routing concept applies: assigning server resources requested by the customer to a particular (physical) data center can be done transparently. This paper investigates the design of scalable optimization models to perform the virtual network mapping resiliently (for single bidirectional link failures), thus supporting resilient anycast cloud virtual networks. We compare two resilience approaches: PIP-resilience maps each virtual link to two alternate physical routes, VNO-resilience provides alternate paths in the virtual topology (while enforcing physical link disjointness).

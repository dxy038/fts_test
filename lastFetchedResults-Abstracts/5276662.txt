In this work, the sequential code developed is effectively parallelized using the MPI. All objects are 2D perfect electric conductors (PEC) immersed in air. The illuminating waves are transverse magnetic (TM) plane waves where the electric field is parallel to the axes of the cylinders. The objective is to retrieve the number of scattering objects, their shapes and locations in few minutes versus hours using the full-band level set method . All parallelization results are implemented and tested on the San Diego Super Computer Center (SDSC) facilities.

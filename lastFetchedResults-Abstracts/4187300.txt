Image matching plays an important role in many fields, such as pattern searching and recognizing. The majority of the present image matching algorithms are the betterment ones which based on template matching. This thesis aims at the improvement of matching strategy which based on image feature point (FP), by searching correct feature point, and setting bidirectional threshold value, we can quickly and precisely implement the matching process with optimistic result

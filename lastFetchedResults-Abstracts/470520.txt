Objective
The objective of the study was to determine the incidence, origin, and character of cerebral lesions in monochorionic twins with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome treated with fetoscopic laser surgery.
Study design
This was a prospective study of monochorionic twins with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome treated with fetoscopic laser surgery and monochorionic twins without twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome delivered at our center between June 2002 and September 2005, using cranial ultrasonography.
Results
Incidence of antenatally acquired severe cerebral lesions in the twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome group was 10% (8/84) and 2% (2/108) in the non–twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome group (P = .02). Incidence of severe cerebral lesions at discharge was 14% (12/84) in the twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome group and 6% (6/108) in the non–twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome group (P = .04). Antenatal injury was responsible for severe cerebral lesions in 67% (8/12) of the twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome group.
Conclusion
Incidence of severe cerebral lesions in twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome treated with fetoscopic laser surgery is high and results mainly from antenatal injury.

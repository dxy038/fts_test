Background and Objective: Attentional focus has a significant impact on performance and the learning of many motor skills, including balance skills. Recently, use of mental imagery as a tool for promoting cognitive performance of patients with nerve damage has been proposed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Attentional Focus Imagery on dynamic balance (maintaining stability while a specific motion is being executed) in patients with multiple sclerosis.

Materials and Methods:; The participants in the study were 40 multiple sclerosis patients with a score of 03 in the Expanded Disability Status Scale. To assess dynamic balance the test used was &amp;quot;Timed Up and Go&amp;quot;. The training period duration was 6 weeks. The average number of attempts were recorded for each subject in pretest, acquisition and retention stages. After the pretest, the participants were randomly divided into 4 groups. An Internal attentional focus imagery group, an external attentional focus imagery group, a traditional imagery group and a control group.

Results: The results showed that during the acquisition phase, the external attentional focus groups results were better compared to the traditional imagery and control groups. Also in the pursuit test, the external attentional focus group performed better than the internal attentional focus, traditional imagery and control groups.

Conclusion: According to the results of the present study, it seems external attentional focus imagery is a practical and effective method for improving dynamic balance control in multiple sclerosis patients and can be used in order to improve balance control and motor skills in multiple sclerosis patients.;

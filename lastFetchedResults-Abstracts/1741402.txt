The properties of vortex tubes are extracted and analyzed from a DNS database at various R e λ , with the objective to characterize the associated distributions of induced velocity and kinetic energy dissipation. The induced velocity exhibits an inverse power-law scaling in the far field, different from Burgers’ r − 1 scaling, supporting the interpretation that tubes are the remnants of vortex sheets after roll-up, and suggesting a possible link with the Kolmogorov k − 5 / 3 spectral scaling. The energy dissipation signature is characterized by a local maximum near the edge of the vortex core, and an absolute peak at its center, which can be tentatively explained appealing to the occurrence of a bi-axial configuration of the strain-rate tensor.

Background: Addiction influences on health due to its progressive nature in all aspects of life and affects psychological, physical, social, emotional, spiritual and cognitive health.
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the association of personality characteristics and family functioning with mental health in addicts. 
Methods: This correlational study was conducted on 94 male addicts that were selected by convenience sampling method from camps and addiction treatment centers in Ardabil during 2012. The measurement tools were the five-factor Personality Inventory (NEO), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and the family assessment device (FAD). Data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and stepwise multiple regression analysis. 
Findings: There were significant associations between 5 personality characteristics and most dimensions of family functioning and between mental health and all dimensions of family functioning. Stepwise regression analysis showed that agreeableness and neuroticism factors could predict family functioning in addicts. High neuroticism score was related to low family functioning and high agreeableness was related to better family functioning. These two variables explained 14% of the changes in family functioning. Total family functioning and communication factor could predict mental health in addicts. These two variables explained 22% of the changes in mental health. 
Conclusion: With regards to the results, members of the treatment team can facilitate prevention, treatment and rehabilitation programs in addicts by identifying common characteristics, personality traits, supportive systems and mental health and quality of life promotion systems for addicts.

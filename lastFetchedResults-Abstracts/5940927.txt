This paper proposes a novel feedrate interpolation strategy depending on the error feedback information. The proposed strategy incorporates the real-time non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) algorithm and is applied in a biaxial contouring stage system. The objective of the strategy is to improve the contouring accuracy to cope with the high-precision standard nowadays. The proposed method does achieve the control purpose that if the detected contouring performance is beyond a given specified value, then the feedrate controller will vary the actual feedrate to provide better contouring accuracy. By real-time adjusting the feedrate depending on the error feedback, contouring error will not accumulate such that the precision can be improved. Many experiments are conducted and the results do show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

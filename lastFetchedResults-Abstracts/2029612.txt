The objective of the present review was to present the current knowledge on nitrogen (N) rhizodeposition, including techniques for 15N labelling of agricultural plants, amounts of N rhizodeposition and its fate in soil. Rhizodeposition is the process of release of organic and inorganic compounds from living plant roots. It is often quantified in terms of carbon (C) and less often as N derived from rhizodeposition (NdfR). Rhizodeposition of N can be estimated by labelling plants with 15N and following its fate in soil. Most methods used for labelling plants with 15N can only be applied after appearance of the first leaf and only allow pulse or multiple pulse labelling. Only the split-root technique and the application of gaseous 15N allow continuous labelling. All methods available at present have their flaccidities mostly due to the fact that the application of N is not following its physiological pathway of assimilation or by using artificial conditions. In the studies reviewed, amounts of N rhizodeposits ranged from 4% to 71% of total assimilated plant N. In legumes the median was 16% and in cereals it was 14%. Rhizodeposits were 15â€“96% of the below-ground plant biomass (BGP). In legumes the median was 73% and in cereal it was 57%. The high variability of these results shows the need for more investigations on N rhizodeposition looking especially on the factors influencing the amounts released in different plant species under field conditions.

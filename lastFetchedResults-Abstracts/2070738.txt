Objective: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a multi-factorial and heterogenic disease
with atherosclerosis plaques formation in internal wall of coronary artery. Plaque formation
results to limitation of the blood reaching to myocardium leading to appearance
of some problems, such as ischemia, sudden thrombosis veins and myocardial
infarction (MI). Several environmental and genetic factors are involved in prevalence
and incident of CAD as follows: hypertension, high low density lipoprotein-cholesterol
(LDL-C), age, diabetes mellitus, family history of early-onset heart disease and smoking.
According to genome wide association studies (GWAS), five polymorphisms in the
9p21 locus seem to be associated with the CAD. We aimed to evaluate the remarkable
association of two polymorphisms at 9p21 locus, rs1333049 and rs10757274,
with CAD.
Materials and Methods: This experimental study was conducted in Golestan, Aria Hospitals
and Genetics Lab of Shahid Chamran University in the city of Ahvaz, Iran, in 2010-
2011. The collected blood samples belonging to 170 CAD patients (case group) and 100
healthy individuals (control group) were analyzed by tetra-primer amplification refractory
mutation system (ARMS)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The results were
analyzed using software package used for statistical analysis (SPSS; SPSS Inc., USA)
version 16. A value of p < 0.05 and an odd ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)
were considered significant.
Results: The frequencies of CC, CG and GG genotypes for rs1333049 polymorphism
in patients were 18.2, 65.3 and 16.5%, while in controls, the related values were 25,
67 and 8%, respectively. GG genotypes of rs1333049 polymorphism in CAD patients
were more than control cases (OR: 0.354, 95%CI: 0.138-0.912, p=0.032). The frequencies
of AA, AG and GG genotypes for rs10757274 in CAD patients were 8.2, 58.3
and 33.5%, while in controls, the related values were 35, 63 and 2%, respectively. GG
Genotype in rs10757274 polymorphism in CAD patients was found more than control
cases (OR: 0.014, 95% CI: 0.003 -0.065, p=0.0001).
Conclusion: The rs1333049 polymorphism at 9p21 locus shows a weak association with
CAD, whereas rs10757274 polymorphism reveals a significant association with CAD.
These variants may help the identification of patients with increased risk for coronary
artery disease.

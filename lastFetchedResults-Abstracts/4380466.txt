A wide range of Bayesian short-time spectral amplitude (STSA) speech enhancement algorithms exist, varying in both the statistical model used for speech and the cost functions considered. Current algorithms of this class consistently assume that the distribution of clean speech short time Fourier transform (STFT) samples are either randomly distributed with zero mean or deterministic. No single distribution function has been considered that captures both deterministic and random signal components. In this paper a Bayesian STSA algorithm is proposed under a stochastic-deterministic (SD) speech model that makes provision for the inclusion of a priori information by considering a non-zero mean. Analytical expressions are derived for the speech STFT magnitude in the MMSE sense, and phase in the maximum-likelihood sense. Furthermore, a practical method of estimating the a priori SD speech model parameters is described based on explicit consideration of harmonically related sinusoidal components in each STFT frame, and variations in both the magnitude and phase of these components between successive STFT frames. Objective tests using the PESQ measure indicate that the proposed algorithm results in superior speech quality when compared to several other speech enhancement algorithms. In particular it is clear that the proposed algorithm has an improved capability to retain low amplitude voiced speech components in low SNR conditions.

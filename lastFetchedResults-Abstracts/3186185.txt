It is indisputable, that Information and communication technologies (ICT) have influenced all areas of our lives. In recent years, to the universities come the students from a generation of &#8220;digital natives&#8221;, who surpass their teachers in the knowledge of ICT in many ways. The main objective of any education institution is to provide that kind and quality of study that could prepare the best graduates for the work market. These institutions (including universities) have to face many important changes - stay competitive in providing the study by implementation the newest information for the students by ICT supported and more eye-catching ways. Trends in education indicate ongoing changes of learning styles to learner-centred education, which currently means for the teacher a change not only in the traditional methods of teaching, but also the usage of new technologies to increasing student involvement in the learning process. This process of transformation is very intensive and covers several areas of teachers´ life. Within the proposed paper there will be shortly described the fundamental aspects of this transformation process and demands on today´s teacher as well as activities that were already done and currently underway at our faculty to support our teachers.

This paper describes an ad hoc networking scheme and routing protocol for emergency communications. The objective of the network is to collect damage assessment information quickly and stably in a disaster. The network is configured with a hybrid wireless network, combining ad hoc networks and a cellular network to maintain connectivity between a base station (BS) and nodes even in a disaster. In the event that a direct link between the BS and a node is disconnected due to damage or obstacles, the node switches to the ad hoc mode, and accesses the BS via neighboring nodes by multihopping. The routing protocol proposed in this paper discovers and builds a route by way of monitoring neighborsâ€™ communications instead of broadcasting a route request packet. The network employs a dedicated medium access control protocol based on TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) for multihopping in ad hoc networks to maintain accessibility and to perform a short delay. Experiments showed that approximately 90% of nodes are capable of reaching the BS within a few hops, even in conditions where only 20% of nodes maintain direct connections to the BS. In addition, the results showed that it is feasible for the network to operate in a short delay for delivering a packet to the BS. However, throughput is not retrieved sufficiently due to the restriction of the access protocol, whereas reachability does improve sufficiently. Therefore, the network is suitable for collecting damage assessment information and transmitting urgent traffic quickly and stably, while the data is restricted to a small amount.

In real world machine vision problems, issues such as noise and variable scene illumination make edge and object detection difficult. There exists no universal edge detection method which works under all conditions. In this paper, we propose a logarithmic edge detection method. This achieves a higher level of scene illumination and noise independence. We present experimental results for this method, and compare results of the algorithm against several leading edge detection methods, such as Sobel and Canny. For an objective basis of comparison, we use PrattÂ´s Figure of Merit. We further demonstrate the application of the algorithm in conjunction with Edge Detection based Image Enhancement (EDIE), showing that the use of this edge detection algorithm results in better image enhancement, as quantified by the Logarithmic AME measure.

India lacks proper health-care delivery solutions to serve its huge population. Major objective of this paper is to propose technical solution for enabling people, communities, health-care organizations to collect and transmit health information as and when required. An integrated infrastructure based on advanced technologies like Sensor Networks and Grid Computing can be built for improved health-care services for the rural and urban India. An architecture of Sensor-Grid infrastructure is presented in this paper to deliver health-care services efficiently.

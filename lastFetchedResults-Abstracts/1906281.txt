The appropriate and ontime maintenance play significant role in reducing costs and increasing the market share of an industrial unit. The main purpose of the preventive maintenance is avoiding any damage to machinery and the preservation of it at a permanent ideal level. The previous studies and researches have widely dealt with the issue of preventive maintenance scheduling. They compute the time and the type of preventive maintenance by modeling the total cost related to maintenance today, the engineering insurance is a strong support for the reduction of risks related to the industrial machinery. This kind of insurance covers a part of the costs of the machinery maintenance. However, the previous studies have not considered the effect of the engineering insurance on calculating the optimum time of the preventive maintenance. While this kind of insurance affects the cost function of maintenance. The present article is addressing the calculating of the optimum time of the preventive maintenance along with considering the overall cost function and the reliability of the total system which include the effects of engineering insurance, , as well as because of uncertainty in the input parameters robust design approaches is used. To solve this multi objective problem, first we transform them to a single objective using global criterion and solve it with help of multi objective simulated annealing algorithm. The results and findings indicate the significant effect of the engineering insurance on the time scheduling of the preventive maintenance. Accordingly, the lack of attention to the engineering insurance could lead to an inefficient and non-optimal time scheduling of preventive maintenance as well as increase in the costs of the system.

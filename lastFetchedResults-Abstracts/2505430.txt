The main objective of this study was to investigate the
effect of forest road construction on the Soil Organic
Carbon Stock (SOCS) in Ziarat Catchment. Therefore, soil
samples were collected from five land use types including
road construction, cultivated area, channel bank, pasture and
forest land and soil organic carbon concentration and bulk
density were measured in the samples and SOCS were calculated.
The results showed that the forest road construction reduce
SOCS. SOC stock was greatest in the forest land use and the
total SOC stock under different land uses varied in order
forest, pasture, cultivate, channel bank and road construction
with 143, 136, 128, 36 and 29 Mg ha?1, respectively (p < 
0.001). Therefore, these results can be useful as a scientific
basis for selecting the proper soil erosion control methods as a
simple and low-cost approach to mitigate the SOC loss.

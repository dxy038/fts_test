Background and objectives: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most leading causes of death among cancers. The therapeutic methods of RCC are surgery, immunotherapy, chemotherapy and biologic response modulators. Medicinal plants such as Nigella sativa (N. sativa) also are used for the treatment of cancer. Therefore, in this study the effect of aqueous fraction of N. sativa was investigated on percentage of live cells in the human renal carcinoma cell line (ACHN) and normal human renal epithelial cells (GP-293).
Materials and Methods: Aqueous fraction of N. sativa obtained from %70 hydro-alcoholic extract after discarded of n-Hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, N-butanol fractions. In this study two cell lines including carcinoma cell line ACHN and normal cell line GP-293 were used. Cells were seeded in 96 well plates and were treated with various concentrations of aqueous fraction and cell viability was calculated with MTT after 24, 48 and 72 hours. Results are presented as Mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS. One-way ANOVA test was applied for the statistical analysis of the data.
Results: our results showed aqueous fractions of N.sativa didn’t significant effect on percentage of live GP-293 cells in certain dose and time but its effect on percentage of live ACHN cells is significantly higher than control group and GP-293 cell line in dose and time-dependent manner.
Conclusion: It was concluded that the aqueous fraction of N.sativa has cytotoxic effects on ACHN cell line but didn’t has any significant effect on GP-293 cell line.

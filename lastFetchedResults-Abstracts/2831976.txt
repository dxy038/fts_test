The rateless codes is a forward error correction technology. Because it has arbitrary probability approaching Shannon limit and rateless characters, so it can be able to adapt to the variety of deep space communication features. This paper studied the rateless codes based file transfer protocols of the file transmission delays and investigate its capacity based ACK scheme in deep space communication. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate through experimental results that the existing TCP and CFDP protocols are far from satisfying deep space communication requirements, and the performance of rateless codes based file transfer protocols has obviously advantages in the aspects of reducing the transfer time and proposed a improvement to increasing the link capacity in the stationary erasure channel.

What is currently raised as a new approach in the management of plant diseases is developing and formulation of plant base fungicides. Melia azedarach is a small to medium deciduous tree, an attractive ornamental and shade tree with a high lateral branching. Melia azedarach (Meliaceae) is widely distributed in northern area of Iran. The objective of present study is to evaluate the Antifungal effects of methanol extract of chinaberry (M. azedarach) against strains of Trichoderma spp, Sclerotium spp, Geotrichum spp, Fusarium oxysporum, and Rhizoctonia solani. The antifungal activity of methanol extract Based on the growth inhibitory zone in the manner of disc diffusion assay was evaluated. Results of testing for antifungal effects were quite positive. Among them, Organs of the flower had the greatest impact in creating inhibitor zone; also in most cases the highest concentration has the greatest influence in forming inhibitor zone. Generally in a zone of inhibition, the effects of three concentrations are different, that the best concentration is 200, 150 and 75 mg per liter, respectively.

The objective of this work is to analyze the effects of decrease
in water subsidies (increase in the price of the water) on
various economic sectors in order to promote the conservation
of this resource based on the actual price of water. But over the
past decades, various subsidizing methods hold the cost of water
down. On the other hand, the indiscriminate use of these
resources led the government to impose enormous costs. Determining
the economic impact of subsidy reform can be an
essential factor in the determination of water price reform
scenarios. The methodology that will be used to explore the implications
on the economy will be a computable general
equilibrium model (CGE), previously designed for an analysis
of the direct taxes of the Andalusian economy (Cardenete and
Sancho, 2003), but now enhanced and extended to include emissions
of pollutants and the introduction of environmental taxes
(Andr√©, Cardenete and Vel?zquez, 2005). This model has been
further modified to introduce the variations in the water price
that this study investigates the effect of water subsidy reform on
the economy based on six scenarios using computable general
equilibrium model. Results show that by decreasing subsidies,
GDP will reduce in all economic sectors. Government can
prevent the decrease in production by redistributing incomes.

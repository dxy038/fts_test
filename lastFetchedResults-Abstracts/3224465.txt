Ad-hoc networks are becoming increasingly popular due to their wide range of uses. Mobile ad-hoc network have Nodes for at no cost to move and arrange them in random order. Ad-hoc networks are suitable for make use of in situation where an infrastructure would not unavailable or to deploy one is not cost effective. In ad-hoc networks MAC protocols are responsible for coordinating access from active nodes. Different MAC protocols with various objectives have been projected for wireless ad hoc networks. Almost of the wired networks based on the symmetric links, which are always unchanging. But this is not a crate with ad-hoc networks as the nodes are movable and continuously varying its position within network. maximize the network life span, is regular purpose of ad hoc network, since ad hoc network nodes are understood to be dead when they are without of battery. Another main objective is increasing the capacity of the network. However we have shown that some schemes degrade the network throughput as well as bring unfairness in the network in order to save energy and to increase the network throughput as compared to the standard protocol. The proposed methods give a very high energy saving and better throughput which increases the battery life of the ad hoc nodes making the system cost effective. Also the proposed schemes bring fairness in the pair wise network throughput.

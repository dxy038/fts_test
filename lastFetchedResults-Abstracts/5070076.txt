Silicon solar cell/EVA composite is being studied with an objective to further improve the manufacturing technology of PV modules. Sample extraction and an adhesion strength measurement process has been modified. Silicon and EVA samples were extracted from solar cells of new and field-deployed modules. Optical microscopy, SEM, and AES of samples from new modules revealed EVA islands covering most of the silicon cell surface indicating a cohesive failure. A good correlation was observed between the adhesive strength and surface concentration of carbon. A low carbon concentration which indicated less EVA clinging to cell surface always resulted in low adhesive strengths. The correlation provides a simple technique for inferring properties of EVA

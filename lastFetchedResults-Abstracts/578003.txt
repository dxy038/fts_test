Data mining is the process of discovering correlations, patterns, trends or relationships by searching through a large amount of data stored in repositories, corporate databases, and data warehouses. Industrial procedures with the help of engineers, managers, and other specialists, comprise a broad field and have many tools and techniques in their problem-solving arsenal. The purpose of this study is to improve the effectiveness of these solutions through the application of data mining. To achieve this objective, an adaptation of the engineering design process is used to develop a methodology, specifically designed for industrial proceduresâ€™ operations. This paper concludes by describing some of the advantages and disadvantages of the application of data mining techniques and tools to industrial procedures; it mentions some possible problems or issues in its implementation; and finally, it provides recommendations for future research in the application of data mining to facilitate decisions relevant to industrial procedures.

Abstract:
Background and Aim: The quality pertaining to the depth and duration of local anesthesia in the primary issue of concern in invasive dental procedure. Profound pulpal anesthesia is  necessity for successful dental procedures and failure occurs most often with the interior alveolar nerve block. Positive effects of periods combined with lidocaine has been documented in dentistry, however, no objective study has so far evaluated the effect of lidocaine with and without the effect of fentanyle. Therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the anesthetic efficacy of using fentanyle with lidocaine in depth and duration of pulpal anesthesia in human inferior alveolar nerve block with pulp tester.
Materials and Methods: This cross over double blind randomized controlled Trial consisted of 19 subjects rating from 19-29 years of age. Each subject was injected with following anesthetics in two separate sections.  A: 1.8 ml lidocaine 2% with 1: 80000 epinephrine+40 ?g fentanyl (0.8 ml)   B: 1.8  ml lidocaine 2% with 1:80000 epinephrine +0.9% saline(0.8 ml) An electric pulp tester was used to test the anesthetic depth of the first molar, canine and lateral incisor in 3 minutes with 60 minutes, interval. If a degree of 80 was consecutively detected 2 times  within 15 minutes and maintained for 60 minutes, the anesthesia was regarded successful.
Conclusion: combining fentanyl with lidocaine 2% (1:80000 epi) has no significant effect in obtaining profound pulpal anesthesia. 
Results: There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of level of pain, onset on anesthesia in the pulp and lower lip, adequacy of anesthesia in a specific tooth and duration of anesthesia (P < 0.2).

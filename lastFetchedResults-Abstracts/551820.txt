Background and Objective: Metformin is a widely used medicine for treatment of type 2 diabetes. In this study, the effect of various doses of metformin on the mouse islets of langerhans volume was investigated. Materials and methods: Twenty four C57BL/6 adult male mice weighting 30±5 gr were randomly divided into 4 groups. Normal saline was given to the control group (group 4) and the experimental groups (groups 1-3) received 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg metformin daily by intraperitoneal injection for seven days. One day after the last injection the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and their pancreases were fixed in 10% formalin for histological studies. The volume of the islets of langerhans was estimated by using Cavalieri method.
Results: Volume of the islets of langerhans in doses of 75 and 150 mg/kg Metformin showed a non¬significant difference in comparison to control group (P>0.05). 300 mg/kg metformin treated mice showed a significant increase in islets of langerhans volume compared to the control group (P<0.05). Conclusion: Metformin increases in the islets of langerhans volume in a dose-dependent manner. Increasing effects of Metformin on the islets of langerhans volume may be due to proliferation or hypertrophy of beta cells.

In view of the comprehensive governmental policies, on the grounds of exploitation developments from the
South Pars Gas Field, on one hand and the impacts of the plan implementation on the environment on the
other hand, the performance of impact assessments and consequences arising from regional building
operations, taking into consideration the coastal strip is the principle objective of this research. In addition to
which, the survey of abiding to environmental criteria, the rendering of modes to decrement and prevent the
adverse impacts of activities, the preparation of monitoring environmental programs and establishing
compatibility between regional activities and the environment, is another aim of this research.
The distinguished economic region of Pars Energy in southwestern Iran encompasses 10,000 hectares of
land, was established in the year 1998. The South Pars Gas Field consists of 6.8 percent of the total global
gas reserves and more than 38 percent of the entire gas reserves of the Country. It is one of the largest
resources of the Country's energy, located on the common frontier of Iran and Qatar and is accounted for
being, one of the major energy resources, of the Country.
The minimum elevation at sea level is zero at the coast and its maximum altitude is approximately 1,400
meters, in the northern heights of the region. The region is situated in the coastal drainage basin and the only
regional surface water, is the Gavbandi River. Similarly, the general direction of groundwater flow is
towards the sea and its surface level is high. The only active fault present in the region is the Gavbandi Fault,
which is situated at a distance of less than 5 kilometers, northeast of the Naieband National Park. In this
phase of the research, with the aid of geological maps and types of rocks, in accordance with reference to the
Special National Strategy Plan, seismic diagrams and land slides (drifts), in three appropriate zones of
durability, semi-suitable and unsuitable have been prepared.
In concern with the ground cover conditions, the regional plants are of the Polygonaceae, Leguminesae and
the palmaceae families, including a few classifications of weeds and scrubs, small trees, ornamental and fruit
bearing trees. Likewise, in the area of study, the bird community is of an acceptable diversity. The presence
of several terrestrial and aquatic habitats has lead to a high diversity of birds in the region in having
environmental potentials in the area. In the South Pars region, the Naieband National Marine Park and two
creeks which are known as Basatin and Bidkhoon are vital environmental banks and suitable locations for
spawning and the breeding of aqua life. The proximity with oil and gas installations in the Asalooyeh region
can be precarious in two ways. One, in an indirect mode, due to development activities that take place in the
area, such as, constructions and littoral structures etc., and in a direct form, due to the perpetual and probable
leakage of oil, gas and their derivatives into the regional waters, is possible. According to the census in the
year 1996, the township of Kangan had a population of 78,318 persons and with due attention to the
economic structure and migration, the area is confronted with a rise in population on the whole.In order to assess and survey the consequences, arising from the South Pars constructional activities on the
coastline, as well as the appraisal of the relative potentials and the vulnerability of the various sections, of the
implementation location of the project, from a list to recognize occurrences and the matrix, so as to
determine and gain an absolute reliability as to the results, two other methods have been utilized. In this
study, with the help of determining the slope, soil conditions (from the viewpoint of depth), bed rock (from
the viewpoint of durability), ground cover (from the point of view of density), sensitive ecosystems (creeks,
the Naieband Gulf and Naieband National Park) and by taking into consideration the specifications and
conditions of the limits, proportionate ecological, industrial and residential model surveys of constructions
have been prepared in these three aspects and they have been utilized in zoning.
After executing the zoning, so as to evaluate and specify the amount of damages caused, due to the various
activities, the checklist method was resorted to. The utilization of this method took place in the two phases of
construction and exploitation, in 6 of the major or principle regional activities such as, the refinery,
petrochemicals, airport, port and docks, gas transition line and transportation. In the checklist used with
respect to each of the activities, only the negative consequences as to the exploitation impacts of the
environmental factors have been distinguished. These consequences, from the point of view of being a
collection of impacts, retrievable and likewise, its impacts on the coastline were surveyed and then the
results gained were totalized. In continuation, so as to analyze and appraise the regional environmental
impacts and consequences and with due attention to the results of the list, (estimations of the initial impacts),
for the recognition of the intensity and importance of the impacts, as well as totalizing the quantitative facets
of the impacts and a final decision-making, the impacts predicted in the list method, is in the form of a
matrix, in two macro and micro proportions, in which they have been categorized and totalized.
With due attention to the results obtained from assessing the capacity, the ecological limits were divided into
three zones, the first zone is of 200 hectares, the second zone is of 19,200 hectares and the unsuitable zone, is
allocated to 26,300 hectares.
In comparing the ecological capacity role of the area, with the special regional development role, illustrates
that, approxin1ately 56 percent of the development is in the semi-suitable zone, and 44 percent of the
development shall be conducted in the unsuitable zone. With due attention to the fact that since that the
development in the region under study, shall be executed in the unsuitable environmental bed, though, due to
the vast importance and aptness of the region, in continuance with more accurate surveys of the limits under
study with the aid of other methods in connection with the project implementation was taken into discussion.
The results of the checklist show that from between the 6 main activities present in the South Pars
Development Plan Region, the refinery and petrochemicals, followed by the gas transfer pipelines, has the
highest percentage of adverse impacts on the environment. Similarly, the results of the implementation
matrixes of the project in the region do not qualify. Due to the outstanding economic benefits of the South
Pars region and the joint participation issue, as well as the exploitation of this resource by the southern
neighbors of Iran, a termination of the plan activities is not feasible. Therefore, in the continuation of this
research, modes to decrease the impacts and environmental monitoring under influence, with due attention to
the regional conditions have been rendered. After surveying the impacts of the mentioned plan, on the
various environmental components, as well as with emphasis on pollution and environmental destruction as
an adverse impact of the project on the environment, the manner to decrement the negative impacts of the
project in the region has been given in brief, as follows:
Means to reduce the adverse impacts of the project on the physical environment:
- Conservation and restoration of the regional lands, reducing the impacts arising from the occurrence of
inundation in the region, abiding to the 60 meter perimeter from the coast, for several constructional
activities in the area, preparing the required equipments for the collection of coastal sand, polluted with oil
products, the utilization of suitable chemical compounds for purging oil pollution in the region
Manner to decrease the oil impacts on the biological environment:- Utilizing recycled water and surface runoffs, utilizing brackish or fresh water resources, Use of irrigation
systems prone to slighter consumption, prevention of industrial development in the direction of the Naieband
National Park, prevention of the discharge of untreated urban, industrial and agricultural sewage and
wastewaters into the sea, abiding to the standards and controlling the temperature of sewage released into the
marine water (sea), controlling the leakage from oil pipes and installations, including the particular oil
tankers utilized for the replacement of oil produce
Method to reduce the adverse impacts on the socio-economic and cultural environment:
- Performing population scanning studies, executing special tutorial programs, so as to establish coordination
between the indigenous populace, abiding in rendering priority to indigenous individuals, in relative to
employing manpower
Modes to decrement the environmental pollution impacts:
- Accurate designing of chimneys utilized for pollutants, utilization of filters to decrease pollution in the
flares of industrial chimneys, Siting the approved or correct industrial development, with due attention to the
direction of wind in the region, sanitary burial of wastes, controlling the infiltration of pollutants into the
surface waters and the utilization of sensing equipment, in regards the leakage of pipes.
The monitoring program taking into consideration the South Pars region comprises of: Survey of the quality
of water resources by sampling and testing the specifications under view, topographical and landform
monitoring, in order to control and regulate development procedures, measuring and monitoring sound level.
Monitoring air pollution, sample taking of aqua life, taking statistical account of the amount and dispersion
of terrestrial fauna and aqua life listed in environmental studies, surveying ground cover conditions by
reviewing the destruction and transformation of the region having ground cover, particularly the destruction
of habitats, Monitoring and control of health and hygiene in the region, including the survey of employment
conditions. It is essential, that these specifications be sensed (weighted) during specific intervals of time
(more so, monthly and seasonally)
In accordance with the surveys performed, rectification proposals for the decrement of destructive impacts
within the entire area of study and the coastal strip have been rendered as hereunder:

Background and Objective: Matricaria chamomilla L. (MC) has been used as an effective plant for wounds, gastrointestinal disorders, pharyngitis, rheumatic pain and infertility for years. Until now, an in vivo study showing its extract effect on immune cells viability has not been done. The aim of this study was to determine the in vivo effects of MC aqueous and ethanolic extracts on macrophages and lymphocytes viability in BALB/c mice by MTT assay.

Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 110 mice. Four groups (each with 5 mice) were intraperitoneally injected with 25-100 mg/kg/day ethanolic extracts and five groups were orally treated with 100-1000 (mg/kg/day) ethanolic extract for 15 days. The same treatment groups were used for the aqueous extracts. On day 16, macrophages and lymphocytes were separated from the peritoneum and spleen of mice, respectively. 

Results: The viability of macrophages decreased in the injected mice with 75 and 100 mg/kg, and in the orally treated groups with 500, 750 and 1000 mg/kg ethanolic extracts, but increased in the treated mice with 50 (injected) and 1000 (orally) aqueous extracts. The viability of lymphocytes also decreased in the orally treated groups with 100 and 750 mg/kg ethanolic extracts and increased in the orally group with 100, 500 and 1000 mg/kg aqueous extracts.

Conclusions: MC ethanolic extracts effectively reduced the in vivo viability of macrophages and lymphocytes as compared to the aqueous extract. This reduction could be due to the anti-inflammatory effect of the ethanolic extract; however the aqueous extract may be promoted the immune system.

The quality and yield of products in the process of aluminum hot rolling is affected seriously by the load distribution. The load distribution of the hot tandem rolling is actually a problem of multi-objective optimization(MOO). The model of the rolling schedule was established based on slippage factor, which was also set as an optimization objective. In this paper, an improved NSGA-II is applied to optimize the rolling schedule of aluminum hot tandem rolling. This paper also proposed a method to select the best solution based on the preference after process of the improved NSGA-II. This method shows its ability on the slippage preventing and load distribution.

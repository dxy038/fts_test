The objective of this work was to develop a biohydrometallurgical/UV radiation route to produce ferrous sulphate heptahydrate (melanterite) from the pyrite present in coal tailings. The experimental work was carried out with a pyrite concentrate obtained from gravimetric processing of coal tailing. At laboratory scale it was performed the oxidation of pyrite in an aqueous medium in packed bed leaching columns in an oxidising environment with the presence of acidophilic bacteria (Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans). The recirculation of the liquor allowed obtaining an iron-rich extract. The conversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+ was performed using ultraviolet irradiation (UV). Finally, the solution was evaporated allowing the formation of iron sulphate crystals. The results demonstrated that it is possible to produce high purity ferrous sulphate heptahydrate crystals using coal tailings as raw material.

Energy efficiency is the most important issue in wireless sensor networks. To reduce energy consumption, lots of aggregation algorithms were proposed. Since the overlap of detect regions, data aggregation has been extensively investigated for eliminating data redundancy, but it has a great side-effect (such as: latency, accuracy, fault-tolerance). In this paper, we take energy efficiency and latency as our considerations, and propose an solution of data gathering and processing. Our objective is to maximize the lifetime of the networks by utilizing bilayer-based data aggregation based on GA. In this scheme, we divide the wireless network to bilayer and each layer has different number of cluster heads optimized by GA. The members (nodes or cluster heads) in the detection region of each layer send data to the related head it belonged to and the head responses for aggregation. Our results show that the scheme can improves the networks lifetime and reduces latency of whole network.

Objective
This study was undertaken to determine the outcomes of hysterectomy with and without conservation of the ovaries.
Study design
Data were collected prospectively for 3 years from 257 women undergoing hysterectomy (group 1) and 57 women undergoing hysterectomy with oophorectomy (group 2).
Results
Pelvic pain, abdominal pain, and depression scores were reduced in the 3 years after hysterectomy. Twenty-one percent of the women in group 1 and 43% in group 2 regretted the loss of fertility 3 years after hysterectomy. Satisfaction with the operation was greater than 90% after 3 years in both groups. New symptoms of pelvic pain were infrequent in groups 1 (3%) and 2 (5%).
Conclusion
Three years after undergoing hysterectomy with and without oophorectomy, satisfaction is high although some women regret the loss of fertility.

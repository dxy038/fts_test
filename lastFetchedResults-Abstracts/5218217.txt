Research objective of the authors is 3D map building and localization of search robot for rescue use. In this paper, the authors propose a novel method of dense 3D map building and present its trial result. For building a map, it is necessary to estimate robot motion. However, on rubble, it is difficult to estimate robot motion by using odometry or gyro. Therefore, in this framework, rough 3D map and discrete robot motions are derived using SLAM based on 3D scan matching. ICP algorithm is used for the matching method. Then, the dense 3D map is reconstructed from the rough 3D map and texture images.

A novel wavelength assignment method for a bidirectional two-fibre WDM network of star topology is proposed. It is shown that the minimal number of wavelengths required for an n-node star network is n (when n is odd) or n-1 (when n is even). A simple and explicit recursive formula, which completes wavelength assignment quickly with a time complexity of O(n/sup 2/ log/sub 2/(n)), is given. Simulation results show that the present method can give an optimal wavelength assignment much faster than conventional methods for a star network.

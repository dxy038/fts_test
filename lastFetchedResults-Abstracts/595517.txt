Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of diabetic retinopathy in a tertiary care hospital using digital retinal imaging technology. Methodology: This descriptive study was carried out in the department of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases, Hayatabad medical complex Peshawar. Patients referred from outpatient department, general practitioners and from private clinics were included and after taking their basic demographic data were referred to the department of Diabetes for Fundus Photograph using Canon CR1 non-mydriatic digital retinal camera. Photographs were analyzed first by Endocrinologist and later by an Ophthalmologist to assess the severity of retinopathy. Results: Two thousand one hundred and twenty three patients with type 2 diabetes were evaluated clinically followed by fundus photography by retinal digital imaging.The frequency retinopathy and maculopathy was 32.03 % and 6.31 % respectively (both retinopathy and maculopathy 38.34%). Three seventy four patients (17.6% patients) received laser treatment for prevention of blindness.

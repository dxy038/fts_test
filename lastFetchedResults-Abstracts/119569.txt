The effect of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is one of the most important factors in correcting the reflectance obtained from remotely sensed data. Estimation of BRDF model parameters can be deteriorated by various factors; contamination of the observations by undetected subresolution clouds or snow patches, inconsistent atmospheric correction in multiangular time series due to uncertainties in the atmospheric parameters, slight variations of the surface condition during a period of observation, for example due to soil moisture changes, diurnal effects on vegetation structure, and geolocation errors [Lucht and Roujean, 2000]. In the present paper, parameter estimation robustness is examined using Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) data measured for paddy fields in Japan. We compare both the M-estimator and the least median of squares (LMedS) methods for robust parameter estimation to the ordinary least squares method (LSM). In experiments, simulated data that were produced by adding noises to the data measured on the ground surface were used. Experimental results demonstrate that if a robust estimation is sought, the LMedS method can be adopted for the robust estimation of a BRDF model parameter.

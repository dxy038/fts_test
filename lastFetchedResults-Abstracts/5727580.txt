Sophisticated fault detection (FD) algorithms often include nonlinear mappings of observed data to fault decisions, and simulation studies are used to support the methods. Objective statistically supported performance analysis of FD algorithms is only possible for some special cases, including linear Gaussian models. The goal here is to derive general statistical performance bounds for any FD algorithm, given a non-linear non-Gaussian model of the system. Recent advances in numerical algorithms for nonlinear filtering indicate that such bounds in many practical cases are attainable. This paper focuses on linear non-Gaussian models. A couple of different fault detection setups based on parity space and Kalman filter approaches are considered, where the fault enters a computable residual linearly. For this class of systems, fault detection can be based on the best linear unbiased estimate (BLUE) of the fault vector. Alternatively, a nonlinear filter can potentially compute the maximum likelihood (ML) state estimate, whose performance is bounded by the Cram&#233;r-Rao lower bound (CRLB). The contribution in this paper is general expressions for the CRLB for this class of systems, interpreted in terms of fault detectability. The analysis is exemplified for a case with measurements affected by outliers.

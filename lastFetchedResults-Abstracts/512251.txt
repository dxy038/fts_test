Malaysia in its effort to become a fully developed nation by 2020 has undertaken a monumental task in instilling noble values into its society including its civil sector. The objective of this research was to examine the level of awareness, knowledge and understanding of integrity among selected civil servants of three State agencies in Terenganu, Malaysia, which basically served as the scope of the research. The respondents were selected based on a purposive sampling technique. The research used a quantitative approach where self-administered structured questions were distributed. Descriptive and inference analysis were carried out to meet the research objectives outlined. The research findings indicated that there were civil servants groups who were unclear and uncertain about the meaning of integrity in public sector. Those with shorter length of services were found to be less knowledgeable on the respective rule and procedure which led to them being unsure about integrity. The civil servants also believed that corruption level in Malaysia was still high. The research contended that length of service was inversely related to the perception on the knowledge of integrity, corruption and quality of service delivery.

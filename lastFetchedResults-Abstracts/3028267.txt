The Internet protocol anycasting allows communication from a specific node to any one of the nodes in a group of nodes, which share the same IP address. The two main protocols involve in the packet transmission are the routing tree formation protocol (RTFP) and the packet forwarding protocol (PFP). Besides that, several types of routing techniques such as single path routing (SPR) and multi-path routing (MPR) are being used by current communication services. In this paper we have analyzed static and dynamic routing mechanism for anycast packets in SPR and MPR. New RTFP have been designed and proposed for this new anycast mechanism based on our research. The tree of each network topology can be determined and formed by different routing tree formation protocol like AGBSPF algorithm (SPF), load-balanced AGBSPF algorithm, load propagation algorithm for server over-load announcement and core-based tree (CBT). We have implemented the dynamic routing algorithms, which are suitable for IP anycast packet forwarding. The objective of the dynamic routing algorithm is to minimize the computational complexity to update the tree and maintain the routing stability by making minimal changes to the current routing tree of the network. After the tree formations, the packet forwarding protocol will decide the transmission of the packets based on the cost factor. The major outcome of this paper is new dynamic RTFP and PFP.

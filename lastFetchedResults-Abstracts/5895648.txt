In this paper a novel approach to the optimisation of the ECCM (electronic counter measures) capabilities of a phased array radar has been proposed. The division in sub-arrays for adaptive digital beamforming is performed by a MOGA (multi-objective genetic algorithm) which aims to find optimal trade-offs between competitive objectives (detection probability, accuracy of the target angular estimation, level of the side lobes, etc.). The solutions obtained after several cycles of the algorithm for a study case (square phased array antenna with 64 radiating elements) are presented.

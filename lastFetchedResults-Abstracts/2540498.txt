Objective: The main purpose of the present study was to evaluate psychometric properties of Persian version of WHOQOLDIS questionnaire in elderly people with disability.

Materials  Methods A classical psychometric method was used to evaluate validity and reliability of WHOQOLDIS questionnaire in elderly people with disability. Lawshe, and Waltz and Bausell methods were used for assessing content validity. During convenient sling, 205 elderly, whose score in WHOQOLDIS questionnaire was more than 4, completed the SF12 questionnaire in order to assess convergent validity and criterion validity (using known groups comparison). Reliability was estimated using internal consistency and testretest reliability was determined by means of Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC).

Results: According to Lawshe, and Waltz and Bausell methods of content validity, acceptable scores were obtained for all items. Correlation between the WHOQOLDIS questionnaire and the SF12 scales was satisfactory except for social domain (P=0.13). The Intraclass Correlation Coefficients for score of questionnaire dimensions and total score was higher than 0.70. Cronbachs alpha for investigating Intraclass Correlation was higher than 0.70 except for social domain. Comparing known groups revealed distinctions in sex and health and disability status between elderly people (P<0.001).

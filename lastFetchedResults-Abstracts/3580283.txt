The objective of the Navy Manufacturing Technology Program for Computerized Thick-Film Printing is to establish advanced thick-film hybrid manufacturing capabilities that are cost effective and efficient when applied to the comparatively small quantities of thick-film hybrid microcircuits typically associated with defense avionics development and production programs. This program will establish a thick-film hybrid microcircuit manufacturing technology based on high-speed orifice writing processes, controlled by computer-aided hardware and software, for low-cost and fine-line deposition of thick-film materials onto ceramic substrates. As a result of this program, Navy microelectronic hardware acquisition costs will be reduced. Contractor production cycles will be shortened through the reduction or elimination of those costs presently associated with key labor-intensive thick-film manufacturing processes. Specifically, savings should be realized by elimination of 1) critical artwork generation procedures, 2) photolithographic preparation of stencil screens necessary for microcircuit fabrication, 3) intermediate production tooling as represented by the stencil screens, and 4) lengthy prototype-and-redesign cycles. The proposed manufacturing technology is directed toward, but not limited to, the hybrid microelectronics manufacturer who typically has modest thick-film and assembly capabilities, but has virtually no efficient in-house means to generate complex artwork. Currently, this manufacturer is constrained to the labor-intensive stencil screen preparation required for screen printing. Realization of this manufacturing technology will enhance even the smallest fabrication facility. It will provide not only a tooling-free microcircuit printing capability for prototype and limited production quantities, but a complementary microcircuit pattern design capability as well.

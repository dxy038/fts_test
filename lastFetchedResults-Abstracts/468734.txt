Objective
Our purpose was to determine whether maternal plasma levels of neutrophil granule products are elevated in patients with chorioamnionitis after preterm premature rupture of membranes (PROM).
Study design
Fifty-two patients between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation with preterm PROM were included. Plasma samples for defensins and lactoferrin were collected throughout latency. Fifty-two control subjects between 26 and 30 weeks' gestation were recruited for baseline levels.
Results
Mean control defensin levels were compared with mean defensin levels on admission (668 ng/mL vs 5665 ng/mL, P<.01). Mean defensin levels on admission in patients without chorioamnionitis were compared with those of patients in whom histologic chorioamnionitis developed (520 ng/mL vs 9163 ng/mL, P<.01). The same relationships were not demonstrated for lactoferrin. With use a defensin value of 1500 ng/mL on admission, the sensitivity is 76% and specificity is 94% in predicting histologic chorioamnionitis.
Conclusions
Maternal plasma levels of defensins are markers of histologic chorioamnionitis in patients after preterm PROM.

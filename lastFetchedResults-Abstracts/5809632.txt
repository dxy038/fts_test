This paper presents a formulation of security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) with emphasizing on Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) and Benders Decomposition. The problem is finding a solution which satisfies the constraints and maximizes the objective function. The proposed method is solved using MINLP using solver in GAMS software. As a case study, results on IEEE 30-bus system are presented in this paper.

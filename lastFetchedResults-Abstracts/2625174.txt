Well instability and its ultimate falling and loss incur high costs and delay in the production operations and can raise concerns about the plan being economic. Hence, analyzing and forecasting the pit wall instability plays a significant role in efficiency and success of the project. Amongst the effective parameters on well stability are well drilling route, direction and magnitude of in situ stress, rock geo-mechanical properties, formation fluid pressure and its properties. The objective of this research is to study the instability and optimum designing of inclination and azimuth of the directional wells for which FLAC3D software was used. In this regard, a study was conducted on cases about optimum designing of inclination and azimuth of the directional wells in Ahwaz northwest oilfields in Sarvak formations.
Modelling was done for a wide range of inclinations in the first deviation point with inclinations 20, 10 and 0 and azimuths of 90, 75, 60, 45, 30, 15. Also, in Sarvak formation, the most stable situation is the inclination of 0 degree / azimuth 0 degree while the most instable situation is the inclination of 20 degrees / azimuth 90 degrees in the second deviation point

An approach for the specific design of laminated composites structures with local reinforcements regarding their dynamic behavior is presented. It is based on the sensitivity-based parameterization concept which has been presented in [1]. The search for best structural performance calls for a local adaption of the laminate properties to the inhomogeneous internal load distributions in order to take advantage of the anisotropic characteristics. If designing a structure regarding dynamic behavior, eigenfrequencies are often pushed above the essential excitation frequencies in order to prevent dynamic coupling. However, dynamic coupling can also be prevented by creating a resonance-free band in the range of the excitation source. Local reinforcements allow a specific shifting the eigenfrequencies for generating a resonance-free band. Different objective functions, which separate a pair of eigenfrequencies, are presented. A design solution is physically realized to verify the existence of a resonance-free band. A manufacturing process, called sequential curing process, is presented which allows the production of high-quality locally reinforced structures by separating the curing of basic structure and reinforcements into two temperature cycles. Eigenfrequencies and modes of the panel are measured with a scanning-vibrometer. The experimental results show high agreement with the simulation and the resonance-free band is confirmed.

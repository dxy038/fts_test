In this paper, a multi-antenna two-way relaying protocol is proposed whereby two source nodes wishing to exchange information via a relay node additionally send private messages intended solely for the relay. In particular, we investigate the performance of this bidirectional relaying protocol over fading channels when the relay and source nodes are equipped with multiple antennas thus enabling them to leverage diversity and/or multiplexing gains. Specifically, provided enough antennas are available at the relay, the latter may opt for a demodulate-and-forward approach whereby it demodulates all incoming streams before broadcasting solely the messages to be exchanged between the source nodes or it may opt for a generalized analog network coding approach whereby it only demodulates the private messages destined for the relayÂ´s own sake while treating the messages to be exchanged between the source nodes as colored noise, subtracting the demodulated information from the overall received signal and then broadcasting the remaining part of the received signal. We compare how the two approaches fare when coupled with different multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection techniques thus striking suitable tradeoffs between performance and implementation complexity for the generalized multi-antenna two-way relaying channel under consideration.

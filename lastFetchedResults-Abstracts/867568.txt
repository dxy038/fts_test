In this paper we consider a two-machine flow shop scheduling problem with effects of deterioration and
learning. By the effects of deterioration and learning, we mean that the processing time of a job is a function
of its execution starting time and its position in a sequence. The objective is to find a sequence that
minimizes the total completion time. Optimal solutions are obtained for some special cases. For the general
case, several dominance properties and some lower bounds are derived, which are used to speed up
the elimination process of a branch-and-bound algorithm. A heuristic algorithm is also proposed, which
is shown by computational experiments to perform effectively and efficiently in obtaining near-optimal
solutions.

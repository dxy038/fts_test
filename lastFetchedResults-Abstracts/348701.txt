Objective
To quantify the incidence of seizures and adverse events during standard electroencephalography (EEG).
Methods
A retrospective random sample of 1000 of a total of 3391 reports of standard scalp EEG recordings during 2002 at Kings College Hospital were studied, and adverse events during standard EEG were recorded. Photic induced seizures and epileptiform activity were compared with the resting, hyperventilation and sleep EEG.
Results
Adverse events occurred in 131 records (13.1%), including seizures in 60 records (45 electro-clinical and 15 non-epileptic seizures). The overall incidence of electro-clinical seizures was not statistically different during the resting EEG (2.8%), sleep EEG (2%), hyperventilation EEG (2.1%) and during photic stimulation EEG (1.4%). There was a higher frequency of electro-clinical seizures during hyperventilation and sleep in those with a diagnosis of idiopathic generalised epilepsy (31.5%) and during photic stimulation in photosensitive patients (31%). The incidence of electro-clinical seizures was significantly less during activation procedures in focal epilepsies (2.6%). Activation techniques made a unique diagnostic contribution when routine resting EEG was normal or equivocal in 11% of cases.
Conclusions
Adverse events occurred in 13.1% of records, and most were minor. Sixty of the adverse events were seizures. Those generated during the EEG were brief and safety precautions operated successfully. In those without a prior diagnosis, the chance of seizures is the same during both resting and activation EEG. In those patients with generalised epilepsy or photosensitivity, activation procedures have a higher rate of seizure induction.
Significance
This study has implications for informed consent for EEG.

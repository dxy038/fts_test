In this paper, we investigate the problem of survivable grooming for anycasting over wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks. Anycasting is a communication paradigm in which a source node sends data to any one out of multiple candidate destinations. In WDM networks, the standard anycasting problem involves the establishment of a connection from the source to any one destination with the objective of minimizing the resources used. In order to provide survivability, the problem can be extended to find both a connection to a primary destination and a connection to a backup destination. The connections, which may require an amount of bandwidth that may be less than the bandwidth of an entire wavelength, can be groomed with other connections in the WDM network. We propose an auxiliary graph approach to solving the survivable grooming problem for anycasting in WDM networks, and we propose three different protection approaches for providing different degrees of survivability against link failures and destination failures. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is verified through simulation.

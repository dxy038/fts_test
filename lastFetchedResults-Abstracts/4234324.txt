This paper discusses the Objective Defense Operational Control System (ODOCS) architecture, a multi-phase plan through which the current Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) control system will migrate to JTA-A/COE compliance while supporting the potential for COTS-based subsystems. The goals of the ODOCS architecture, including standards-compliance, manpower reduction, and integration of functionality, are explored. Each of the key architectural components, hardware, computing environment, network, and data, are discussed and their implications for new DSCS control subsystems explained. Finally, the multiple phases to reach ODOCS compliance are discussed

Input nonlinearities of many physical systems due to their actuator constraints are important points which have to be considered by designers. One of the recent methods for dealing with this problem is to use compensation after controller. In this paper, a new approach based on fuzzy sets theory, as a solution, has been proposed. The main objective of the proposed method is to provide a feasible controller output if it is not in the legal ranges to keep the system output performance as high as possible.

Objective: To elucidate the correlation between the telomere length and subtelomeric methylated
status in peripheral leukocytes and the laboratory data of inpatients with brain infarction and metabolic
disorders. This is the first report describing a link between routine clinical laboratory data and genomic aging.
Design: Cross-sectional population-based study. Setting: Chronic disease ward of Kyushu University Hospital
at Beppu in Japan. Participants: Inpatients with brain infarction and metabolic disorders. Measurements:
The laboratory data of male patients were collected and the telomeric parameters in their peripheral leukocytes
were determined by a Southern blot analysis with methylation-sensitive and insensitive isoschizomers. Any
correlations between the laboratory data and the telomeric parameters were assessed. Results: The patients
revealed a significant correlation among the fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, serum creatinine and urea nitrogen
levels with the mean telomere length, expression of long telomeres (>9.4 kb), or the subtelomeric
hypermethylation status of long telomeres. Conclusion: Our results suggested that the hyperglycemia and
renal function of patients with metabolic disorders correlated positively with the aging-associated telomeric
changes.

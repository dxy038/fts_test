Bluetooth is a promising wireless technology that enables portable devices to form short-range wireless ad hoc networks. However, several issues must be properly addressed before its wide deployment, one of which is intra-piconet and inter-piconet scheduling. Several scheduling algorithms have been proposed, with the objective of maximizing throughput while maintaining fairness. None of them consider the issue of providing temporal quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we build upon the distance-constrained task model and its scheduling algorithm, in compliance with the Bluetooth specification, a scheduling algorithm to handle dynamic establishment and termination of connections with temporal QoS requirements. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms others in scheduling QoS sensitive connections while maintaining high throughput and low delay for non-QoS-sensitive connection.

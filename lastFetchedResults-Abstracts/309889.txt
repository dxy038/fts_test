Objective:
To investigate the association between different the left ventricle (LV) geometric patterns and lymphocyte DNA damage in patients with hypertension (HT).
Methods:
We studied 84 patients (50.0 ± 6.1, years) with HT and 24 healthy control subjects (48.6 ± 3.3, years). Four different geometric patterns were identified in patients according to LV mass index and relative wall thickness. Peripheral lymphocyte DNA damages and plasma levels of total antioxidant status (TAS) were determined in all subjects.
Results:
DNA damage was increased in hypertensive patients compared with control group (p = 0.001). The major increase in DNA damage was observed in concentric hypertrophic geometric pattern compared with all other geometric patterns (p < 0.001, for all). In multiple linear regression analysis, lymphocyte DNA damage was independently correlated with only TAS (β = − 0.444, p < 0.001), but not LV geometry (p > 0.05).
Conclusion:
The major increase in lymphocyte DNA damage was observed in concentric hypertrophic geometric pattern. This result may be related to increased oxidative stress.

This paper describes a study made to explore the application of GIS and Remote Sensing in flood risk assessment for Bandar Segamat sustainability. The objective is to explore and understand the flood risk assessment characteristics, Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS). Open source software such as QuantimGIS and Infoworks RS is used as tools in processing the data. The result show a significant movement of water in Segamat city which causing such loss in terms of property damages and lives. A simulation of flood risk and sustainability at Bandar Segamat was developed which indicate the most, moderate and less affected area in Segamat.

This paper proposes a design of a system, which would provide a solution to irregular waste bin disposal system. The designed system makes use of weight sensor, IR sensor and biosensor to detect the extent of filling of the bin and the extent of pollution caused by the waste. This information is fed to a controller which with the help of a GSM module notifies the respected authority of the condition of the bin. Objective of the paper is to provide a solution to irregular monitoring system and its causes of wastage clearance system in urban areas. To develop an electronic system which is embedded with the knowledge of microcontroller, its interfacing &amp; GSM technologies of Telecommunication engineering using solar energy as power source.

This work shows the conceptual design of a modular snake robot using modules built from a folded paper structure. Module interconnection scheme and their design specifications are based on existing modular snake robot technology, simplifying the control of the whole robot. Module concept design, size and scaling, followed by the paper sheet folding procedure and its interconnection are explained. The modeling of the folded moduleÂ´s bending behavior is compared with a rigid one, validating its implementation convenience. The main objective of this work is to seize the emerging technology of programmable sheets, to produce a real soft robot application.

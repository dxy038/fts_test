This paper studies a new innovative concrete with phase change materials (PCM) on thermal aspects. The final objective is to develop a product which would achieve important energy savings in buildings. The work here presented is the construction and experimental installation of two real size concrete cubicles to study the effect of the inclusion of a PCM with a melting point of 26 Â°C. The cubicles were constructed in the locality of Puigverd of Lleida (Spain). The results of this study show the energy storage in the walls by encapsulating PCMs and the comparison with conventional concrete without PCMs leading to an improved thermal inertia as well as lower inner temperatures.

Cutting parameters optimization is actually a very challenging task. It should achieve a trade-off between cost, time and quality to the utmost. Additionally, it involves many constraints due to the complexity of manufacturing process. A multi-objective optimization model for cutting parameters was proposed, in which minimal machining time and minimal elapsed tool life were considered. An improved NSGA-II was also designed in order to efficiently deal with multiple constraints, in which the non-dominance concept was extended to constraint space. An application on titanium alloyÂ´s cutting parameters optimization showed that the proposed approach is effective to find Pareto solutions. The proposed cutting parameters optimization approach is ease to programmable for machining decision support system.

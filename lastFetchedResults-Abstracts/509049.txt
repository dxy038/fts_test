Background and Objective: Metabolic syndrome is a key factor in
developing cardiovascular disease and is a major problem in many
countries. With regard to the young Iranian population, high
frequency of pregnancy, and the high prevalence of metabolic
syndrome, especially in women after menopause, it is a great
concern in Iran. This study was performed to investigate the
relationship between the number of deliveries (Parity) and metabolic
syndrome in non-obese postmenopausal women.
Subjects and Methods: This cross sectional study was carried out
on 140 healthy non-obese postmenopausal women who had a BMI
less than30 Kg/m2, at 2009 in Ahvaz. The data which were
collected through interviews contained demographic information,
the number of parity, age at menopause, values of HDL-C, FBS, TG
serum after 12 hours fasting, blood pressure and waist
circumference. We used the Pearson correlation and multiple
regression analysis by SPSS 15 software.
Results: There was significant relationship between parity and
components of metabolic syndrome such as FBS (P < 0.001), systolic
blood pressure (P=0.001), diastolic blood pressure (P=0.003), waist
circumference (P=0.004) and triglycerides(P=0.009) except HDL-C
(P=0.08). There is significant relationship between parity and
metabolic syndrome (P=0. 05)
Conclusion: Increasing in parity is associated with increasing in
FBS, BP, TG and WC and metabolic syndrome .Therefore, control
and reduction of pregnancies should not be disregarded.

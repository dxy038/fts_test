The photovoltaic module is typically represented by an equivalent circuit whose parameters are calculated using the experimental current voltage characteristic I-V. The precise determination of these parameters remains a challenge for researchers, which led to a diversification in models and numerical methods used for their characterizations. For Si-crystallin module, the parallel resistance R<sub>sh</sub> is generally high, and its contribution has a little influence in the model, so for that the model with four parameters is one of the mainly used in literature. Parametric characterization of the four parameters model is the objective of this work. The simulation results for the Shell SP75 module are confronted with those of the manufacturer to develop the different conclusions drawn about the different methods used.

A capacitivly coupled interface for a bidirectional data bus like a Controller-DRAM-bus with data transfer rates up to 1Gb/s at a power supply voltage of 1.5V is presented. All receivers are capacitively coupled to the data bus. The CMOS receiver consumes 1.65mW DC-power in a 0.35&#181;m technology. The computed power consumption of the driver for a bus with five I/Os is reduced approximatly to 1/4 and to 1/8 in comparison with a SSTL (Stub Series Terminated Logic) system and a RSL (Rambus Signaling Logic) system at a transfer rate of 1Gb/s respectively.

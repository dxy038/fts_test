Introduction: Malnutrition is one of the most important health problems in developing countries, especially in school students.

Objective: To determine of relationship between intestinal parasitic infection and wasting and growth stunting incidence among primary students in rural areas of Kashan, in the year of 2008.

Materials and Methods: In this Case-Control study, 65 students with wasting and 65 students with growth stunting were chosen as case groups, also 65 students without malnutrition were chosen as control group. The National Center of Health Statistic (NCHS) growth charts was used as normal standard. The nutritional status was measured by Waterlow classification indicators. (The ratio of weight to height (wasting) and height to age (stunting) for pathogen intestinal parasites diagnosis). Three serial fecal samples from students in case and control groups was collected during different days, in addition Cellophane tape method for Enterobius vermicularis eggs was performed in all of them.

Results: According to data, there were no significant relation between Pathogen intestinal parasitic infection and wasting and growth stunting (P=0.08 and P=0.18) respectively.

Conclusion: The possibility of causing major detrimental effect on natural status of children by light parasitism is low.

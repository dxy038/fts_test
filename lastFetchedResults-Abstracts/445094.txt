background
Head and neck tumors often spread to the lungs, with a variety of presentations. The ideal treatment for those patients is still controversial. Resection of lung metastases was shown to significantly influence overall survival of patients.
objective
To evaluate results of surgical resection of lung nodules in patients with head and neck primary tumors.
methods
A retrospective analysis was made of 53 patients with head and neck tumors and lung nodules (no other metastases detected in other organs) admitted to our department. They were separated into two groups: OPER (thoracotomy, n = 26), and NOTOPER (no thoracotomies, n = 27). Overall survival was compared (Kaplan-Meier, log-rank) between groups.
results
Overall median survival of all patients was 10 months, of OPER 20 months, and of NOTOPER 6 months (P<0.0001). Complete resection (n = 19) of lung metastases was associated with the greatest survival rate (median 23 months). Patients submitted to incomplete resection (n = 7) had a median survival of 16 months, compared with 7 months for patients who received only chemotherapy (n = 7) and 4 months for patients (n = 20) with no treatment (P<0.0001).
conclusion
Resection of lung metastases offers a significant survival benefit for patients with head and neck primary tumors, when compared with the current chemotherapeutic regimens. It should be considered for all patients clinically fit and who present with no extrapulmonary disease.

A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is used to assess the effect of pump layout program on flow field in Ditch-V pump station for potable water treatment. The model is based on the CFD code Fluent and exploits several specific aspects of the potable water application to derive a computational tool much more efficient than the corresponding tools employed to simulate booster pump station projects. To research the flow field of deflector program in super pumping station with many restriction factors such as large flow quantity, high pumping lift and three different water supply directions, an incompressible turbulent fluid velocity field model and multi-hydraulic model was established. Then flow field was calculated and analyzed using control volume method. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the size of the deflector program in the water supply. The present model is adjusted against data from a real pump station and then it is used to assess the significance of influent structure and diversion variation. It is found that the flow pattern in transition section of symmetric trapezoidal layout program was smooth, and had little water loss. Flow pattern near the bottom in the fore-bay was smoother, while vortex and roll back flow was formed near the front surface of the pool. Some program improvements were made during numerical simulation including increasing the length of canals, changing configuration forms and adding diversion cone. Numerical simulation results indicated that the inlet drift angle below the pump was generally less than 4&#176;. Flow field near the suction pipe was smooth and uniform.

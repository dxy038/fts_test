In this paper, we study the outage probability performance of a very well-known bidirectional protocol based on decode-and-forward relaying: physical-layer network coding (PNC). We first derive an exact closed-form outage probability expression for the PNC protocol. To provide more insight, we also derive asymptotic outage probability expression. Finally, the validity of the derived expressions is confirmed by numerical results.

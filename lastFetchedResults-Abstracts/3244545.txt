In this paper, supervisory predictive control (SPC) considered as a improved generalized predictive control is developed for coordinated control system of 1000MW once through boiler. This strategy has the abilities of self-learning and self-adaption of GPC and the characteristics of simple construction, high reliability and strong robustness of conventional PID controller. WhatÂ´s more the objective function includes not only the performance of the system but also the economic indicators, so this algorithm could achieve more satisfied performance on keeping steady state, tracking capability and disturbance rejection as well as the economics. The simulations investigate that the SPC is better than a traditional PID controller both on the solving nonlinearity, coupling, delay and uncertain factors problems and economics optimization.

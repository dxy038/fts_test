The US Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) set by the US National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine (IOM), have provided goals for evaluating diets since the first nutrient calculation software appeared. Early standards were often perceived as being too high, and nutritionists set values such as 23 of the RDA as a more reasonable standard. Such arbitrary rules had no basis in science. Recently new standards have been set, and are known collectively as the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). Using these newer standards, algorithms for evaluating diets of individuals are now better grounded in science. Objective: To create computer software displays for evaluating diets of individuals incorporating the concept of probability of adequacy. Methods and materials: National Academy of Science publications give equations for calculating the confidence that an individual's intake is adequate or exceeds reference values and suggest ranges of acceptable intakes for carbohydrate, protein and fat. Using readily available graphing software we have designed several sample displays for presenting this information to a research subject or client. Results: Calculations have been programmed into graph-making software to produce several sample displays for evaluating intakes. Significance: Graphic displays give a picture of dietary adequacy and excess that is meaningful and easy to understand.

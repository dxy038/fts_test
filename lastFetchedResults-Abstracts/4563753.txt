SEPIC Converter is a fourth order non-linear system and hence non-linear control strategies are more suitable to apply for it. When the SEPIC operates at very high switching frequency, it is essential to limit the computation time lower than the switching period. Sliding Mode Control (SMC) meet this objective. This paper presents a PWM based Integral Sliding Mode Control Strategy for controlling the output voltage of SEPIC converter. The present control methods for SEPIC converter are based on linear control approaches which are critical in low power application areas consuming more power since they require more processing time to run. The proposed control strategy is developed using the hybrid model of SEPIC converter with the state space averaging technique. The equivalent control law is derived and the control model is simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK and the desired response is obtained.

The objective of this article was to investigate the feasibility of epoxy resin-based monoliths prepared by stepwise polymerization and column preconcentration of metal ions using large-scale monolithic matrix. A novel macroporous polymer monolith matrix was prepared from epoxy resin (EP) and ethylenediamine (EDA) and pore-forming reagent (polyethylene glycol, PEG-1000) by in situ step-addition polymerization. The morphology of the resulting polymer monolith was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge prepared from a simple glass-tube was used for the preconcentration and determination of Pb(II) combined with flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS). The characteristics of the monoliths for the extraction of Pb(II) in aqueous solution were investigated. The experimental results showed that trace Pb(II) ions could be quantitatively preconcentrated in the pH range of 4.0–9.0 with recoveries of >95%. The maximum static adsorption capacity of the monolith adsorbent was 106.8 mg g−1. The column was eluted by 1.0 mol L−1 HNO3 and recovery of Pb(II) was more than 97%. Moreover, the polymer monolith adsorbent shows superior reusability and stability. The precision and the accuracy of the proposed procedure were satisfactory by analyzing a standard reference material and three natural water samples. It was shown that the EP–EDA monolith was suitable for the preconcentration of environmental Pb(II) as an ion-selective SPE adsorbent.

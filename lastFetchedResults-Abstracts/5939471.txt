Fifty-four purebred Jinhua barrows weighing about 45 kg were divided into three groups, each group has three replicates with six barrows in each replicate, and fed corn-soybean meal basal diets supplemented with 0, 0.125% and 0.250% betaine for 45 days. At trial termination, two pigs weighing about 67 kg were selected from each replicate and slaughtered for analyses. The results were that increased daily gain, decreased gain/feed ratio were observed in betaine-treated groups (P&lt;;0.05). Carcass lean percentage and Longissimus muscle area were significantly increased, meanwhile, carcass fat percentage and average backfat thickness were significantly decreased in betiane-contamined groups (P&lt;;0.05). Serum urea nitrogen and TG concentrations were significantly decreased, however, total protein and serum FFA concentrations were significantly increased in betaine-treated groups (P&lt;;0.05). These results indicated that betaine of feed could increased growth performance, improve carcass characteristics and serum metabolites in Jinhua barrows.

In this paper a modified objective function has been proposed for optimal network reconfiguration and conductor resizing simultaneously and includes conductor costs, and energy losses costs. Furthermore, a new method is proposed for optimization of objective function in simultaneity and non-simultaneity states. The Simulation results are presented and compared for a 16 buses civanlar system in three states include, network reconfiguration before conductor resizing, network reconfiguration after conductor resizing and conductor sizing and network reconfiguration simultaneously. Simulation results show that the results of simultaneous conductor sizing and network reconfiguration are better than two other statesÂ´ results.

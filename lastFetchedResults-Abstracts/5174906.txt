Multi-objective shop scheduling optimization approach often presents the scheduling decision makers a set of Pareto solutions, which is hard to select the most satisfactory one from them. Therefore, a new method was put forward to select the best solution from the Pareto solutions. Firstly, a new weight-confirming method which contained subjective factors and objective factors was obtained by combining analytic hierarchy process and entropy theory (A-E). Then, the distance between ideal scheme and spare schemes was illuminated by Euclid norm as a standard to select the best scheme. Finally, the result testifies that using A-E method can make a right decision quickly which can help the decision-maker get the most satisfied solution from the set of Pareto solutions.

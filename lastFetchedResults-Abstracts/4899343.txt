In this contribution, a feedback control strategy that drives a system of multiple nonholonomic kinematic unicycles to agreement is introduced. Each agent is assigned with a specific subset of the rest of the team, called the agentÂ´s communication set, that includes the agents with which it can communicate in order to achieve the desired objective. The proposed nonholonomic control law is discontinuous and time-invariant and tools from nonsmooth stability theory and graph theory are used to check the stability of the overall system. Similarly to the linear case, the convergence of the multi-agent system relies on the connectivity of the communication graph that represents the inter-agent communication topology

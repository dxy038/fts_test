Experimental results are presented to validate a recently developed adaptive output feedback controller for a class of unknown MIMO systems. The control approach relies on three components, i.e. a predictor, a reference model, and a controller. Specifically, since the predictor is designed to predict the system´s output for any admissible control input, controlling the uncertain system is reduced to controlling the predictor, which is a virtual system with known dynamics and full state available. Subsequently, a full state feedback control law is designed to control the predictor output to approach the reference system, while the reference system tracks the desired trajectory, accounting for the actuator amplitude and rate saturation constraints. Ultimately, the control objective of driving the actual system output to track the desired trajectories is achieved by showing that the system output, the predictor output, and the reference system trajectory all converge to each other. Theorems and the step-by-step implementation of the control strategy are presented. Finally, the control´s efficacy is illustrated by a real time implementation of the proposed algorithm on an actual helicopter test bed.

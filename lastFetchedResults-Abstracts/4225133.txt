The research objective is to determine an accurate position and orientation for mobile robots based on information received from odometry and inertial sensors. For a wheeled robot, odometry is one of the important means of achieving the robot position. To improve on odometryÂ´s error, the information from odometry is integrated with the inertial system using unscented Kalman filter (UKF).

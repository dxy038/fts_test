Objective
This study was undertaken to evaluate the occurrence and management of mesh erosions in patients undergoing abdominal sacrocolpopexy.
Study design
A retrospective chart review of the abdominal sacrocolpopexy procedure (n = 92) between 1997 and 2003 was performed. Patients with mesh erosion were identified. Incidence by graft type and treatment required for erosion resolution was analyzed with Ï‡2 and Fisher exact test.
Results
Erosions occurred in 7.6 % (7/92). Erosions were identified only in patients with Gore-Tex (3/33, 9%) or silicone-coated mesh (4/21, 19%) compared with none of 38 patients with polypropylene mesh (n = 24) or fascia (n = 14) grafts (P = .068.). Partial excision of exposed graft resolved all 3 Gore-Tex erosions, compared with none of the silicone-coated mesh erosions (P = .03). Complete graft removal was required to resolve silicone-coated mesh erosions.
Conclusion
We observed a high rate of erosion with Gore-Tex and silicone-coated mesh. Partial graft excision was adequate for Gore-Tex erosions, but complete graft removal was necessary to resolve erosions associated with silicone-coated mesh.

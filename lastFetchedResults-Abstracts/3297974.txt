In this paper have analyzed the interruption concert of a multi-hop wireless network in which the routes between resource-objective pairs are fixed. It has developed a new queue grouping technique to handle the complex correlations of the service process resulting from the multi-hop nature of the flows and their mutual sharing of the wireless medium. A general set based interfering model is assumed that imposes constraints on links that can be served simultaneously at any given time. These interference constraints are used to obtain a fundamental lower bound on the interruption concert of any scheduling policy for the system. It presents a systematic methodology to derive such lower bounds. For a special wireless system, namely the clique, it design a policy that is sample path interruption is fi nest. For the cycle queue network, where the interruption finest policy is known, the expected interruption of the optimal policy numerically coincides with the lower bound. The lower bound analysis provides useful insights into the design and analysis of optimal or nearly optimal scheduling policies.

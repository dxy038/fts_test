In current trends, the central target of interest for multimedia applications is to meet the stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements for traffic flow over contention based MAC protocol of IEEE 802.11 WLAN. To achieve this objective, our paper proposes a connection admission control (CAC) policy, which attempts to maintain the flow of incoming traffic in the wireless network so as to effectively coordinate the medium in the midst of the challenging traffic sources so that wireless network operates in an optimum way, thereby sustaining the QoS requirements with better channel utilization. In this proposal, majority of the available bandwidth is allocated to real time sources (RT) (voice) and the remaining small portion is reserved for non real time (NRT) data traffic to meet the statistical QoS requirements, such as low delay and high throughput, for both the traffics (RT and NRT) over WLAN.

In this paper, a distributed generation based on stand alone wind energy conversion system (WECS) using a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) is proposed with a solid state voltage and frequency (VF) controller. A high efficiency WECS is realised using a PMSG driven by a wind turbine with a gear system. The controller consists of IGBTs (insulated gate bipolar transistors) based voltage source converter (VSC) with a battery energy storage system (BESS) at its dc link. The VF controller is having bidirectional power flow of both active and reactive power by which it controls both frequency and system voltage with varying consumer loads and wind speeds. The controller functions as a harmonic compensator and a load balancer along with voltage and frequency regulator. The neutral current in the three-phase four-wire distribution system is circulated locally using a zig-zag transformer. The proposed electro-mechanical system along with its VF controller and zig-zag transformer are modelled and simulated using MATLAB with its simulink and power system blockset tool boxes.

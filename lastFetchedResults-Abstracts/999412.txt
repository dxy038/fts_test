Background and Objective: ICU patients are in need ofneedy to medical and nursing services. According to Global estimates, the  ofmortality rate statistics are is high in these section wards because of deterioration of the patient and the severity of the disease. So The the gradinge systems are designed to predict improvingrecovery, mortality rate and classifying and mortality rate among of these patientsthese systems,. The SOFA scoring system is aone of these scoring systems case in point. So, the this study aim of the study iswas conducted  to determine the efficiency of SOFA scoring system on in predicting of mortality rate and stay length in intensive care unit for patients of alzahra hospital in Isfahan.

Materials and Method: This descriptive study was conducted on 107 patients in intensive care unit of Al-Zahra Hospital in 1391 2012 during a 4-month period through convenience sampling.. tThe instruments for gathering data gathering consisted of demographic information form and SOFA check list. For data analysis independent t-test and Pearson correlation were used.
      Results: The findings showed that there is significant difference between SOFA score at the beginning of admission and death of patient (t = 10.5,          P < 0.0001) and between the SOFA score on the following days and mortality rate (t = 13.3, P < 0.0001). But mortality rate in the beginning of admission was more significant than other days. There is significant relationship between sofa score in beginning of admission and stay lenght (P = 0.07, r = 0.25), but there is no significant relationship between SOFA score on the days after admission and length of stay (P = 0.14, r = 0.14).
    Conclusion: The result of current study showed that SOFA scoring system is appropriate instrument to predicting mortality rate and stay length of patients in intensive care unit.

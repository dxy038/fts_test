Selenium-enriched Candida utilis has attracted much attention due to its expanding application in food and feed additives. The objective of this study was to efficiently prepare selenium-enriched C. utilis and to investigate the effects of the prepared yeast on antioxidant capacity in rats. A batch culture of selenium-enriched C. utilis was first carried out, and the addition of sodium selenite (Na2SeO3) after all glucose had been consumed was found to favor higher intracellular glutathione and organic selenium content. Moreover, l-methionine boosted yeast cell growth and glutathione biosynthesis, and prevented glutathione from leaking to the extracellular space that can be caused by Na2SeO3. We therefore developed a two-stage culture strategy involving supplementation with l-methionine and Na2SeO3 at separate culture phases to improve the performance of selenized C. utilis. Using this two-stage culture strategy, intracellular glutathione content reached 18.6 mg/g and 15.5 mg/g, respectively, in batch and fed-batch systems, and organic selenium content reached 905.2 μg/g and 984.7 μg/g, respectively. The effects of selenium-enriched C. utilis on the activities of antioxidant related enzymes in rats were investigated, and the prepared selenium-enriched C. utilis was shown to be an optimal dietary supplement for enhancing antioxidant capacity in rats.

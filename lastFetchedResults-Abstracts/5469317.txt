A novel configuration which achieves TDMA (time division multiple access) functions on a connected bus topology for wide area applications, resulting in an integrated voice-data (IVD) transmission capability, a high throughput, connection portability for stations, and high reliability, is proposed. Loop LANs that are composed for multiple bus lines and operate synchronously with a demand-assignment function are presented. The delay time and throughput are derived, revealing that a wide area system with a loop length of less than 25 km can be achieved. It is verified that all the loop systems considered-bidirectional, partial bidirectional, and one-way, in that order-are much more attractive than any existing LAN system with regard to IVD capability, throughput performance, portability, and reliability

The paper presents the cost optimization of an underground gas storage (UGS), designed from lined rock caverns (LRC). The optimization is performed by the non-linear programming (NLP) approach. For this purpose, the NLP optimization model OPTUGS was developed. The model comprises the cost objective function, which is subjected to geomechanical and design constraints. The geotechnical problem is proposed to be solved simultaneously. Geomechanical rock mass parameters are determined from geological conditions of a selected suitable UGS location and a special FE model is generated. The rock mass strength stability and safety of the system are then analyzed for various combinations between different design parameters like inner gas pressures, cavern depths, cavern diameters and cavern wall thickness. As a result, geomechanical constraints are approximated and put into the optimization model OPTUGS. This way, the optimization enables not only the obtaining of an optimal solution but also that the rock mass achieves sufficient strength stability and safety. The optimization is proposed to be performed for the phase of preliminary design. The numerical example at the end of the paper demonstrates the efficiency of the introduced optimization approach.

We consider the problem of fitting a discrete curve to time-labeled data points on the set P<sub>n</sub> of all n-by-n symmetric positive-definite matrices. The quality of a curve is measured by a weighted sum of a term that penalizes its lack of fit to the data and a regularization term that penalizes speed and acceleration. The corresponding objective function depends on the choice of a Riemannian metric on P<sub>n</sub>. We consider the Euclidean metric, the Log-Euclidean metric and the affine-invariant metric. For each, we derive a numerical algorithm to minimize the objective function. We compare these in terms of reliability and speed, and we assess the visual appear ance of the solutions on examples for n = 2. Notably, we find that the Log-Euclidean and the affine-invariant metrics tend to yield similar-and sometimes identical-results, while the former allows for much faster and more reliable algorithms than the latter.

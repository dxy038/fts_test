When transmitting 32 kbit/s adaptive differential pulse code modulation (ADPCM) speech using Reed-Solomon error correction coding and 16 level quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM), a 20 slot packet reservation multiple access (PRMA) assisted cordless telecommunications (CT) scheme supported 36-38 speech users with negligible objective and subjective speech degradation. The average number of users per slot was nearly doubled due to deploying PRMA and toll quality speech was transmitted in a user bandwidth approximately 11.6 kHz. For a channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in excess of 25 dB, a Rayleigh fading channel and mobile speeds above 2 mph the speech segmental SNR degradation was less than 0.3 dB.

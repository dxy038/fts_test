In order to train distance learning students the discernment ability, teachers often suggest Web courseware on specific topics, such as controversial social issues, with different viewpoints. Traditional discriminating strategies based on simple keyword matching often lead to low accuracy of discrimination. This paper proposes a method called DRSA (discriminating via representative sentence assaying), which is based on a five-stage process: extracting representative phrases, calculating a characteristic array, mining a threshold array, objective judgment, and subjective judgment. Experimental results show that our algorithms are very efficient in discriminating documents into positive and negative views.

In this paper, we describe the synthesis of H<sup>infin</sup> state feedback controllers for linear tracking servo system of blu-ray disc drive. We consider the problems of designing the H<sup>infin</sup> state feedback controller. Controller problem are solved on the basic of the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. The sufficient conditions for the existence of controller and the H<sup>infin</sup> state feedback controller design methods are presented. The objective of the track servo system design for optical disc drives is to construct the system with better performance from various disturbances. We show that the resulting controller guarantees the asymptotic stability and disturbance attenuation of the closed loop.

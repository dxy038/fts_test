Optimal unit commitment is one of the key problems of electric power operation. The pure contract transaction mode is an operational mode of power generation market. This paper analyzes the new characteristics of unit commitment under the pure contract transaction mode of power generation market and establishes an optimal-resource-allocation-oriented mathematical optimization model with equality as the objective, in accordance with the fact that there are granularities of different magnitudes in the optimization model, a heuristic strategy is presented. The discussion of this problem is of great reference value both to the comparative research of efficiency and equality under this mode and to the further launch of studies on unit commitment under a mixed mode of futures and spots trade.

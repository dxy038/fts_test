We consider the problem of wavelength assignment in reconfigurable WDM networks with wavelength converters. We show that for N-node P-port bidirectional rings, a minimum number of <span class="MsoNormal" style="font-family:Arial">&#9484;</span>PN/4<span class="MsoNormal" style="font-family:Arial">&#9488;</span> wavelengths are required to support all possible connected virtual topologies in a rearrangeably nonblocking fashion, and provide an algorithm that meets this bound using no more than <span class="MsoNormal" style="font-family:Arial">&#9484;</span>PN/2<span class="MsoNormal" style="font-family:Arial">&#9488;</span> wavelength converters. This improves over the tight lower bound of <span class="MsoNormal" style="font-family:Arial">&#9484;</span>PN/3<span class="MsoNormal" style="font-family:Arial">&#9488;</span> wavelengths required for such rings given in if no wavelength conversion is available. We extend this to the general P-port case where each node i may have a different number of ports P<sub>i</sub>, and show that no more than <span class="MsoNormal" style="font-family:Arial">&#9484;</span>&#963;<sub>i</sub>P<sub>i</sub>/4<span class="MsoNormal" style="font-family:Arial">&#9488;</span>+1 wavelengths are required. We then provide a second algorithm that uses more wavelengths yet requires significantly fewer converters. We also develop a method that allows the wavelength converters to be arbitrarily located at any node in the ring. This gives significant flexibility in the design of the networks. For example, all <span class="MsoNormal" style="font-family:Arial">&#9484;</span>PN/2<span class="MsoNormal" style="font-family:Arial">&#9488;</span> converters can be collocated at a single hub node, or distributed evenly among the N nodes with min{<span class="MsoNormal" style="font-family:Arial">&#9484;</span>P/2<span class="MsoNormal" style="font-family:Arial">&#9488;</span>+1,P} converters at each node.

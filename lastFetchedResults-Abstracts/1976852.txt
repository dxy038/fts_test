Rapid development in information technology makes a profound revolution in giving services to users. Suitable data for the suitable data seeker in a suitable time is a basic slogan used by librarians and activists in information services to use it in order to make the slogan more objective. Electronic reference services, such as e-mail, chat, cell phones, etc. are the most suitable devices to answer the needs of library users.
The aim of this study was to identify the ability of librarians and the infrastructures required to provide electronic reference services in Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. In this regard, we measured the gap between the skills and the existing infrastructures as well as proper infrastructures and skills desired. 
Since similar experiences were not found in the previous researches, instruments like questionnaire and interview checklist were provided based on IFLA and RUSA guidelines and other related literature.
The study population were all librarians working in the reference services area, information and public services area in the libraries of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (32 persons). Interview was conducted with one of the administrative staff woking in  the Central Library. The checklist was completed with the help of the heads of libraries.

Meanwhile, only %28 believed that librarians have the necessary technology skills and nearly %50 believe that they have the searching skills. In this regard, more than %60 of librarians said they have suitable skills. Based on the findings, there is a deep gap between present and ideal situation in using information technology by librarians in its ideal form.

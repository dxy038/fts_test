This paper is concerned with multiobjective robust controller design using eigenstructure assignment for multi-variable control systems. It considers various performance indices (or cost functions) in the objectives, which are individual eigenvalue sensitivity functions, and the sensitivity and the complementary sensitivity functions in the frequency domain, instead of a single performance index for a control system. Based on these performance indices, the robustness criteria are expressed by a set of inequalities. The paper will make full use of the freedom provided by eigenstructure assignment to find a controller to satisfy the robustness criteria. A numerical algorithm for multi-objective optimization is developed.

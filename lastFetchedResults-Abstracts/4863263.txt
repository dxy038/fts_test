Wireless sensor network (WSN) has received intense attention in recent years and has been applied in many industrial and medical care areas. Based the OpenWSN platform, we design an intelligent parking system to help avoid the crowd jam of parking lot in city. Both theoretical analysis and practical simulation are presented in this paper. Due to energy limitations of wireless sensor networks and the objective circumstance of the parking lot, novel network protocols (MAC and NET lawyers) are proposed to handle the above situations. Detailed experimental design and simulation are evaluated in the experiment section to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the new scheme.

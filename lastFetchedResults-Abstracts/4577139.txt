Summary form only given. Open shutter photography provides beam size and position information along the entire beam propagation path. The objective of the present work is to validate this diagnostic against simultaneous optical and magnetic measurements. The 5-MeV, 20-kA, 40-ns Naval Research Laboratory SuperIBEX beam is first sent through an IFR (ion-focus regime) cell to radius tailor the beam. The beam is then centered by an active axial wire cell. Finally, the beam is injected into an air chamber, past sets of magnetic probes, before passing through a quartz Cerenkov converter. The open shutter photographs are scanned, digitized, and stored in an accessible image format. The open shutter radius data have been compared to those from gated-optical-imager frames and streak camera images. Open shutter images also provide measurements of the beam centroid movement that could be compared to magnetic probes.

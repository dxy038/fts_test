Treatment of Nutrition Related Diseases (NRD) mostly arising from imbalanced diet has an associated high economic cost globally. Planning meals and formulating a balanced diet are time consuming, complex routine decision making involving constraint satisfaction and meeting multi-part objective of the Recommended Dietary Intake (RDI). The authors have proposed DIligenS - Dietary Intelligence System to provide ubiquitous intelligence for automating the diet formulation and monitoring. DIligenS has a seven layered architecture consisting of knowledge base and inference engine, and necessary database. The meals scheduling, and diet formulation including consumption of food away from home is to be carried out within many constraints of budget, time, health, and individual preferences. This study investigates the applicability of Fuzzy Multicriteria Decision Making (FCDM) following the Prioritised Fuzzy Constraint Satisfaction Approach to computerise the inherently imprecise and vague user preferences for meals selection.

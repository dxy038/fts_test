In accordance with a new viewpoint of operating risk, probabilistic power system unit commitment is studied in this paper. The proposed approach takes the unit stochastic failure characteristics and uncertainty of load forecasts into account. With the prediction of operating risk, a dynamic programming model for daily unit commitment is established to minimize the objective function of spinning reserve throughout a day, and an algorithm is also proposed. A numerical example is given to illustrate the application of the proposed approach, and the results show that the approach and algorithm are both feasible and efficient.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Fast growing population of elderly people has recently been a serious issue in many countries and becomes a global concern in the world. Most elderly people require assistance in their daily life, including in maintaining their wellbeing, taking care of their health, or responding to emergency medical situations. The need for caring for elderly people, particularly to maintain their wellbeing, has been growing significantly. The objective of this research is to seek improvements in quality of life that can enhance the wellbeing of elderly people through innovations in information technology. This research is also expected to be a significant contribution for dealing with ageing population as a common issue in many countries. This paper deals with a pervasive health care technologies and ambient environment, which propose a model of Connected Technologies for Home Care for Elderly People (Contempo) to enhance the wellbeing of elderly people. A model of wellbeing assessment is also proposed to examine the proposed Contempo.

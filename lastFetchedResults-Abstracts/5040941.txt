In this paper ageing tests focussed on indoor switchgear respective on their core components are described. These tests aim at simulating severe environmental stresses and are recommended to be performed for switchgear which has to operate in a harsh indoor climate. Standardized and nonstandardized test procedures are compared on the basis of experimental experience. IEC Report 932 deals with requirements for enclosed switchgear and control gear from 1 kV to 72.5 kV, to be used in severe climatic indoor conditions and considers the environmental stress factor condensation and pollution. Different test procedures proposed in EEC Report 932 will be illustrated and relevant tests are performed on newly developed medium voltage switchgear NXAir P in the High Voltage Laboratories at Darmstadt University of Technology in cooperation with Siemens AG, Power Transmission and Distribution, Frankfurt. The objective or the presented paper is to evaluate the performance of the insulating components under harsh operating conditions by performing an ageing test.

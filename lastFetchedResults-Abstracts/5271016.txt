Finger Braille is one of tactual communication media of deafblind people. Deafblind people who are skilled in Finger Braille can catch up with speech conversation and express various emotions. Because there are small non-disabled people who are skilled in Finger Braille, deafblind people communicate only with interpreters. Objective of this study is development of a Finger Braille supporting device which assists not only verbal communication but also non-verbal (emotional) communication between deafblind people and non-disabled people who are not skilled in Finger Braille. In this paper, to develop emotion recognition system, we analyzed features of emotional expression (Neutral, Joy, Sadness and Anger) and derived an algorithm of emotion recognition using accelerometers worn by receiver. According to the results of discriminant analysis, it was considered that emotion recognition using the discriminant functions by standardized data and the average of posterior probabilities in a sentence was possible and independent of sentences.

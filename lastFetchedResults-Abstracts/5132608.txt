The objective of this study is to explore the relation between oxidative stress and DNA-protein crosslink formation caused by formaldehyde (FA) inhalation in mice liver. 15 Kun Ming mice were divided into 3 groups: control group, 3.0 mg/m<sup>3</sup> gaseous FA inhaled group, 3.0 mg/m<sup>3</sup> gaseous FA and lipoic acid (LA) treated group. The content of reduced glutathione (GSH) and the content of DPC were measured after the treatment for 3d. The content of GSH in liver cells declined significantly and the content of DPC increased significantly after inhaled with 3.0 mg/m<sup>3</sup> gaseous FA. The content of GSH and DPC were both recovered to control group after treated with 3.0 mg/m<sup>3</sup> gaseous FA inhalation and LA injection. LA injection could inhibit the formation of DPC in mice liver after exposure to FA. It is suggested that DPC formation in mice liver may be related with oxidative damage.

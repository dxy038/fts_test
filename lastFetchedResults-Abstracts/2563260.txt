Introduction: Coronary artery disease (CAD), is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the world and more focused among the researchers. For this reason, novel risk factors for CAD, such as serum iron in the form of serum ferritin levels have been emphasized. Excessive serum iron can increase risk of CAD by the production of free radicals and incorporation into lipid peroxidation.
Objective: To investigate the relationship between serum ferritin level and severity of obstructive CAD.
Materials and Methods: This analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on 400 patients with CAD, referred to Rasht Heshmat Heart Hospital from September of 2014 to March of 2015. Demographic information, serum ferritin level with other blood markers was collected before angiography and the severity of vessel involvement was evaluated afterwards. Data analysis was done using Mann-Whitney, Kendall tau and Spearman correlation coefficient tests. 
Results: The median age of patients was 58 years and 56% were male. The median of serum ferritin level in women and men was 74 and 95 Âµg/dl, respectively (p < .001). There was no relationship between serum ferritin level and the severity of CAD in all patients and subgroups (P > .05 for all)
Conclusion: In this study, no significant relationship was observed between serum ferritin level and severity of obstructive CAD. Further investigations are needed to consolidate the finding.

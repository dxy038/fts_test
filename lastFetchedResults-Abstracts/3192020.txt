This paper presents an objective approach to wage adjustments and raise calculations using regression and multiple goal linear modeling. The model comprehends key input items and constraints such as available budget, Human Resource max/min guidelines, employee ranking, existing salary, and deviation from &#8220;target&#8221; salary. The model rewards employee performance by weighting adjustments/raises based on peer ranking while making sure all budgetary constraints are maintained.

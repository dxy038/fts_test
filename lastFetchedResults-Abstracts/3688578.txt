GSI, Darmstadt is preparing to build FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research) which include SIS 300, a 300T - m fast-ramping heavy ion synchrotron. Dipoles for this ring will be 2.9 m long, producing 6 T over a 100 mm coil aperture and ramped at 1 T/s. The cable for these dipoles must have low losses and produce acceptable field distortions during the fast ramp. We plan to achieve this objective by using fine (~ 3 mum) filaments of NbTi in a wire with an interfilamentary matrix of CuMn to reduce proximity coupling and increase the transverse resistivity. The Rutherford cable have a thin stainless steel core and the wires will be coated with SnAg solder which has been oxidized, using a recipe similar to that developed at CERN, to increase the adjacent strand resistance Ra. Measurements of crossover strand resistance Re and Ra in cored cable with oxidized SnAg coating will be presented, together with data on critical current, persistent current magnetization and eddy current coupling in a wire with ultra fine filaments and a CuMn matrix in the interfilamentary region of the wire. These data will be used to predict losses and field distortion in the SIS 300 dipole and optimize the final design of cable for FAIR.

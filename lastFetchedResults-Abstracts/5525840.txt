The paper proposes a quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) based multiuser detection for the antenna-diversity-aided multicarrier code-division multiple-access (MC-CDMA) systems. Due to the spatial receive-diversity, the received signals at the different antennas are faded independently, resulting in an independent log-likelihood function (LLF) for each receive-antenna. To resolve the multi-objective dilemma when choosing one signal estimation for multiple receive-antenna-branches, the proposed scheme updates each quantum particle in a Pareto optimal way. Simulations and comparisons with the QPSO of linear combining strategy and the maximum likelihood detection (MLD) verified the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

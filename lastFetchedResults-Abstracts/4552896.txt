In the last few years, the management systems which control the mobile location are becoming more important due to the increase in the number of mobile users. From among the location management techniques, the use of Location Areas is an important strategy which defines the location management task as an optimization problem with two conflicting costs that must be minimized: subscriber location update and paging. In this work, we resort to a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2), to obtain quasi-optimal solutions of this optimization problem. Furthermore, we compare our results with those obtained by mono-objective algorithms of other authors because, at present, there is not any previous work that tackles the problem with a multi-objective approach. Results show the advantages of solving the Location Areas scheme by using a multi-objective approach.

Introduction & Objective: Deaf children have special emotional reactions, Understanding these characteristics and problems can help medical and paramedical professionals, parents and teachers to reach the purpose of behavioral adaptability.The present study was performed in order to recognize disorders, emotional problems and functions of deaf children compared with normal children in emotional components of anxiety, depression, aggression, impulsiv-ity and lack of compromise.
Materials & Methods: In order to recognize emotional disorders and problems of deaf children, sample groups of 120 male and female patients (60 deaf children and 60 children with nor-mal hearing with equal number of male and female) enrolled in primary schools of Hamadan province were selected by multi stage randomly sampling in this casual_comparative study. House-Tree-Person (HTP) and Draw-A-Person tests (DAP) were used to determine their emotional problems.
Results:Our results indicate that in terms of parameters related to the two tests (distance of three components of each other ,anxiety, aggression, depression and impulsivity and lack of compromise), participants' overall scores in two tests by major scales such as anxiety (?=0.01, P <  0.05; 3.48, 3.13) aggression (?= 0.05 , 0.01, P <  0.05; 6.12 ,3.97) depression (?=0.05 P < 0.05 ; 3.75,3.81) , impulsivity (?=0.05, 0.01, P < 0.05 ; 3.47, 3.01) and lack of compromise (?=0.05, 0.01, P < 0.05; 4.89, 4.95) are significantly different from each other.
Conclusion:The deaf children in terms of denotative parameters related to the two tests are sig-nificantly different from normal children; and the overall scores obtained on each of the scales generally show a significant difference with normal children,In the deaf group with regard to gender variable (male and female) significant differences in some of the scales such as distance of three components of each other ,anxiety, aggression, depression and lack of compromise iare observed between the deaf boys and girls.

Introduction: P thalassemia is genetic disorders in p globin chain production. There is either a complete absence of P globin chain production or a partial reduction. In bone marrow, thalassemic mutations disrupt the maturation of red blood cells, resulting in ineffective erythropoiesis and disrupt of red blood cells in spleen causes severe hemolytic anemia in P thalassemia major Patients. Transfusion therapy can lead to normal life expectancy but also exposes Patients to the risks of iron over load and transfusion - transmitted viruse. (Especially HCV) these Patients need for effective anti viral therapy in addition to regular iron chelation.
Objective: Evaluation of correlation between iron over load and the response of chronic hepatitis C In thalassemia major Patients treat with alfa- interferon and ribavirin.
Materials and Methods: We enrolled 30 Patients with p thalassemia major and chronic hepatitis C who referred to clinic of hematology from December 1998 to April 2006. HIC was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy before treatment. Hepatitis C virus, genotype, viral load, were analyzed. Multiple variables were analyzed by SPSS (15)
Results: Among the 30 Patients, 17 cases (56.7%) were male and 13 cases (43.3%) female. HIC was determined on a liver biopsy specimen. This study showed that HIC was not correlated to a therapeutic response.(p =1). Evaluation of correlation between viral load and therapeutic response showed that viral load was not correlated to a therapeutic response (p= 0.414). Among the 30 Patients, 24 cases (80%) had genotype la and 6 cases (20%) had genotype 3a and genotyping was not correlated to a therapeutic response. (p=0.068). Gender and HIC were not correlated to a therapeutic response. (Male p=0.226) and (female p= 0.199).
Conclusion: In this study HIC, genotyping, viral load and gender were not correlated to a therapeutic response and it does not need chelation therapy before anti viral therapy.

The matching design problem of the ship-engine-propeller is a non-linear constrained multi-objective optimization problem which is performed based on multiple objectives,such as system efficiency and the life cycle cost. A multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) approach for matching design problem of the ship-engine-propeller problem is presented in this paper.A real matching design problem of the ship-engine-propeller is employed to demonstrate applicability of the proposed approach.The results indicate that multi-objective particle swarm optimization approach in comparison with most of multi-objective optimization algorithms such as the multiple objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is simple ,efficient and operable.

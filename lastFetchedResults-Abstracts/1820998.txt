Objective
n I/II of mutans streptococcus (MS) is a surface protein, which binds to salivary receptors. The objective of this study was to study the effect of a peptide corresponding to residues 1025–1044 of antigen I/II and a dentifrice containing peptide on the adherence of MS.
s
ptide was synthesized and included into dentifrice. Anti-adherence experiments of the peptide and a dentifrice containing it were processed in vitro and in vivo.
s
sults showed that the adherence of MS to hydroxyapatite was inhibited by synthetic antigen I/II peptide and also by a dentifrice containing the peptide in vitro. The numbers of MS in plaque from subjects treated with dentifrices containing the peptide for 1 month was significantly reduced compared to baseline (log 3.11 ± 0.80 vs log 4.09 ± 0.90, P &lt; 0.01), whereas the control group showed no reduction.
sion
herence of MS to hydroxyapatite was inhibited by both a synthetic peptide and a dentifrice containing the peptide. The peptide dentifrice produced a significant reduction of MS in dental plaque in vivo.

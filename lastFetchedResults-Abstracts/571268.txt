Introduction & Objective: Interstitial lung disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with scleroderma. For this reason an early diagnosis of lung involvement is warranted. The best approach to detect pulmonary disease particularly alveolitis (inflammatory NSIP) as a reversible phase is controversial. The aim of this study is estimating the advantage of HRCT as a noninvasive screening test to detect the pattern of ILD related to systemic sclerosis.
Materials & Methods: In this cross sectional study, 52 patients with scleroderma who referred to rheumatologic medical center from 2010 to 2011 were evaluated for ILD by the use of history, physical examination, CXR and HRCT. Finally, all the data were analyzed using SPSS13 software.
Results: HRCT was normal in 21 patients (40.4%), and NSIP in 19 patients (36.5%) and UIP in 12 patients (23.1%) were reported. CXR was normal in 19 (36.5%) and mild reticular pattern in 15 (28.8%), overt reticular pattern in 14 (26.9%) and honey combing in 4 (7.7%) were seen. HRCT findings were abnormal in 6(11.5%) patients without dyspnea, 22(42.3%) without cough, 20(38.4%) without crackle in lung auscultation and 26(50%) without clubbing in physical examination. In 2(3.8%) patients no pulmonary signs and symptoms UIP were reported.
Conclusion: HRCT is a noninvasive method to detect lung involvement in early phases independent of presence or absence of pulmonary signs and symptoms.

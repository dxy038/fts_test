The dividing wall column (DWC) has gained increasing application in a variety of chemical processes because of its potentiality in energy and capital cost savings in multicomponent separations. The main objective in this work is investigation of its use for removing the bottleneck phenomenon within the column when increasing the throughput of an existing distillation process, particularly, the acetic acid (AA) purification process. Optimal column sequence design, involving both conventional and DWC, is considered. The internal recycle flow distribution around the dividing wall was investigated as a primary optimizing variable. Several column arrangements were analyzed to show that the DWC requires less investment and energy costs than conventional distillation, the Petlyuk column, or the prefractionator arrangement.

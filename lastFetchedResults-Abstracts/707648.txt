Computed tomography has had a questionable role in diagnosing blunt aortic injury (BAI). The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of helical computed tomography of the thorax (HCTT) for detection of BAI. Trauma Registry data and medical records were reviewed for 2,854 patients admitted over a 32-month period. A total of 243 patients were identified at risk for BAI. Patients were evaluated for BAI because of chest radiograph, physical examination, or clinical suspicion. Eleven of 2,834 patients sustained BAI. Of 243 patients who sustained blunt torso trauma, 232 patients underwent HCTT. Eleven underwent aortography without HCTT. Sixteen patients had an abnormal HCTT, revealing 9 patients with BAI. No delayed BAI were encountered. HCTT effectively screens for BAI. Aortography can be more specifically applied as a diagnostic study when preceded by HCTT. HCTT should not be used as solitary study for BAI as some injuries identified by HCTT do not represent BAI.

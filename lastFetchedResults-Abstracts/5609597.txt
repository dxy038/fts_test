A multistep electricity price model with bidirectional regulation is proposed for large adjustable consumers in the area with abundant hydropower. In order to guide large consumers to regulate electricity consumption manners for resource utilization, down-steps price in high water period and up-steps price in low flow period are suggested. In the proposed model, the objective is to maximize power consumption in high water period and minimize power in low flow period and the constraints include acceptable index of consumers, generation capacity and cost and transmission capability. Monte Carlo simulation is used to calculate the optimal partition of price steps. The results of simulation show that the model can mitigate the imbalance between supply and demand in high and low water period.

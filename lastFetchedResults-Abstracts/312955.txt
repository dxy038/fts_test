Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the predictability of the relationships between gait speed and common peak sagittal plane parameters in order to provide a set of reference parameter values. Design: Lower extremity biomechanical data were collected in 64 healthy adults while walking barefoot at his/her comfortable walking speed, then at self-selected fast, slow and very slow speeds. Twenty seven peak joint parameter values were plotted and regressed as a function of gait speed. Discussion: While most parameters change with increasing gait speed, in general, the kinetic parameters had better predictability than the kinematic parameters. Most of the power parameters were found to have a quadratic relationship with gait speed. Of the moment parameters, four had a linear relationship with gait speed, while four had a quadratic one. These relationships shown in the tables and graphs here can be used as a reference for ‘normal’ gait parameter values.

Previously, mini-fiber-node (mFN) technology has been proposed to upgrade existing cable TV (CATV) systems to provide bidirectional, broadband capabilities.

This allows cable operators to simultaneously add additional broadcast and narrowcast digital video services and install bidirectional services cost effectively, without affecting existing services.

This work describes ongoing work for measuring the performance of an application running on a machine, where this measurement takes a fraction of the time required to run the application itself thoroughly. We call it Performance Software Probe. The objective is to have knowledge of this machine/application performance previous to the execution, and without the need to even install this application on the machine to characterize. Our goal is to enhance efficiency of master/worker applications on highly heterogeneous multiclusters, where the available machines - and their respective performance indexes - are not known until the time we have them available for execution.

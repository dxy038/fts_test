The vigorous development of 3D technology has improved the photography technology of stereo cameras constantly. However, there are no widely recognized objective evaluation criteria for stereo camera shooting quality under different shooting parameters and shooting distances. At the same time, no shooting guideline can be used for reference when people take stereoscopic images. To solve this problem, we propose the objective evaluation criteria of shooting quality of two types of stereo cameras (parallel and toed-in camera configurations) under three shooting conditions (macro shooting, short, and long distance shooting). In our work, several prominent evaluation factors are built by analyzing the characteristics of each shooting condition. Based on the effective five-point scale used in our subjective experiments, the relationships between shooting factors and shooting quality are obtained and then effectively integrated together to build the overall evaluation criteria. Finally, extensive experiments have been conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively evaluate the shooting quality of stereo cameras.

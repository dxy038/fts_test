This Multiscale Integration of Manufacturing and Assembly Processes (MIMAP) demonstration project investigates the integration of two or more Thrust Area Groups (TAGs) by creating a flow of information and processes from two areas of research. The control theory research of two different controllers for diffusion furnaces used in semiconductor manufacturing which predict a specific window of machine failure, the mean-time-before-failure (MTBF). The objective is to increase yield, decrease cycle time, work-in-progress (WIP) and production costs. A global factory Minimum Inventory Variability Scheduling policy (MIVP(R)), used to decrease cycle time and cycle time variance when compared to a first-in-first-out (FIFO) scheduling policy, was used to make the comparisons between the two inner and outer loop controllers. The projectÂ´s Cross Cutting Methodologies (CCMs) is ensured by the participation of faculty from three different colleges (LAS, CEAS, and CTAS) and two electrical engineering doctoral students

A new demosaicked image postprocessing method for single-sensor imaging devices is introduced. The method is capable of removing visual demosaicking artifacts in the restored, full color images obtained by cost-effective color filter array interpolators. The utilization of the normalized color-ratio model and the original underlying Bayer pattern structure allows for the removal of false colors and eliminates color shifts introduced during demosaicking. At the same time, it yields excellent improvements in terms of objective image quality measures. Moreover, the computational simplicity of the method suggests that it can be effectively implemented either in hardware or software.

The work presented in This work focuses on the development of a ´proof-of-concept´ fuel cell vehicle prototype using a dynamometer-based test bench. The main objective of this work is the validation of design ideas regarding the combination of two different energy storage devices (i.e., batteries and ultracapacitors) into an ESU for the power management of this vehicle. The implemented prototype is a simplified and scale-down version of the designed vehicle; however, the measured results show that the vehicle could greatly benefit from the combination of energy sources that are different in nature such as batteries and ultracapacitors.

Objective
We measured maternal serum soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 concentrations across pregnancy and immediately postpartum in women who developed preeclampsia and normal pregnant women.
Study design
This was a nested case control study of 113 normal pregnant women and 55 women with preeclampsia.
Results
Serum soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 concentrations increased similarly in early pregnancy in both groups. Mean serum soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 concentrations were increased in women who developed preeclampsia, compared with normal pregnant women, and this increase was most pronounced in severe preeclampsia. However, many women with preeclampsia had soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 concentrations similar to normal pregnant women. Lastly, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 decreased rapidly after delivery, but this decrease was significantly slower in women with severe preeclampsia.
Conclusion
Increased soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 is not an early-pregnancy event among women who later develop preeclampsia. Increased soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 is more likely to be present in women with severe preeclampsia, but it is not present in all women with preeclampsia. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 concentrations decrease more slowly after delivery in women with preeclampsia, consistent with a decreased rate of excretion or continued production.

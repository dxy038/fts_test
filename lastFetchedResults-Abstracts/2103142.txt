Mastitis is ranked as the top disease for dairy cattle based on traditional cost analysis. Greater than 100 organisms from a broad phylogenetic spectrum are able to cause bovine mastitis. Transcriptomic characterization facilitates our understanding of hostâ€“pathogen relations and provides mechanistic insight into host resistance to mastitis. In this review, we discuss effector mechanisms and transcriptomic changes within the mammary gland in response to experimental infections. We compare temporal, spatial and pathogen-specific local transcriptomic disruptions in the mammary gland as well as pathogen-induced systemic responses and transcriptional changes in distant organs. We attempt to explain why studies on transcriptomic changes during critical physiological periods and in response to non-mastitic pathogens may have important implications for mastitis studies. Future perspectives on revealing bidirectional molecular cross-talk between mastitis pathogens and host cells using cutting-edge genomic technologies are also discussed.

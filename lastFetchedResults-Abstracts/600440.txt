Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate aggressive and angry behavior in patients with fifth metacarpal neck fracture and to analyze the anger management style of these patients and their response to psychological support. Methods: This study included 30 patients (mean age: 24.8 years) who presented to the emerÂ¬gency room with fractures of the fifth metacarpal neck and 30 healthy control subjects (mean age: 28.7 years). All subjects were evaluated with the Spielberger state-trait anger scale and the 30 subjects with the fifth metacarpal neck fractures completed the Turkish version of Barratt impulsiveness scale and semi-structured data form to assess anger level before the trauma and willingness to receive psychological support. Results: In the metacarpal fracture group, 60% of injuries were caused by hitting the hand against a wall and 40% by hitting the hand in a fight. The non-planning impulsiveness score of Barratt impulsiveness scale was higher in the injured group. There was no significant difference between the Spielberger state-trait anger scores of the injured and control groups. High scores in the subsection that measures impulsiveness that requires attention were found in 82% of patients. Conclusion: Impulsive anger behavior is a common cause for fractures of the fifth metacarpal neck. Patients with these types of injuries often have difficulty controlling and directing their anger and often refuse psychiatric support. We believe that the hand surgeon should focus on the psycho-social problems of patients, and if necessary patients should be treated by a psychiatrist to prevent late psychopathologies for health promotion.

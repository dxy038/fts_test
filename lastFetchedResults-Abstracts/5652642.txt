The Solar Energy Management System (SEMS) was developed by Honeywell while under contract to the Department of Energy/LBL. The contractual objective was to develop an alternative to the typical residential solar system controller -- a controller that is simply a collection of differential thermostats and logic relays. Honeywell´s unique SEMS controller is a microprocessor-based system that capitalizes on the extensive logic and computational capability of today´s microprocessor technology to provide a general-purpose, flexible solar energy management system.

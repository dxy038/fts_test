An approach to solving the short-term unit commitment problem (UCP) using a neural-based tabu search (NBTS) is presented. The solution of the unit commitment problem is a complex optimisation problem. The exact solution of the UCP can be obtained by a complete enumeration of all feasible combinations of generating units, which could be a huge number. The unit commitment has commonly been formulated as a nonlinear, large-scale, mixed-integer combinational optimisation problem. The objective is to find the generation scheduling such that the total operating cost can be minimised, when subjected to a variety of constraints. This also means that it is desirable to find the optimal generating unit commitment in the power system for the next H hours. Tabu search is a powerful optimisation procedure that has been successfully applied to a number of combinatorial optimisation problems. It has the ability to avoid entrapment in local minima by employing a flexible memory system. The neural network combines good solution quality for tabu search with rapid convergence for an artificial neural network. The neural based tabu search method is used to find the unit commitment. By doing so, it gives the optimum solution rapidly and efficiently. The Neyveli Thermal Power Station (NTPS) Unit-II in India has been considered as a case study and extensive studies have also been performed for different power systems consisting of 10, 26, and 34 generating units. The data collected has been used for implementation in the above methods. Numerical results are shown, comparing the cost solutions and computation time obtained by using the intelligent techniques with the conventional methods like dynamic programming and Lagrangian relaxation to reach proper unit commitment.

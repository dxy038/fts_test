In todayÂ´s telecommunications market there is a clear trend to adopt a flexible infrastructure to minimize costs and facilitate the introduction of new services. Typical examples are represented by dynamically managed packet-based next generation IP networks (NGN) and 4G mobile networks. In general the rate of success of these new networks will depend on whether they can deliver at least the same quality of service (QoS) than the networks they replace at lower overall cost. Voice quality represents a major dimension of perceived QoS. Measures that predict voice quality are essential in monitoring and managing the performance of such networks. Traditionally the perceived quality of voice has been evaluated by expensive and time-consuming subjective listening tests. Several attempts have been made to supplement subjective tests with objective estimators of voice quality. From the viewpoint of the measurement procedure, objective voice quality estimation methodologies can be categorized either as speech-layer objective models or packet-layer objective models

This article gives a comprehensive introduction to the field of Wireless Sensors and Controllers Network in industry by means of a laboratory-based course developed at the University of Patras - Greece. The parallel enrollment with theoretical and experimental tasks is the main direction of the corresponding educational process. Therefore, a series of lectures outline theoretical issues about networking in industry, emphasizing the integration of wireless technology. Furthermore, students´ training over the concept of a hybrid network between a Wireless Sensor Network and a PLC one fulfills the objective of the course. The philosophy of this educational implementation is first pointed out, followed by the lectures´ content and the laboratory practice.

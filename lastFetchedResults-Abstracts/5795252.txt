A fuzzy neural network based approach to 3-D heart motion understanding is proposed. Knowledge from cardiologists is used to specify different classes of motion and classification rules. The objective of this approach is to find the decisions for all possible classes of motion in the form of possibilities. Experiments on real data have been conducted to corroborate the proposed techniques

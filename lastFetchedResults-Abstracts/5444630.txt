The paper, based on the fuzzy question of the multi-objective ore blending, firstly, gives the solving analysis of its characteristics and complication. Then, the two-step fuzzy optimization algorithm is designed based on the sequence of linguistic satisfaction. The algorithm places weight on the improvement of optimality and importance model. Ultimately, a simulation study is conducted through a mine ore blending example. The effectiveness, flexibility, and sensitivity of algorithm are verified. Which overcome the solving difficulty in applying the multi-objective planning to the ore blending, and a practical, great universal method or means for the ore blending is explored.

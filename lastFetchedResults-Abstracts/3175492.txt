The structure of wheel reducer will be damaged easily after being used a period of time if not consider the fatigue life of gears during the design. Nowadays minimum volume is the objective to most wheel reducer optimization design which ignores the influence of the fatigue life. The fatigue life of gears was studied and ROMAX which has the function of gears fatigue life analysis was used to the optimization design of wheel reducer to solve the problem in this paper, taking 60T electric wheels articulated truck wheel reducer as an example.

The objective or our research was to obtain refractory alloys using the high-power diode laser (HPDL) coating technique. After optimisation using factorial experiments, two different cladding regimes were clearly distinguished. It was also shown that a very narrow transition zone exists between the two regimes, and, inside this zone, clad layers having a satisfactory compromise between the response functions (surface aspect and cavity presence) were obtained. The main objective of our study, namely, the control of the operating parameters (geometrical and kinematical) to realise adequate coatings, without cavities and having a good surface aspect (for a thickness &gt;1 mm), was also achieved using factorial experiments.

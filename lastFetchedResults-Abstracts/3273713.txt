Recently it was shown, that proposed simplicial partition based DISIMPL algorithm gives very competitive results to well known DIRECT algorithm for standard test functions and performs particularly well when the search space and the numbers of local and global optimizers may be reduced by avoiding symmetries. However, the simplicial partition has a cost (except for the case where the original feasible region is a simplex): in order to use simplicial partitions hyper-rectangular feasible region should be covered by simplices. After initial covering 2n objective function evaluations is performed for DISIMPL-V and n! for DISIMPL-C. This limits DISIMPL method to rather small dimensional problems. To increase the applicability of the DISIMPL algorithm to higher dimensional problems a parallel DISIMPL for multicore computers was created and investigated in this paper. The efficiency of the developed parallel algorithm is investigated solving up to 55 dimensional optimal design of grillage-type foundations "black-box" optimization problem.

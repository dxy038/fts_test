The objective of the study is to find out how employees perceive the organizational culture in
three leading IT companies. It is an exploratory research. A primary research was conducted
through an administration of a structured questionnaire. The sample size is 165 consisting
of employees from three leading IT organizations in India. Involvement and Adaptability are
indicators of flexibility, openness and responsiveness; which are strong indicators of growth.
Mission and Consistency are indicators of driving direction, integration and vision, and are
strong indicators of profitability and efficiency. These four traits of organisational culture if
monitored and harmoniously used are the key to ensure high performance within the
organisations. Aligning culture and leadership goals are keys to organisational success. All
the four dimensions of organisational culture are heavily influenced by leadership based
interventions in an organisation.

ABSTARCT: Objective: Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis in the old adults especially in women. Knee OA associated with pain and stiffness of the joint and decreased range of motion. Furthermore, difficulty of the knee motion and postural control in knee OA patients increased risk of falling. Although knee OA is a degenerative diseases and progress with aging, it can be prevented to deteriorate by exercise. Hence, the aim of this study was investigation the effects of water exercise on falling risk, ROM and knee pain in elderly women with knee OA.
Methods: 30 elderly women with knee OA over 60 years old voluntarily participated in present study. Knee pain was evaluated by KOOâ€™s questionnaire. Using Berg questionnaire, the falling risk was evaluated. Range of motion (ROM) of the knee joint was actively assessed using a standard goniometer. Then the subjects were divided into experimental and control groups randomly. Experimental group underwent a 12weeks (three sessions per week) water exercise program. The control groups did not participate in any training program. The evaluations were repeated after the treatment sessions. Within group comparisons was carried out by paired t-tests, where between groups comparisons was performed by t test for independent samples.  Statistical significance was set at an alpha of p  <  0.05. The data were analyzed using the statistical package SPSS, PC program, version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., USA).
Results: After water exercise ROM Improved significantly (p=0.01). Also water exercise reduced the falling risk (p=0.001) and knee pain (P= 0.04). 
Conclusions: exercise in the water, where it declines weight bearing and stress on the joints, due to increase ROM, decline the knee OA pain and then risk of fall. This water exercise program recommended for rehabilitation of elderly with knee OA.

The paper provided herein aims at investigating two state-of-the-art publicly available full-reference video quality assessment metrics, particularly with regard to high-definition video data. Concretely, we will concentrate on the performance of the Multi-Scale Structural Similarity index (MS-SSIM) and the NTIA General Video Quality Metric (VQM) compared to the still widely used Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) to answer the question which metric is better suited to automatically assess the quality of a given video. Evaluation is done on progressive video material of three different video quality databases. The paper also performs a detailed examination of the evaluation methodology of objective video quality metrics itself aiming at a better reproducibility and comparability of results.

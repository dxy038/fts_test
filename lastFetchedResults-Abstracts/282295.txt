This study was designed with a double objective: (1) testing the replicability of the three, four and five factor personality structure proposed by Zuckerman et al. (1993) and (2) testing which of the three models obtain the better goodness-of-fit to the data using structural equation modelling analysis. The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised, the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Inventory Form III-Revised, and the NEO-Personality Inventory-Revised were applied to a sample of 1006 Spanish University students. Different statistical techniques such as Exploratory Factor Analysis (with Varimax and Procrustes rotation methods) and Confirmatory Factor Analyses were used. Comparative results show that the three, four and five-factor structures obtained on the Zuckerman's study and the current data are very similar, demonstrating their cross-cultural replicability. Results of the CFA show that the simple structures of the three different models obtained unsatisfactory fit indices, although after introducing modifications these improve acceptably. None of the three models was clearly superior. We discuss the relationships among Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Psychoticism.

The main objective of this project is to design a comprehensive tool that performs technical and economical analysis for building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV). This tool will be used to propose a BIPV villa design for the UAE real-state market. MATLAB-based tool was designed to perform a full technical and economical analysis for grid-tied PV systems. The designed tool carries out number of consecutive technical analysis procedures. A large database that includes various PV modules and inverters is used. The developed tool is flexible and can be easily adapted to changes in PV technologies and weather data worldwide.

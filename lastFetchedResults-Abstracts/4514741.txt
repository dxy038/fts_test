Near Field Communication (NFC), as one of the promising technological developments, provides means to short range contactless communication for mobile phones and other devices alike. NFC has become an attractive design science research area for many academicians due to its exploding growth. A better understanding of the current status of NFC research is necessary to identify the gap between theory and practice. In this paper, we evaluate NFC literature from a design science point of view and seven important guidelines of the design science research are employed for evaluating some of the NFC related studies which propose innovative artifacts. Design science perspective of NFC literature gives beneficial guidelines for future studies. This rigorous and holistic literature review with the objective of bringing to the state-of-art in NFC design science research provides advancement of knowledge in NFC research and further research directions.

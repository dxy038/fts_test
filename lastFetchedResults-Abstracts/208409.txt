In the progress of international capital mobility, most countries have taken long
steps toward economic openness and FDI attraction to benefit further from
international transactions. The objective of this research is thus to explore the role of
economic openness in trade flows through its interacted effect on FDI inflows.
Hence, a trade model is specified and estimated by the panel data method using data
for 24 selected Asian-Pacific countries, which includes 12 East Asia-Pacific
countries and 12 countries from the West Asia, over 1995-2005. According to the
empirical result obtained, the interacted effect of openness and FDI on exports of
sample countries has been significantly positive during the period under
consideration. Therefore, an implication is that developing countries like Iran
should move substantially toward outward-orientation strategy III order to facilitate
conditions for deepening trade relations with their trade partners.

Creative problem solving (CPS) is a multi-step method for solving problems in various disciplines that can support students in the learning of mathematics. Although CPS is cooperative in nature and is most productive when done as a team, CPS cannot utilize the full potential of teamwork to connect and share ideas among groups in the process of solving problems. Cooperative learning (CL) has additional elements designed to develop groups into a learning community. Both CL and CPS elements are combined to create a problem solving framework to guide students through the CPS cycle according to CL principles and to transform group discussions to class discussions. The main objective of this study is to propose a cooperative creative problem solving (CCPS) framework to support student problem solving in engineering mathematics. The designed framework can encourage engineering students to learn mathematics in their teams and overall class discussion.

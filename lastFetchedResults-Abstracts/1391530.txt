In formulating mathematical models for dynamical systems, obtaining a high degree of qualitative correctness (i.e. predictive capability) may not be the only objective. The model must be useful for its intended application, and models of reduced complexity are attractive in many cases where time-consuming numerical procedures are required. This paper discusses the derivation of discrete low-dimensional models for the nonlinear vibration analysis of thin cylindrical shells. In order to understand the peculiarities inherent to this class of structural problems, the nonlinear vibrations and dynamic stability of a circular cylindrical shell subjected to static and dynamic loads are analyzed. This choice is based on the fact that cylindrical shells exhibit a highly nonlinear behavior under both static and dynamic loads. Geometric nonlinearities due to finite-amplitude shell motions are considered by using Donnell's nonlinear shallow-shell theory. A perturbation procedure, validated in previous studies, is used to derive a general expression for the nonlinear vibration modes and the discretized equations of motion are obtained by the Galerkin method using modal expansions for the displacements that satisfy all the relevant boundary and symmetry conditions. Next, the model is analyzed via the Karhunen–Loève expansion to investigate the relative importance of each mode obtained by the perturbation solution on the nonlinear response and total energy of the system. The responses of several low-dimensional models are compared. It is shown that rather low-dimensional but properly selected models can describe with good accuracy the response of the shell up to very large vibration amplitudes.

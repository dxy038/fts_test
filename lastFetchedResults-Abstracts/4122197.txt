The main objective of this paper is to provide an efficient computational model for fast and accurate calculation of electromagnetically induced vibrations in electrical machines. Although a three-phase permanent-magnet synchronous machine has been used in this paper, the same methodology can be extended to other types of electric machinery. A brief comparison between the different methods for structural analysis in electrical machines is introduced. The method proposed in this paper uses finite-element analysis in order to extract the impulse responses that are used in calculating the vibration. A field reconstruction method is used for the electromagnetic field analysis.

The paper presents a new technique for speed control of a 3-phase induction motor (IM) based on the adaptive control theory and vector method. A fictitious current is selected to construct the field oriented control system. The field oriented control is achieved by adjusting the magnitude and angular frequency of the rotor flux linkage simultaneously. The objective of the proposed controlled system is to achieve rotor speed control, field orientation control and constant flux control. The adverse phenomena which is caused due to the parameter variations and unmodelled dynamics of the IM, is cured by the least-squares algorithm with reference model includes the optimal rotor angular velocity and the optimal two components of the rotor flux linkage current. The design procedural of the adaptive controller, parameters estimation, and constructing the MRACS are investigated in this paper. The robustness and applicability, of the proposed controller are investigated by digital computer simulation results

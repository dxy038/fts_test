Objective: We sought to determine the incidence of unsuspected injury to the lower urinary tract as detected by intraoperative cystoscopy when the Burch procedure is performed. Study Design: We reviewed the records of 181 women who underwent pelvic surgery, which included a Burch retropubic urethropexy for genuine stress urinary incontinence, between Jan 1, 1998, and Dec 31, 1999. All patients underwent intraoperative cystoscopy at the completion of the Burch procedure after the administration of intravenous indigo carmine dye. Results: There were 6 (3.3%) injuries to the lower urinary tract. Five of the injuries were cystotomies that had been recognized during operation. One obstructed left ureter was detected by cystoscopy and relieved by the release of left paravaginal repair sutures. No unsuspected injuries that were detected by cystoscopy were attributable to the Burch procedure. Conclusions: The lower urinary tract injury rate was 3.3%. All but one injury was recognized before cystoscopy. The one injury was attributed to concomitant paravaginal repair and not to the Burch procedure. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185:345-48.)

Objective
Facial paralysis in children is very often idiopathic and isolated facial nerve palsy, resulting from leukemic infiltration is a rare occurrence.
Here we present the case of a 14 year-old boy with acute Iymphobastic
leukemia, who first presented with isolated right side peripheral facial nerve paralysis and was initially diagnosed with Bell's palsy.
Conclusion
The presence of Bell's palsy in young children requires a complete evaluation, keeping in mind the possibility of leptomeningeal disease.

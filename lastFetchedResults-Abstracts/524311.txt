Background-Malaria is a main parasitic disease with high morbidity and mortality in the world. Rapid diagnosis and prompt treatment are the basic technical elements for the management and control of the disease. During the recent years rapid immunochromatography tests have been applied in diagnosis of specific antigens of human Plasmodia. Objective-The main objective of this study is the evaluation of immunochromatographic test for P. falciparum “ICT Malaria Pf” in the detection of parasitemia in falciparum malaria infection and also in the in vivo drug susceptibility test. Methods-Dipstick kits “ICT Malaria Pf” were applied in the diagnosis and in vivo assessment of the response of P. falciparum to chloroquine in patients with malaria in Bandar-Abbas, southeast Iran. The results of all tests were compared and evaluated with those of microscopic examination (ME) and parasite count in the stained thick blood smears. Results-ICT Malaria Pf was highly specific (reaching 100%) and sensitive (93%) in detection of P. falciparum parasitemia and also quite helpful in the in-vivo assessment of the response of the parasite to chloroquine. Conclusion- At present for the diagnosis of malaria in endemic countries, the dipstick kits are rather expensive. Nevertheless, it is very helpful in centers where the necessary facilities for ME are not accessible for the prompt diagnosis of falciparum infection.

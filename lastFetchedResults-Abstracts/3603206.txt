The Defense Electronics Supply Center´s (DESC´s) field failure evaluation program is described. The primary objective of the program is to take positive corrective action steps to assure that quality electronics parts are used in US Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems. The process flow of field failures from their inception to final corrective action is discussed. To illustrate this, four case studies are presented in which lab testing and coordination with the supplier has resulted in positive corrective action, improving the quality and reliability of the electronic components in DoD weapon systems.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

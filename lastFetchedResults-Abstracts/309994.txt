Objective:
The aim of this study was to determine the adult reference values for cystatin C (CysC) and to evaluate their consistence with those reported in the literature.
Design and methods:
CysC was analyzed in a consecutive series of subjects (100 males and 100 females) by a nephelometric immunoassay. Medline was searched for CysC reference values.
Results:
CysC reference intervals showed 4–11% of variation at the upper limit. The mean upper limit was ≤ 1.0 mg/L of CysC.
Conclusion:
Nephelometric CysC reference intervals are consistent among different populations.

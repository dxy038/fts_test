Yield development is one of the main objective in cotton breeding program. Planning of a breeding program for the Improvement of yield, requires information of the nature and the association between the different influencing characters on yield. Path analysis provides determination of the direct and indirect effects of the traits on yield. In order to assesment of phenotypic and genotypic correlation and determination of the direct and indirect effects of some important agronomical traits on seed cotton yield, the experiments were laid out on 10 cotton genotypes in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) in Karkandeh cotton research station during 2005-2006. Significant genotypic differences existed among the genotypes at 1% level for seed cotton yield (first picking and total yield), plant height, number of boll per plant, monopodial branches number and also at 5% level for second picking and the longest monopodial branches length. Phenotypic and genotypic correlation of traits analysis showed positive and significant correlation between seed cotton yield with first picking, second picking, plant number per row and plant height. Path analysis results indicated that first picking, boll weight and boll number had positive direct effect and sympodial branch numbers had negative direct effect on seed cotton yield. Base on correlation and path analysis results, some traits including first picking, boll weight, number of bolls per plant and earliness were distinguished as the main determining factors for seed cotton yield. Also, the result of present study indicated that the correlation analysis and direct and indirect effect estimation would provide useful information for planning a successful breeding program.

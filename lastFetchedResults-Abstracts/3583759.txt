Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) has become a desirable and necessary feature of almost all modern electronic products. EMC as a design objective requires a careful study and understanding of a technically complex subject and involves such diverse technical disciplines as shielding, grounding, filtering, and fiber optics. The unique attributes of each of these methods, properly applied and implemented, offer effective alternatives in intercon: nection and circuit packaging design. The technical fundamentals of these alternatives are presented in this tutorial review.

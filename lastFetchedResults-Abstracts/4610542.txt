Optimal power flow control in open power market using unified power flow controller (UPFC) has been developed in this paper, with static point of view, for congestion management. Installation of UPFC requires a two-step approach. First, the proper location of these devices in the network must be ascertained and then, the settings of its control parameters optimized for the required objective. In a competitive power market, the minimum price is the main objective subjected to the system operating constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated on a test system.

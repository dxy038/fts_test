The general objective of this paper is to describe the way the authors have been relating general system theory (GST) to practice. The authors applied GST to design a methodology for software development, first. Then, by means of the experience/knowledge learned from applying the methodology to specific systems, a continuous redesigning process started, which simultaneously generalized the methodologies and increased its complexity adding new modules for an increasing diversity of diverse-tasks needed for different systems/situations. The methodological kernel increased it generality and the sub-methodological modules increased its details. This paved the way for a general systems methodology which, when including cognitive/thinking method would return to the theoretical realm, i.e. to a methodological theory which, in turn, would pave the way to theoretical methodology

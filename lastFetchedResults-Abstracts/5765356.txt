Recently, a new buffer and storage management strategy called In-Page Logging (IPL) has been proposed for database systems based on flash memory. Its main objective is to overcome the limitations of flash memory such as erase-before-write and asymmetric read/write speeds by storing changes made to a data page in a form of log records without overwriting the data page itself. Since it maintains a series of changes made to a data page separately from the original data page until they are merged, the IPL scheme provides unique opportunities to design light-weight transactional support for database systems. In this paper, we propose the transactional IPL (TIPL) scheme that takes advantage of the IPL log records to support multiversion read consistency and light-weight database recovery. Due to the dual use of IPL log records, namely, for snapshot isolation and fast recovery as well as flash-aware write optimization, TIPL achieves transactional support for flash memory database systems that minimizes the space and time overhead during normal database processing and shortens the database recovery time.

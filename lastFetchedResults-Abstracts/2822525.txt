A bidirectional interface converter is attractive for the flexible operation and control of a system consisting of a DC sub-grid and an AC sub-grid. Cascaded connection of a dual-active-bridge (DAB) with an inverter is an ideal topology for the bidirectional interface. However, due to the bidirectional power flow, and the potential different control bandwidth of the DAB and the inverter, the DC-link voltage between DAB and inverter may experience significant oscillations, which will increase the stress of the semiconductor devices and cause distortions of grid current. This paper proposes a coordinative control of active power and DC-link voltage for the bidirectional cascaded DAB and inverter. The proposed control method can effectively decrease DC-link voltage oscillation and improve the system performance. The effectiveness has been validated by both simulation and experiment results.

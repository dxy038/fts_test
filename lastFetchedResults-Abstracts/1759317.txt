Objective
cribe the beliefs and preferences of pediatric surgeons regarding the emergent nature of nonperforated appendicitis.
s
ctronic mailing was sent to all 1052 members of the American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA) inviting participation in a 26-item survey, which was administered by Survey Monkey (www.surveymonkey.com). Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests were used for bivariate analysis. Spearmanâ€™s rho was used for nonparametric correlation.
s
undred eighty-four pediatric surgeons (46%) responded to the survey. Few respondents (4%) considered nonperforated appendicitis to be a surgical emergency. A minority (14%) would come in from home to perform an overnight appendectomy. Most (92%) believe that postponing overnight appendectomy until daytime does not result in a clinically significant increase in perforation. Respondents endorsed surgeon fatigue (56%) and limited operating room availability (56%) most often among factors that would make them more likely to postpone surgery. Sixty-eight percent reported no departmental guideline regarding delay of overnight appendectomy.
sions

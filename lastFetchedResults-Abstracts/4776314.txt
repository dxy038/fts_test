This paper narrates an application of particle swarm optimization (PSO) for power loss minimization and voltage control of power systems. This problem is analyzed as a mixed-integer non-linear optimization problem (MINLP). The original PSO is expanded in the proposed method for handling MINLP and for determination of power loss and voltage control with continuous and discrete control variables such as automatic voltage regulator (AVR) operating values of generators, tap positions of on-load tap changer (OLTC) of transformers, and the number of reactive power compensation equipment (RPCE). The feasibility of the proposed method is tested and compared with IEEE 30 bus and IEEE 57 bus systems. The main objective is to minimize the real power loss and maintaining the stability of the power system. The voltage profile assessment is tested by calculation of line stability index. The study results show that the approaches developed are feasible and efficient.

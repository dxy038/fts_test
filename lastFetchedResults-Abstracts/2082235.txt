Air pollution in urban areas induces health effects and poses threat to the life chances and wellbeing of millions of
people every day. The study was aimed at estimation of trace metals in particulate matter and studying the health
effect of air pollutants on children and adults. The particulate matter samples were collected using High Volume Air
sampler SIBATA HV-1000F. The samples were analyzed for metals using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer,
Shimadzu AA-7000F. Four metals were identified in Particulate Matter which includes cadmium, chromium, lead
and nickel. To study the effect of air pollution on children and adults data was obtained from different Hospitals
about the diseases that are caused due to air pollution. The most common respiratory diseases observed in children
were chest infection, asthma, tuberculosis, cough, respiratory tract infections, cough and fever, epigastria,
breathlessness, abdominal pain and sore throat. The most common respiratory diseases observed in adults at
Hospital (I) were asthma, pulmonary tuberculosis, COPD, bronchitis pneumonia, chest infection, pneumonia and
cough and in at Hospital (II) were chest pain, nasal blockage, epigastria, breathlessness, shortness of breath, cough
and sore throat.

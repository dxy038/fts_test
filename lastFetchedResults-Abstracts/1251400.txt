Enormous quantities of Al-sludge from aluminum surface treatments are yearly generated all over the world. Despite of being known as important supplier of alumina, the Al-sludge also have some other components that need to be removed. Calcination has revealed to be an inevitable treatment to achieve such objective. It was also found that conventional densification processes are not efficient for this kind of powders and, to overcome that difficulty, a dynamic compaction approach, using detonation generated shock waves have been followed. The calcinated powders compacted by this way have shown up values of density and hardness, after sintering, comparable to the ones of commercial alumina processed by the conventional methods.

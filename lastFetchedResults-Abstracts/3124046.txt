A collaborative multi-agent concept brings a new paradigm in distributed computation system. Distributed computation models use close relationships among computers, where each computer is autonomous without any memory or clock sharing. This paper focuses on the multi-agent design for finding genetic regulatory systems of M. Tuberculosis organism. Using our concept of intelligent multi-agent computation, each agent is equipped with intelligence, making it capable of identifying other agentsÂ´ capability so that jobs can be distributed to other agents. The multi-agent design can be simply made, resulting in optimal processing time.

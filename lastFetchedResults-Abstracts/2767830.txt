The continuous and precise modulation of the driving and braking torques of each wheel is considered the ultimate goal for controlling the performance of a vehicle in steady-state and transient conditions. To do so, dedicated torque-vectoring (TV) controllers that allow optimal wheel torque distribution under all possible driving conditions have to be developed. Commonly, vehicle TV controllers are based on a hierarchical approach, consisting of a high-level supervisory controller that evaluates a corrective yaw moment and a low-level controller that defines the individual wheel torque reference values. The problem of the optimal individual wheel torque distribution for a particular driving condition can be solved through an optimization-based control-allocation (CA) algorithm, which must rely on the appropriate selection of the objective function. With a newly developed offline optimization procedure, this paper assesses the performance of alternative objective functions for the optimal wheel torque distribution of a four-wheel-drive (4WD) fully electric vehicle. Results show that objective functions based on the minimum tire slip criterion provide better control performance than functions based on energy efficiency.

The quality and yield of the products in the process of hot rolling is affected seriously by slipping phenomenon. In order to solve the phenomenon in aluminum hot rolling, on the basis of considering various factors which lead to slip, the concept of hot rolling slip factor is proposed, and a multi-objective function with equal power margin and preventing the slip phenomenon is established, and the improved artificial fish swarm algorithm is applied to optimize the reduction of first three stands. Adaptive step and improved move strategy are introduced into the proposed algorithm on the basis of basic fish swarm algorithm, which has better accuracy of optimization and faster convergence speed. The optimized schedule is applied to roll aluminum of 1050 in one hot rolling mill, and the performance is satisfied.

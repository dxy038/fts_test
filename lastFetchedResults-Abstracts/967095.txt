The objective of this study is to evaluate corrosion resistance of plasma sprayed hydroxyapatite (HA) and HAsingle bondsilicon oxide (SiO2) coated AISI 304 substrates. In HAsingle bondSiO2 coatings, 10 wt% SiO2 and 20 wt% SiO2 was mixed with HA. The feedstock and coatings were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The corrosion resistance was determined for the uncoated and coated samples. The corrosion resistance of the AISI 304 was found more after the deposition of the HAsingle bondSiO2 coatings rather than HA coating and uncoated. All the coatings were crack free after 24 h dipping in Ringer's solution for electrochemical corrosion testing.

This paper introduces a systematic approach for designing standing wave oscillators (SWOs) optimized through geometric programming. A geometric program is a type of mathematical optimization problem characterized by objective and constraint functions, where all functions are of posynomial or monomial forms. The design of the SWO is formulated as a geometric program problem, which is then solved efficiently as a convex optimization problem. Owing to the efficiency of the proposed method, quantitative tradeoffs among different performance specifications can be analyzed very quickly. As for a SWO operating at 30GHz fabricated using 0.18um 1P6M CMOS technology, simulation results show that the phase noise is around -100dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset, and the power consumption is 27.45mW with a supply voltage of 1.8V.

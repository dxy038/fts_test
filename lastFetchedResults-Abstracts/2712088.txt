This paper presents a broad overview of Knowledge Engineering (KE). This is a research area that aims to develop methodologies, techniques and tools to support the construction of knowledge-based systems, supporting management and dissemination of knowledge. The objective of this paper is to bring together, in a single document, important definitions and concepts of KE, presenting its history, main methodologies, tools and techniques found in the literature. Knowledge systems are increasingly needed, due to the constant growth of data and information. The integration and interoperability between these systems are challenges in this area, where KE can contribute through its available mechanisms.

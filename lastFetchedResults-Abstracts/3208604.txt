Considering that the main objective of a photovoltaic (PV) system is to extract the maximum power that the PV panel can produce, the current work approaches the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) strategies. The paper presents a method that implements the knowledge base of a knowledge driven MPPT structure using a classical search algorithm. The knowledge base is represented by a two-dimensional Lookup table that through is support points associates the maximum power point (MPP) voltage or current coordinates to certain values of two basic external disturbances (solar radiation and temperature of the PV panel). After detecting and storing intermediary MPP coordinates, the Lookup table is set up using the Inverse Distance Weighting method. The detailed case study shows satisfactory results.

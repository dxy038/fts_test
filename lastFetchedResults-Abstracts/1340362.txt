We have reported a novel method of visualizing endotoxin (Et) distribution inside an Et-blocking filtration membrane using both fluorescence-labeled Et and a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope (CLSFM) in our previous paper [J. Membr. Sci. 210 (2002) 45]. The objective of the present study is to clarify Et-blocking mechanism of dialysis membranes. Six kinds of dialysis membranes with varying materials (hydrophilic and hydrophobic) and varying structures (pore diameter, skin layer location and thickness, and water content) were evaluated by CLSFM together with other techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM). Physicochemical property of a membrane material affects Et-adsorbing efficiency, and further membrane structure affects Et-plugging efficiency. Rejected Et distribution in the membranes with varying materials and structures is successfully visualized using fluorescence-labeled Et by CLSFM. Et adsorption on the membranes occurs first, followed by the narrowing of their pores, and afterward pore plugging is continued. Adsorption plays a vital role in Et-blocking. Double skin layer structure is valid for preventing of Et contamination than only inner skin layer structure because the double skin layer structure blocks Et more farther from blood-side surfaces than the only inner skin layer structure.

Articulated steering mechanism is commonly used in wheel loader presently. In this paper objective functions and nonlinear constraints of optimum design model established through analysis of steering mechanism and the choice of the MATLAB Optimization Toolbox function based on the mathematical model of optimization, take the original hinge point as the initial points to be optimized and obtain the optimized results before and after. The optimization has achieved noticeable progress from the contrast results. From optimization, not only can we improve the design of old products, but also it can provide the better choices for new productsÂ´ development.

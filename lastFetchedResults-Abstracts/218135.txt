The objective of this study was to determine the degree of spatial variability of soil chemical properties, soil texture and variance structure. Spatial distributions for 13 soil chemical properties and soil
texture were examined in a fallow land in Bajgah, Fars province, Iran. Soil samples were collected at approximately 60 m' at 0-30 em depth and coordinates of each of the 100 points were recorded with GPS. The
spatial distribution and spatial dependence level varied within location. The range of spatial dependence was found to vary within soil parameters. Phosphorous had the shortest range of spatial dependence (49.50 m) and percentage of calcium carbonate equivalent had the longest (181.94 m). All parameters exhibited strongly spatially dependent. The results demonstrate that within the same field, spatial patterns vary among several soil parameters. Soil nutrients were found to be affected by farmer management. Variography and kriging can
be useful tools for designing effective soil sampling strategies and variable rate application of inputs for use in site-specific fanning.

Tuberculous pericarditis is estimated to occur in 1% to 2% of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. Despite adequate therapy, a subset of patients may eventually require pericardiectomy. Incomplete pericardial resections are associated with an increased incidence of late complications. We report a cutaneous sinus tract communicating with residual pericardium and a retrosternal abscess cavity 11 years after partial pericardial resection.

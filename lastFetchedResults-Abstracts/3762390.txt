This paper deals with the voltage and frequency controller of a wind turbine driven isolated asynchronous generator. The proposed voltage and frequency controller consists of an insulated gate bipolar junction transistor based voltage source converter along-with battery energy storage system at its dc link. The proposed controller is having bidirectional active and reactive powers flow capability by which it controls the system voltage and frequency with variation of consumer loads and the speed of the wind turbine. It is also having capability of harmonic elimination and load balancing. The proposed electro-mechanical system along with its controller is modeled and simulated in MATLAB using Simulink and power system block-set toolboxes. Performance of the proposed controller is presented to demonstrate voltage and frequency control of a wind turbine driven isolated asynchronous generator along with harmonic elimination and load balancing.

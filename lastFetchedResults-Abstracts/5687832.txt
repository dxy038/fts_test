The recent developments in ambient intelligence and ubiquitous computing offer new opportunities for the design of advanced Telemedicine systems providing high quality services, anywhere, anytime. In this paper we present an approach for building an ontology-based task-driven telemedicine system. The architecture is composed of a task management server, a communication server and a knowledge base for enabling decision makings taking account of different telemedical concepts such as actors, resources, services and the Electronic Health Record. The final objective is to provide an intelligent management of the different types of available human, material and communication resources.

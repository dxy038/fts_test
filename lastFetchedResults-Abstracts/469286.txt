Objective
This study was undertaken to evaluate the Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology (CREOG) In-Training Examination scores for significant trends.
Study design
The percent-correct scores for each of the 6 published examination objectives from 7 consecutive years were analyzed. The data set was analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance using gender, examination year, and postgraduate year as categorical variables, and each year was analyzed separately by gender and postgraduate year. Scores of residents who took the examination for 4 consecutive years were analyzed by using repeated measures analysis of covariance.
Results
Variation by examination year appeared random, although scores monotonically increased with postgraduate year for all objectives and all years. The mean relative scores of women were higher than men on the primary/preventive care objective, but the reverse was true for the general considerations objective.
Conclusion
The CREOG In-Training Examination appears to be a dependable measure of residents' improvement in cognitive knowledge.

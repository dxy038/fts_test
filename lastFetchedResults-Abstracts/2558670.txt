Objective: This study investigated the effectiveness of Adlerian parent training on amelioration of problems of executive functions in children with attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method: The research method was experimental with pre-and-post and follow up design with control group. 30 parents were recruited whose children were assigned into experimental and control groups. The research instruments were ADHD diagnostic questionnaire(2013) and Coolidge Neuropsychological(2002) Inventory. Parent Training based on Adler Approach was accomplished in ten 90-minute sessions. Both in the post- and follow-up tests, the two groups completed the questionnaires as post-test. The data were analyzed using ANCOVA. Results: The results revealed the effectiveness of Adlerian parent training on amelioration of executive functions problems. However, no significant effect was found on decision making-planning problems. Conclusion: Accordingly, we conclude that Adlerian parent training could mitigate problems in some executive functions in children with ADHD.

When municipal secondary effluent is used as the main supplementation water source for surface water bodies, its potential adverse ecological effects should not be neglected. The objective of this work was to investigate the effectiveness of several technologies, i.e. combination of coagulation and sand filtration (CSF), ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, chlorination, ozonation, ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis filtration (RO), on the removal of acute ecotoxicity, genotoxicity and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) agonist activity from the municipal secondary effluent. The effects of treated effluents on the development of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) embryos were also evaluated. The secondary effluent exhibited a mutagenic effect on Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 1535/pSK1002, acute invertebrate toxicity to Daphnia magna, and weak RAR Î± activity. RO and ozonation demonstrated remarkable removals of the genotoxic effect, acute toxicity and RAR activity from secondary effluent, while chlorination could elevate both genotoxicity and acute toxicity. CSF, UV, UF, chlorination as well as RO could decrease the 4-day mortality of medaka embryos and accordingly increase the hatching success rate, comparing with the secondary effluent. Ozonation at 4 mg/l and higher doses, however, elicited significantly higher 4-day mortality, leading to the reduction of the hatching success rate.

We propose an integrated approach for dynamic route guidance and ramp metering using Linear Quadratic Model Predictive Control (LQMPC). The main objective is to maximize the throughput of the network by guiding traffic flow towards insufficiently utilized infrastructures. Due to the linear property of the LQMPC, it is fast enough for real-time online traffic control with a short control step (30 second for example). Simulation results from a case study demonstrate that the proposed traffic control approach has great potential to solve congestion when disturbances occur on freeways.

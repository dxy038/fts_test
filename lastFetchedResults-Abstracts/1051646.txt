Objective: The present study aimed at the standardization of Bender Gestalt II for preschool and primary school-children in Shiraz. The sample consisted of 473 girls and 427 boys aged 4 to 11 years who were selected using stratified random sampling from eight schools located in four education districts of Shiraz. 
Methods: Test-retest and split-half methods were used for studying the reliability of the test. To assess the validity of the test, four procedures were used, namely comparison of BG II and Bender-Gestalt test (Koppitz scoring system), comparison with Cancellation test, studying the performance of ADHD and LD children in BG II. In this regard, correlation coefficients were used for the first two procedures, and independent T was used for the last two procedures. 
Results and Conclusion: The reliability coefficient obtained in copy phase was 0.94 and in recall phase was 0.76. The mean of split-half reliability coefficient for all age groups was 0.80. The results of validity assessment showed high validity of BG II for use in Iran, a fact suggesting that BG II can be used as a suitable assessment tool in the Iranian culture. A result of the standardization was that contrary to Koppitz's finding (1963), children's performance in BG II could be affected by cultural and social factors. In other words, children from higher cultural and social groups had a better performance compared to children from lower cultural and social groups. In this study, the performance of girls was significantly better than that of boys.

This paper presents an approach to solve the Vehicle Scheduling Problem(VSP). Taking into the actual connectivity of paths connected to the nodes, we establish a multi-objective mathematical model based on the path length and customer waiting time. A algorithm combining the A* algorithm for path searching with the Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) for global exploration together, is applied to the multi-objective vehicle scheduling model. Some practical problems has been solved with good results by this approach.

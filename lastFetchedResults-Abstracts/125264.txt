The objective of the present study is to survey and evaluate the status and image of women in popular stories of Samak Ayyar and Darabnameh. The study shows that women's roles are presented positively in these stories. Although women have an effective role in decision making, governing, wrestling, ayyari and loving, there are cases in which they are treated pejoratively and their roles are ignored. Since these stories belong to the ordinary people, the lower class women have a broader and more effective presence than the higher ones. On the whole, the image of women in these stories is neither completely positive nor totally negative.

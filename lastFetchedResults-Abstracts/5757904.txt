The l<sub>2</sub>-l<sub>&#8734;</sub> filtering problem of discrete-time switched state-delay systems under asynchronous switching is considered in this paper. The objective is to obtain a full-order or reduced-order switched filter guaranteeing the exponential stability with l<sub>2</sub>-l<sub>&#8734;</sub> performance of the filtering error system. A sufficient condition in the form of linear matrix inequalities for the exponential stability with the l<sub>2</sub>-l<sub>&#8734;</sub> performance of the filtering error system is provided based on delay-dependent multiple Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. Lastly, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed filters.

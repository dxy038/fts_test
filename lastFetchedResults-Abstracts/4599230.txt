Template matching algorithms determine the best matching position of a reference image (template) on a larger image (scene) in either complete or incomplete information environment. In this work, our main objective is to devise a fuzzy integral-based aggregation scheme in an attempt to get more accurate and robust matching, by combining the matching decisions of a finite number of image template matching algorithms, Particularly, Choquet integrals associated with fuzzy measures can be used for handling fuzziness due to incomplete image information. In the present work, a fuzzy integral-based aggregated template matching system is developed on the basis of Choquet integral using belief, plausibility, and probability measure, while being interpreted as an optimistic, a pessimistic, and a noninteracting aggregation, respectively. Finally, to show a validation of Choquet integral-based template matching methods, three individual template matching methods (i,e., MOAD-matcher, SOAD-matcher, and SOSD-matcher) are combined using Choquet integral with respect to different fuzzy measures. Then, performance of these aggregated matchers is compared to individual matchersÂ´ performance. It is found that in a complementary sense a Choquet integral-based aggregation of template matching methods gives a better performance compared to the performance of the individual methods.

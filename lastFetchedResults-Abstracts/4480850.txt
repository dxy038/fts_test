TerraSAR-X is a highly flexible X-band radar satellite. Its primary objective is the acquisition of high quality SAR images in a multitude of possible acquisition modes. The great amount of antenna patterns needed for image acquistion requires an antenna model accurately describing all beams. To guarantee the required image quality, the model has to be verified on-ground and validated in-orbit. The results of the verification will be described here as well as the validation approach.

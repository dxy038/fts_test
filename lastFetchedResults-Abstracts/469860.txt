Objective
This study was undertaken to describe demographics and contraceptive familiarity and use among postpartum adolescents in El Salvador.
Study design
Questionnaire-guided interviews were conducted in Spanish with 50 postpartum adolescents at an urban, public hospital in El Salvador. Open-ended questions included assessments of education, partnership status, and contraceptive knowledge and use patterns.
Results
The median age of subjects was 17 years, 84% were nulliparous, 80% had partners, and 6% were married. Eighty-four percent of the women reported contraception knowledge and 18% reported contraception use. Educational experience and literacy predicted contraceptive knowledge (P = .008 and .001, respectively), but not use. After delivery and postpartum contraception education, 58% of the subjects stated intention to use contraception. Having a partner and living with him were predictors of intent to use contraception (P = .001 and .002, respectively). Being single negatively predicted intention to use contraception (P = .001).
Conclusion
Education and literacy predicted contraceptive knowledge; however, contraceptive knowledge did not predict contraceptive use. Adolescent contraception use depends on more than just contraceptive knowledge.

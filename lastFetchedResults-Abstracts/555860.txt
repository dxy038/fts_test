Introduction & Objective: obesity is independently associated with increased oxidative stress in men and women. Natural antioxidants showed substantial antioxidative and antiÂ¬inflammatory activities in vivo. In this study, we examined the preventive effect of antioxidants supplement and/or restricted diet on the development of obesity induced by feeding a high-fat (HF) diet.
Materials & Methods: The present study was conducted at Hamadan University of Medical Sciences in 2009. Forty-eight male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to HF purified diet (61% kcal from fat) ad libitum, HF restricted (30%), HF supplemented with astaxanthin, vitamin E and C (HFS), HFS restricted (30%) for 12 weeks. Daily food intake and weekly body weight gain were measured. The collected data were analyzed by the SPSS software using Colmogroph- Smirnov, One-Way ANOVA, and Two- Way ANOVA.
Results: Dietary antioxidants suppressed body weight gain in the HF-diet ad libitum (-9.8%), and in HF restricted diet (-18.14%). Energy intake was not significant in HF with HFS (58.8 and 58.6 kcal/rat/d, respectively) and in HF restricted with HFS restricted (41.7 and 41.6 kcal/rat/d, respectively).
Conclusion: results of this study suggest that antioxidants supplement might be of value in reducing the likelihood of obesity in rats fed with high-fat diets, especially when accompanying with restricted diets.

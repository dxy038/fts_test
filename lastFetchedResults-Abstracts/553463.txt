The utilities are interested on economic and
optimal projects which improve their services to
customers. These projects should increase the utilities’
profit as well. Reactive power compensation as a useful
and practical approach has been studied very much. One
way of reactive power injection is installation of constant
capacitors that result in voltage profile improvement,
power losses and cost decrease. The present paper’s goal
is to offer new flexible designs using Game Theory
concepts. Power loss is first objective while capacitor and
power loss cost are considered as second objective. The
optimization algorithm, Strength Pareto Evolutionary
Algorithm (SPEA), proposes some optimum plans for
supplying system reactive power. In order to show the
suggested method’s capabilities, the results are compared
with GA which proves the superiority of SPEA.

Background: Regression is one of the complications, which may occur following LASIK eye surgery in high myopic patients.
Objective: To determine the degree of regression after LASIK in high myopic eyes.
Methods: This interventional longitudinal study was performed on 34 eyes in 20 patients who underwent LASIK. The range of preoperative refraction errors was -6.12 to -22.00 Diopter. LASIK was performed using Moria microkeratome to create a 9 mm diameter, 160 microns thick flap. Preoperative and four consecutive cycloplegic refractions were carried out using recommended standards. The maximum follow up was after 6 months.
Findings: Considering all patients, mean preoperative refraction was -10.58 D which decreased to -0.51±1.33 D a week following surgery. Mean cycloplegic refraction was - 0.98±1.33 D, -1.21±1.81 D and -1.42±1.87 D, respectively, which was recorded (.t 1,3 and 6 months postoperatively. Maximum regression occurred 6 months after the surgery [0.9±0.8 D (8.5%)]. Factors associated with regression included preoperative keratometry (P-0.013) and correction rate (P<0.001).
Conclusion: The degree of regression after LASIK in high myopia was related to preoperative keratometry and correction rate.

Background and Objective: Cerebral venoussinus thrombosis (CVST) is a relatively rare disease with high potential of disability and mortality. The most frequently reported occurrence is seen in adolescent women during reproductive age. The aim of this study was to evaluate risk factors of CVST in hospitalized patients over the years of 2009 to 2010 in Zanjan province.

Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, patients with confirmed diagnosis of CVST by MRI with and without contrast and Magnetic Resonance Venography (MRV) were included. Demographic variables of patients and main CVST risk factors were obtained by interviewing the patients and their families and by referring to laboratory test records of the patients. Prevalence of risk factors was calculated using SPSS software.

Results: The study comprised 33 patients including 32 females and one male with the mean age of 36.5plusmn 10.7 years of whom 19 were affected over the holy month of Ramadan or Hajj times and 26 had a history of contraceptive components consumption. Most clinical complications, clinical signs, predisposing factors, CT scan  results and affected sinus based on MRI and MRV were headache (93.9%), papilledema ( 69.6%), use of contraceptive products (78.7%), normal view (33.33%) and superior sagital sinus (69.7%).

Conclusion: Given that the outstanding risk factor involved contraceptive products, it is recommended that women cease contraceptive components consumption especially for short term periods and consult their physician in cases of underlying hematologic and thrombophilic disorders at pilgrimage, Hajj or Ramadan times, especially during hot seasons.

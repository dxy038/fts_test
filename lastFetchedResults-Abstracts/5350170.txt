Web service selection is an essential element in service-oriented computing. How to wisely select appropriate Web services for the benefits of service consumers is a key issue in service discovery. In this paper, we approach QoS-based service selection using a decision making model - the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). In our solution, both subjective and objective criteria are supported by the AHP engine in a context-specific manner. We also provide a flexible Wiki platform to collaboratively form the initial QoS model within a service community. The software prototype is evaluated against the system scalability.

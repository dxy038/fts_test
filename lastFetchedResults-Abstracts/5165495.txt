This paper deals with an extended output- feedback positioning tracking of a servo-system with friction based on generalized Maxwell-slip (GMS) friction observer dynamics with fixed model parameters. We succeed in designing a linear time invariant (LTI) compensator which ensures exponential stabilization and additional multi-objective features (e.g. closed-loop pole location). These conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Numerous simulations results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed compensator and state a comparison with the similar LuGre closed-loop friction compensator.

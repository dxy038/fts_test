The environmental issue is an important issue to contemporary human. The encouragement for implementing environmental education is emergent. The environmental education and information education is an important job, and their combination will be the trends in the future. However, achieving this goal is not a simple task since the ultimate objective is responsible sustainable behavior. An e-learning through gamification could be an approach to promote the sustainability literacy. In this study, a causal model is proposed by combining motivation theory, flow theory and cognitive load theory, is empirically evaluated to investigate how learner characteristics (skill, challenge, incentives, and cognitive load) and attitudes (playfulness) influence learning outcome by playing a serious game. A real-time strategy game with learning of environmental education was developed in this work.

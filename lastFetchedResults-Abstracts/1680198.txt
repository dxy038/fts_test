A microgrid requires a stable supply of electric power and heat, which is achieved by the cooperative operation of two or more pieces of equipment. The equipment capacity and the operational method of the equipment were optimized using a newly developed orthogonal array-GA (genetic algorithm) hybrid method for an independent microgrid accompanied by a fuel cell cascade system, solar water electrolysis, battery, and heat storage. This type of system had not been hardly developed until now. The objective function of the proposed system was the minimization of the total amount of equipment and fuel cost over ten years. For the first step in the proposed analysis method, the capacity of each piece of equipment and the operational method, which are considered to be close to the optimal solution of the system, are combined using the orthogonal array and factorial-effect chart, which are an experimental design technique. In the next step, the combination described above provides the initial values to the GA, and the GA searches for the optimal capacity and operational method for each piece of equipment in question. Compared with a simple GA, the convergence characteristic improves greatly using the proposed analysis method developed in this study.

Introduction: The objective of this research was to determine memory problems (episodic memory, memory bias and memory confidence) in checking type obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Method: Sixty individuals with OCD (30 checking and 30 washing types) were selected, together with 60 control individuals (30 with generalized anxiety disorder and 30 normal). The groups matched the checking OCD group in demographic features and were assessed for obsession and compulsion by the Maudsly Obsessive - Compulsive Inventory (MOCI) and diagnostic interview. Memory was assessed by two computer-based word lists (recalling list and recognition/confidence list). Results: This study revealed no difference in the amount of recalling words among the groups. Checking OCD, washing OCD and generalized anxiety groups showed memory bias in recalling danger associated words. The checkers had significantly less memory confidence than any other groups. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings were also considered. Conclusion: The memory problem in the checking type OCD could be described in the frame-work of psychological theories, particularly, with a cognitive-behavioral approach.

Analyzes the performance of various types of multiple fiber ring networks employing optical paths (OP´s). The multiple fiber ring network architecture is suitable for achieving failure resilient networks that have extremely large bandwidth but are still upgradable against future increases in traffic. This architecture will overcome the limitation of conventional WDM rings in terms of network expansion capabilities, the number of nodes within the ring, and the number of OP´s accommodated in the network. The generic node architecture suitable for multiple fiber ring networks is presented and functionality requirements are identified. The OP accommodation design algorithms that minimize the required node system scale are proposed. Based on the generic node architecture and proposed OP accommodation design algorithms, we evaluated the performance of several types of multiple fiber rings in terms of the required node system scale for rings under various conditions. The effect of the ring architecture (uni-/bidirectional rings), optical path schemes (wavelength path/virtual wavelength path), and different node connectivity patterns are demonstrated for the first time. The obtained results elucidate the criteria for selecting the most suitable multiple fiber ring architecture

This paper proposes a heuristic algorithm based on tabu search for solving the problem of routing and wavelength assignment in multicast multi-fiber WDM networks using virtual light -tree (VLT) technique. The objective is to design an effective algorithm that can be applied to large network problems served as an alternative method to that based on Integer Linear Programming technique. The design outcomes measured in terms of the total capacity requirement of the proposed algorithm are evaluated and compared to that of ILP approach. Results on tested networks demonstrate that both techniques offer comparable design output, signifying the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

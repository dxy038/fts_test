With the diffusion of multi-channel surround reproduction system for high-realistic sensation, the sound field reproduction system of room acoustics is significantly in demand. In order to simulate the room acoustics, the acoustic ray tracing based on geometric acoustics is one of effective methods. However, it cannot sufficiently simulate the wall materials, because it employs an unique scalar value as the wall impedance. So, we designed the virtual sound field simulator based on acoustic ray tracing and wall impedance acquired by real measurements. With our designed simulator, we could calculate impulse response on arbitrary capturing points in the virtual sound field. But, our former approach cannot sufficiently realize high-realistic sensation, because humans listen to the acoustic signal included in diffraction, transmission and so on causing their head and body. Therefore, it is difficult to reproduce the high-realistic sound field. In this paper, we expand the monophonic simulator to multi-channel output one with our former designed simulator. Specifically, considering transfer functions between the loudspeakers and human ears close to head (head-closed impulse response: HCIR), we designed the simulator based on acoustic ray tracing and HRTF. And on the monophonic and multi-channel simulator, we confirmed availability of the proposed method by objective evaluation.

In this work, we show that finding 1.5-cliques is a good idea for exploring friendships in Blogosphere. In todaypsilas blog service environment, friend relationships are usually unidirectionally established, without the confirmation from the other party. Conventional methods find either too small or too few cliques in forming friend groups, since bidirectional links are not completely built under such circumstances. To solve this problem, the idea of finding 1.5-cliques is proposed, and is used for exploring friend groups from a social network, Wretch (www.wretch.cc), as a case study. The effectiveness of this idea is valued from the perspective of the densities of the explored groups. By investigating the data we have been continually collecting in the past year, this method is demonstrated to be pretty good.

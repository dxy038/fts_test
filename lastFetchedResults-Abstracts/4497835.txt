This paper proposes a bi-criterion global optimisation approach to determine the most appropriate generation dispatch solution taking into account the fuel cost, the environmental cost and the requirement of the operation security of power networks. The approach is based on the simulated annealing technique and the formation of a bi-criterion objective function. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through an example, in which the sample test system is a 3-area interconnected and longitudinal system

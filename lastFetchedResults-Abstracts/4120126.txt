The development of a traffic engineering and administration software system for use in administering a private AT&amp;T corporate wide area network (CWAN) is described. The traffic administration system discussed is intended to aid network administrators in periodically, e.g., weekly, engineering the CWAN. The objective of this ongoing engineering process is to minimize network facilities and equipment expenditures while providing acceptable performance levels to network end users proactively. The CWAN network is described, and the CWAN network management and traffic administration approach used during the network deployment and in the mature network is reviewed. Also described is the CWAN traffic administration system (CTAS), an automated system that implements this CWAN traffic engineering and administration approach.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

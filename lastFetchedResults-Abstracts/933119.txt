Edible films are flexible thin materials based on biopolymers. It is therefore necessary to know the physicochemical properties of those macromolecules in order to obtain films with desirable characteristics. Dried gelatin is a partially crystalline polymer that exhibits glass and helix–coil transitions. The knowledge of phase properties is important for the choice of the type and concentration of the plasticizer to be utilized to obtain a flexible and easy-to-handle film. The objective of this work is to determine the phase transitions of pigskin gelatin as a function of moisture content in the hygroscopic domain. Pure gelatin was conditioned over different saturated salt solutions at 25°C to allows samples with various moisture content. After equilibrium was established, the samples and an empty pan, as reference, were heated twice between −100 and 250°C at the rate of 5°C/min, in a DSC (TA 2010) after quench-cooling with liquid nitrogen. Gelatin was placed in a pan with a perforated cover, and maintained at 105°C for 24 h in the DSC cell before thermal analyses, to obtain completely dried samples. The glass transition temperature of these samples was found to be 220.2°C. The DSC traces obtained in the first scan, except those conditioned at 11% relative humidity, showed a glass transition followed by two endothermic peaks due to two sol–gel transitions in the gelatin. The plasticizing effect of moisture on Tg was observed in all the samples conditioned by absorption and in the second scan with the samples conditioned by desorption. This behavior was well represented by the Gordon and Taylor model, with κ=5.26 and R2=0.96. Also, a plasticizing effect of moisture over the sol–gel transitions was observed. The Flory-Huggins model was applied to experimental data with: χ1=1.94 and R2=0.999, for the first peak Tm, and χ1=1.90 and R2=0.989, for the second peak.

In this work, we report our initial results based on an innovative approach that we started last year for delivering an introductory computer science course. The teaching approach consisted of a team teaching, a blended delivery system, recorded lecture retrieval capability, readiness assessment activities, objective assessment of student progress, and cooperative learning through team work. During our last delivery, we added post-assessments and results related to this addition are presented in the paper. Our intent is to present a preliminary evaluation of the aforementioned approach as well as future direction and adjustments.

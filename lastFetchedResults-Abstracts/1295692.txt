This paper deals with a physical access network design problem of fiber-to-the-home passive optical network (FTTH-PON). The design of FTTH-PON access network seeks the cost effective location of optical splitters that provide optical connectivity from central office to subscribers in a given service area. We formulate the problem as a multi-level capacitated facility location problem on a tree topology with nonlinear link cost. Dealing with the nonlinear link cost, we propose an objective function relaxation approach to obtain tight upper and lower bounds. We develop valid inequalities that enhance the lower bound and propose a local search heuristic procedure that improves the upper bound. Valid inequalities force integrality condition on the number of splitters placed at nodes. Local search heuristic improves the initial greedy solution by placing splitters on the sub-root nodes of a given tree network. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution procedures.

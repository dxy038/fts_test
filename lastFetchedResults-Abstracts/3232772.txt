Wireless networks are widely used in urban or office environments and could become in the future an interesting solution for various aeronautic applications. Their development will necessarily induce channel model investigations to allow a link between propagation and system aspects. The objective of this paper is to present the channel model characterization by simulation of a complex avionic environment; a cabin of Airbus A320.

Fuel cells offer a unique technology that will revolutionize the way building electric and thermal loads are met. No other system can generate electricity, provide heat and hot water, has fuel flexibility, is modular, has quiet operation, is a nonpolluter and has an overall conversion efficiency potential of 80% or better. The Office of Building Equipment in the Department of Energy´s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is doing research and development on major components for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells to help ease the environmental effects of global warming and to reduce energy consumption. The objective of the fuel cell for buildings program is to have a ´First Generation´ PEM fuel cell ready for operation in a building by the year 2004. The ´First Generation´ PEM fuel cell will operate on reformed methane, have an electric generating efficiency of 40% or better, and a life of 5000, or more, hours. The projected cost target is $1500/kW-$2000/kW. The stated characteristics will be unique to buildings and will lead to advanced systems for co-generation applications, providing a coupling between the fuel cell and the building. Close cooperation with the automotive fuel cell program will be maintained and those technologies being developed in either program will be adapted where applicable

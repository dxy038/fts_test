The objective of this work was to obtain experimental characteristics of the heat transfer coefficient during impingement fluidized freezing of vegetables, using a heat flux sensor. The material undergoing freezing was formed from vegetable slices measuring 3 × 3 × 0.5 cm. The formula Nux = 0.353∙Rex0.608 can be used to describe the dependence of the heat transfer coefficient on the process parameters and is valid for the 8000 &lt; Rex &lt; 30000 range. The model was validated by a statistical evaluation of the relative error, the regression characteristics for the Nusselt number, and an estimate of the agreement between the computated and experimental distributions of the Nusselt number. A strong correlation was found between the heat transfer coefficient values from the proposed model and the experimental values.

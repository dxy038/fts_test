Objective
estigate how many men with low-risk prostate cancer had positive lymph nodes detected by radio-guided surgery and whether they had a higher biochemical relapse rate after radical prostatectomy, because in such patients most urologists dispense with operative lymph node staging, as nomograms indicate only a low percentage of lymph node metastases.
ts and Methods
udy included 474 men with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of &lt; or = 10 ng/mL, biopsy Gleason score of &lt; or = 6 and positive biopsies in one (group 1, 315 men) or both lobes (group 2, 159 men); follow-up data were available in 357 men. Men with adjuvant radiation or hormone therapy before the occurrence of biochemical relapse were excluded.
s
ve lymph nodes were detected in 17 men in group 1, and in 18 in group 2. In more than half of the patients (19/35) these nodes were found outside the region of standard lymphadenectomy. Men with node-positive disease had a higher biochemical relapse rate (P &lt; 0.001). When the tumour was organ-confined and well differentiated in node-positive disease (Gleason score &lt; or = 6) the biochemical relapse rate was lower than in men with higher tumour stage and grade.
sions
issecting pelvic lymph nodes, extended or sentinel lymphadenectomy should be preferred. Removing the diseased nodes could improve the PSA progression-free survival, especially in well differentiated organ-confined disease.

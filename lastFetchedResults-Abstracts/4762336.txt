The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II is applied to a multi-objective air transportation fleet-mix problem for finding flexible fleet mixes. The Stochastic Fleet Estimation model, which is Monte Carlo-based, is used to determine average annual requirements that a fleet must meet. We search for Pareto-optimal combinations of platform-to-task assignments that can be used to complete stochastically generated scenarios. Solutions are evaluated using three objectives, with a goal of maximizing flexibility in accomplishing each task within its closure time, and minimizing fleet cost and total task duration. Optimization over all three objectives found very flexible low cost fleets, which were not discovered using previous two-objective and three-objective optimizations.

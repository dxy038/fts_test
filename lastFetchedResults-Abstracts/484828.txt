Background and Objective: Lead is one of the heavy metals which releases into water and soil resources
through industrial wastes and poses serious harmful effects on human health. This study was conducted to
determine the biosorption capacity of lead by active biomass of lead resistant fungi.
Materials and methods: In this study the lead -resistant fungi were isolated from effluent of Zanjan Lead
and Zinc factory and lead biosorption capacities of isolated fungi were studied by biosorption experiments. A
collection of fungi colony was isolated in SDA media and then every colony was cultured in separate media.
The fungi colonies were identified via morphological characteristics and Lacto phenol Caten Blue. The MIC
of fungi was determined and their lead biosorption capacities were measured by culturing the fungi in SDB
media that were polluted with 50-200 mg/L of lead.
Results: The isolated fungi were one Spp. of Rhizopus, two Spp. of Penicillium and one Spp. of Aspergillus.
The MIC of Rhizopus was 2500 and for others was 3000 mg/L. The maximum lead biosorption capacities
were 51.5, 19.2, 25.6 and 12.5 (mg per g of dry weight of fungi biomass) for Rhizopus, two Spp. of
Penicillium and Aspergillus respectively.
Conclusion: The maximum lead biosorption capacity of Penicillium and one Spp. of Aspergillus was higher
than 700/0, thus biosorption of lead is an efficient method for treatment of lead polluted eftluents.

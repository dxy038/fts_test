Objective
To examine the relationship between two measures that can be used to examine quality life among pediatric burn survivors.
Design
Prospective, correlational study.
Setting
Acute and rehabilitation pediatric burn care facility.
Participants
Eighty young adult survivors of pediatric burns, who were 18–28 years of age, with burns of 30% or greater, and were at least 2 years after burn.
Interventions
Not applicable.
Main outcome measures
The SF-36 and the Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) were used to assess participant's self-reported general health and long-term adjustment.
Results
Significant correlations (p ≤ 0.001) were found between the total quality of life score of the QLQ and the mental component scale of the SF-36. However, no significant correlations were found between the total quality of life score of the QLQ and the SF-36 physical component scale.
Conclusions
Approximately 100,000 children are treated for burns annually, with a high percentage surviving, creating a challenge for health care professionals who need to prepare burn survivors with their psychosocial and physical well-being as adults. This study found that the SF-36 and QLQ are measuring somewhat different aspects of psychosocial and physical adjustment. It is recommended that both tools could be useful to the burn practitioner in assessing quality of life.

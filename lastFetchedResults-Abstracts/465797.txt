Objective:
This study was undertaken to determine whether previously described significant and quantitative cervical shortening caused by loop excision of the transformation zone persists after 3 months of healing.
Study Design:
A prospective study was designed in which 20 patients were enrolled. Each underwent transvaginal ultrasonography for determination of cervical length before the loop excision of the transformation zone and ≥3 months after the loop excision of the transformation zone. Simple regression analysis and the Student paired t test was performed to determine whether the length of the cervix had changed significantly between the measurements.
Results:
The mean cervical lengths as measured by transvaginal ultrasonography before and after loop excision of the transformation zone were 3.1 ± 0.8 cm and 3.1 ± 0.7 cm, respectively. The correlation between ultrasonographic measurements before and after loop excision of the transformation zone was r = 0.88 (P<.0001). A paired ttest resulted in a P value of 1.0000, which indicates that the ultrasonographic measurement after loop excision of the transformation zone was not different from the ultrasonography measurement before loop excision of the transformation zone. The mean difference between measurements was 0.0 ± 0.4 cm.
Conclusions:
After adequate healing time after loop excision of the transformation zone, the length of the cervix, as measured by transvaginal ultrasonography, does not appear to remain shortened.

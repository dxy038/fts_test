The paper presents the operating space of a bidirectional PWM ac-to-dc converter which can act also as a line conditioner. This analysis of the operating space will prove the secondary line conditioning functionality of the PWM dc converters. Starting from the steady state equations of the converter, the 3D operating space will be represented for a PWM dc converter which works in simple line conditioning as well as active line conditioning mode.

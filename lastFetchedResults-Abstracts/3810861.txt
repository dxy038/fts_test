The letter formalizes the bandwidth allocation process over space communication systems as a multi-objective programming (MOP) problem and proposes an allocation called "minimum distance" algorithm. The algorithm assigns the bandwidth so to approach the ideal situation where each station has the overall channel bandwidth available, as close as possible. The performance evaluation is carried out analytically by varying the fading level of the space channel

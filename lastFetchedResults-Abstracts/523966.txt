Objective: Investigation of the suitability of electrospun Poly (?-caprolactone) (PCL)
nanofiber scaffold for the Vero cell culture.
Materials and Methods: Electrospinning was used for production of PCL nanofibers
scaffolds. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), MTT assay, hematoxylin staining
and histology analysis were used to investigate the cell morphology, viability, attachment
and infilteration of the vero cells on the PCL nanofiber scaffolds.
Results: The results of the MTT assay, SEM images and hematoxylin staining
showed that Vero cells attach and spread on PCL nanofiber scaffolds. The proliferation
of Vero cells is as well as that of control group, but histological analysis showed
the lack of cell infilteration into the scaffolds, which was found to be due to the small
diameters of the pores of nanofibrous scaffold.
Conclusion: The result of this study show that PCL nanofiber scaffolds are suitable
for cell culture, proliferation and attachment and Vero cells attach and proliferate on
PCL nanofiber scaffolds.

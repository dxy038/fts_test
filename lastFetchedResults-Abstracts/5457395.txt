This paper presents a statistical interpretation of the chest radiograph for the detection of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Each region of interest was represented by a vector of wavelet texture measures which is then multiplied by the orthogonal matrix Q. The first two elements of the transformed vectors were shown to have a bivariate normal distribution. Misclassification probabilities were estimated using probability ellipsoids and discriminant functions. The most important result of this study recommends the detection of pulmonary tuberculosis by constructing discriminant function using maximum column sum energy texture measures where the misclassification probabilities were less than 0.15. In the validation exercise, the proposed discriminant procedure yielded 94% correct classification rate.

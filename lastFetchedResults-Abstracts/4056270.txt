This paper reports an integrated CMOS potentiostat for detection of heavy metal ions in water and other solvents based on electrochemical sensing. The proposed potentiostat features a low-input impedance, high sensitivity, high gain and low power transimpedance amplifier front end, with programmable control of electrode potential, thus facilitating continuous bidirectional measurement of reduction-oxidation (redox) current in a potentiostat for cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiment. For proof of concept, we use the proposed integrated potentiostat to perform CV on a reference ferricyanide (K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>) using external microelectrodes. Results compared with standard benchtop potentiostat confirm microelectrode behavior with accurate estimate of redox potential with varying redox currents proportional to the ferricyanide concentration.

Unbalanced three-phase distribution networks are undergoing significant changes with the advent of modern distributed energy resources (DER). These DER come in the form of both load and generation, such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, photovoltaics and micro wind turbines, and have the potential to drastically modify customersÂ´ behaviours and needs. Consequently, as distribution networks continue to develop, network management systems will become a crucial element of future distribution system architecture. This work introduces a multi-period, three-phase, unbalanced optimal power flow (TOPF) method, which has the capability to provide optimal solutions for distribution system control variables, for a chosen objective function, subject to required constraints. The method is validated with the IEEE 123-node test feeder, and a practical test feeder with the addition of photovoltaic systems is utilised to demonstrate the multi-period TOPF capabilities. The results show the benefits of adding storage to PV systems when combined with the TOPF formulation described here.

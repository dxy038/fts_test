Call admission control is one of the key elements in ensuring the QoS in mobile wireless networks supporting multimedia applications. This paper introduces a new distributed and dynamic call admission control mechanism (SDCA), whose objective is to maximize the radio channel utilization subject to a pre-determined threshold of the call dropping probability. The novelties of the proposed mechanism are that we have taken into account the effects of limited channel capacity and time dependence on the call dropping probability, and the influences from nearest and next-nearest neighboring cells. New calls are spread evenly over a control period, which leads to more effective and stable control. Simulations show that our scheme steadily satisfies the hard constraint on call dropping probability while maintaining a high channel throughput when compared with previous proposals

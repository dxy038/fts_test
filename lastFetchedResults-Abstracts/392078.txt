To determine whether l-menthol stimulation of the major palatine nerve can affect nasal patency, we noted subjective and measured objective nasal patency before and after l-menthol stimulation of the palatal mucosa. l-Menthol stimulation of the palatal mucosa enhanced nasal sensation of airflow but nasal resistance was unaffected. By contrast, l-menthol stimulation after local anesthesia of the palatine nerve or of the nasal mucosa substantially diminished the subjective response of increased nasal patency but without affecting objective nasal patency. It is suggested that the effect of both direct stimulation by l-menthol of the major palatine nerve and its vapor action on the sensory nerve endings of the nasal mucosa produce an increase in the sensation of nasal patency without an increase in objective nasal patency.

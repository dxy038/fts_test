A new image coding scheme called dynamic codebook adaptive vector quantization (DCAVQ) is proposed. DCAVQ is designed to minimize the transmission overhead and computational complexity of existing adaptive vector quantization systems. Simulation results using real images demonstrate both subjective and objective performance of decoded images are improved using the proposed method. On the other hand, the execution time of the system is being comparable to that of a standard universal VQ system

Hybrid Photovoltaic/Wind Power Generation System with Storage Bank (HPWS) is a new form of power generation. Starting with a summary of the typical structure, technical characteristic of HPWS, this paper further designs an optimization model of battery storage about charging and discharging, and assigns the minimum fluctuation of power as the optimum objective function, a new concept of initial capacity of battery storage in each step and a control policy for charging and discharging as the constraint condition. Based on the model, three indexes of the power fluctuation of HPWS are put forward, combined with LPSP, EXC, which are commonly used to measure the system reliability, moreover, the five indexes can be used to appraise the total output power characteristics comprehensively. Finally, the paper use the Matlab to analyze the change tendencies of output power with the battery capacity and the guide role of the indexes for determining the optimum size of a HPWS.

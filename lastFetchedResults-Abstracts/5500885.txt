Emphasis is given to the need of standardization, in an international scope, of DC power supply systems; suggestion is made of a procedural system so that such a goal can be reached in the most objective and effective way. Firstly, a short study is made on the diversities, causes and inconveniences, present in the power supply requirements of telecommunication equipments, especially as related to the voltage variation range in their in-lets; basic principles are also stated and analyzed, to be taken into consideration while defining systems having a high standardization degree. Final considerations on the progress already reached or under development in Brazil, as regards this theme, leads to reckoning that application of these concepts and ideas is perfectly feasible in a great number of other countries.

This paper discusses an adaptive control scheme for a bidirectional boost converter used in a hybrid gasoline-electric vehicle. The converter transforms the voltage of the low-voltage battery, approximately 96 V, to 400 V on the DC-link of the motor inverter. The switching frequency of the inverter is 80 kHz, which enables the usage of rather compact 64 &#181;H inductors. However, the sampling frequency of the control scheme is 10 kHz, so the duty cycle of the switches will only be updated after 8 consecutive switching periods. Due to the large dead-time of the switches in comparison with the switching frequency, the response of the current to changes in the duty cycle is highly non-linear. The low sampling frequency of the control scheme combined with the highly non-linear current response makes it impossible for a simple PI-controller to regulate the current in a satisfactory way. At first the cause of the non-linear response is investigated. Based on that knowledge, a control scheme is developed that adjusts the duty cycle when necessary and switches between two PI-controllers, one for small currents and one for large currents. This current controller is implemented on two interleaved bidirectional boost converters. The current controllerÂ´s set point is regulated by the DC-link voltage controller.

A quantitative and objective method based on the optoelectronic kinematic analysis of hand segments and on the calculation of global and partial parameters, which provide measures of the degree of long finger and thumb extension is proposed for the evaluation of the hand's voluntary range of motion and maximal opening of the fingers and thumb. To test the precision and repeatability of the method, the protocol was applied on 14 healthy subjects (28 hands). The proposed parameters are repeatable and show a precision between 5.5° and 10.4° (mean value: 7.3°), comparable to values obtained with other methods. Advantages of the present approach include simultaneous analysis of all fingers, absence of cumbersome connecting cables and no need for individually customized devices. The method, also applied to the paretic hands of two hemiplegic stroke patients before and after electrical stimulation of the wrist and finger extensor muscles, has shown encouraging results for its clinical feasibility and utility in addition to functional tests.

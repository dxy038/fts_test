This paper implements and designs a new under frequency load shedding in competitive electricity market. In this paper  at first optimal amount of load shedding is achived to restore the power system stability and put steady state frequency in allowable range after disturbance occurring. Then a technoeconomic multi-objective function is introduced to detect  an optimal load shedding scheme considering competitive electricity market. The proposed problem include maximum GENCOs profits considering electricity power not supplied penalty cost and minimizing congestion cost in competitive electricity market. In order to solve multi objective function, a partical swarm optimization (PSO) is used to find the optimal value of load shedding. The proposed methodology is implement on a modified IEEE 39-bus test system. Generating output associated with the price of each generator, power output and price of dispatchable loads are calculated through performing smart market procedure of  MATPOWER 4.1. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in designing the optimal load shedding to restore system frequency and satisfying social welfare.

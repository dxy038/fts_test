This paper deals with the problem of Non Line Of Sight (NLOS) in wireless communications systems devoted to location purposes. It is well known that NLOS condition, which is mainly due to blocking of transmitted signal by obstacles, biases Time Of Arrival (TOA) estimates therefore providing biased position. The objective of this paper is to analyze the improvements in positioning accuracy tracking the TOA bias with the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) proposed for location estimation. The evaluation of the approach has been carried out in Impulse Radio Ultra-Wideband (IR-UWB) communications systems.

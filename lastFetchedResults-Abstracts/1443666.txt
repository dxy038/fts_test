Control synthesis for robust tracking is considered for a class of pulse-width modulated systems that appear, for example, in power electronics applications. The control objective is to regulate a high frequency ripple signal to robustly track a constant reference signal in an average sense. To achieve this goal, a new H ∞ control problem with integral action and average sampling is proposed. The solution of this problem involves a hybrid lifting framework which requires a careful elaboration in order to develop an algorithm that allows one to solve the design problem by the standard state space formulas for H ∞ control. The design procedure is verified on a synchronous buck converter.

Background: Researchers have suggested that the General Self-Efficacy (GSE) can substantially contribute to organizational theory, research, and practice. Therefore, it is important to studythe psychometric properties of the most widely used instruments like self-efficacy. Objective: The present research aims to study the psychometric properties of Schwarzer and Jerusalem’s General Self-Efficacy Scaleamong staff of the state universities in Tehran. Method: 400 employees, who completedthe GSE scale, were selected using multistage cluster sampling method. Results: The results of principle components analysis obviously supported the one- factor structure of GSE. This factor explained 47.63% of the total variance of the test. Sherer’s self-efficacy scale and the GSE were concurrently administrated to calculate the convergent validity of the GSE.The results showed that the correlation of these two scales was0.80 and significant at the level of P? 0.01. The results also indicated that reliability of GSE scale, calculated using internal consistency method, was 0.87 for all of participants, 0.85 for men and 0.88 for women. These values were acceptable and satisfactory. Mean and standard deviation of the self- efficacy scores of staff were respectively 30.50 and 4.64. The GSEfor university staff is a one-factor scale and is satisfactorily valid and reliable. Conclusion:Considering the results as well as the authentichistory of research on the GSE scale at a global level, it can be concluded that the GSE is an appropriate instrument to measure self-efficacy of university staff thatcan be used in other researches

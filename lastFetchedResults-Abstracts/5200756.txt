Edge detection has been used extensively as a preprocessing step for many computer vision tasks. Due to its importance in image processing and the highly subjective nature of human evaluation and visual comparison of edge detectors, it is desirable to formulate objective edge map evaluation measures. One would like to use such a measure to make comparisons of results using the same edge detector with different parameters as well as to make comparisons of results using different edge detectors. Reconstruction-based measures have the clear advantage that they effectively incorporate original image data. In this paper, a general model for reconstruction-based measures is established in order to alleviate the shortcomings of the reconstruction-based measures, followed by the formulation of a new non-reference measure for objective edge map evaluation. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the new measure both as a means of selecting optimal edge detector parameters and as a means of determining the relative performance of edge detectors for a given image.

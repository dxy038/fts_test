The objective of this review is to describe current methods and technologies used to decontaminate food animal carcasses in the United States and describe new technologies and methods that are under development. Bacterial reduction during the conversion of muscle to meat has always been an important challenge for the meat processing industry due to the impact on product safety and quality. More intense microbiological testing and improved microbiological methods have led to a greater awareness by industry and government about the levels of pathogenic bacteria on meat carcasses and in meat products. This increased awareness has spurred research and development on new technologies implemented sequentially in the process, aimed at reducing and eliminating bacteria on carcasses and meat products.

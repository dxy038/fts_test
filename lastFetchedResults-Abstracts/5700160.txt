The communication between two different cluster heads is still a challenge due to the hidden node problem. The cluster head may have bidirectional connection with the first non-group node to reach another node from different cluster. The presence of hidden node could not be identified to complete the communication between two different clusters. The problem of inter cluster link management is unidentified. Inter cluster grouping mechanism, which supports the communication between two different clusters is proposed. The proposed grouping protocol initiated by the cluster heads. Each cluster head sends cluster join request to non-group member of the cluster. The non-group member receives the Group Join Request (GJREQ) message and forward to other bidirectional nodes visible to them. This will be forwarded until it reaches a cluster head. Upon receiving by the cluster head, it will assign its address to the acknowledgement and sends the reply. When the source node receives the reply from non-group node it updates the neighbor cluster details. This neighbor cluster details will be used to send /receive data between clusters.

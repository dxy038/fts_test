This paper presents a performance comparison of the two modern video coding standards H.265/HEVC and VP9. For such comparison, the latest available versions of codecs for encoding were used. Comparison is provided by set of objective quality metrics. Comparing of coding efficiency is evaluated for Full HDTV and also for Ultra HDTV. Results indicate a dominance of HEVC encoding algorithm in comparison to VP9 if bit rates are set to higher values. In low bitrates results are both codecs very balanced with small dominance of VP9.

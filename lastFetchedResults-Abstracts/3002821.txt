The operation and characteristics of novel three-phase rectifiers with half-voltage DC outputs are presented. The rectifier consists of a three-phase diode bridge circuit with three additional bidirectional switches, and two tapping circuits on the DC side. The rectifier can generate relatively low distortion input currents and low ripple DC voltage at lower switching frequencies. The advantages and disadvantages of the rectifier were discussed in comparison with conventional circuits

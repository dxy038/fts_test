Today´s global competition has prompted many automotive manufacturers to design their products based on consumer´s preference and satisfaction. In car seat design and development, posture of car drivers among others is a critical factor that has to be considered closely and effectively. A car driver controls the vehicle and his/her comfort and safety is important to avoid any road injury or unfortunate accident. The objective of this paper is to depict the subjective rating of the car seat design on drivers comfort preference. A total number of 45 Malaysian citizens were involved in this study. A subjective rating scale was used to determine participants´ perception on the seat design and comfort. From the result of the rating scale, a rating percentage value is summarized for all three cars involved in the study. It was found also a significant difference value for the seat width, drivers´ seat condition, arm comfort and whole body comfort parameters between the three sets of data.

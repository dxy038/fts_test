This paper proposes a new application of bees algorithm (BA). In this application, the multi-objective bees algorithm (MOBA) is developed for solving the multi-objective optimal power flow (MOOPF) problems on small and large scale power system. The objectives of MOOPF are to minimize the total fuel cost of generation, environmental pollution and power system loss by considering many constraints i.e. limits on generator real and reactive power outputs, bus voltages, transformer tap-setting and power flow of transmission lines. Proposed crowded selection mechanism and fuzzy mechanism techniques are added into selection process of proposed MOBA. Also, the algorithm based on fuzzy set theory is used to extract the best compromise solution. In order to prove the proposed MOBA method, the simulation result of weight aggregation is used for comparison. The standard IEEE-30 and IEEE-118 bus system is selected to test the algorithm. The result shows that Pareto front of proposed MOBA are diverse and well distributed. The proposed MOBA have good performance and efficiency to solve multi-objective optimal power flow.

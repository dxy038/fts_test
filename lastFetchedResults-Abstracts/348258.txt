Objective
To investigate the somatotopic organization of the facial skin area in the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) in humans.
Methods
Somatosensory evoked magnetic fields following air-puff stimulation of 5 body sites, the foot, the lip and 3 points of the facial skin (forehead, cheek and mandibular angle point), were recorded. We focused on activities in SII following stimulation of these 5 sites and compared dipole locations among them.
Results
There was a clear somatotopic organization in SII with lip in the most lateral area, foot in the most medial area and face in an intermediate area close to the lip area. However, there was no significant difference of dipole localization in SII among the 3 areas of facial skin, similar to the overlapped somatotopic organization of facial skin areas in the primary somatosensory cortex in our previous study.
Conclusions
The facial skin areas are considered to occupy a small area in SII with insufficient spatial separation to differentiate each area of facial skin even using magnetoencephalography which has a high spatial resolution.
Significance
This is the first systematic study of the activated regions in SII following stimulation of the facial skin.

Objective
m of this study was to evaluate the clinical retention of a one-step self-etching adhesive system (Xeno III) in Class V non-carious cervical lesions and the effect of restorative material and curing techniques on longevity of the restorations.
als and methods
l of 139 Class V restorations were placed with the self-etching primer Xeno III and a resin composite (Tetric Ceram) or a poly-acid modified resin composite (Dyract AP) in non-carious cervical lesions without intentional enamel involvement. The materials were cured with a conventional continuous light, a soft-start or a pulse-delay curing mode. The restorations were evaluated at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months and then yearly during a 7 year follow-up with modified USPHS criteria. Dentine bonding efficiency was determined by the percentage of lost restorations.
s
 the 7 years, 135 restorations could be evaluated. No post-operative sensitivity was reported by the participants. Overall relative cumulative loss rate frequencies for the adhesive system at 6 and 18 months and 7 years, independent of curing technique and restorative material, were 0.8%, 6.9% and 23.0%, respectively. The self-etching adhesive fulfilled at 18 months the full acceptance ADA criteria. Tetric Ceram showed at 7 years a 20.9% loss of retention and Dyract AP a 25.0% loss rate (Log rank p = 0.48). The loss rates for the 3 curing techniques: continuous, soft start and pulse delay were 17%, 27.9% and 24.4%, respectively (Log rank p = 0.52). No secondary caries was observed.
icance
ngle-step self-etching adhesive showed acceptable clinical long-time retention rates to dentine surfaces independent of restorative material and curing technique used.

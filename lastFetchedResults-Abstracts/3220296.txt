In the recent times, there has been considerable effort towards developing an effective and widely informative patient health record system. To meet this objective, diversified groups working on medical informatics have made concerted attempt to bind biome&#769;dical knowledge base with patient health data. This approach necessitates a strong need to make all relevant patientÂ´s clinical information available through extensive information search, thereby enabling better clinical management. Through this work we propose a method to bind patient event sequences, the temporal medical information and the medical knowledge. The run time extraction of information pose challenges such as (a) performance (b) a priori relation identification and (c) handling of memory overheads. This paper describes a practical implementation of a patient health record linked to a knowledge base and integrated with an information extraction platform ensuring a good balance between the performance complexity and memory usage.

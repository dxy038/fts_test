This paper utilizes a cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) to a MIMO control problem. The objective of this paper is to control a twin rotor MIMO system (TRMS) to move quickly and accurately to the desired attitudes, both the pitch angle and the azimuth angle in decoupled condition. A conventional CMAC and an adaptive CMAC are applied to control the TRMS in step response and sine wave response. For real-time control, Altera Nios II FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) is employed to construct a hardware-in-the-loop system through writing C and VHDL codes on this FPGA. Simulations show that the proposed CMAC controller can successfully control the TRMS to follow desired references.

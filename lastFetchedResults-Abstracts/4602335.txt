In this paper, we study an image-based PID control of a redundant planar parallel robot using a fixed camera configuration. The control objective is to move the robot end effector to the desired image reference position. The control law has a PD term plus an integral term with a nonlinear function of the position error. The proportional and integral actions use image loop information whereas the derivative action adds damping using joint level measurements. The Lyapunov method and the LaSalle invariance principle allow assessing asymptotic closed loop stability. Experiments show the performance of the proposed approach.

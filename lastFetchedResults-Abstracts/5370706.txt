A novel philosophy of secure mobile agent model which is based on trust model, risk evaluation and cryptography is proposed in this paper. Compared to current related research, our dynamic model can update in real time and is comprehensive for combining subjective and objective estimation. In addition, this model is broadly adaptive due to its flexibility. Trust and trust relationship are defined on secure problem as while as character of trust itself which are faced when analyzing mobile agent, and trust update function and recommender evaluate function which are already existent are improved. Finally, secure problems which might be brought by trust are discussed.

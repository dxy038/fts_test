Bilevel programming, a tool for modeling decentralized decisions, consists of the objective of the leader at its first level and that of the follower at the second level. Bilevel programming has been proved to be NP-hard problem. Numerous algorithms have been developed so far for solving bilevel programming problem. In this paper, an attempt has been made to develop an efficient approach based on genetic algorithm. The efficiency of the algorithm is ascertained by comparing the results with Gendreau et al. (J. Global Optimization 8 (1996) 217â€“233) method.

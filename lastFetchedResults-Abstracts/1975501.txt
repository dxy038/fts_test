This paper provides a review and critique of measurement strategies and methods for the study of job stressors and strains, with an emphasis on mental and physical well-being outcomes. The issue of self-report versus objective approaches to the measurement of potentially stressful working conditions is discussed with a view toward using both approaches in a multiple indicator analytical strategy. Short- and long-term outcomes of stressful work experiences are discussed in terms of differences in constructs rather than differences in measurement methods. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges accompanying measuring the physiological processes that theoretically mediate the effects of job stressors on well-being.

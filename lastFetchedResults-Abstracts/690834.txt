The overall objective of this study was to investigate the impact of blending membrane-treated water treatment plant (WTP) residuals with plant-filtered water on finished water quality in terms of biostability and disinfectant by-product (DBP) formation. Filter backwash water (FBWW) was treated with a pilot-scale ultrafiltration (UF) membrane to produce permeate that was blended with plant-finished water. The batch studies involved storing samples for a specified time with a disinfectant residual to simulate residence time in the distribution system. Both chlorinated and non-chlorinated FBWW streams were evaluated, and the experimental design incorporated free chlorine, monochloramine, and chlorine dioxide in parallel to a model system that did not receive a disinfectant dose. The results of the study found that blending 10% UF-treated FBWW with plant-filtered water did not have an impact on water biostability as monitored with heterotrophic plate counts (HPCs) or DBP concentrations as monitored by TTHM and HAA5 concentrations. However, the presence of preformed THM and HAA species found in chlorinated FBWW streams may result in higher levels of initial DBP concentrations in blended water matrices, and could have a significant impact on finished water quality in terms of meeting specific DBP guidelines or regulations.

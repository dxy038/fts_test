Background and Objective: In many countries, especially in developing countries, diarrheal diseases are among the most important causes of mortality. In these countries, due to availability of transfer conditions of parasitic infections, (pathogenic and non-pathogenic parasite), the prevalence of these disorders is high. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of parasites causing diarrhea in Gorgan.
Material and Methods:   This cross-sectional study was performed on 1086 patients with acute diarrhea using wet-mount method and formalin-ether concentration test, according to WHO protocol.
 Results:   of 1086, 197 (18.1%) are infected with intestinal parasites, 141 (13%) with Protozoa and 79 (7.27%) with intestinal worms. The prevalence, using wet-mount method, of Entamoeba histolytica is 69 (6.4%), Giardia lamblia is 27 (2.5%), entamoeba coli is 15 (1.4%) and chilomastix mesnili is 8 (0.7%). With formalin-ether method, Hymenolepis nana in 26 (2.4%), Trichostrongylus in 16 (1.5%), Enterobius vermicularis in 10 (0.9%) are observed. 
Conclusion: The high prevalence of Entamoeba histolytica shows the leading role of this parasite in causing acute diarrhea. Having knowledge about epidemiology and applying rapid diagnostic procedures can be helpful to promote public health.

Backgrand and Objective: Varicocel is known as one of the most common cause of male
infertility which occurs through different mechanisms. Immunologic reasons such as antisperm
antibody (ASA) may have also a role in infertility. The aim of this study was to determine the
antisperm antibody in semen and serum of male patients with varicocel before and alter
varicocel surgery.
Methods and materials: A cross sectional study was conducted on 65 varicocel patients
who had indication for varicocel surgery. were candidate for assessment of ASA level in semen
and serum pre and post surgery. The level of ASA was measured by direct and indirect
SPERM. MAR-test. Over 15% ASA level was considered as positive result.
Resultsz. The semen analysis after surgery showed recovery regarding all three parameters
including sperm count, motility and morphology, where changes in count and motility revealed
significant (p<0.05) differences. Thirteen percent of patients before surgery showed positive
level of ASA in serum and semen, whose ASA level three-months alter surgery was positive 15
% in sernem and 21% in serum. Serum level of ASA before and alter surgery showed
significant differences(P~O.03I). In semen, the level of ASA did not show any differences
(p~0.772). After surgery, semen parameters compared within positive and negative ASA
patients showed only significant difference in motility (P~ 0.035). Within patients with negative
ASA before surgery 48 patients showed ASA level about 5-15% with no effect on semen
parameters.
Conclusion: Based on these findings, it can be concluded that varicocelectomy may cause
positive ASA level in serum of patients after surgery. However, in comparison with patients
with negative ASA alter surgery, no changes in the semen parameters can be seen except
reduction in motility. Since varicocelectomy showed no effect on semen ASA, thus
varicocelectomy has no unfavorable effects on male infertility.

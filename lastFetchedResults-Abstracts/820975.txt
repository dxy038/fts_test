Wind farms are designed to supply power to the consumers at a minimal price. The cost of wind power production directly or indirectly depends on proper selection of vendors. The present paper highlights a model for selection and ranking of vendors for a wind farm based on fuzzy set theory to determine criteria weights and an additive ratio assessment (ARAS) method to analysis criteria values. The objective of the paper is to establish the ARAS method as an effective method for Vendor selection. A case study is shown to ascertain the proposed method especially when the criteria are interdependent and conflicting in nature. The result is validated with another popular MCDM technique, COPRAS, which shows that the models are effective and applicable, and provide decision makers with better solutions for decision making.

The increased demand on data and the scarcity of available bandwidth motivate research for new technologies beyond 4G. In this paper we provide a system level study of a new cellular architecture that incorporates millimeter wave technology (60 GHz) for the access link. A system level simulation is carried out for a university campus and an urban environment and the sensitivity to various design parameters has been studied. The objective of such a system is to provide up to 500X the wireless network capacity that is delivered today without a significant increase in energy or deployment costs.

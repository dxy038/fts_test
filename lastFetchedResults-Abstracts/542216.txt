Objective: the article is a review of the very controversial microbial life in subsurface environments like caves, rocks, mines, deep subsurface water and springs, in very special extreme environments. Material and Methods: the methods of isolation of the bacteria and archaea from subsurface environments are discussed too and analysed. Results: the results of years of investigations showed the possiblilities of adaptation to extreme environments and survival on very long periods of times, even geological eras, of some microorganisms. The inner biochemical, physical, biological and energetic mechanisms are still not elucidated, even some features were discovered. Conclusion: an extensive and intensive work of cooperation in this field of activity is required to discover the mechanisms of long term survival in extreme conditions of the subsurface microorganisms.

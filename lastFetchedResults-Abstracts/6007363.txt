A UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) needs to plan the flight path dynamically according to the changes of battlefield threat situation. For this issue, this paper presents the method of a UAV 3-D space dynamic path planning which combined comprehensive intercept probability estimation model with model predictive control algorithm. The estimation model of comprehensive intercept probability is acquired by calculating radar continuous tracking probability and anti-aircraft missiles shot down probability as a UAV flies to the ground defensive position. On this basis, this paper introduces the comprehensive intercept probability estimation result into the target function of model predictive control algorithm. A series of online control quantities are acquired by rolling the optimization objective function. Thus, a UAV 3-D space dynamic path planning can be accomplished. The simulation results show that this method is effective against the intercept from the ground defensive positions. It, therefore, improves the UAV survival probability in the battlefield environment.

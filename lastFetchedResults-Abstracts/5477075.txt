In the last few years critical infrastructures have become more and more tightly interconnected and their protection is one of the major issues for the national and international security. In order to achieve that, many modeling techniques for the interdependencies existing among them have been proposed. Now, a crucial issue is how to use such models to develop tools able to estimate the status of key elements of CIs, quantify the possible threats and suggest adequate countermeasures to human operators and actors. Due to security, commercial and technological aspects, the only feasible approach is to provide distributed and interconnected state/interdependency estimators. In this paper the general problem of the state estimation of interconnected systems sharing the same model is introduced. A first step in the solution of such a challenging problem is then provided in the case of linear systems. The final objective of this research is to define an effective framework for the problem at hand, and then implement and validate an on-line distributed state/interdependency estimator within the EU IST MICIE project.

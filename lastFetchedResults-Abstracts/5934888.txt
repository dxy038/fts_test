According to characteristics of bracing engineering for deep foundation pit in metro, an index system for supporting scheme is established. Using the theory of fuzzy probability and analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a comprehensive assessment model is constructed to optimize supporting scheme for deep excavation of metro. In order to assess the index weights scientifically, the fuzzy weighted value is proposed to avoid the limitation while determining the index weights. The practical example, with 4 supporting schemes for deep foundation pit of metro in Guangzhou, is introduced and compared to the results obtained by other methods. The method is based on clear concept and rigorous theories, and can be applied extensively to obtain objective and dependable result for the managers of civil engineering.

This paper presents trajectory tracking for an overhead gantry crane. The system has two degrees-of-freedom and is underactuated. We present two nonlinear control techniques and the objective of the paper is to compare the two techniques for this particular trajectory control problem from various points of view -in particular the control magnitudes and robustness. One of the techniques is the Interconnection and damping assignment-passivity based control (IDA-PBC) notion and the other is a direct Lyapunov approach.

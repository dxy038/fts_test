In this paper we present an approach to automatic generation of GUI for browsing of RDF data based on observation of existing forms and their adaptation to available RDF graphs. The objective of such an approach is the rapid prototyping of forms and their associated queries by exploiting the vast amount examples that is already available from the Web, and trying to automate those steps requiring human intervention (form template extraction, query specification) for customizing found examples to developerÂ´s specific needs.

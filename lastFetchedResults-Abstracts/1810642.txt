The objective of this work was to investigate the adhesion properties of a silicone elastomer coating to an epoxy-coated aluminum substrate. Various silane-based adhesion promoters and different application methods were used to improve the adhesion of silicone coating to the epoxy undercoat. Adhesion strength was measured using pull-off method. Static contact angle measurements and surface free energy data were used to determine the wettability of the surfaces. SEM technique was employed to investigate the compatibility of the components.

s showed that the addition of silane compound improves the adhesion strength of silicone coating to epoxy undercoat, however, this depends on the composition of the tie layer.

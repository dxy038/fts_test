This note considers finite time stabilization of uncertain chained form systems. The objective is to design a nonsmooth state feedback law such that the controlled chained form system is both Lyapunov stable and finite-time convergent within any given settling time. We propose a novel switching control strategy with help of homogeneity, time-rescaling, and Lyapunov-based method. Also, the simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control design approach.

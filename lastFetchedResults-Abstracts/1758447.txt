Objective
difficult to know when children hospitalized with pertussis can be safely discharged. We sought to identify clinical features of children hospitalized with pertussis that are associated with readmission.
s
 series of 207 children hospitalized with pertussis was studied. The 33 children readmitted with pertussis were compared with the 174 who did not require readmission.
s
aphic characteristics and immunization status of the children with pertussis requiring readmission did not differ from the children who were not readmitted. Median duration of initial hospital stay was 4 days for both groups (P = .11). The children who were readmitted had more cyanotic episodes per day (0.8 vs 0.0 episodes, P = .03) and on greater proportion of hospital days (0.5 vs 0.1, P = .01). On the last day of admission, the children subsequently readmitted had more coughing episodes (4 vs 0, P &lt; .001), and a larger proportion had a cyanotic episode (30% vs 10%, P = .003). The risk of readmission was increased in children who had ≥1 cyanotic episode per day (relative risk [RR] = 2.5, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.3–4.6); cyanosis on ≥50% of days (RR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.4–4.8); ≥ 2 coughing paroxysms on the last hospital day (RR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.3–4.4); or any cyanosis on the last day (RR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.5–5.2).
sions
smal cough and cyanosis are clinical signs that can be used in children hospitalized with pertussis to help decide when to discharge them from hospital.

The single vehicle routing problem with multiple routes is a variant of the vehicle routing problem where the vehicle can be dispatched to several routes during its workday to serve a number of customers. In this paper we propose a goal programming model for multi-objective
single vehicle routing problem with time windows and multiple routes. To solve the model, we present a heuristic methodwhich exploitsan elementaryShortest Path Algorithmwith Resource Constraints. Computational results of the proposed algorithmare discussed.

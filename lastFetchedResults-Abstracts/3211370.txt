Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) is one of the recently developed population based algorithms which has shown impressive performance over other Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). BBO is based on the study of geographical distribution of biological organisms over space and time. Yagi-Uda antenna design is most widely used antenna at VHF and UHF frequencies due to high gain, directivity and ease of construction. However, designing a Yagi-Uda antenna that involves determination of wire-lengths and spacings is highly complex and non-linear problem. If gain is intended to increase then imaginary part in impedance becomes significant. In this paper Non-dominated Sorting BBO (NSBBO) is proposed and investigated for Multi-objective optimization of six-element Yagi-Uda antenna designs to optimize two objectives, viz., gain and impedance, simultaneously. The best results and BBO flow are presented in the ending sections of the paper.

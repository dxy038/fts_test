An autonomous agent response learning (AARL) algorithm is presented in this paper. We proposed to decompose the award function into a set of local award functions. By optimizing this objective function set, the response function with maximum award can be determined. To tackle the optimization problem, a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) called "multi-species PSO (MS-PSO)" is introduced by considering each objective function as a specie swarm. Two sets of experiments are provided to illustrate the performance of MS-PSO. The results show that it returns a more accurate response set within shorter duration by comparing with other PSO methods.

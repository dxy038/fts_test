A design study for the control system of low speed Maglev vehicle is described which uses the ANDECS-MATLAB design environment. A particular feature is that the multi-objective facility within ANDECS is used to satisfy simultaneously the suspension requirements corresponding to both random and deterministic inputs. Two different control strategies, one classically derived and the other using linear optimal techniques, are optimised to meet the same performance requirements, and the results contrasted. The paper demonstrates the power and effectiveness of using concurrent CACSD techniques to provide practical solutions for realistic control engineering problems

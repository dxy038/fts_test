Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications are of growing importance in designing access/home networks. This paper proposes an energy-efficient P2P communication architecture over a wavelength division multiplexing/time division multiplexing passive optical network (WDM/TDM-PON). The proposed architecture includes adaptive link rate (ALR) and network coding (NC) techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed architecture can reduce the power consumption of a communication device effectively in the presence of bidirectional P2P traffic.

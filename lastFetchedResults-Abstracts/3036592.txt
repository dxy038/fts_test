Over the years, grid-connected PV-systems have developed into complex installations containing a variety of components and features supposed to be necessary for proper operation under all circumstances. In this paper it is shown (in theory and practice) that it is possible to simplify system design and installation dramatically, without any compromise. In fact, such systems are inherently safe and respond extremely well to non-optimal operating conditions and faults. PV-wirefree is based on the concept of combining the functions of support or integration with those of electrical connection and current conduction. Within one (sub)system all modules are connected in parallel, at a DC-voltage of less than 21V. A PV-wirefree system consists only of PV laminates, click-on-click-off dual-purpose clamps, aluminium extrusions and an inverter. No diodes, no cables, no connectors, no junction boxes, etc. The main objective of PV-wirefree is to minimize costs of PV-systems and costs of electricity generated by PV-systems. With PV-wirefree we estimate the BOS-costs can be reduced with more than 50%.

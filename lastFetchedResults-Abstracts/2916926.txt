The INMARSAT-3 series of satellites are expected to be developed from 1994 onwards in the four INMARSAT operating regions and will form the backbone of the INMARSAT system up to the year 2000. INMARSAT is presently in the process of coordinating the operating of the INMARSAT-3 satellite networks with the MSS satellite networks of other countries within the framework of the ITU Radio Regulations. The overall objective for INMARSAT in this coordination process is to obtain regulated access to sufficient L-band MSS spectrum in order accommodate the substantial MSS traffic in the INMARSAT system projected in the 1990Â´s and beyond. The authors provide a possible constellation of MSS satellites at year 2000, and list the L-band MSS satellite networks filed at the ITU

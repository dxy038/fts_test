Objectives
tudy sought to investigate the clinical outcome of patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for in-stent restenosis (ISR) randomized to short (6 months) versus long (24 months) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) regimen.
ound
still unclear if patients treated for ISR may benefit from a long DAPT regimen.
s
e present purpose, we selected 224 patients undergoing the PCI procedure for ISR enrolled in the PRODIGY (Prolonging Dual Antiplatelet Treatment After Grading Stent-Induced Intimal Hyperplasia) trial and randomized to short (6 months) versus long (24 months) DAPT regimen. The primary objective was the cumulative incidence of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or cerebrovascular accident at 24 months. Safety endpoints were moderate and major bleeding complications.
s
l, 114 patients were allocated to short DAPT regimen, whereas 110 patients were allocated to long DAPT regimen. Twenty-seven patients reached the primary endpoint (19 in short DAPT regimen vs. 8 in long DAPT regimen; p = 0.02). The cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint at 24 months was 16.7% in the short DAPT regimen group compared with 7.3% in the long DAPT regimen group (p = 0.034). This is principally due to a lower occurrence of death and MI in the long DAPT regimen group as compared to the short DAPT regimen group (6.5% vs. 15.5%; p = 0.03). There was no difference in the occurrence of bleeding complications between long and short DAPT regimen.
sions
udy offers preliminary evidence that patients receiving a new PCI procedure for ISR may benefit from long-term administration of aspirin plus clopidogrel. (Synergy Between Stent and Drugs to Avoid Ischemic Recurrences After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention [PRODIGY]; NCT00611286)

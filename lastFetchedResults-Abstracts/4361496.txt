The complexity of the real time power system operation is so high that several tools must be available in order to help training electric management systems (EMS) operators and also teaching engineering graduate and undergraduate students. Computer based training systems have played an important role in providing users with a better understanding of power system operation. They have witnessed steady progress since the early 1980s. In this article the authorsÂ´ objective is to present the development of a Tcl/Tk (Tool Command Language/Tool Kit) GUI (Graphical User Interface) based real-time power system operation simulator program. Users can dynamically interact with the target system by using an one-line diagram to change system measurements (MW, MVAr and kV) and also change transformers taps and circuit breaker status

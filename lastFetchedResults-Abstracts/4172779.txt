In this paper, we introduce a new demosaicing algorithm that can be used for various sensor images captured by digital cameras equipped with various red-green-blue color filter arrays. Our algorithm enhances the universal demosaicing algorithm of Lukac et al by defining a new spectral interpolation model that exploits not only the information on the color of pixels but also the relative distance between neighboring pixels within an image. Moreover, we include an edge-detection model that makes our algorithm adaptive and reduces the presence of color shifts and artifacts. A series of tests has been made on images of the Kodak database, and our algorithm performs better than the universal demosaicing algorithm with regard to both subjective and objective evaluation. The versatility of our demosaicing algorithm is also highlighted through an application to the issue of color image resampling, and we obtain conclusive experimental results.

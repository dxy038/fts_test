This paper presents an extension of the free-space method for measurement of bi-axial anisotropic material at microwave frequencies. In this method, four complex transverse constitutive parameters are directly computed from the reflection and transmission coefficients of a planar sample in free space for a normally incident plane wave with two polarizations. By using the measured amplitudes of the reflection and transmission coefficients of a planar sample at six incident angles with two polarizations, two complex longitudinal constitutive parameters are obtained by finding the solution to minimize the properly designed objective function under the suitable judging criterion. The numerical trials are carried out for a high-loss material by joining random errors to simulate the real measurement condition, which verifies the validity of this method.

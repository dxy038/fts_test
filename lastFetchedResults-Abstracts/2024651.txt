Abstract - Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) face
unavoidable challenges in the areas of maintaining
connectivity, network lifetime and energy efficiency in
its implementation. Recently, several WSN
architectures based on mobile elements (MEs) have
been proposed which can beleveraged to overcome
these problems. Mobility of the mobile elements is
controlled by the protocols & algorithms. We surveyed
on different aspect data collection algorithms for
WSNs such as Partitioning Based Scheduling (PBS)
algorithm, Multihop Route to Mobile Element(MRME)
algorithm, etc. and found the method scheduler of
mobile element in WSNs for data collection. Wehave
highlighted their objective, feature, complexity in this
paper.

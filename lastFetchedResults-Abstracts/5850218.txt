An effective tabu search algorithm is proposed for solving No-idle permutation Flow Shop Scheduling Problem in this paper. The objective is to minimize the maximum completion time (MakeSpan) of the problem. The Tabu Search Algorithm starts to search from an initial solution generated by the famous NEH heuristic. The dynamic feature of the tabu list length is applied to improve the robustness of the algorithm. In order to further improve the capability of the algorithm, a detailed local search method is introduced. Simulation results show the effectiveness and superiority of the algorithm.

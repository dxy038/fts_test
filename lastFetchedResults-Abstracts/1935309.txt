ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cardiac arrhythmia is a potentially fatal complication of acute coronary syndromes. Researchers believe that the magnesium disturbance is an important factor causing the arrhythmias. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum magnesium levels and the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in patients with acute coronary syndromes.
METHODS: This observational study was performed as a cohort, 124 goal-oriented patients were evaluated (two groups of hypomagnesemia and normomagnesemia, 62 subjects in each group. Variables included patient demographics, primary diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome, magnesium levels, cardiac arrhythmia and its rate and origin. At first, serum magnesium levels were measured and then the patients were followed up for incidence of cardiac arrhythmias for 72 hours, and two groups were compared with each other.  
FINDINGS: In this study, 17 subjects (24.7%) in hypomagnesemia and 8 patients (12.9%) in normomagnesemia group had cardiac arrhythmia showing a statistically significant difference (p=0.044). However the magnesium level was not related to subgroup of arrhythmia and its rate, also magnesium level was not related to the type of acute coronary syndromes.
CONCLUSION: According to the obtained results, it may be concluded that there is a significant association between serum magnesium level and cardiac arrhythmia among this patients. 

KEY WORDS: Serum magnesium level, Cardiac arrhythmia, Acute coronary syndromes.

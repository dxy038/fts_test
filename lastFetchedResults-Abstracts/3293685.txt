Increased penetration of renewable generation and demand to drive more value from existing assets is causing a shift in how distribution grid operators manage their networks. Current infrastructure constraints and the costs of core capital upgrades are, however, hampering the speed at which these changes can take place. An effort between Toronto Hydro, Prolucid and LocalGrid Technologies is helping to address this concern by deploying configurable, distributed intelligence into the distribution grid. Intelligent Nodes will be situated in a substation, monitoring feeder load, and next to distributed generation (DG) sites, where they can monitor and interact with the associated distributed generation controller. Logic in the Intelligent Node at the substation will be responsible for monitoring and dispatching distributed generation within required bounds. The aim of the demonstration project is four-fold: To demonstrate the effectiveness of a distributed and reconfigurable data collection and automation platform for the distribution grid; To quantify the nature of the current DG connectivity constraints; To simulate and test the process of active and autonomous control of DGs with the objective of increasing the DG capacity above the worst case scenario planning levels; To document the success of this project and demonstrate to stakeholders that there are viable alternatives to the two current extremes; doing nothing (and being constrained in terms of DG connectivity) or investing on large capital upgrades for marginal gains.

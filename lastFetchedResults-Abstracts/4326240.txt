Since the past 4-7 years the paradigm of Cyber-Physical Systems has gained growing attention, starting from initiatives taken by US government institutions such as NSF, NIST and other funding agencies. Such software systems were then requested to realize a widest possible correspondence, if not congruence between software system and real-world structures, the latter to be controlled by the software system. We will, in this paper, describe the implications of this comprehensive objective, for the modeling, analyzing, testing and evaluating under a cyberphysical perspective. This will be done by sketching the major development steps within the DEZENT project over the past 7 years, from the early de-sign steps until a large real-world field study in a Southern German region which is already covered with renewable energy by nearly 100%. The emphasis will be on the mutual inspiration between applicational and software-technical constraints and insights, gained by the partners from Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and practitioners who altogether benefitted considerably with respect to their successful cooperation.

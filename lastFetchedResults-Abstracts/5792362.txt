Algorithms to determine the itinerary of intelligent agents are fundamental in the context of distributed applications based on mobile agents with time constraints. In order to establish the agent itinerary it is necessary to consider the trade-offs between high-quality of results and meeting the deadline. In this paper, we describe and evaluate adaptive heuristics able to choose the best behaviour to be used for decision making in the itinerary definition. This decision-making is based on a log of benefits collected by the mobile agent in past executions. The paperÂ´s objective is to propose a new heuristic able to realize the change in the environment and adapt itself dynamically, changing its behaviour in order to meet the deadline of the mission and to achieve the greatest possible benefit.

Using rigorous multiple scattering theory in determining the average or bulk dielectric properties of discrete random media is the objective of this communication. The random medium is modeled as a random distribution of identical, spherical scatterers imbedded in an homogeneous unbounded background medium. At high scatterer concentration, the form of the radial distribution function becomes important; two forms are considered here, viz., virial series and the self-consistent form. The average loss tangent of the bulk medium is computed as a function of frequency and scatterer concentration, and compared with a frequently used mixture formula, e.g., Maxwell-Garnett. The results show that multiple scattering losses are significant at the higher concentrations and must be accounted for when <img alt="ka gtr\\sim 0.05" src="/images/tex/13257.gif"/> . The theory and the computational procedure can thus he used as a mixture formula for <img alt="ka" src="/images/tex/12738.gif"/> in the range <img alt="0 &lt; ka \\hbox{ $_{\\sim}^{&lt;}$} 5.0" src="/images/tex/13258.gif"/> and concentrations in the range <img alt="0.01 &lt; c \\hbox{ $_{\\sim}^{&lt;}$} 0.40" src="/images/tex/13259.gif"/> .

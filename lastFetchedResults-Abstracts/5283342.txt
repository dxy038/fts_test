A thyristor-assisted standard cell compatible self-timed bidirectional repeater with no configuration overhead enables 8mm interconnects to achieve 37% higher speed at 20% lower energy over conventional repeaters in 65nm CMOS at 1.0V. Bidirectional operation without the need for configuration logic removes the need for clocking, yielding up to 14&#215; higher energy efficiency at low data switching activity.

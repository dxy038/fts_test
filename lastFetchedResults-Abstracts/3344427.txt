This work presents a novel floor planner tailored for Partially-Reconfigurable FPGAs having an arbitrary distribution of heterogeneous resources. The proposed approach precomputes a set of feasible placements for each of the reconfigurable regions, thus allowing the designer to set a preference on the types and positions of the desired areas. Then, the core of the approach is based on a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation which exploits constraints derived from a conflict graph to prevent overlapping between areas. Experimental results have shown that the defined approach leads to an average 11% improvements in the objective function value w.r.t. The state-of-the-art solutions under the same limited time budget.

In this letter, we propose a novel method for unsupervised change detection (CD) in multitemporal Erreur Relative Globale Adimensionnelle de Synthese (ERGAS) satellite images by using the relative dimensionless global error in synthesis index locally. In order to obtain the change image, the index is calculated around a pixel neighborhood (3 <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="\\times" src="/images/tex/326.gif"/> </formula> 3 window) processing simultaneously all the spectral bands available. With the objective of finding the binary change masks, six thresholding methods are selected. A comparison between the proposed method and the change vector analysis method is reported. The accuracy CD showed in the experimental results demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

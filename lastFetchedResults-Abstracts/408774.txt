A 42-year-old man with a history of repeated abdominal surgery and lymph node tuberculosis underwent orthotopic liver transplantation for primary sclerosing cholangitis. Two years after transplantation, this patient developed a severe protein-losing enteropathy with no evidence of cardiac diseae or lymphoproliferative disorder. Imaging work-up revealed hemodynamically significant stenosis of the supra-hepatic caval anastomosis, which was treated by percutaneous balloon angioplasty. All clinical and biochemical disorders resolved within 1 month after percutaneous dilatation, but relapsed simultaneously with recurrent anastomotic stenosis 15 months later. Repeat caval angioplasty resulted in rapid recovery, which strongly suggests that hepatic venous outflow obstruction was responsible for the protein-losing enteropathy in this patient.

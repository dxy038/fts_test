In this paper we present a different approach to the mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-control problem. The procedure involves the formulation of a finite-time cost functional that represents an H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-bound in a H<sub>2</sub>-optimization setting through a specific parametrization of the worst-case disturbance. One benefit of this formulation is that the ensuing optimization procedure does not require an initial controller guess to be stabilizing. Our approach also represents a non-Riccati based method for the mixed H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-control problem, it allows the incorporation of linear controllers with arbitrary structure and order; a problem that has not yet been solved in a numerically efficient manner. Here, we define a time-domain cost functional that, as t<sub>&#8747;</sub> &#8594; &#8734;, will lead to the solution of an optimal H<sub>2</sub>-norm control problem with an H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-norm bound constraint (i.e T<sub>z&#8734; w&#8734;</sub><sub>&#8734;</sub> &#8810; &#947; where &#947; is a prespecified parameter). Parameterizations of the controller and the worst-case disturbance will lead naturally to the use of numerical parameter optimization techniques. Finally an example will illustrate the tradeoff between the H<sub>2</sub>- and the H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-design objective.

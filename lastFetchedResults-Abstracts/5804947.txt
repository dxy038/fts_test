This paper addresses the problem of joint admission control and power allocation in the downlink of a single-cell code-division-multiple-access (CDMA) wireless network. The objective is to maximize the user-capacity (or base station revenue), while meeting the strict quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of each admitted user. We prove that the global optimal solution can be found by performing admission control and power allocation separately. To solve the admission control problem, we give an exact polynomial-time algorithm for user-capacity maximization, and an efficient approximation algorithm for base station revenue maximization. To solve the power control problem, we provide two simple heuristics, that can be efficiently carried out by the base station. Numerical results further demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed approach.

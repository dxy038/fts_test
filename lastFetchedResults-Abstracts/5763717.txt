It is the key to construct the virtual link for P2P network. In this paper, put forward a virtual link selection model of multi-objective solution, and consider the metrics in this model including viability, routing cost, connectivity and the latency. Through the analysis of these network parameters, establish the virtual link selection model for P2P network. Meanwhile, presents the solution algorithm - the ant colony algorithm based on simulated annealing for virtual link selection model. And then, analysis the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm by the experiments.

The prime objective behind optimized sensor deployment is to reduce sensing range of a sensor node. Proper positioning of sensor nodes leads to increased lifetime, better coverage and more connectivity among nodes. In this paper, the sensor deployment problem has been considered as a clustered approach and the solution to the optimal co-ordinates of the sensor deployment has been obtained using Bacterial Foraging Optimization.

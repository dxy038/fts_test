Background: Knee osteoarthritis is one of the most prevalent chronic disorders. Several pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches have been used to treat knee osteoarthritis. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of adding vitamin B to Diclofenac on pain due to knee osteoarthritis.
Methods: This double-blind clinical trial was carried out on 73 patients with knee osteoarthritis referred to the Rheumatology and Orthopedics clinics of Shahrekord University of Medical sciences in 2013. The patients underwent treatment with oral Diclofenac plus oral vitamin B (38 patients), or oral Diclofenac plus placebo (35 patients). Pain was measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) and morning stiffness and physical functioning were measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) before treatment, and 14 and 21 days after treatment. Data were analyzed using Chi-square test, T-test, and repeated measures ANOVA.
Findings: The visual analogue WOMAC mean score for knee pain, overall pain severity, stiffness of knee joint, and function in the last 48 hours significantly decreased in both groups from the first to third measurement. Decrease in overall pain severity, function in the last 48 hours and stiffness of knee joint scores in vitamin B group was more than Diclofenac group. Decrease in knee pain VAS was similar in both groups. Patient satisfaction was not significantly different between the two groups.
Conclusion: With regards to the results, it seems that vitamin B supplement is useful for the treatment of osteoarthritis symptoms.

Objective: Salvia and Phlomis species are traditionally used in different infectious conditions. In the present study the antibacterial activities of Salvia sahendica and Phlomis caucasica (Iran endemic taxa) were evaluated against a range of gram positive and negative bacterial strains. Methods: n-Hexane, dichloromethane and methanol extracts of aerial parts of Salvia sahendica and Phlomis caucasica were prepared and their antibacterial activity against gram negative bacterial strains including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella paratyphi and Serratia marcescens as well as gram positive bacterial strains namely Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumonia and Bacillus cereus were investigated using paper-disk agar diffusion method. SPE method was used for fractionation of methanol extract and activity of the fraction was monitored. Results: n-Hexane and dichloromethane extracts of both plants had no antibacterial effect against none of the examined strains but methanol extracts had a moderate activity on some bacteria especially within the gram positive group. Fractions of methanol extracts showed a remarkable antibacterial activity. Among the tested bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most sensitive strain to fraction 40% of Salvia methanolic extract. The sensitivity of the tested bacteria against Phlomis caucasica were lower in comparison with Salvia sahendica, and the most significant effect related to 60% fraction when examined against Bacillus cereus. Conclusion: The results indicate that polar fractions of methanol extract of both plants have significant antibacterial activity on the examined gram positive bacterial strains and the effect of Salvia sahendica is more potent.

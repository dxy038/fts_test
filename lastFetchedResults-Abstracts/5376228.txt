The aim of the current study is to implement fuzzy set theory and grey theory for selection of a proper scheme that will best meet customers requirements with uncertainty and lack of information. In the first phase, we propose a framework based on traditional quality function deployment (QFD). Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is utilized to compute the transcendental weight. Then, entropy theory is used to achieve amendatory weight. In the next phase, the scheme evaluation model is put forward. The fuzzy logic and trapeziform fuzzy numbers are utilized to deal with vagueness of human thought and grey relational analysis is adopted to measure the relationship between objective sequence and reference sequences. Finally, a case study is conducted to illustrate the evaluation.

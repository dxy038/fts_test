In this paper, we formulate an optimal design of system reliability problem as nonlinear integer programming (NIP) problem with interval coefficients, transform it into single objective NIP problem without interval coefficients, and solve it directly keeping the nonlinearity of the objective function based on Hybrid Genetic Algorithms (HGAs). Also, we demonstrate the efficiency of this method with Optimal Selection and Allocation problem of a System Reliability.

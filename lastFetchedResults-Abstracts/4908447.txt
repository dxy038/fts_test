We propose a low-complexity constraint-based routing algorithm for traffic engineering in packet networks that route end-to-end packet flows. The proposed fuzzy routing algorithm (FRA) modifies the well-known DijkstraÂ´s single-source shortest paths algorithm by using fuzzy-logic membership functions in the path-cost update process. The main objective of FRA is to reduce path-request blocking and increase overall network utilization. To achieve this objective, the algorithm computes new routes based on network-wide load balancing constraints. Simulation results show that FRA outperforms several earlier algorithms in terms of load balancing and path-request blocking.

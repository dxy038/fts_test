Aim Poor academic performance can reflect the neurobiological
abnormalities underlying schizophrenia and has
been suggested as a premorbid marker for the disorder.
However, it is not clear as to how academic performance
compares as a marker for other mental disorders. The
objective of this study was to examine whether educational
attainment is a candidate marker for certain psychiatric
disorders.
Methods Using a retrospective cohort design, we compared
the early educational performance of 6957 National
Service male conscripts. The presence of mental illness
was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic
Interview. Academic performance was assessed using the
results of a standardized national examination after 6 years
of primary education.
Results Adjusting for ethnicity, the scores from this
examination revealed that those with schizophrenia
spectrum disorders scored significantly lower than those
without any mental illness.
Conclusions Poor educational attainment predicts the
onset of schizophrenia spectrum disorders and could be a
possible predictor for this specific group of mental illness.

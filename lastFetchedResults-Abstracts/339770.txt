Objective
Use of a trifunctional bispecific antibody (trAb) given concomitantly with allogeneic cell therapy to achieve an anti tumor effect without graft-vs-host disease (GVHD).
Materials and Methods

A trAb-directed against murine CD3 and human epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) (BiLu), was given alone or concomitantly with interleukin (IL)-2–activated (LAK) H-2b donor splenocytes to H-2d/b mice inoculated with murine melanoma cells transfected with human EpCAM.
Results

A total of 32/38 mice treated with BiLu and LAK splenocytes, were tumor-free survivors without GVHD for >200 days following inoculation of a 100% lethal tumor dose (5 × 104). Of 28 disease-free surviving mice previously treated with LAK splenocytes and BiLu, 24 mice proved resistance to a second tumor challenge of 104 cells given >210 days following the first tumor inoculation with no evidence of disease for >150 days. In contrast, only 4 of 13 disease-free survivor mice treated with naïve splenocytes and BiLu, and 5 of 10 disease-free survivor controls treated with BiLu only, resisted the second tumor challenge. Induction of antitumor immunity was more efficient and long-lasting (>150 days) in mice previously injected with a lethal tumor cell dose of 5 × 104 cells than in mice previously inoculated with 5 × 103 tumor cells.
Conclusion

Concomitantly treatment of allogeneic LAK cells and trAb-induced an efficient long-lasting antitumor immunity. Considering the documented efficacy of anti-EpCAM bispecific antibody in various metastatic cancers, clinical application of our approach may be justified in patients with minimal residual disease at high risk for tumor recurrence.

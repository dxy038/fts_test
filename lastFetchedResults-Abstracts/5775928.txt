Service-oriented architectures are todayÂ´s favorite answer to solve interoperability issues. As various kinds of systems can be used to implement service-oriented architectures, the recent trend is to apply principles of model-driven development by (i) modeling the service-oriented architecture in an abstract manner and (ii) providing model transformations between this abstract specification and the underlying platform specific systems. As such, multiagent systems became very popular as both, service-oriented architectures and multiagent systems, share several commonalities. In this paper, we compare the core building blocks of multiagent systems and the emerging UPMS (UML profile and metamodel) standard for service-oriented architectures from the Object Management Group (OMG). The major objective of this investigation is to identify if SOA-Pro-the current submission under review--offers functionalities to allow modeling of multiagent systems adequately and if not to identify what kind of functionality is missing and how this functionality can be achieved to provide model transformations between service-oriented architectures and multiagent systems.

Background and Objective: Hip fractures are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. It seems that these fractures are affected by race, culture and geographic differences.  Understanding the predisposing factors that contribute to hip fracture in our region can be valuable for future treatment planning. The aim of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the incidence of hip fracture in our region
Subjects and Methods: In this retrospective study, characteristics of the patients (age, sex, mechanism of the fracture), with inter-trochantric and femoral neck (intra- and extracapsular) fractures were collected from their medical files at Imam khomeini and Razi hospitals of Ahvaz. Data were analyzed by SPSS program and Fisher exact test, and P  <  0.05 was considered as a significant difference.
Results: This study included 594 hip fractures. The mean age was 64.99Â±21.9 years.  Fifty-five percent of the patients were male. Falling down was the mechanism of fracture in 83% of our patients and high energy trauma 16%. Forty-six percent of the patients had intertrochantric and   (53.9%) had femoral neck fractures. Fifty-six percent of the patients were under the age of 75. Eleven percent of the patients had separate extremity fractures. The patients were divided into separate age groups and analyzed based on type of their fracture. (P < 0.75). Trauma mechanism had significant positive correlation with separate extremity fractures 
(P  < 0.001).
Conclusion:  According to our study, the mean age of the hip fracture is 10 years younger than western countries with a higher incidence in males. In younger patients, high energy trauma has positive correlation with hip fractures.

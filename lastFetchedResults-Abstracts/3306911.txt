In this communication, a study has been carried out to evaluate the life cycle cost of a hybrid renewable systems combining solar, wind, biomass energy sources to meet the demand of energy centre, MANIT, Bhopal. The main objective of this study is to compare the life cycle cost of different combination of hybrid systems and individual stand alone systems. The most economical hybrid system with lowest life cycle cost is determined. From the analysis it is found that life cycle cost of standalone solar energy system is highest Hybrid system consisting of solar / (25% wind + 75% biomass) is having the lowest life cycle cost compared to stand alone systems. So it is noticed that with hybrid energy system using three energy sources, life cycle cost decreasing and reliability of power supply throughout year is increasing.

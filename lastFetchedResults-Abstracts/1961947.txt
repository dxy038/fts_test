The issue of mental existence had been one of the most complicated problems in the Islamic philosophy before Mulla Sadra, and it had been discussed by most of the Muslim philosophers and theologians, but none was able to overcome and solve it. Mulla Sadra, however, was able to solve this problem by developing the primary prediction and ordinary prediction and presenting their difference. By exiting knowledge from the realm of essence and entering it to the realm of existence, he was able to develop an innovative approach with regard to this issue and solve its most precise problems.When Mulla Sadra brought knowledge out of the realm of categories and considered it as an entity, which ran counter to his antecedents, he was enabled to make a distinction between knowledge and mental existence and to consider mental existence as a subcategory of knowledge. Moreover, he was also able to consider the conformity of mind and entity as a result of the objective conformity of the superior existence of the known essence to particular existence, by categorizing the existence in the analogical gradation of ordoessendi and by proposing the idea of the true and subtle prediction of the essential conformity of mind and entity, which ran counter to the idea of his antecedents.

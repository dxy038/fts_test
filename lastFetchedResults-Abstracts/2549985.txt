Background and Aim: Postoperative hemorrhage is a common complication following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Warming the patient may be effective on postoperative hemorrhage and blood transfusion. The main objective of this study was to determine the effect of postoperative active warming of the patient on hemorrhage and blood transfusion after offpump CABG surgery.

Methods: This singleblinded randomized clinical trial was performed on 60 candidates. The patients undergoing CABG surgery were randomly allocated to case and control groups. Members of the case group (n = 30) were actively warmed postoperatively by Warm TouchTM 5800 after admission in intensive care unit (to reach a temperature up to 36.7deg C). In the control group (n = 29), a bed sheet, was applied as the routine intervention. Blood loss and need for blood transfusion were assessed in both groups during the first 24 hours after surgery. For statistical analysis, chisquare and independent sle t test were used.

Results: There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of age, sex, weight, left ventricular ejection fraction and preoperative tests. Mean chest tube drainage was significantly lower in the Warm Touch group than the control group within 6 and 24 hours after surgery (P = 0.046 and P = 0.041 respectively). In addition, the difference between the two groups was not significant as for blood transfusion 24 hours following the operation.

Conclusion: Warming of patients after CABG surgery reduces postoperative hemorrhage but does not affect blood transfusion.

This study first defines "adjunct" and addresses the other types of adjuncts in traditional grammar. Then, the concept of "figurative adjunct" is reviewed and the study suggests another division for the other types of adjuncts. This division is exploited on the basis of "foregrounding", "automation", and "literary functions" of language, It also discusses some of the characteristics of simile according to the novel division of adjuncts and gives an account of some ancient manuscripts. However, they are not in the category of simile adjunct. These lands of simile consist of an abstract and a concrete noun which are called "objective adjuncts". In addition, this paper provides some examples of this trope and continues with some comments on the results and conclusions are discussed at further length.

The synthesis of a library of trehalose-based compounds has been accomplished, and their activities against Mycobacterium smegmatis have been determined. A preliminary structureâ€“activity relationship (SAR) is reported. Despite not having a potent lead, one of the trehalose derivatives displays strong activity when applied with isoniazid (INH), which is known to have low sterilizing activity. The bacteriocidal nature of our compounds against Mycobacterium may be significant for the development of new therapies against tuberculosis.

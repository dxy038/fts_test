This paper presents ICBot (inchworm-like robot with claws), a vertical climbing robot which uses inchworm-like motion and bidirectional claws. The robot mainly consists of four parts, upper support, lower support, crank-slider mechanism between them, and compliant feet with bidirectional claws. A single motor drives the crank-slider mechanism, resulting in lower support and upper support move relatively, just like the inchworm motion. The bidirectional claws make the robot attach and release easily. ICBot measures 12cm in length and 30g in weight. It is capable of climbing vertical pearl brocade plate, softwood and other soft or rough surface.

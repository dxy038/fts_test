We consider stabilisation of SISO switched linear systems of arbitrary order. Our approach is motivated by applications in which the major design objective is to achieve similar behaviour of the closed-loop system in each mode. We exploit the algebraic properties of a class of matrices to develop design guidelines to achieve this goal for a class of SISO switched linear systems. It is shown that closed-loop stability and transient-free switching can be achieved simultaneously.

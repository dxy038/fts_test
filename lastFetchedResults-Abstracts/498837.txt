Background and objective: While enjoying proper physical educational facilities and benefiting from specialist professors and spending a fortune, IRI Police University (IRIPU) makes efforts to train specialist and committed police forces. However, in case students feel sleepy, all the efforts and budget is wasted. The present research aims at examining the issue and offering scientific and experimental solutions to prevent sleepiness in class.

Materials and Methods: Seven theories were developed through examining scientific theories. The data of this survey was gathered through three self-made questionnaires for three sample respondents including 352 police cadets of IRIPU, 206 instructors and 69 Field Training Officers (FTOs).

Findings: Students have said that in some classes they feel sleepy(50%), 28% have said they feel so sleepy, while 22% have said that they feel a little sleepy. However, 14.5% of the instructors believe that students are so sleepy in class.

Conclusion and Recommendations: While considering theories in this regard, it came out that warm, dim, and quiet classes contribute to the students' sleepiness. In case students get involved in the teaching learning process, they don't feel sleepy. Theoretical classes cause more sleepiness compared with practical classes. In general, six out of seven theories were confirmed, and the impact of esprit level was rejected by all the three groups. Among the recommendations of the research for reducing sleepiness level is using rapturous color to paint the classes, increasing students' sleeping time, reducing students' physical activities before classes, using interactive teaching methods, and holding both theoretical and practical classes everyday.

Wireless network are growing rapidly, leading to overloaded systems, unacceptable delays and increasing computational costs due to inefficient channel allocation strategy. Handoff call is more important over new call so it must provide some priority; this is the prime objective of all channel allocation strategy. In this paper we propose regular users priority scheme to better utilization of channel and reduce handover blocking probability. We have analyzed a particular path for several users and assign a symbol for regular, medium and normal users. These symbols are also inserted with other related information of user in HLR. Some channels are reserve for regular and medium users over normal users. Strategy of channel reservation schemes provides priority to regular and medium user over normal user. The aim of proposed scheme will use to increase user loyalty by reducing handover blocking probability. Now-a-days it is important not only to acquire new mobile users for mobile companies but also retain them. We can retain mobile users by providing them good channel facility as described in proposed scheme.

Our research examines the problem of negotiating access control policies between autonomous domains. Our objective is to develop software agents that can automatically negotiate access control policies between autonomous domains with minimal human guidance. In this paper we describe a mathematical framework that is capable of expressing many such negotiation problems, and illustrate its application to some practical scenarios.

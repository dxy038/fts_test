The explosive growth of Internet traffic has led to a dramatic increase in demand for data transmission capacity, which has spurred tremendous research activities in optical transport networks (OTNs) such as automatically switched optical networks (ASON) and related control protocols. To provide high resilience against failures, OTNs must have an ability to maintain an acceptable level of service during network failures. Fast and resource optimized light- path restoration strategies are urgent requirements for the near future OTN with a generalized multi-protocol label switching (GMPLS) control plane. Our objective in this paper is to presents a multi-layer recovery scheme that guarantees fast and efficient recovery of lightpaths in ASON/GMPLS networks. It includes concepts as well as systematic procedures of the proposed scheme for multilayer recovery in ASON/GMPLS networks.

The topography of the eastern margin of the Porcupine Seabight was surveyed in June 2000 utilizing swath bathymetry. The survey was carried out during RV Polarstern cruise ANT XVII/4 as part of the GEOMOUND project. The main objective was to map and investigate the seafloor topography of this region. The investigated area contains a variability of morphological features such as deep sea channels and giant mounds. The survey was planned and realized on the basis of existing data so as to guarantee the complete coverage of the margin. In order to achieve a resolution of the final digital terrain model (DTM) that meets the project demands, data processing was adjusted accordingly. The grid spacing of the DTM was set to 50 m and an accuracy better than 1% of the water depth was achieved for 96% of the soundings.

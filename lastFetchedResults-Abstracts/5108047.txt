In this paper the replacement of a lost learning function of rats through a computer-based real-time recording and feedback system is shown. In an experiment two recording electrodes and one stimulation electrode were implanted in an anesthetized rat. During a classical-conditioning paradigm, which includes tone and airpuff stimulation, biosignals were recorded and the stimulation events detected. A computational model of the cerebellum acquired the association between the stimuli and gave feedback to the brain of the rat using deep brain stimulation in order to close the eyelid of the rat. The study shows that replacement of a lost brain function using a direct bidirectional interface to the brain is realizable and can inspire future research for brain rehabilitation.

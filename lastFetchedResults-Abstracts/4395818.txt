Self-healing is the most important characteristic of the smart distribution system. Through the switch configuration optimization, the distribution network will not only satisfy the requirement of reliability and economy, but also has good self-healing property. This paper firstly proposes the self-healing evaluation index of distribution system, and then proposes the improved adaptive binary particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the problems of switch configuration optimization meeting the requirement of self-healing, which builds the multi-objective function of self-healing capability and the comprehension cost, and considers the constraint of distribution systems. At last, the test system results verify the rationality of the model and the effectiveness of the proposed method.

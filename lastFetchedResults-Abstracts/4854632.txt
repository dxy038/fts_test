A three-port distributed-parameter equivalent circuit representing the whole structure of a directional IDT is derived from generalized coupling-of-modes (COM) equations with complex parameters. The circuit has a simple form similar to that of a bidirectional IDT, but involves two additional impedance elements of opposite signs. It is shown that the two additional elements well express the behaviors of unidirectional IDTs and the directivity can be easily derived from the equivalent circuit. Some examples of calculations of device Characteristics using the circuit are also presented

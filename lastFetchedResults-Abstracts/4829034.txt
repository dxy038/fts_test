The US/German twin satellite mission GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) [1] celebrated it´s 10th anniversary March 17, 2012. The prime objective of GRACE is to provide detailed measurements of the static and, for the first time, also of the time-variable gravity field of the Earth. Today, GRACE delivers the most accurate map to date of the Earth´s long wavelength gravity field. In view of global warming it can deliver substantial information about current and future trends concerning the global hydrology cycle, ocean currents and sea level rise and help to predict their impact on human live.

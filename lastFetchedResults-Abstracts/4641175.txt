In this paper a new decomposition scheme (H-&#945; method) for analysis of pure targets echo around distributed targets (random targets) is presented. Pure targets have deterministic scattering matrix. In random targets scattering matrix, noise components is existed that must be omitted with applying ensemble averaging method. For this objective, eigenvector analysis technique in the H-&#945; method is used for calculating eigenvector as well as probability of them from coherency or covariance matrix. Also a simulation scheme is developed for calculating entropy (H) and scattering mechanism ( &#945; ) for spheroid targets. In this work drop size distribution (DSD) is considered for stochastic process of oblated or prolated spheroid rain droplet. Results of pure target simulation are presented and these results are compared with radar data set.

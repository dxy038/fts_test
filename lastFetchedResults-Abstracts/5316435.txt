Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are dynamic mobile networks that can be formed in the absence of any pre-existing communication infrastructure. MANETs are vulnerable to jamming attack due to their salient characteristics. The objective of a jammer is to interfere with legitimate wireless communications, and to degrade the overall QoS of the network. In this paper, we propose a new method to react at jamming attacks. The military has long dealt with jamming by using frequency-hopping spread spectrum communication. Unlike frequency hopping that takes place at the PHY layer, our purpose takes place at the MAC layer.

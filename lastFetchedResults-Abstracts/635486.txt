Numerous studies examined the role of processing
effort in judgments using the ‘‘ease-of-processing’’
paradigm in which participants generate or retrieve few or
many issue-relevant thoughts. Because earlier studies only
assessed the subjective effort, it is unclear if this paradigm
also mobilizes objective effort, and how such effort relates
to subjective effort. These questions were addressed in two
experiments modeled on standard tasks from the processing
effort literature: ‘‘ease of argument generation’’ (Study 1)
and ‘‘ease of retrieval’’ (Study 2). In both experiments we
simultaneously measured subjective effort (via self-report)
and objective effort (via cardiovascular reactivity). The
results showed that processing ease manipulations (generation
or retrieval of few vs. many exemplars) influence not
only subjective effort, but also objective effort, as reflected
especially by increases of systolic blood pressure in the
many exemplars condition. However, only subjective effort
was related to judgment. In the discussion, we consider the
role of various forms of effort and other relevant variables
in ‘‘processing ease’’ effects

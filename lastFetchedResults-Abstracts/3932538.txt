At the planning of combined heat and power (CHP)-based micro-grid, its distributed energy resources (DER) capacity is to be selected and deployed in such a way that it becomes economically self-sufficient to cater all the loads of the system without utilityÂ´s participation. Economic deployment of DERs is meant to select optimal locations, optimal sizes, and optimal technologies. Optimal locations and sizes, which are independent of CHP-based DERs types, are selected, here, by loss sensitivity index (LSI) and by loss minimization using particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, respectively. In a micro-grid, both fuel costs and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions are, mainly, dependent on types of DERs used. So the main focus of the present paper is to incorporate originality in ideas to evaluate how different optimal output sets of DER-mix, operating within their respective capacity limits, could share an electrical tracking demand, economically, among micro-turbines and diesel generators of various sizes, satisfying different heat demands, on the basis of multi-objective optimization compromising between fuel cost and emission in a 4-DER 14-bus radial micro-grid. Optimization is done using differential evolution (DE) technique under real power demand equality constraint, heat balance inequality constraint, and DER capacity limits constraint. DE results are compared with PSO.

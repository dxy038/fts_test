BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Dental caries is the most common means of ingress of bacteria to the dental pulp and pulp infection. Different materials have been introduced for pulp therapy but they were not effective in producing an acceptable coronal seal. The aim of this study was to evaluate anti- inflammatory effect of local capsaicin on dental pulp of cat.
METHODS: Twenty-four canine teeth of six domestic short hair cats weighing approximately 3-4 kg were selected for this experimental study. After cats had been anesthetized, the crown of teeth were cut 3 mm upper than cementoenamel junction (CEJ) and exposed under sterile condition. The teeth were divided into two groups. In group I the exposed pulp was capped with zinc oxide-eugenol as control. In group II dental pulp capped with capsaicin as experimental group. All access cavities were sealed with glass ionomer cement (Fuji IX). The animals were sacrificed at 1, 2 and 4 weeks after procedure. The canine teeth were extracted for histopathologic evaluation. The specimens were sectioned serially at 6 jim thickness parallel to tooth long axis. The sections were stained with H & E and studied by light microscopy.
FINDINGS: Result of this study showed that signs of necrosis in zinc oxide-eugenol group during 1,2 and 4 weeks decreased significantly (p=0.026). In capsaicin group hyperemia during 1, 2 and 4 weeks decreased significantly (p=0.019). In comparison of the effect of two drugs on pulp in 4 weeks and all weeks the sign of necrosis in capsaicin group was increased significantly (p=0.029, p=0.039). Two groups showed difference in dental barrier formation, type of inflammatory responses and soft tissue changes but these differences were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: According to findings of this study capsaicin could decrease the intensity of the inflammation but was not successful in dental barrier formation

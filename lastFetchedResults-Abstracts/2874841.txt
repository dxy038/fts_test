We are integrating an AC waveform source into our Programmable Josephson Voltage Standard system (PJVS). The objective is to provide a convenient, highly automated quantum-referenced source for AC voltage metrology that does not require the use of a thermal voltage converter. The stability of the AC waveform is inferred from the DC voltage reference. The accuracy of the AC waveform is measured utilizing the differential sampling method with a PJVS step-wise synthesized waveform as a reference. Preliminary results show that the AC waveform source is about ten-times more stable than commercial calibrators.

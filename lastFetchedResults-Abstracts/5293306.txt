In order to effectively evaluate the traffic safety state of highway, an evaluation method based on entropy weight and matter-element analysis was set up. Through deeply analyzing the traffic safety data, and operating environment of highway, an evaluation indices system was constructed. By applying the entropy weight and matter-element analysis, a new evaluation method based on trans-department information was put forward. The actual application shows that the method was better able to ensure the integrity of the information evaluation process and the objective of the evaluation results.

Diets high in concentrates and soluble carbohydrates are associated with reduced insulin sensitivity in horses. Exercise training could protect against diet-induced insulin resistance. The objective of this study was to determine the intensity of exercise training required to affect insulin sensitivity in stabled horses fed a diet high in concentrates but moderate in soluble carbohydrates. In all, 31 stabled horses underwent three different exercise regimens: turnout, light exercise, and moderate exercise, while being fed a diet containing 60% concentrate. Blood was sampled monthly and analyzed for insulin. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using basal insulin concentrations and calculated insulin sensitivity (reciprocal of the square root of insulin) and compared across months by analysis of variance with repeated measures. Insulin sensitivity (reciprocal of the square root of insulin) was higher during periods of moderate and light physical activity as compared with turnout. These results indicate that turnout alone may not be adequate to improve insulin sensitivity in horses fed high amounts of concentrate.

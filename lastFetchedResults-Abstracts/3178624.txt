The objective of this project is to develop a portable amblyopia treatment system (PATS) which can be used to evaluate and train up the lazy eye of amblyopes. We describe here our dual-channel treatment system which relies on the perceptual template model (PTM) and multi-domain vertical alignment (MVA) technology to project diagnostic grating patterns in a miniaturized micro-display with high contrast ratio for measuring the visual characteristics of affected eye. With a designated lens sequence, the physical setup of typical system in a normal clinic is virtually fused and realized in our portable treatment system. Analysis of subjectsÂ´ trial response gives characteristic parameters such as visual acuity (VA) value and contrast sensitivity function (CSF) after seeking sufficient data and achieving convergence. We report on the initial performance of this system on amblyopes of known visual characteristics before and after experiment. The results demonstrate the potential of the technology in home-based medical applications.

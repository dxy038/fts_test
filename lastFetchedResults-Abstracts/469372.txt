Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene polymorphism in pregnant women with and without preeclampsia.
Study design
Preeclampsia was defined as hypertension and pathologic proteinuria in pregnant women after gestational week 20. Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes. The insertion-deletion polymorphism in intron 16 of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene was detected in DNA samples with the use of the polymerase chain reaction. Chi-squared and Student t tests were used for statistical analysis.
Results
In preeclampsia (n = 51 women) angiotensin-converting enzyme genotypes were deletion-D (DD) in 16 women (31%), insertion-I (II) in 12 women (24%), and insertion-deletion in 23 women (45%); in the control group (n=71), the angiotensin-converting enzyme genotypes were DD in 21 women (30%), II in 17 women (24%), and insertion-deletion in 33 women (46%). Angiotensin-converting enzyme genotype distribution and allelic frequencies were not different between groups.
Conclusion
No difference in the angiotensin-converting enzyme genotype distribution was found between preeclampsia and normal pregnancy. The results showed no association between angiotensin-converting enzyme polymorphism and the development of preeclampsia.

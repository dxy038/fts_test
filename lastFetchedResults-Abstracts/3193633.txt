Anti-rolling tank is one of the most popular used stabilizing devices, aiming at reducing ship roll motions thanks to a passive resonant oscillator made of liquid in a tank. Controllable passive tanks need to adopt the air valve realize the control of air channel, the control methods are also affecting the structure design. The anti-rolling tanks are specific to each ship and must be designed and optimized for given constraints in terms of space, weight and location of the ship. In the paper, the objective is to optimize roll stabilization capabilities of a U-tube tank within a given limited envelope and index, and the subject of the optimization method could consider various factors included the fluid mechanics, the structure design and control and so on. The multi-objective optimization in this study is expected to be very useful in designing anti-rolling tank.

An approach to requirements modeling based on synergy between multiple views is presented. It integrates natural-language descriptions, visual executable model with run-time behavior monitoring and code-generation facilities, and interactive graphical user interface prototypes, through the use of dynamic scenarios. A conceptual design of an integrative requirements modeling system (currently implemented as research prototype) is described. Partial modeling techniques are used to preclude excessive redundancy and permit flexible balancing of emphasis between views. The general objective is to allow industrial teams to flexibly combine the advantages of informal and formal methods, to smoothly shift balance between them with incremental investment in tools and training, and to preserve continuity between old and new projects.

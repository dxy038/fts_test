Objective
luate the influence of tetrahydrofuran (THF) on the resin-to-dentin microtensile bond strength (μTBS) after water storage, for 24 h and 6 months, and to compare its behavior with that of traditional solvents.
s
versions of monomer/solvent mixtures (primers) were prepared using the following solvent and water combinations: (1) THF, (2) acetone, (3) ethanol, (4) water, (5) THF/water, (6) acetone/water and (7) ethanol/water. An experimental adhesive resin was also synthesized to compare adhesive systems with the different primers. Forty-two bovine incisors, randomly separated into seven groups, had their superficial coronal dentin exposed. After acid-etching and rinsing, the excess water was removed from the surface with absorbent paper. Each experimental primer was applied with agitation (30 s) followed by a mild air stream (10 s). The experimental adhesive resin was applied and light-activated (20 s). Resin composite restorations were constructed incrementally. Restored teeth were stored in distilled water at 37 °C (24 h) and sectioned to obtain sticks with an area of 0.5 mm2. Half the specimens were subjected to the μTBS test immediately after being cut and the other half were tested after 6 months of water storage. Data (MPa) were analyzed by two-way ANOVA (solvent type and storage time as factors) and Tukey–Kramer's test at α = 0.05.
s
s and interaction showed a statistical effect. After 6 months storage, acetone groups and primers containing THF showed similar μTBS to initial means.
icance
ems to be a promising solvent for use in dental adhesive systems, maintaining bond strength on dentin substrate after storage.

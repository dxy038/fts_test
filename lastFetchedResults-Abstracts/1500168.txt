Mechanical cooling systems in buildings are the main producers of carbon dioxide emissions, which have negative impacts on environment and amplify global warming, particularly in hot climate. Due to the lack of energy supply, windcatchers can be utilized as a sustainable attempt for cooling and ventilation purposes. The objective of this paper is to review and provide a comprehensive literature on windcatcher system for space cooling and ventilation. The concepts were discussed according to the relevant parameters of windcatcher, i.e. windcatcher attributes, windcatcher configurations and windcatcher technologies. The pros and cons of this green architectural feature have also been highlighted and the future research need in this realm of study is proposed.

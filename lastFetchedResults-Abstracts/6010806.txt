The fed-batch fermentation process is nonlinear and often operated at unsteady state. In this work, a supervisory control system was added to a fed-batch fermentation plant. The objective was to preserve the final biomass concentration, as nearly as possible to its ideal final value, even if the process input was subjected to changes. The main process input is the initial biomass concentration which has an ideal initial value that may change according to chemical laboratory quality assurance procedures. Simulated experiments on the proposed supervisory control were done using a Proportional controller only, then by a Composite controller. The results showed that the Composite controller has a superior effect than the Proportional.

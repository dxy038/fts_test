Background and Objective: With regard to the role of dyslipidemia control in prevention of cardiovascular diseases and emphasis on using nondrug treatments, this study was performed to assess the effect of wheat germ on lipid profile reduction among hyperlipidemia and normolipidomia students.
Materials and Methods: 108 volunteer students in the age range of 21.33Â±2.15 years old
(74 normolipidemics, 34 hyperlipidemics) were entered to the study. In addition to their typical diet, these students were asked to take a 30- gram wheat germ in their daily diet for 4 weeks. Hyperlipidemia and normolipidomia participants were determined based on National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel 3 (NCEPATP3) guidelines. Anthropometric and metabolic measurements, calorie and mineral intakes, before and after the intervention were taken and analyzed using paired t-test (SPSS 
version 19). 
Results: In the wheat germ group, total cholesterol, triglycerides and VLDL (p=0.001) significantly reduced to 10.5, 19 and 20%, respectively. Also parameters of HDL-C/TC (p=0.004) and systolic blood pressure (p=0.046) significantly increased (in both groups) and decreased (in hyper lipidemic group), respectively. In addition, total cholesterol level decreased significantly (p=0.003) in normolipidemic students. There was no statistically significant change in other parameters. 
Conclusion: Due to significant decrease in triglycerides in hyperlipidemic group and total cholesterol levels in both groups, consumption of wheat germ, as a nondrug treatment, for prevention of cardiovascular diseases and dyslipidemia is suggested.

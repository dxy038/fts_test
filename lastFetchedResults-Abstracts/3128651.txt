Advanced photovoltaic power systems require a bidirectional power converter functioning as a battery charger and a voltage regulator to maintain state-of-charge of the battery and regulate the load voltage respectively. This paper presents a photovoltaic power system which performs maximum power point tracking, battery charging and regulation of the load voltage with an integrated converters configuration. No bidirectional converter is needed. The proposed converter can be used in dc power system or dc microgrid. Experimental results are reported to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

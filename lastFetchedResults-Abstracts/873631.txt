A multiple-objective optimization problem involving generalized univex functions
is considered. Kuhn]Tucker type sufficient optimality conditions are obtained for a
feasible point to be an efficient or properly efficient solution. Mond]Weir type
duality results are obtained. Further, a vector-valued Lagrangian is introduced and
certain vector saddlepoint results are presented.

The construction industry is one of the most hazardous industries in many countries. Struck-by-falling-object accidents are not given adequate attention even though they are of great importance on construction sites. The objective of this paper is to analyze the proactively preventive information requirement of struck-by-falling-object accidents and propose an integrated information management model using a ZigBee RFID sensor network to fulfill these requirements. First, the frequency of particular type of objects is analyzed based on vast historical accident cases. Next, this paper analyzes the proactively preventive information requirement of struck-by-falling-object accidents and brought forth an integrated information management model. Furthermore, considering the crucial and controllable objects, an integrated information management model is proposed. This study would provide a possible approach for tracking struck-by-falling-object accidents based on real-time information for proactive prevention and could serve as a foundation for further study.

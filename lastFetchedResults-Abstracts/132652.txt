It has been tried to estimate the.optimal allocation of resources in higher education via mathematical optimazation model. The objective function is to maximize the benefits obtained from the graduates of higher education. One the other side, this very issue of optimization is associated with limitation such as academic staff, physical limitation, current and developing credit, and the lower limits of students' admission.
The determination of the coefficients and parameters of this model is a very sensitive issue in this paper, since these coefficients should reflect the structure of higher education in Iran. The determination of the coefficients of the objective function is more difficult than other parameters. This is so, due to the fact that there is no precise data on the contribution of graduates of different fields in GDP, or - in the other words - their benefits to the country. To estimate these coefficients there was no way but using regression method. The advantage of this approach is because of its cross-section nature.

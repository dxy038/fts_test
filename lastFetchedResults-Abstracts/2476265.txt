Apoptosis is an essential process for elimination of damaged and cancerous cells and is also a desired effect for the anti-cancer activity of drugs. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors including celecoxib are a class of drugs with chemopreventive and anti-proliferative properties regardless of their routine anti-inflammatory effects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of celecoxib loaded nano-liposomes on the isolated rat hepatocytes and comparing the results with what were obtained from usual form of this chemopreventive agent. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were prepared by two step collagenase perfusion method and, following stabilization in rotary, were exposed to 0, 20, 40 and 100 ?M of celecoxib in nano and usual form. Viability was obtained and apoptosis was determined by modified comet technique. At high concentrations (40 and 100 ?M), apoptosis was demonstrated and it was clearly more prominent in hepatocytes exposed to celecoxib loaded liposomes. Our results showed that celecoxib loaded liposomes robustly induced apoptosis, an action that can potentially make it more relevant than the usual form for chemopreventive strategies and also may raise concerns about its toxicity

Purpoe
To invetigate the correlation between change in contrat enitivity (C) and difference in objective poterior capule opacification (PCO) core before and after Nd:YAG laer capulotomy.
Deign
Propective interventional cae erie.
Method
C (Functional Acuity Contrat Tet, or FACT, chart), ditance viual acuity (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy tudy [ETDR] chart), and pupil ize of 30 peudophakic eye with PCO of varying intenity were meaured before and after capulotomy. Digital retroillumination image were taken, and the area correponding to the pupil ize wa evaluated with an automated PCO analyi program known a AQUA.
Reult
The correlation between change in PCO core and change in C wa highet (r = 0.85) for row B on the FACT chart and lowet (r = 0.09) for row E. The correlation with change in ETDR viual acuity wa 0.57.
Concluion
Objective PCO aement by an automated image analyi ytem correlate well with PCO-induced lo of C and i therefore an appropriate method for clinical tudie on the development and prevention of PCO.

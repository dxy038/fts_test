The objective of this research is to demonstrate the maturity of an autonomous neural control system appropriate for spacecraft vibration isolation and suppression. This technology focus area addresses the development of an innovative adaptive neural controller which is capable of accommodating system level failures or degradations under severe operating conditions. The feasibility and flexibility of the proposed methodology are validated under an on-going flight program. The proposed concept incorporates adaptive control and neural network technologies to provide the system with the desired robust stability and controller reconfiguration

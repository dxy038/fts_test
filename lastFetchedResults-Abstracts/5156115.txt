In this work, we conduct an in-depth survey on recent multimedia storage security research activities in association with cloud computing. After an overview of the cloud storage system and its security problem, we focus on four hot research topics. They are data integrity, data confidentiality, access control, and data manipulation in the encrypted domain. We describe several key ideas and solutions proposed in the current literature and point out possible extensions and futuristic research opportunities. Our research objective is to offer a state-of-the-art knowledge to new researchers who would like to enter this exciting new field.

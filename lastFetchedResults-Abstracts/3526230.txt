A new manual mobile telephone system has been designed around the requirements of operation by "landline" telephone companies in the domestic public land mobile service. A specific objective has been a significant reduction in first cost and annual charges of the system to the operating companies. Achievement of this objective has resulted in a system which is expected to bring mobile telephone service to many areas which have previously been without it. This system makes mobile service feasible in many smaller exchanges which are typical of those served by the Independent Telephone Industry.

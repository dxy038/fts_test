Harmonic resonance often manifests as high harmonic voltages in a power system. It was found that such resonance phenomenon is associated with the singularity of the network admittance matrix. The singularity, in turn, is due to the fact that one of the eigenvalues of the matrix approaches zero. By analyzing the characteristics of the eigenvalue, one can find useful information on the nature and extent of the resonance. The objective of this paper is to present our findings on this interesting subject. Based on the results, a technique called resonance mode analysis is proposed. Analytical and case study results have confirmed that the proposed method is a valuable tool for power system harmonic analysis.

Objective
ng-term stability the adhering interfaces of an implant-retained supraconstruction of titanium/carbon–graphite fiber-reinforced (CGFR) polymer/opaquer layer/denture base polymer/denture teeth must function as a unity. The aim was to evaluate adhesion of CGFR polymer to a titanium surface or CGFR polymer to two different opaquer layers/with two denture base polymers.
als and methods
um plates were surface-treated and silanized and combined with a bolt of CGFR polymer or denture base polymer (Probase Hot). Heat-polymerized plates of CGFR polymer (47 wt% fiber) based on poly(methyl methacrylate) and a copolymer matrix were treated with an opaquer (Sinfony or Ropak) before a denture base polymer bolt was attached (Probase Hot or Lucitone 199). All specimens were heat-polymerized, water saturated (200 days) and thermally cycled (5000 cycles, 5/55 °C) before shear bond testing.
s
tized titanium surfaces gave higher bond strength to CGFR polymer (16.2 ± 2.34 and 18.6 ± 1.32) MPa and cohesive fracture than a sandblasted surface (5.9 ± 2.11) MPa where the fracture was adhesive. The opaquer Sinfony gave higher adhesion values and mainly cohesive fractures than the opaquer Ropak. Different surface treatments (roughened or polished) of the CGFR polymer had no effect on bond strength.
icance
acture surfaces of silicatized titanium/CGFR polymer/opaquer layer (Sinfony)/denture base polymers were mainly cohesive. A combination of these materials in an implant-retained supraconstruction is promising for in vivo evaluation.

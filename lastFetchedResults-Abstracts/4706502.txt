A new algorithm is developed for adaptive filtering applications. This algorithm is based on a direction set method and has a computational complexity of O(N) for each update of the system. The method exploits the structure of the objective function and maintains a set of near-conjugate directions with respect to the Hessian. The algorithm has a fast rate of convergence which is comparable to that of the well known RLS and CG based algorithms. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated with an example

Practitioners in the electric drives community have recently introduced a novel torque control strategy for high power induction motor applications, called direct torque control (DTC), which has three distinctive features: 1) it focuses on stator flux regulation; 2) it does not aim at an asymptotic system inversion; and 3) it explicitly takes into account the discrete nature of the control actions. Besides its simplicity, it is claimed that the achieved performance is superior to field oriented strategies because of the digital form of the control structure and the reduced dependence on parameter variations of the stator flux calculations. Our objective in this paper is twofold: 1) to carry out a mathematical analysis of the stabilization mechanism of DTC, which helps us assess the achievable performance of the current scheme and provide guidelines for its tuning; and 2) to propose a modified DTC to improve its dynamical behavior. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the main points of our paper

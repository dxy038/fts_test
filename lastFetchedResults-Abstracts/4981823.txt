This paper focuses on new control techniques for a direct power converter having a resonant tank on the output side feeding a rectifier. The application being considered is for HV power supplies. The objective of the control is to provide a stable output, with good supply current quality. Two predictive controllers are described, one based on the input filter dynamics and one based on the output tank dynamics, and their performances are compared. Practical results from a laboratory prototype are presented

Balance loading on all processors is essential to ensure the success of any parallel approach. To achieve this objective, a novel approach involving the factorization tree algorithm is proposed in this study on the basis of calculating the maximum number of fill-in and the degree of every node as the cutset block nodes. Using the proposed approach, the number of nodes in each subnetwork is more uniform and the computation time is saved. Simulation results of the IEEE test systems and the Taiwan Power Company (TPC) 288-bus are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and its capability to implement parallel computing for the load flow analysis.

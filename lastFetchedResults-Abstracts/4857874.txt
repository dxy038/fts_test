A life-centric model of single hop regenerative relay based cognitive radio system is introduced. Objective of this paper is to minimize the outage probability while satisfying the total power constraint and interference threshold for primary user(PU). Lifetime of cognitive radio network is also considered using the concept of battery life to improve the overall capacity of the cognitive radio(CR). Overall Capacity of secondary user(SU) is calculated from the subcarrier allocation between source and destination of secondary user. Extensive simulation has been performed for energy aware and non-energy aware scheme to obtain a better network lifetime as well as less outage probability without disturbing the threshold limit of PU.

Femtocell has appeared as a solution to increase both the coverage and the capacity of cellular networks. However, interference problem between the macrocell and the femtocell must be solved before any deployment. Since femtocells are deployed by home users in random locations, decentralised interference management schemes remain worth of investigation. In this study, the author deal with the problem of aggregate interference modelling and static resource allocation in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based two-tier femtocell networks for both closed and open access femtocells. It is assumed that for macrocell users (MUs), spectrum allocation is accomplished through fractional frequency reuse. The author´s objective is to maximise the femtocell user´s throughput while maintaining as low as its possible impact on the MUs´ performance. Their proposed algorithm is decentralised, and based on some measurements, needs to be performed only when femtocell access point is plugged in. Simulation results show the accuracy of their model and the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to the previous methods.

In this paper, a direct learning control method for a class of switched systems is proposed. The objective of direct learning is to generate the desired control profile for a newly switched system without any feedback, even if the system may have uncertainties. This is achieved by exploring the inherent relationship between any two systems before and after a switch. The new method is applicable to a class of linear time varying, uncertain and switched systems, when the trajectory tracking control problem is concerned. A numerical simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

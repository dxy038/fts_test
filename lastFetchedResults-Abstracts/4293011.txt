Decision or selection making is a vital part of daily life; of which the major concern is that almost all issues requiring decisions have multiple, often conflicting, criteria. In reality, there is no avoidance of the coexistence of qualitative and quantitative data, and the data are often full of fuzziness and uncertainty. In order to mediate the conflicts and contradictions in the reconciliatory process and act in response to the lack of flexibility while adopting traditional multi-criteria method to solve fuzzy problems, the study intends to use fuzzy VIKOR methods to solve fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making problems. Fuzzy VIKOR aims to find the decision-makerÂ´s preferable compromise that suits human objective cognition. In this paper, we use case analysis to sort out the systematic solution process, and eventually come up with a best solution and compromise solution that can be an important reference of decision-making. Finally, our conclusion and suggestion for advanced works are also offered

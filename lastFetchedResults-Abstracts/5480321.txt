The expansion of automotive electronic system and the disadvantage of the traditional voltage source inverter should not be ignored. To complete boost-inverter in single stage and remove the impact of harmonics which is caused by the dead time, this paper presents a bidirectional Z-source inverter for the automotive with 42V DC-BUS. In the paper, the schematic of Z-source was introduced, and the parameters of Z-source network were calculated. The third-harmonic injection method was used for ZSI, and the power transfer was illustrated briefly. The results from simulation and the real platform experiment verify the feasibility and advantages of the proposed topology and control strategy.

In the present paper, high-power continuous-wave (CW)-pumped ytterbium-doped double-clad (YDDC) fiber amplifiers for the amplification of nanosecond pulses with tens of kilohertz repetition rates are numerically studied. Targeting pulse energy and average output power, the fiber amplifiers under forward, backward, and bidirectional pump are systematically analyzed and optimized in consideration of pump and signal wavelengths, pulse repetition rate, fiber structure and length, dopant concentration, and Raman effect, etc.

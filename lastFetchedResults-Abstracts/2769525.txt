Target tracking in radar and sonar is often done in either spherical or rectangular coordinates. The objective of the work presented here is to provide a means to analytically characterize the probability density function (pdf) of these transformations. Such pdf can be used to accurately characterize the measurement statistics needed for filter design, simulation, and potentially, implementation. The results of this work provide the infrastructure to accomplish such goals for tracking filters.

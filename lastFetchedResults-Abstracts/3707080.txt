The application of the "branch and bound" technique for nonlinear discrete optimization, due to Dakin, to the problem of finding the coefficients of a recursive digital filter with prescribed number of bits, to meet arbitrary response specifications of the magnitude characteristic, is investigated. Due to the fact that the objective function is nonlinear and the stability constraints are linear with respect to the parameter, the recent algorithm for nonlinear programming due to Best and Ritter is used. Based on the ideas presented, a general computer program has been developed. Numerical experience with the present approach is also presented.

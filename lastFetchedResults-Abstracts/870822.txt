This paper presents a framework for fuzzy criterion set and fuzzy criterion
dynamic programming which generalizes the tools applicable to an array of fuzzy
decision models, particularly those represented by the generalized reservoir operation
and the stochastic inventory models. The objective is to maximize the expected
fuzzy criterion function of the product of fuzzy criterion sets. We prove certain
properties of the resultant models including existence, uniqueness, and stability
theorems of solutions to this model and show that under the regular hypothesis
assumption, the optimal control is a bounded critical number policy. Q 1996

Next future vehicles will change battery voltage front 14 to 42 V. As a consequence, new converters are being developed to cover the needs of the electrical circuits. In the meantime, vehicles will have dual battery system (14 and 42 V). A 1 kW bidirectional 14-42V DC-DC converter has been built and tested for these vehicles. The goodness of the digital control allows the use of a high number of interleaved converters, yielding to a low profile (10 mm height) circuit without current sensing.

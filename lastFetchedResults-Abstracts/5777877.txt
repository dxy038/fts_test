A new method for front wheel alignment parameters design of mine truck is afforded. In the design, tire wear and handling performance are considered. The candle-suspension and unite steering mechanism is adopted in the truck. The response surface method is applied by the second-order approximation model between alignment parameters and optimization objective. The controlled factors are included in inclination angle, caster, camber, toe-in, and the uncontrolled factors are included in the steering trapezoid arm length and the bottom angle of steering trapezoid. Through experiments analysis the key factors are obtained. The optimum design is finished based on the models. The advance and validity are testified by comparing results of empirical function and the response surface model method. This is a new method for front wheel alignment parameters design.

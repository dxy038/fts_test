Emotion can be expressed in ways that can be seen such as facial expression and gestures. Emotion can also be heard by detecting prosody features and other vocal characteristics. However in this research, we are interested to detect emotions from textual information. Our main objective is to predict the emotions from textual material such as e-mails that is related to relationship. We work on emotion detection by using keywords spotting method and semantic network method. We examined both the methods and achieved a better result with the semantic network model.

Objective
To characterize CD33+CD34+ cells, a major population in human cord blood (CB) CD34+ cells of preterm neonates.
Materials and methods

The proportion of CD33+ cells was analyzed on CB CD34+ cells from preterm and full-term neonates. CD33+CD34+ cells were purified by cell sorting and analyzed on their clonogenic activity, proliferative activity in short-time liquid suspension culture, and GATA-2 mRNA expression by RT-PCR and Southern blot.
Results

The absolute numbers and proportion of CD34+ cells in mononuclear cells inversely correlated with gestational age. CD33 was expressed on a majority of CB CD34+ cells of preterm neonates but on only a minor population of them in full-term neonates. In addition, CD33 was dominantly expressed on CD38−CD34+ cells or CD117lowCD34+ cells in CB of preterm neonates. CD33+CD34+ cells of preterm cord blood had high proliferative and reproducible potentials compared with CD33−CD34+ cells. CD33+CD34+ cells as well as CD33−CD34+ cells from preterm CB highly expressed GATA-2, in contrast to those from BM.
Conclusions

These results suggest that CD33+CD34+ cells, which are a major population in CB CD34+ cells of preterm neonates, do not simply represent relatively mature myeloid lineage hematopoietic progenitor cells as those in adult BM CD34+ cells, and may contain hematopoietic stem cells or primitive progenitor cells as in fetal liver.

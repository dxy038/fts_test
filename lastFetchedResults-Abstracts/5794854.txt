A major challenge in data communication is to provide security for the message during transmission. For achieving this goal various cryptographic and steganographic algorithms are used. Steganography provides impending means to hide the existence of private data. In this paper two new approaches are proposed for embedding the data using clustering algorithm. The objective of clustering is to group the pixels for the embedding process.

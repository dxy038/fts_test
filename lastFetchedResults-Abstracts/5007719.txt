This paper presents the results of studies which applies a multi-objective optimization function for the management of a solar based DC spacecraft network of the ring bus topology. The optimization function is utilized which features the objectives of optimizing the utilization of solar energy to continually meet the needs of the network while minimizing battery discharge current and current flows among ring buses. This work is an extension of the previous studies conducted where reliability studies are conducted for failure scenarios, states of battery charge and variability of the loads. An optimum power management program is developed where operating strategy and corresponding control actions are identified to maintain system reliability and serviceability.

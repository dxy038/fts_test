Recent reports have described a stem cell population termed stromal vascular cells (SVCs) derived from the stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue, which are capable of intrinsic differentiation into spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes in vitro. The objective of this study was to further define the cardiac lineage differentiation potential of SVCs in vitro and to establish methods for enriching SVC-derived beating cardiac myocytes. SVCs were isolated from the stromal vascular fraction of murine adipose tissue. Cells were cultured in methylcellulose-based murine stem cell media. Analysis of SVC-derived beating myocytes included Western blot and calcium imaging. Enrichment of acutely isolated SVCs was carried out using antibody-tagged magnetic nanoparticles, and pharmacologic manipulation of Wnt and cytokine signaling. Under initial media conditions, spontaneously beating SVCs expressed both cardiac developmental and adult protein isoforms. Functionally, this specialized population can spontaneously contract and pace under field stimulation and shows the presence of coordinated calcium transients. Importantly, this study provides evidence for two independent mechanisms of enriching the cardiac differentiation of SVCs. First, this study shows that differentiation of SVCs into cardiac myocytes is augmented by non-canonical Wnt agonists, canonical Wnt antagonists, and cytokines. Second, SVCs capable of cardiac lineage differentiation can be enriched by selection for stem cell-specific membrane markers Sca1 and c-kit. Adipose-derived SVCs are a unique population of stem cells that show evidence of cardiac lineage development making them a potential source for stem cell-based cardiac regeneration studies.

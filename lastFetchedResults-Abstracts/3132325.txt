Based on the analysis of the path planning for tooth movement in virtual orthodontics treatment system, the objective of path planning and the constraints of tooth moving was proposed, and a mathematical model was established. The genetic algorithm was selected to solve the path planning for tooth movement. The fitness function was defined as the weighted sum of the motion distance, the rotation angle and a value related with the constraints of tooth movement. Roulette wheel selection operator, one-point crossover operator and simple mutation operator was defined. Based on the model and method, a software is developed by using Visual C++ and OpenGL for the path planning of tooth movement. Experiments show that the model and the method are reliable and effective.

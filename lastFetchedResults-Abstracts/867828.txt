Supply chain management is concerned with the coordination of material and information flows in
multi-stage production systems. A closer look at the literature reveals that previous research on the coordination
of multi-stage production systems has predominantly focused on the sales side of the supply
chain, whereas problems that arise on the supply side have often been neglected. This article closes this
gap by studying the coordination of a supplier network in an integrated inventory model. Specifically, we
consider a buyer sourcing a product from heterogeneous suppliers and tackle both the supplier selection
and lot size decision with the objective to minimise total system costs. First, we provide mathematical
formulations for the problem under study, and then suggest a two-stage solution procedure to derive
a solution. Numerical studies indicate that our solution procedure reduces the total number of supplier
combinations that have to be tested for optimality, and that it may support initiatives which aim on
increasing the efficiency of the supply chain as a heuristic planning tool.

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a 217 Hz magneti c field of
mobile phone GSM 900 exposure on the bioelectric activity of F1 neuronal cells of the land
snail.
Materials and Methods: According to the magnelic field measurement of Ihe mobile phone ,
a range of flux intensities of magnetic fields (0.46 - 229 ~T) at a frequency of 217 Hz was
produced by magnetic field coils. The bioelectri cal acti vity of F1 nerve cells at different time
intervals was recorded , using intracellular recording under current clamp conditions in control,
sham and field exposed groups .
Results: Magnetic field exposure decreased the amplitude of action potential and the firing
frequency of F1 nerve cells . Furthermore, it resulted in a Significant (p<0.05) increase in
the amplitude of after hyperpolarization (AHP) and duration of action potential. Change in
the cell's electrophysiological parameters was associated with a decrease in neuronal excitability.
Magnetic field expo sure affected also the resting membrane potential of F1 cells in a
bimodal fashion , including depolarization and hyperpolarization. Considering the exposure
condition , most of the alterations in the electrical activity of F1 nerve cells induced by magnetic
fields exposure were reversible.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that 217 Hz magnetic field s of mobile phones with different
intensities affect the spontaneous bioelectrical activity of F1 nerve cells and exert inhibitory
effects on neuronal excitability. There is evidence for the existence of an amplitude
window and these electrophysiological alterations occur within this amplitude window. The
reversibility of the magneti c field- induced most electrophysiological alterations in the neuronal
behavior under our experimental condition s was observed .

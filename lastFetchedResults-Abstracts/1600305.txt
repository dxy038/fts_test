This paper advances the fundamental understanding in mathematical and computational modelling of discrete fracture networks (Type I). It presents a systematic procedure to solve the most important problem in modelling by global optimization â€” objective function formulation, which negates guesswork in objective function formulation by automatic selection of highly ranked components and their corresponding weighting factors. The procedure starts from real data to identify potential components of the objective function. The components are then ranked by fuzzy sensitivity analysis, based on their effects on the final objective function value and simulation convergence. The final fracture network inversion is subsequently realized and validated. Results of the study provide an explanation why previous methods such as stochastic simulations are not sufficiently reliable, compared to global optimization methods.

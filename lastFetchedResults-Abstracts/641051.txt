In order to compare the nutritional status of tuberculosis (TB) patients who were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive with those who were seronegative, we carried out a cross-sectional anthropometric and biochemical assessment, together with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) of the nutritional status of TB patients hospitalized in the Department of Internal Medicine, Bujumbura University Hospital, Burundi, East Africa. Of the 65 TB patients (33 pulmonary, 6 extrapulmonary, and 26 disseminated TB), 50 (76.9%) were HIV-seropositive (HIV+). When assessed according to anthropometric, BIA, and biochemical variables, HIV+ TB patients had more pronounced malnutrition than HIV− patients. Similar results were obtained when the comparison was restricted to patients with only pulmonary TB: HIV+ patients were more malnourished than HIV− patients. The results according to anthropometric measurements were: weight loss (13.5% of HIV− patients versus 26.4% of HIV+ patients, P = 0.005), body mass index (18.6 versus 15.1, P = 0.003), fat free mass (FFM) (13.9 versus 11.9, P < 0.01), and body fat (BF) (4.55 versus 3.71, P = 0.03) expressed per unit height2. BIA showed that the difference in FFM between HIV− and HIV+ TB pulmonary patients was mostly due to a decrease in body cellular mass. Measurements of albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin showed a marked decrease in all three markers in HIV+ TB pulmonary patients. The nutritional status of HIV+ patients with disseminated versus pulmonary TB was similar. The nutritional status of HIV+ TB patients is far worse than that of HIV− TB patients. In such patients, anthropometry underestimates the degree of malnutrition because it does not account for the water component of FFM. Nutritional status should be assessed and nutritional intervention should be provided in an attempt to improve the prognosis of TB patients, especially those who are infected by HIV.

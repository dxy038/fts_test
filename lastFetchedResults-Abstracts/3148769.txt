Aimed at the different characteristics of the scale and the quality of various populations in ecology evolutionary algorithm of food chain, selection methods such as proportional model and deterministic sampling are used in low population and intermediate population separately, senior population uses optimal reserved strategy but dose not use reproduction operator, which gives further consideration to both the overall search and the local search capability.With expansion transmission corridor as decision variable, a real number encoding method is proposed for reducing the dimension numbers of covariates. The test was performed on the 18-bus system, the calculation results verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed algorithm.

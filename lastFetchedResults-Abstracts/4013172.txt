In this study, a new approach to design an autonomous hybrid wind-photovoltaic (PV)-batteries system is presented in order to assist the designers to take into consideration both the economic and ecological aspects. Primary embodied energy (EE) has been introduced as a new criterion for hybrid systems, designing with the objective to minimise loss of power supply probability (LPSP). For a location, meteorological and load data have been collected and assessed. Then, modelling and primary energy analysis have been achieved for all components of the hybrid system. Finally, an optimal configuration has been carried out using a dynamic model and applying two different algorithms with single and multi-objective optimisation. The methodology has been performed successfully for the sizing of a wind-PV-batteries system to supply at least 95% of the yearly total electric demand of a residential house. The simulation results show that the optimal configuration meets the desired system reliability requirements (LPSP &lt;;5%) with the lowest EE. A life cycle cost analysis has been established at the end of the study to demonstrate the importance of economic considerations.

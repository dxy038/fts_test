The objective of the study was to identify coping strategies used by ADHD adults and evaluate the relationship between their coping strategies, cognitive deficits and antisocial personality problems. Participants were 44 clinical referrals for assessment of ADHD in adulthood and 34 healthy controls. ADHD adults were compared with a healthy control group on the Ways of Coping Scale. Secondly, the scores obtained on these measures were correlated with cognitive measures of impulsivity (Matching Familiar Figures) and attention (Continuous Performance Test), and a measure of pro-social behaviour (Gough Socialisation Scale). The ADHD group used maladaptive coping strategies (confrontative, escape-avoidance and less planful problem-solving) but they positively reappraised stressful situations. Only cognitive measures featured in the correlation of the ADHD group whereas both personality and cognitive factors were associated with the coping strategies of the controls. The way ADHD adults interact with the environment and cope with stressful situations is determined by their cognitive ability. Their ability to positively reappraise stressful situations may be an important protective factor. The relevance of the findings for clinical interventions is discussed.

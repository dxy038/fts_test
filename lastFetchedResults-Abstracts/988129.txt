So many algorithms have been proposed to solve the shortest path in road networks, in this paper, an algorithm is developed to solve shortest route problems. The algorithm is being demonstrated through solving of various network problems. The principle of the algorithm consist in  transforming  the graph into a tree by means of arc and node replication, thereby expanding outwards from the source node  considering all possible paths up to the destination node. The objective is to develop a method that can be applied in directed and non-directed graphs.

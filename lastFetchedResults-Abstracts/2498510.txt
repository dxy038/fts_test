The objective of this paper is to analyze the effects of heat and mass transfer in the presence of thermal radiation, internal heat generation and Dufour effect on an unsteady magneto-hydrodynamic mixed convection stagnation point flow towards a vertical plate embedded in a porous medium. The non-linear partial differential equations governing the flow are transformed into a set of ordinary differential equations using suitable similarity variables and then solved numerically using shooting method together with Runge-Kutta algorithm. The effects of the various parameters on the velocity, temperature and concentration profiles are depicted graphically and values of skin- friction coefficient, Nusselt number and Sherwood number for various values of physical parameters are tabulated and discussed. It is observed that the temperature increases for increasing values of the internal heat generation, thermal radiation and the Dufour number and hence thermal boundary layer thickness increases.

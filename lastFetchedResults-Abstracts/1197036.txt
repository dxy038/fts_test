The main objective of this work is the investigation and improvement of thermal performance of evacuated CPC (Compound Parabolic Concentrator) solar collector with a cylindrical absorber. Modified types of this solar collector are always combined with the evacuated glass envelop or tracking system. The conventional stationary CPC solar collector has been compared with the single axis tracking CPC solar collector in outlet temperature, net heat flux onto the absorber and thermal efficiency. Numerical model has been analyzed based on the irradiation determined actually and the results have been calculated to predict the thermal efficiency. Based on the comparison of the measured and calculated results, it is concluded that the numerical model can accurately estimate the performance of solar collectors. The result shows the thermal efficiency of the tracking CPC solar collector is more stable and about 14.9% higher than that of the stationary CPC solar collector.

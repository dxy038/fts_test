This paper develops a coarse-gain parallel genetic algorithm for solving a service restoration problem in electric power distribution systems. A power utility performs service restoration in order to restore out-of-service areas at fault. Developing an effective service restoration procedure is a cost-effective approach to improve service reliability and to enhance customer satisfaction. The main objective in service restoration procedure is to restore as much load as possible by transferring de-energized loads via network reconfigurations to other supporting distribution feeders without violating operating and engineering constraints. Details of the parallel genetic algorithm developed in this paper are described. The proposed method is implemented on transputers for parallel computation. The feasibility of the developed algorithm for service restoration is demonstrated on several distribution networks with promising results

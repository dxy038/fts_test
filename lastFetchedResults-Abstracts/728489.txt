A series of glycosyl thioacetamide and glycosyl sulfonyl acetamide derivatives have been prepared following a convenient reaction protocol and evaluated for their antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Amongst 32 compounds evaluated 3  compounds were effective in inhibiting mycobacterial growth at MIC of 6.25 μg/mL, 6 compounds at MIC of 3.125 μg/mL and 1 compound at MIC of 1.56 μg/mL. All active compounds were found nontoxic in Vero cell lines and mice bone marrow macrophages.

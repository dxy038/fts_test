Selenium is essential for thyroid hormone homeostasis. Selenium is co-translationally incorporated into the protein backbone of 5â€² deiodinase enzymes, which are responsible for the intra- and extra-thyroidal activation of thyroid hormones. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sodium selenite on the transcript levels of type I (DIO1) and II (DIO2) deiodinases in the primary culture of ovine and bovine fetal thyroid. By culture of fetal thyrocytes in the presence or absence of sodium selenite, and quantification of DIO1 and DIO2 transcripts using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), we found that sodium selenite is able to increase the abundance of transcripts for DIO1 and DIO2 genes. We also found that cultured thyrocytes in the presence of sodium selenite compared to control cultured thyrocytes release more T3 into the culture medium. This indicates that in the presence of sodium selenite higher levels of DIO1 and DIO2 enzymes are produced, which are able to convert T4 to T3. In conclusion, we have shown that sodium selenite is increasing the abundance of DIO1 and DIO2 transcripts and increasing the production and release of T3 from cultured fetal thyrocytes. This finding emphasizes the role of selenium in transcriptional and expression processes during development and suggests that selenium deficiency during pregnancy in sheep and cattle may lead to the lower levels of DIO1 and DIO2 transcription in fetal thyroid, and thus, lower level of thyroidal T3 release into the fetal serum.

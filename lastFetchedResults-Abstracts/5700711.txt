Cubesats fall in the line of miniature satellites that imparts nano technology in them. They are very compact in size of about 1000 cm<sup>3</sup>. A cubesat consists of Power Supply Unit (PSU), On Board Computer (OBC), Altitude Determination and Control System (ADCS), Communication System (COM), Camera (CAM) or the payload and other structural subsystem. In our paper we are in focus of the Electrical Power Supply Unit (EPS) that is responsible for the power transfer to the rest of the system. The PSU consist of solar panel, electronics and batteries. The objective of the paper is to design the controller circuit to track maximum power from the source. The conventional buck converter is replaced with the buck-boost converter which can be used for both as the step up and step down converter. Hence the MATLAB design of Maximum Peak Power Tracking in combination with the SEPIC converter is discussed further along with the proposed block diagram.

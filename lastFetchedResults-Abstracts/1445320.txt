A terminal state equality constraint for Model Predictive Control (MPC) laws is investigated, where the terminal state/input pair is not fixed a priori but it is a free variable in the optimization. The approach, named “generalized” terminal state constraint, can be used for both tracking MPC (i.e. when the objective is to track a given steady state) and economic MPC (i.e. when the objective is to minimize a cost function which does not necessarily attains its minimum at a steady state). It is shown that the proposed technique provides, in general, a larger feasibility set with respect to the existing approaches, given the same prediction horizon. Moreover, a new receding horizon strategy is introduced, exploiting the generalized terminal state constraint. Under mild assumptions, the new strategy is guaranteed to converge in finite time, with arbitrarily good accuracy, to an MPC law with an optimally-chosen terminal state constraint, while still enjoying a larger feasibility set. The features of the new technique are illustrated by an inverted pendulum example in both the tracking and the economic contexts.

A Compact Test Range (CTR) facility extends the measurement capabilities at the Microwaves and Radar Institute of the German Aerospace Centre, in Oberpfaffenhofen. Increasing requirements in the precision of RF-component characterization was the main driving factor to establish the measurement facility. A new `TechLabÂ´ building houses the CTR facility. The operations started at the end of 2009. An overview of the CTR facility is the objective of this paper.

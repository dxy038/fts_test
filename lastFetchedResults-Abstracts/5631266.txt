Bioinformatics is an emerging field as an interdisciplinary field of computer science and molecular biology. The growth rate of data and information of this domain is exponential, and the techniques and strategies adopted few years earlier to handle data of this domain are considered obsolete now. Therefore, management of data of bioinformatics domain is facing serious problems of data management due to huge volume and high rate of growth of web resources of biological data. One of these problems is to store the data and information on semantic web resources of biological data, and then retrieve only the relevant data and information from these resources. Therefore, to achieve this objective, we need new technique to design and maintain ontologies of the web recourses in different way. In our opinion, we need a technique that can maintain dynamically ontologies. For this purpose, we introduce the concept of dynamic ontology which can control irrelevancy in retrieval of data stores by adding new index terms of the domain.

The objective of this paper is to propose a competitive microwave security system that can be applied with reasonable price at museums in Egypt due to following reasons, the priceless elements in Egyptian 23 museums country wide and the lack of good recent security systems even in big ones. The system main goal is to detect valuable targets to ensure their presence in the pre-defined positions in order to protect them from stolen. The system is based on real time microwave scanning for the required space volume through transmitting RF waves at consecutive angles and detecting the back scattered waves from required objects to detect their existence at pre-specified locations.

We consider First-Order Hybrid Petri Nets (FOHPN), a model that consists of continuous places holding fluid, discrete places containing a non-negative integer number of tokens, and transitions, either discrete or continuous. This Petri net model reveals itself to be particularly suited to modeling manufacturing systems and its control can be efficiently framed as a conflict resolution policy that aims at optimizing a given objective function. The use of linear algebra leads to sensitivity analysis that allows one to study how changes in the structure of the model influence the optimal behavior. It further enables us to determine admissible ranges of variation for some design parameters in order to improve the optimal myopic solution

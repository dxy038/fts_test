With the fast economic and population growth in Houston-Galveston area, more and more municipal solid wastes are generated in the region. It is expected that more landfill sites need to be built in the future within the next ten or twenty years in Houston-Galveston area. The objective of this study is to identify the best locations for the future landfill sites in Houston-Galveston area using geographical information system (GIS). Landfill site selection is a very important step before building the landfills. An optimized site selection will maximize the cost saving for waste transportation while minimize the adverse social and environmental impacts. In this study, GIS data of different geographical features in Harris County and Galveston County were collected, including constrains of flood plain, streams, hurricane areas, schools, museums, water bodies, hospitals, parks, natural refugee areas and airports that are prescribed by federal and state regulations on landfill sitting. We customized the GIS and generated a grid system composed of grids with 50 acres size. GIS spatial selection method was used to identify the grids that are out of the impact on various environmental sensitive areas. These selected grids have been evaluated in Google Earth using the KML technology. Preliminary results have identified several best sites for future landfills in the region, mainly in the Northeast and Northwest Harris County.

This paper describes an optimization model to adjust the hourly load level of a given consumer in response to hourly electricity prices. The objective of the model is to maximize the utility of the consumer subject to a minimum daily energy-consumption level, maximum and minimum hourly load levels, and ramping limits on such load levels. Price uncertainty is modeled through robust optimization techniques. The model materializes into a simple linear programming algorithm that can be easily integrated in the Energy Management System of a household or a small business. A simple bidirectional communication device between the power supplier and the consumer enables the implementation of the proposed model. Numerical simulations illustrating the interest of the proposed model are provided.

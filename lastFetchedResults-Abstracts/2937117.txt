The paper presents an interpretation of L and C band HH and VV SAR data acquired by the E-SAR system during an airborne flight campaign over an eucalyptus plantation in Congo. The overall objective is a better understanding of the radar responses of a specific forest type, in the aim of retrieving forest parameters from SAR data. The results show that for this type of sparse forest medium with vertical structure; the contribution of the ground surface is present in most cases and is only reduced at high incidence angles, relatively high frequency and VV polarisation. In the case under under study, C-W, &#952;&gt;50&#176; provides the best results relating the radar backscattering to forest biomass

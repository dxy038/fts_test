The challenges posed by the deployment and routing in sensor networks, are a superset of those found in wireless ad hoc networks. An example of these specific requirements is the limited energy supply and batteries which usually irreplaceable and not rechargeable. In order to maximize the lifetime of the network, the protocols need to be designed from the beginning with the objective to manage efficiently many characteristics and requirements like fault tolerance, scalability, production costs and others. In this paper, we present our new adaptive multi-criteria routing algorithm. Our approach provides a routing mechanism, which considers the best path based on the evaluation of the topological metrics (centrality measures) of neighbouring nodes, according to an automatically varying criteria set. These criteria are controlled and supervised dynamically by the root node (The Sink). In response to changes in the network state, criteria and application-defined goals, the best path between each node and the Sink will be called.

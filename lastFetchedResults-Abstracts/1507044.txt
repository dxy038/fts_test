Dew-point pressure is one of the most important quantities for characterizing and successful prediction of the future performance of gas condensate reservoirs. The objective of this study is to present a reliable, computer-based predictive model for prediction of dew-point pressure in gas condensate reservoirs. An intelligent approach based on least square support vector machine (LSSVM) modeling was developed for this purpose. To this end, the model was developed and tested using a total set of 562 experimental data points from different retrograde gas condensate fluids covering a wide range of variables. Coupled simulated annealing (CSA) was employed for optimization of hyper-parameters of the model. The results showed that the developed model significantly outperforms all the existing methods and provide predictions in acceptable agreement with experimental data. In addition, it is shown that the proposed model is capable of simulating the actual physical trend of the dew-point pressure versus temperature for a constant composition fluid on the phase envelope.

Background and Objective: Lower ureter is the most common site of stone traped causing renal colic and hydroureteronephrosis. If medical therapy is not effective , the treatment consist of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), transurethral lithotripsy (TUL) or on rare cases, open surgery. This study was done to compare the ESWL with TUL in sixty patients with lower ureteral stones which did not responed to thraputic regiment.

Materials and Methods: This prospective cohort study was done on sixty patients with obstructive lower ureteral stones for more than 3 weeks, that have not been responded to the thraputic regiment in Imam Reza hospital, Mashhad, Iran during 2004-06. According to treatment indications sixty patients divided in two equal ESWL and TUL groups. Success of procedure were evaluated by ultrasonography and KUB radiography. The success rate of two different technique and the side effects in each patients was recorded.

Results: In ESWL group in 14 patients (46.66%) the stone was broken and its particles were removed but in 13 patients (43.33%) the stone was not broken and they became candidates for TUL. In 3 patients (10%) the stone was broken but the particles did not pass. The only complication of ESWL was renal colic which was in 15 patients (50%) and cured by medical treatment. In TUL group, in 93.5% of patients, the stone was broken and particles were removed, but in 6.5% the procedure was not successful and the patients underwented ESWL or open surgery. 10% of patients experienced fever and colic pain, who underwented medical treatment.

Conclusion: This study showed that TUL technique has higher successful rate than ESWL technique in lower uretaral stones.

The objective of this design is to implement an accurate and cost effective adaptive tracking controller for a DC motor using an 80C196kr microcontroller system. The on-chip embedded functions, optical quadrature encoder and a PWM waveform generator, are used to measure motor positionsÂ´ and generate DC voltages to drive a DC motor respectively. A homing routine that incorporates a photoelectric sensor is used to position the motor at a reference point. Users communicate with the system through a 4&#215;4 matrix keypad and 20&#215;2 LCD display or through a PC. The experimental results have shown the validity of this simple microcontroller-based digital control system. This system is performed on a real-time basis, and the control law can be easily replaced by any advanced control laws without changing the hardware setup

This paper is concerned with the average consensus problem of networked multi-agent systems over memory communication channels with packet losses. The focus is on a particular case: uniform packet losses(i.e. all the communication links in the network may be failed simultaneously). The objective is to compare the performance of the corresponding memoryless and memory consensus protocols. We show that the memory consensus protocol always provides a better performance than the corresponding memoryless one, moreover, greater possibility of data drop will produces greater convergence rate gap between the memory and memoryless protocols. Simulations are included for illustration.

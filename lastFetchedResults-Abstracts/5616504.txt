On the base of constructing the evaluation index system of the enterprise´s independent innovation capability, this paper firstly achieves an objective evaluation of the enterprise´s independent innovation capability through the division of its five stages. During this process, it uses a new fuzzy multi-attribute group decision-making method to establish a mathematical model. Compared to the traditional evaluation methods, this method takes into account the uncertain preference coefficient in decision-making and uses the weighted Hamming distance, based on the fuzzy theory and multi-attribute decision-making theory. Furthermore it can identify the enterprise´s independent innovation capability by the relative closeness interval. Finally, the empirical result about Yantai Wanhua Polyurethanes Co. LTD shows that the model can effectively identify the enterprise´s independent innovation capability.

We investigate a multi-user multi-service scheduling scheme in the OFDMA based two-hop cooperative relay network, which aims at the cooperative resource allocation in this paper. We propose an adaptive Aggregated Utility Function (AU-Function) as the optimization objective, which simultaneously takes various multi-service QoS requirement and fairness among different services into consideration. We format the utility function into a several QoS parameters captured form, including rate, delay, jitter and Packet Loss Ratio (PLR) of services, which combines the QoS requirement well. Then, the complex resource allocation is decoupled into a joint relay-subcarrier selection and power allocation problem. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm achieves an efficient balance among rate, delay, PLR, etc., and show that the usersÂ´ QoS can be evaluated adoptively by the full dimensional utility consideration.

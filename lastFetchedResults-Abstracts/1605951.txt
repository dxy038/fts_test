The present paper deals with an eco centric approach for the restoration and eco-reforms of fast degrading Gujar Tal
ecotone belts in district Jaunpur, (U.P.). Gujar Tal lake-land transition zone are surrounded by natural vegetation ecotone belts
and at certain places covered with agricultural crop lands. The present wetland and its ecotones are under great threat of
degradation. Therefore, the main objective of this kind of study is the first step to discuss the remedial course of management of
Gujar Tal wetland ecotone belts based on logical, field and experimental studies fromApril, 2008 to March, 2009 at two selected
sites viz. (I) abandoned or neglected lands- 80×125m(II) cultivated lands or crop lands -50×200 m.

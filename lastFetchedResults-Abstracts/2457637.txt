Abstract
Background and Objectives
Asymmetry as a morphological-anthropometric characteristic is developed for body axis formation. Dermatoglyphics studies the skin lines in palms, toes and fingertips accurately and systematically. The objective of this research is to investigate the relevance of the asymmetry lines of fingerprints and blood groups in a population of women living in Khorasan  Razavi.

Materials and Methods
For this purpose, after determining the blood groups, the fingerprints of the first phalange of the left and right hands of 53 healthy pregnant women (18 to 42 years old), were printed by ink and their dermatoglyphic patterns were compared in terms of quality and quantity and the patternsâ€™ frequencies were determined in any blood group. In analyzing the data, we used SPSS 16 & MiniTaba 15 softwares. 

Results
The findings suggest asymmetry in women with A blood group due to a significant difference in the ridge count of dermatoglyphic patterns between their right and left indexes (Mean difference: 2.72, Standard Deviation: 1.34) (p <  0.05). There was a significant difference between fingerprint patterns and the type of fingers in the right hand of women with B blood group and between fingerprint patterns and the type of fingers in the left hand of those with B and O blood groups (p <  0.05). There was a significant difference between fingerprint patterns and the type of fingers in the both hands of women with Rh+ blood group (p <  0.01).

Conclusions
The present study reveals an association between the pattern of fingerprints and ABO blood groups.

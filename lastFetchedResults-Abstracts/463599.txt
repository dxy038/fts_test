OBJECTIVE: We examined whether the presence of fetal fibronectin in cervicovaginal secretions may be a marker to predict the onset of term labor and delivery.
STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study was performed in 100 primiparous and multiparous women having reached their expected date of confinement. Fetal fibronectin was assayed by taking samples of both the cervical and vaginal mucus with two different fetal fibronectin tests. The study population was divided into women delivering within 48 hours and women giving birth>48 hours after sampling.
RESULTS: Seven patients had to be excluded from evaluation. Of the remaining 93 women, 37 were delivered within 48 hours; fetal fibronectin was detected in 30. Fifty-six women were delivered later than 48 hours; 51 of them had negative results for fetal fibronectin (positive accuracy 86%, negative accuracy 88%, p< 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Fetal fibronectin in the cervicovaginal secretions of women who have reached their expected date of confinement is a useful predictor of the onset of term labor and delivery.

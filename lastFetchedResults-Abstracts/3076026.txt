A correct exploitation of the contrast agent previously injected inside the human body and the measurement of nonlinear responses generated by the bubbles that composing it need to an acoustic beam pressure having a quasi-constant profile in a fixed range of depths. In order to obtain this objective, a synthesis stochastic method (based on simulated annealing) aimed to the optimization of the weight coefficients to be applied to the array sensors has been developed and performed. The results obtained in terms of pressure profile and simulated echographic images have been reported and discussed

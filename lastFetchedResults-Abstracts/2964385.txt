Field-observed BRDFs for different land cover types are employed to derive a global BRDF/albedo database from land cover classifications. In a second step, AVHRR reflectance observations are used to reintroduce within-class variations into this database by fitting the field-observed BRDFs to the observed bidirectional reflectances. These databases are useful precursors to future satellite-derived BRDF databases

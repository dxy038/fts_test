The objective of this research is to study the long-run relationship between road accident
and its influencing factors in Iran. This research method is an analysis-causal
and itâ€™s objective is application and the method of data collection is the type of
library and fact and information about the variables used in this study is extracted
from Central Bank of Iran and Statistics Center. Also, Econometric tools used in
research is Eviews Software and time domain is seasonal time of 2006 to 2013 and
spatial domain including Iran. In this research Johansen-Juselius method is used to
estimate the long-run relationship between road accident and its influencing factors.
The results of this research indicate that the coefficients of all variables are significant
and based on theoretical foundations. Findings show that, Kuznets hypothesis
or an inverted U relationship between GDP per capita and road accident has been
approved and the number of motor vehicle per capita and the number of passengers
transported by road transport have a significant positive impact on road accident.
Also, the results based on error correction model indicate that to achieve long-term
balance, about 0.27 of short-run imbalances is adjusted in each period.

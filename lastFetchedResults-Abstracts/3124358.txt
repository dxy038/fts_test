Distribution transformers are responsible for approximately one third of the electric system losses. The capitalized losses may represent significant costs to the utility and to society itself. Therefore, great effort has been directed to increasing the efficiency of distribution transformers and consequently reducing the losses and, hence, the operational costs. International standards, published by means of norms, define the power efficiency of transformers, taking into account the no-load losses, the load losses and capitalization equations. An increase in distributor efficiency is obtained through prior knowledge of loads and design adequateness. The objective at AES-Sul Utility Company is to offer the best service to its customers through knowledge of their system and also through the acquisition of efficient equipment, compatible with similar units presently available in the European Common Market.

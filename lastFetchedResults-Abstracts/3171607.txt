The design of PID controllers can be considered as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem. This paper proposes a novel multiple tuning method for PID controllers based on the constrained particle swarm optimization algorithm. The design objective is to achieve the near-optimal performance subject to constraints in the time and frequency domain. Different optimization indexes and constraints can be selected to satisfy the multiple requirements of the processes. The proposed PID tuning method is tested on various kinds of processes with improved performance over the classic ZN tuning and other methods.

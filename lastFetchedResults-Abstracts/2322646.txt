Establishment of appropriate terminals is effective as the
main gate entrance to international, national and local transportation
network for economic performance, traffic safety and reduction of environmental
pollution. This paper focuses on intermodal terminal location
problem. The main objective of this problem is to determine which of
the terminals of a set of candidate terminals should be opened such that
the total cost be minimized. In this problem, demands of customers will
ship directly (without the use of terminals) between the origin and destination
of customers, or intermodaly (by using two terminals) or even
by combination of both methods. Since this problem is NP-hard, metaheuristics
algorithms such as tabu search (TS) is used to solve it. The
algorithm is compared with greedy randomized adaptive search procedure
(GRASP) on instance of this problem. Results show the efficiency
of TS in comparision with GRASP.

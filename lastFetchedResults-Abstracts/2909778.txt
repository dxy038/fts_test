This paper presents some field trials carried out in Bilbao (Spain) for testing the feasibility of Cloud Transmission (Cloud-Txn) reception in fixed and pedestrian indoor scenarios. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to analyze the Cloud-Txn system coverage features so as to determine the optimum transmission power level to ensure a good coverage in indoor scenarios. The results will be useful for planning purposes in this kind of scenarios.

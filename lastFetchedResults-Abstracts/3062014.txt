In this article, the work of the NTU-JTC joint project entitled "Development of an intelligent lift door monitoring system for preemptive maintenance" is described. The objective of the project is to develop an intelligent system that could predict imminent lift breakdown. The basic idea is to develop a computerized system to monitor the performance of the lift door system and alert the user when the performance has deteriorated to a level when servicing is necessary, but before a lift breakdown actually occur. Such a system can provide not only a more efficient utilization of maintenance resources but also, at the same time, a reduction of the actual lift downtime in the flatted factories managed by JTC. The on site testing result of the prototype demonstrates the effectiveness of the system.

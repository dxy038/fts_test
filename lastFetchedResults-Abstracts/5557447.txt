The objective of the Visual Programming Challenge (VPC) is to focus the various visual programming approaches, both research and commercial, on a specific problem as a means of providing a comparative analysis. The competition domain is a problem involving quasi-real-time control of a robotic vehicle. The control of these robotic vehicles is representative of programmable control problems that might reasonably be encountered by the general public in years ahead. For instance, programming a robotic vehicle is similar to what might be required to program a robotic vacuum cleaner

Background and Objective – Hepatotoxicity associated with the hypoglycemic effects of an aqueous extract of Teucrium polium was previously described. In this investigation, the effects of the extract on oral glucose tolerance test, regeneration of pancreatic islets and hepatic glucokinase activity of streptozocin-induced diabetic rats were studied. Methods – An aqueous extract of T. polium was fed by gavage tube to healthy and streptozocin-induced diabetic rats for several days. Oral glucose tolerance, number of pancreatic islets and hepatic glucokinase activity were measured using standard methods and compared between diabetic and healthy rats. Results – In diabetic animals, the aqueous extract caused a significant reduction (p < 0.001) in the level of serum glucose during oral glucose tolerance tests. The number of pancreatic islets per unit area significantly increased (p < 0.01) and glucokinase activity was significantly elevated (p < 0.01) in diabetic animals treated with the extract. Conclusion – Although aqueous extract of T. polium contains some hepatotoxic compounds, it also contains components that are beneficial in the treatment of streptozocin-induced diabetes.

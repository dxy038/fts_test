The major oil industry upstream activities include the exploration, drilling, extraction,
pipelines installation, and production of crude oil. In this paper, we develop a
mathematical model to plan for these operations as a crude oil supply chain network
design problem. The proposed multi-period mixed integer linear programming model
entails both strategic (e.g., facility location and allocation) and tactical (e.g., project and
production planning) decisions. With the objective of maximizing total Net Present Value
(NPV) at the end of planning horizon, the decisions to be made comprise the location of
the facilities, the flow of commodities and the amount of investment. The uncertain
natures of important input parameters such as capital and operational cost, demand and
price of crude oil, are taken into account via fuzzy theory. Finally, the performance of the
developed model is investigated using the real data of Iranian South Oilfields.

Background
The term “myocytolysis” was first used to define the repair process of contraction band necrosis associated with an acute myocardial infarction. On the other hand, in the latter condition a “myofibrillolysis,” presenting edematous myocardial cells not involved by infarct necrosis, and without evidence of repair process was reported. The objective of this study is to establish the frequency, extent and meaning of this myocardial lesion.
Materials and methods

In 12 groups of patients for a total of 432 cases with and without coronary heart disease, “colliquative myocytolysis” – i.e., progressive vacuolization by loss of myofibrils until their total or subtotal disappearance associated with intramyocellular edema in absence of any cellular reaction – was graded in 16 histological slides of the different cardiac regions in each pathological case.
Results

Colliquative myocytolysis (CM) was present in more than 90% with a maximal extent in cases of irreversible congestive heart failure followed by transplanted heart cases (67%) with a survival greater than 1 week. In all other groups, the lesion was absent or minimal.
Conclusions

No correlation was found between CM and contraction band necrosis, gender, age, heart weight, myocardial fibrosis, coronary artery stenosis, clinical data. Colliquative myocytolysis is a specific histological marker of congestive heart failure, without relation to coronary blood flow, heart weight and myocardial fibrosis. Vacuolization of myocardial cells may be due to other causes (e.g., storage disease, etc.) or may be an artifact. There is no support for the belief that coronary ischemia or myocardial hypoxia is its causes.

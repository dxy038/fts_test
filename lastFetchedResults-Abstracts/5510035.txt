Light Emitting Diode (LED) is one of promising source in lighting industry and applied as light source of a backlight system in flat panel display with advantages of performance and environmental-friendly feature. The inherent characteristic of LED causes high heat dissipation from the device and careful thermal management is required. Therefore, the thermal management in LED backlight system is crucial for the display development. However, narrow volume of flat panel display cause non-uniform temperature distribution over the system and the dependency of LED operating temperature necessitate the carful thermal design for light source. The objective of present study aimed to investigate the effect of design parameters in edge illuminating type backlight system. It is presented thermal characteristics of LED light source in edge-illumination type backlight system and evaluated performance of the thermal management system to ensure the reliability of the system.

The problem of finding the capacity region of a multiple access channel occupies one of the cornerstones of information theory. In this type of communications system several users transmit simultaneously to a common receiver. The main multiplexing strategies that fall in that category include frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA) and code division multiple access (CDMA). The indoor wireless channel can be analysed through the use of an information theoretic approach, whose main objective is to find the set of information rates at which the simultaneous reliable communication of the messages of each user is possible. This article presents an analysis of the capacity region for the multiaccess Gaussian channel, when subject to random fading

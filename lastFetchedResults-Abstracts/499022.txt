Background and Objective: Reviews of literature indicate that hydro- alcoholic extract of white mulberry leaves, possesses anti-inflammatory effects such as inhibition of nitric oxide, PGE2 and cytokines, which urged us to examine the anti-inflammatory effect of this leaves hydro-alholic extract on carrageenan- induced paw edema in rat.

Materials and Methods: Hydroalcoholic extract of white mulberry (Morus alba) leaves was prepared by ethanol (70% V/V) and soxhlet's method. The rats grouped as: Intraperitoneal (ip) extract receiving (200, 400, 600 mg/kg), positive control (aspirin 300 mg/kg) and group that received saline. Thirty minutes following the ip injection of materials, carrageenan (1% W/V) was injected into the rat's hind paw and the changes in rat's paw edema was assessed by plethysmometer for five hours at intervals of one hour.

Results: Compared with aspirin, 200 and 400 mg/kg doses of extract had lower effect on reduction of rat's paw edema (P<0.001). However, there was no significant difference between the group that received 600 mg/kg extract and aspirin group.

Conclusion: Hydro-alcoholic extract of Morus alba leaves at 600 mg/kg dose similar to aspirin (300 mg/kg), significantly reduced the paw edema of rats and showed effective anti-inflammatory activity.

The main objective of the proposed work is to explore the application of 2-D dual tree discrete wavelet transform (DDWT) which is directional and redundant over the critically sampled transform like discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for image coding. In this paper biome&#769;dical image coding is investigated with DDWTs along with iterative projection based noise shaping (IP-NS) algorithm. The noise shaping is one of sparsifying method for DDWT coefficients used to modify large coefficients to compensate for the loss of small coefficients, without substantially changing the original image. We compared results with various biome&#769;dical images using DWT, DDWT with noise shaping algorithm. Proposed scheme of noise shaping with DDWT significantly improve the performance in terms of PSNR.

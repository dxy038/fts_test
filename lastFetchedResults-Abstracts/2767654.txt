Distributed wind generation (DWG) with increasing permeability has brought an adverse effect to grid security. The battery energy storage system (BESS) can solve this problem. However, the system reliability may be limited by the improper locations of switches. To make full use of BESS, a coordinated planning model of BESS and controllable switches (CSs) is developed for distribution networks. The objective is to minimise overall cost including investment cost, operation cost, network loss, insufficient power supply cost and energy price arbitrage, while satisfying security and BESS limitations. The simulation results show that the model proposed is effective.

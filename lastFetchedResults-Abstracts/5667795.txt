The objective of this study is to determine the economic viability of a natural compressed gas service station to supply the urban bus fleet of Tranvias de Ferrol S.A. as a preliminary step to the planned project of moving its installations. The study will describe the installations needed to supply NGC to the urban bus fleet of the region of Ferrolterra, which are currently run on diesel, using the opportunity that the company is moving its offices and garages. Following the economic valuation the study of viability will follow to aid in the decision making process of whether the project is realised or not.

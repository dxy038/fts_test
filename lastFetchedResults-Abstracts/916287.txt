Background
Several factors may cause infertility and fetal loss. Blood groups antigens seem to be implied in the mechanisms of infertility and fetal loss. Maternal natural antibody can react against father’s blood group antigens on spermatozoa. The effects of parental blood group system on infertility and fetal surveillance perceived by its manifestation in prezygotic (caused infertility) and postzygotic (caused fetal loss) stages. Objective of the present study is to determine the effect of parental ABO blood group on fetal surveillance and men infertility.
Materials and Methods
This is a retrospective, cross sectional study. Our study was carried out in fertility and infertility center of Yazd city. Blood group of 118males (group1:100 males with infertility and group 2: 18 males with abortion history in female partners) that referred to this center was evaluated based on medical document’s patients.


Data were analyzed with SPSS 16 software using chi-square test. The results were considered significant when P-value was  < 0.05, CI: 0.95.
Results
Results indicated that overall distribution of blood groups in group 1 was:50%, 25%, 16% and 9% and in group 2: 56%,27%,11%,6% for blood groups O, A, B and AB respectively. There is a significant relationship between male infertility and blood group O (P value = 0.01). There is also a significant relationship between parental blood group O and fetal loss in group 2 (P value =0.03)
Conclusion
The present study revealed that there is a significant relationship between father’s blood group O and fetal loss, so that appropriate intervention strategies can be followed.

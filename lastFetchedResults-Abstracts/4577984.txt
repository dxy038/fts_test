The objective of the research is to develop new methods or indicators regarding cyclostationarity (CS) that could clearly point out and differentiate between walking disorder signals. Normal human locomotion is the rather grand term given to the description of walking by individuals who fall within the range considered as &#8220;normal&#8221;, and is seen as a sequence of cyclic and repeated gestures. It is a highly individual and variable activity influenced by many various factors. Analysis and treatment of such sequences, are demonstrated, and have proved that such processes are cyclostationary. This article suggests that &#8220;Kurtosis&#8221; provides a strong indicator of CS, and shows empirically the existence of a relationship between the &#8220;Kurtosis&#8221; and the known indicator of CS; specifically &#8220;the degree of cyclostationarity (DCS)&#8221;. An empirical study on the biomechanics of locomotion is performed with the objective of using it as supportive evidence of that relationship.

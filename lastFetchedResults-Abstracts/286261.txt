Background:  Temporary black henna tattoos are very popular as body adornment. Although contact allergy to natural henna is unusual, the inclusion of hair dye, p-phenylenediamine (PPD), increases the risk of contact sensitization. Objective:  This study was performed to identify the presence and concentration of PPD in a black henna tattoo mixture to which our patient developed contact allergy. Methods: The presence of PPD in a black henna tattoo mixture, various samples of commercially available henna powders, and several hair dye products was qualitatively and quantitatively detected using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: This study demonstrated that PPD was present in the black henna tattoo mixture at a concentration of 15.7%, which is significantly higher than commercial hair dye preparations. Conclusion:  The presence of PPD in black henna tattoo mixtures in high concentration poses a health hazard and a risk of allergic contact sensitization with potential long-term consequences.

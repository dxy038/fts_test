As we move towards the next generation of air traffic management (ATM) system, we anticipate a shift in the control paradigm from a ground-based, reactive air traffic control scenario to a collaborative system based on predictive management of traffic. Such a system is clearly identified in the NAS CONOPS as a concept in which all participants have a collaborative role in managing the NAS with the objective of reducing congestion and delay with ever increased levels of safety and security. To include the flight-deck in the decision making process a number of information sharing mechanisms are being introduced, for example automatic dependant surveillance (ADS) and traffic information service (TIS). Using the information available from these systems, the pilot is supported in the cooperative decision making process by a suite of on-board collaborative decision making (CDM) tools. To evaluate the benefits and impacts of enhanced situational awareness and the introduction of intelligent agents on the flight deck, the augmented flight deck model (AFDM) has been created. This work discusses the concept of the intelligent flight deck, and describes the AFDM simulation model and how it operates within a common ATM information framework to support validation studies for the future air traffic environment.

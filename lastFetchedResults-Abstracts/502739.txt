
Background and Objective: Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the most common diseases of childhood which may cause serious morbidity. We evaluated recurrence rate of UTI in children without congenital abnormalities who were at the age of 1 month to 12 years old. 
Materials and Methods: This cross- sectional study was carried out for three months after the termination of the treatment in order to determine the rate of recurrence and re-infection in children (sex segregationation) at the age of 1 month to 6 years and 6 to 12 years who did not have any anatomical or functional urinary abnormalities at Arak Amir kabir Hospital. 
Results: In total, 250 patients (224 girls and 26 boys) were evaluated. 17 girls had recurrences, of whom, 2 cases (11.7%) were under 1 year old, 14 cases (82.2%) had 1 to 6 years old and 1 case (5.8%) was in the 6 to 12 years old group. In the first month there was no relapse and most recurrences occurred through the third month (65%). All recurrences were symptomatic. 
Conclusion: Due to low rate of recurrence of urinary infection in our study group, repeated cultures and prophylactic treatments is not recommended in children and infants without underlying congenital renal abnormalities. In such cases, UTI can be prevented by effective trainings.

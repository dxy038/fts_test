Background: Type 2 diabetes is a global health problem and a major cause of illness. Exercise, diet and medication are the three pillars in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of aerobic training combined with green tea hydroalcoholic extract consumption on blood glucose and lipid profile on diabetic rats. 
Methods: Diabetes was induced in 40 male Wistar rats by intraperitoneal injection of 50 ml/kg streptozocin. After two weeks the diabetic rats with fasting blood glucose of 150 to 300 mg/dl were divided into 4 groups of 10 rats each and named as: aerobic exercise, aerobic exercise with green tea, green tea, and control.  Aerobic exercise was performed as running on Treadmill for 5 days a week daily for 30-90 minutes with Treadmill speed of 18 -24 meters per minute. Green tea extract (100 mg/kg) was gavages once a day for 5 weeks. At baseline and endpoint fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c and triglyceride levels were determined in all groups.
Results: Fasting blood glucose level decreased significantly in all groups but triglyceride and cholesterol decreased in aerobic exercise and aerobic exercise + green tea groups at end point compared with baseline and also compared with control group. Fasting blood LDL-c level significantly decreased and HDL-c level significantly increase, in aerobic exercise and aerobic exercise with green tea at end point compared with baseline and also compared with control and green tea group.
Conclusion: Aerobic exercise favorably affects glucose and lipid profile and in combination with green tea it has synergistic effects.

Objective
Cord blood CD34+ cells are more uncommitted than their adult counterparts as they can be more easily maintained and expanded in vitro and transduced with lentiviral vectors. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether pretreatment with high-energy shock waves (HESW) could further enhance the expansion of cord blood progenitors and the transduction efficiency with lentiviral vectors.
Methods

Human cord blood CD34+ cells underwent HESW treatment with a wide range of energy and number of shots (from 0.22 mJ/mm2 to 0.43 mJ/mm2 and from 200 to 1500 shots). Cells were then evaluated both for their in vitro expansion ability and in vivo engraftment in primary, secondary, and tertiary NOD/SCID mice. The transduction efficiency with a lentiviral vector (LV) was also evaluated in vitro and in vivo.
Results

Cell viability following HESW ranged from 75 to 92%. Pretreatment with HESW significantly improved early progenitor cell expansion after short-term suspension culture. Upon transplantation in primary NOD/SCID mice, the HESW treatment enhanced progenitor cell engraftment (total human CD45+CD34+ cells were 10% in controls and 14.5% following HESW, human CD45+CD34+CD38âˆ’ cells were 0.87% in controls and 1.8% following HESW). HESW treatment enhanced the transduction of a GFP+ lentiviral vector (e.g., at day 42 of culture 6.5% GFP+ cells in LV-treated cell cultures compared to 11.4% of GFP+ cells in HESW-treated cell cultures). The percentage of human GFP+ cell engrafting NOD/SCID mice was similar (34% vs 26.4% in controls); however, the total number of human cells engrafted after HESW was higher (39.6% vs 15%).
Conclusion

The pretreatment of CD34+ cells with HESW represents a new method to manipulate the CD34+ population without interfering with their ability to both expand and engraft and it might be considered as a tool for genetic approaches.

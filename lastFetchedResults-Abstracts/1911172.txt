Objective
er of large-scaled studies done in Western countries have proven a positive relationship between serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and prevalence of positive bone scan findings in newly diagnosed prostate cancer (CaP) patients. The objective of this study is to verify that the tendency occurs as well in Asian population, as well as to establish a possible correlation between PSA level, bone scan result, and Gleason score.

s of 116 patients diagnosed to have CaP were reviewed retrospectively for bone scan results, PSA levels, and Gleason score.

-four patients were proven to have bone metastases based on positive bone scintigraphy result. None of these patients had a PSA level of less than 10 ng/ml. Two patients had PSA level between 11 and 20, and 15 patients had PSA level between 21 and 200. For patients with PSA level over 201, 17 had bone metastases on bone scintigraphy.
sion
on the PSA level, the likelihood of positive bone scintigraphy result can be postulated. According to PSA levels, staging investigations can be more selective for patients with confirmed CaP. The risk of having positive bone scan is so low that it is not required for patients with PSA level less than 10 ng/ml. On the other hand, on studying the correlation between Gleason score and PSA level or bone scan results, no statistically significant relationship was established.

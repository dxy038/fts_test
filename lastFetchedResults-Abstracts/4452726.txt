This paper considers supervisory discrete-time LQG control of a wide-area multi-machine power system in the presence of communication time-delays. These delays are incorporated into the LQG design procedure by using two alternative methods, namely Pade Approximation and Bessel-Thomson Approximation. Resulting LQG controllers are then compared with each other and with the standard LQG controller that ignores time-delays. Comparison is performed using a non-linear simulation of a 2-area, 4-machine, 8-bus power system for which the control objective is to damp electromechanical oscillations in the presence of communication time-delays.

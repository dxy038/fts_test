Today, application of shunt capacitors and distributed generation resources due to increase in demand and power quality parameters improvement has increased. Appropriate location and size of these two elements plays important role in bus voltage profile and stability improvement, reducing active power losses and economical aspect of the system. Due to the advantages of using DGs and capacitors simultaneously, Using from this two element has additional capabilities for the electrical power distribution system. The mentioned is related to the location and sizing of DGs and capacitors, when it is presented under a nonlinear optimization problem. In this paper, the imperialist competitive algorithm for solving multi-objective problem of locating and tracking the amount of distributed generation resources and shunt capacitors are employed simultaneously. This objective functions for this problem are voltage profile improvement, increase in voltage stability and decrease in active power losses. The proposed method has implemented on standard IEEE 69 bus and the 33 bus models. The results indicate significant improve in power quality parameters.

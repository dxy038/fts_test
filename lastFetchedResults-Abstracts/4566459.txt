On February 10, 1993 an Air Force F-16 dropped an INS/GPS modified GBU-15 from an altitude of 35000 ft and a down range distance of 88000 ft in adverse weather. The guided weapon impacted within 6 meters of the target, demonstrating the potential of INS/GPS technology to significantly improve air-to-surface munitions strategies and tactics. This landmark flight was successfully followed by 5 additional drops with varying altitudes, downrange distances and weather conditions. OCD was designated an Air Force high gear program, allowing streamlined acquisition and reporting procedures, in response to Operation Desert Storm experience highlighting the need for attacking high-value targets from high altitude in adverse weather. OCD met itÂ´s objective to build and demonstrate an INS/GPS weapon in an operationally representative environment. Results of the demonstration show there is low technical risk associated with development of INS/GPS munitions considered for the Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) program. This paper provides additional details on program objectives, system implementation, and test results. The focus of this paper is on the implementation and performance of the integrated INS/GPS navigation system

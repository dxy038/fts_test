Objective: To better understand the seemingly contradictory plasma  -amyloid (A ) results in
Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) patients by using a newly developed plasma A  assay, the INNO-BIA plasma A 
forms, in a multicenter study. Methods: A combined retrospective analysis of plasma A  isoforms on mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) from three large cross-sectional studies involving 643 samples from the participating
German and Swedish centers. Results: Detection modules based on two different amino (N)-terminal specific A 
monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that A  in plasma could be reliable quantified using a sandwich
immunoassay technology with high precision, even for low A 42 plasma concentrations. A 40 and A 42
concentrations varied consistently with the ApoE genotype, while the A 42/A 40 ratio did not. Irrespective of
the decrease of the A 42/A 40 ratio with age and MMSE, this parameter was strongly associated with AD, as
defined in this study by elevated hyperphosphorylated (P-tau181P) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
Conclusion: A highly robust assay for repeatedly measuring A  forms in plasma such as INNO-BIA plasma A 
forms might be a useful tool in a future risk assessment of AD.

Objective
To examine demographics and immunization attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of parents who sought medical attention for a child due to an adverse event following immunization (AEFI).
Methods

A sample of households that participated in the National Immunization Survey was re-contacted during 2001. This analysis was conducted in 2004 and 2005.
Results

Of 2286 respondents, 223 (6.9%, weighted) sought medical attention for a child due to an AEFI. Compared with parents reporting no adverse event, parents who sought medical attention were less likely to be African American (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.16–0.75) or Hispanic (AOR=0.16, 95% CI=0.07–0.39) versus white, aged 35 years or older versus 25 to 34 (AOR=0.35, 95% CI=0.17–0.72), more likely to believe that immunizations cause minor side effects (AOR=5.74, 95% CI=2.99–11.00), report unwanted yet required childhood immunizations (AOR=3.54, 95% CI=1.45–8.66), not want a new baby to be fully immunized (AOR=3.48, 95% CI=1.25–9.67), report concern about immunization safety (AOR=2.08, 95% CI=1.07–4.05), believe that immunizations are dangerous (AOR=3.56, 95% CI=1.14–11.13), and have a child missing two or more doses of three immunizations (measles-containing vaccine, DTaP/DTP, or hepatitis B) (AOR=2.30, 95% CI=1.17–4.55).
Conclusions

This study suggests that research is needed to determine whether negative parental attitudes associated with a child’s AEFI might be lessened by improving vaccine safety communication between physician and parent.

Objective
estigate whether parylene coatings over denture bases and silicone elastomers can effectively reduce Candida albicans adhesion and thus to decrease the incidence of denture stomatitis.

ens of silicone elastomers A-2186 or lucitone 199 resin were prepared, and the measurements of contact angle, assay of XTT reduction and cell count of C. albicans adhesion were taken before and after parylene treatment. Furthermore, morphology of C. albicans adhesion for 48 h was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), and C. albicans adhesion for 4 h was illustrated by confocal scanning laser microscopy (CLSM) in combination with fluorescent dyes FUN-1 and Concanavalin A.

was a statistical difference between mean contact angles of silicone elastomer A-2186 before and after parylene coating (P &lt; 0.05). The amount of C. albicans adhesion to the surface of silicone elastomer A-2186 and lucitone 199 resin after parylene treatment was significantly less than before parylene treatment by cells count and XTT reduction assay (P &lt; 0.05). In SEM and CLSM analysis, C. albicans biofilm was more apt to generate on the surface of silicone elastomer A-2186 than other three groups, and more C. albicans aggregation formed on the surface of silicone elastomer A-2186 and lucitone 199 resin before parylene treatment than after parylene treatment.
sion
ne coating reduced C. albicans adhesion and aggregation on the surface of silicone elastomer A-2186 and lucitone 199 resin, and improved the wettability of silicone elastomer A-2186.

In this paper we present a novel access strategy for bidirectional data network which uses the existing and widespread coax distribution infrastructure to provide high speed and cost-effective multi-services. Based on EPON and MoCA (Multimedia over Coax Alliance), the new FTTB (Fiber-to-the-Building) plant is connected to passive coax distribution network (PCN), so that the Ethernet data is conveyed to subscribers over coaxial networks. The system performance testing the broadband-requiring services like internet access, video on demand and VoIP are supplied, performing with high satisfaction. The results prove that the new access method is featured with high access data rate in PHY and MAC layer, good priority support using 802.1D (802.1p), strong bandwidth management for network status, flexible multi-channel upgrading, and outstanding anti-noise ability in the broadband access networks in China. The paper carries out the active exploration and effective practice to facilitate ChinaÂ´s development of fixed broadband access networks.

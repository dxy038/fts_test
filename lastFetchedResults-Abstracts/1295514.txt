In this paper, we study a system consisting of a manufacturer or supplier serving several retailers or clients. The manufacturer produces a standard product in a make-to-stock fashion in anticipation of orders emanating from n retailers with different contractual agreements hence ranked/prioritized according to their importance. Orders from the retailers are non-unitary and have sizes that follow a discrete distribution. The total production time is assumed to follow a k0-Erlang distribution. Order inter-arrival time for class l demand is assumed to follow a kl-Erlang distribution. Work-in-process as well as the finished product incur a, per unit per unit of time, carrying cost. Unsatisfied units from an order from a particular demand class are assumed lost and incur a class specific lost sale cost. The objective is to determine the optimal production and inventory allocation policies so as to minimize the expected total (discounted or average) cost. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and show that the optimal production policy is of the base-stock type with base-stock levels non-decreasing in the demand stages. We also show that the optimal inventory allocation policy is a rationing policy with rationing levels non-decreasing in the demand stages. We also study several important special cases and provide, through numerical experiments, managerial insights including the effect of the different sources of variability on the operating cost and the benefits of such contracts as Vendor Managed Inventory or Collaborative Planning, Forecasting, and Replenishment. Also, we show that a heuristic that ignores the dependence of the base-stock and rationing levels on the demands stages can perform very poorly compared to the optimal policy.

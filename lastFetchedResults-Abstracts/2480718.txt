The present article seeks to answer the question, what was the effect of Allama Tabatabaie's philosophy on his exegesis? In other words, what is the status of philosophy in Allama's exegetical method? Here, we will attempt to deal with this question in an objective and comparative way. To do so, we study and compare the discussion on 'divine agency' – both as an important philosophical issue and an important and frequently posed Quranic issue – in Allama's exegesis and his philosophy. Based on the findings of this study, Allama's broad philosophical knowledge and his systematic use of that knowledge in his exegesis of the Quran has not led to imposition of philosophical meanings on the Quran and neglecting the obvious meanings of its words; rather, it has prepared the ground for a stronger commitment to the appearance of the Quran, while assisting the commentator for a broader and deeper understanding of its meanings.

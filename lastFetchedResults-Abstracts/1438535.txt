The Survey of the Role of Humans' Risk Factors in the Severity of Road Traffic Injuries on Urban and Rural Roads


Backgrounds and Objective: This study was conducted to determine the role of human risk factors in the severity of road traffic accidents on urban and rural roads.

Materials and Methods: All data from road traffic-injured subjects (census, 592168) which were registered by the Fava system (COM forms) were investigated. Human risk factors due to road traffic injuries and the Odds ratio were calculated using an ordinal regression model and adjusted to probable confounding risk factors such as age, gender and lighting system in urban and rural roads.

Results: The mean age of the subjects was 34.1Â±14.0 years. Among human risk factors, the highest percentage (69.9%) was allocated to the disregard of rules and legislation. The Odds ratio of an accident being fatal or non-fatal in inner city roads to alcohol users was 6.5 times more than for those who did not have this risk factor (OR: 6.5, CI: 4.88-8.65). In outer city roads it was also the highest among other ratios (OR: 1.73, CI: 1.22-3.29).

Conclusion: In spite of the fact that alcohol had the highest effect on the severity of road traffic injuries, but acknowledging the low prevalence of this factor and its outcome on lower attributable risks when compared to other factors, it is a better prevention program to focus on those factors which are more prevalent, such as the disregard of rules and legislation and speed.

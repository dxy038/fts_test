The paper deals with the analysis, via step response and phase portraits methods, of biomass filter behavior in a completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) for wastewater treatment. The main objective is to determine the effect of biomass filters on the process properties e.g. substrate degradation, biogas production, limits of operating conditions, with an automatic control and energy perspectives. A reduced model is used in a simulation platform in order to determine the effect of a biomass filter. The obtained results show that immobilizing bacteria on a solid support, the process performances are enhanced since larger disturbance can be rejected, operating regions are modified and instabilities are avoided.

Purpoe
The purpoe of thi report i to characterize the clinical and electrophyiological effect of extraocular mucle urgery in 15 patient with oculo-cutaneou albinim (OCA) and infantile nytagmu yndrome (IN). Our hypothei i that urgery on the extraocular mucle of patient with OCA and IN change their nytagmu and their viual function.
Deign
Interventional, propective, cohort, noncomparative cae erie.
Method
All 15 patient had urgery on all four virgin horizontal recti; three for trabimu alone, three for nytagmu alone, five for an eccentric gaze null zone alone, and four for an eccentric gaze null zone plu trabimu. All patient have been followed for at leat ix month. All 15 patient had the ubjective outcome meaure of pre- and potoperative binocular bet optically corrected acuity (BBOCA). Objective outcome meaure included anomalou head poture (AHP) in nine patient, eye movement recording meaure of expanded nytagmu acuity function (NAFX) in 10 patient, null zone poition (NUZP) and null zone width (NUZW) in 10 patient, and foveation time (FOV) in nine patient.
Reult
The reult are ummarized a follow; BBOCA increaed 0.1 LogMar or greater in 14 of 15 patient. In thoe operated on for an AHP with or without aociated trabimu the AHP improved ignificantly (P < .01 for all). The NAFX, NUZP, NUZW, and FOV meaured from eye movement recording howed peritent, ignificant increae in all patient (P < .01 for all).
Concluion
Thi report add to the evidence that urgery on the extraocular mucle in patient with IN ha independent neurologic and viual reult.

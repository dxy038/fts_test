Objectives
evious study showed the synthesis and characterization of a novel urethane-linked trimethacrylate monomer for use as a co-monomer in dentin adhesives. The objective of this work was to further investigate the performance of dentin adhesives containing a new monomer, with particular emphasis on the water sorption and viscoelastic behavior of the crosslinked networks.
als and methods
 adhesives contained 2,2-bis[4-(2-hydroxy-3-methacryloxypropoxy) phenyl]-propane (BisGMA), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), and a new multifunctional methacrylate with urethane-linked groups-1,1,1-tri-[4-(methacryloxyethylaminocarbonyloxy)-phenyl]ethane (MPE) and were photo-polymerized in the presence or absence of water. Adhesives were characterized with regard to degree of conversion (DC), viscosity, water sorption/solubility, and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and compared with BisGMA/HEMA controls.
s
perimental adhesives exhibited DC and solubility comparable to that of the control, regardless of the presence or absence of water. All the experimental adhesives tested showed less water sorption, lower tan Î´ peak heights, and higher rubbery modulus than the control.
icance
 adhesives containing a new multifunctional methacrylate showed better dynamic thermomechanical properties and water sorption relative to controls, without compromising DC and solubility. Thus, MPE, when included as a component of methacrylate dentin adhesives, may provide enhanced durability in the moist environment of the mouth.

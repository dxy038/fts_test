The objective of this work is to build an efficient WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) with long lifetime for indoor monitoring application, which requires network auto-organization and robustness against node failure and node association. In this paper, a novel MAC protocol, ADCF (Adaptive and Distributed Collision-Free), is proposed. ADCF uses CFBS (Collision-Free Beacon Slot) and CFDS (Collision-Free Data Slot) mechanisms to guarantee QoS (Quality of Service) while reducing energy consumption in a mesh WSN. The simulation results show better performances of ADCF compared with IEEE 802.15.4 standard MAC protocol in terms of energy and guaranteed medium access with the flexibility of mesh topology.

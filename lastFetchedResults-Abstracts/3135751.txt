Planning, co-ordination and managing the electromagnetic spectrum through operational, engineering and administrative procedure, with an objective of enabling electronic systems to perform their function in intended environment is the need of the hour. This requires the parameters of immunity and emissions to be considered from the basic design of an electronic system such that the system is immune to the field created by its neighbors and at the same time the system must limit its emissions at a level that is compatible with the neighboring system. This paper presents the primary EMC design techniques that includes electromagnetic shielding, circuit filtering, good grounding and bonding to cater for spatial attenuation.

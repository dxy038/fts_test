Today the need for renewable energy sources is on the rise because of the acute energy crisis in the world. India has planned to produce 20 Giga Watt of solar power by the year 2020 whereas it has only produced less than half a Giga Watt as on December 2013. Solar power plays an important role in our India. The main objective of this work is to reduce the utility power consumption by the way of sharing the two power supply system; one is utility (Grid power) and another one is solar power system. Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is used to track the maximum power from solar panel. For home applications, we need AC supply and we use an inverter from which the load is fed by the AC supply. The supply to the load is shared depending on the availability of the solar power and the rest via utility. The analysis is carried out using MATLAB/Simulink software package and the results are evaluated.

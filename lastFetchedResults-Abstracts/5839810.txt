We present an ongoing research on an Integrated Real-time Mobility Assistant (IRMA). IRMA is a software system that targets the personal mobility in a near future scenario, based on green, shared and public transports. IRMA handles end-to-end itineraries that may involve multiple transport systems, and encompasses both commuter mobility and visitor mobility. The objective of IRMA is to make practically feasible a mobility that balances efficiency of time, energy/pollution and cost. Therefore, IRMA supports users in plotting the itinerary and also when en-route. IRMA architecture includes a smartphone application and a set of web services to gather and interpret any relevant source of information, that includes open data, crowd data and big data. The technology is SOA/EDA (Service Oriented Architecture / Event Driven Architecture) and uses GTFS format to access open data. IRMA, after being proved on test cases, shall be tested by the students of University of Pavia. IRMA concept is a step ahead current personal mobility systems that simply suggest and track itineraries.

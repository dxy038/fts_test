A new multisensory image registration is proposed for based on detecting the feature corner points using Improved Harris Corner Detection (HCD) and matching the feature using Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (distance condition and angle condition). This optimization process helps in picking up three corresponding corner points detected in the Sensed and Reference image and there by using the affine transformation, the sensed image is aligned with the reference image (base image) through objective switching technique. Further, the result show that the new approach can provide a new dimension in solving multi-sensor image registration problem. The performance of image registration is evaluated and concluded that the proposed approach is efficient.

The objective of this paper is to design and to analyze the performance of Electromagnetic Band-Gap (EBG) antenna for wireless application through simulation. The proposed design is evaluated using the High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS). In our method, after comparing the results, we can say that the best obtained result is with respect to two layers FSS with cylinders having resonant cavity width of 10mm. With this type of structure we have obtained gain of 4.51dB with bandwidth of 67.5MHz and reulted VSWR is 1.38. After simulation of this project on different types of Electromagmetic Band-Gap structures we got some results at resonating frequency 2.4 GHz which is used in wireless applications.

Recently interactive facilities based on computer graphics have been used to aid in the design of complex pattern analysis and recognition systems. One major objective of such interactive systems is to provide both software and hardware facilities to allow efficient human intervention at various levels of the design process. This paper will first outline the methodologies of a number of the existing interactive systems that have been implemented to date. Several remaining important problems are discussed to indicate how the interactive approach may better contribute to the analysis and recognition of complex pictorial patterns. An interactive facility, using a PDP-9 computer system, that is designed to assist data organization for pattern analysis and recognition will be described.

The objective of this study was to determine the frequency and types of pain medications taken before ED arrival based on pain intensity, duration of pain, chief complaint, gender, age, and race. A convenience sample of patients in pain was enrolled in this university hospital-based prospective, observational study. A total of 1233 patients were enrolled. Five hundred thirty-nine of 1233 (44%) patients took pain medication before arrival. Two hundred three (38%) took ibuprofen, 147 of 539 (27%) took oral opioids, and 135 of 539 (25%) took acetaminophen, which were the most frequently used medications. Severity of pain, age, duration of pain, and chief complaint were associated (chi-squared P <.05) with variations in prior medication use. Race and gender were not associated (chi-squared P >.05) with differences in medication use before arrival. Many patients (44%) take medication before arrival in the ED. Age, severity and duration of pain, as well as chief complaint are associated with differences in frequency of self-administered medication.

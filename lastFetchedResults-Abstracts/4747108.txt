A well-known reactive motion planning technique, the dynamic window approach (DWA) provides an elegant way to navigate safely in the presence of obstacles, also taking the dynamic properties of the robot into account. Most of the DWA-based methods have the same limitation, namely they use an objective function consisting of weighted terms. Different situations require different weights, however, there is no algorithm for choosing them. This paper presents a global dynamic window-based navigation scheme using model predictive control and having no weighted objective function. Former DWA-based methods take dynamic limitations of the robot by acceleration constraints into account. In contrast with that, the proposed approach utilizes a dynamic motion model of the robot.

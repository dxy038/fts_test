A method for the array pattern synthesis in the presence of near-zone scatterers in the three-dimensional vector case is presented. The synthesis is based on the minimization of an objective function using the simulated annealing technique. In order to take into account the effects of the scatterers, the physical optics approximation is used. The polarization in both the incident and the scattered fields is also taken into account. Examples for a 10&#195;&#151;10-element planar array of dipoles in the presence of a perfectly electric conducting cylinder are presented.

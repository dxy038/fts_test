Wireless mesh networks have promised to provide high-speed access for residential or mobile customers. And concurrent transmission is an effective way to enhance system throughput in wireless mesh networks. The objective of this paper is to provide an effective concurrent transmission method to enlarge throughput with specific QoS fairness guarantee in wireless mesh networks. Firstly, link relationship is obtained by the topology transformation based on the network models adopted in this paper. Secondly, a greedy concurrent transmission algorithm which constructs the scenarios of links without interference is proposed and threshold values are designed to guarantee particular fairness index for each links in the network. At last, the simulation results demonstrate that with the requirement of specific fairness index, the system throughput can be enhanced efficiently by using the algorithm proposed in this paper.

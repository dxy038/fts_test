Objective
e dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in serum increases as a marker of cellular necrosis. LDH activity in saliva could constitute a specific indicator of oral mucosal lesions with tissue breakdown including periodontal disease. The aim of this study was to determine LDH activity in saliva, assessing inter-individual variations with regard to the oral health status.
als and methods
l and perioral examination was performed on a study group of 175 volunteers, to assess the number of missing teeth, caries, fillings, dental prosthesis, periodontal status and temporomandibular joint condition. LDH activity was determined from stimulated whole saliva.
s
adjustment by age, gender, smoking habits, missing teeth and use of removable prosthesis, the multivariate analysis showed that increased LDH activity was associated with periodontal disease, specifically with the presence of calculus and pockets greater than 5 mm.
sion
tivity in whole saliva could be useful as a biochemical marker of periodontal status.

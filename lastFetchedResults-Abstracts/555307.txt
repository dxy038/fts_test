Background and Objective: The present study is a Quasi-experimental study which has been done in department of Emergency, Imam Khomeini hospital, Hamedan. The aim is to study the effects of hydrocolloid dressing as compared to 1% silver sulfadiazine in healing process of the second degree burns.
Materials and Methods: In this study we selected 30 patients every one was two burn lesions, one lesion a test group (with tragacanth gel dressing) and the second lesion ad control group (with 1% silver sulfadiazine dressing).The instruments were check list to determine the percentage of burn area, healing and check list to elaborate degree of pain. we completed for each dressing session. To analysis the data we used pair T-test and k-square and fisher test.
Results: According to results, duration of healing the wound in test group was 8.06 days and in control group it was 13.2 days, Using pair T- test there was a significant difference between two group (P=0.000) that indicates shorter periods of healing in second stage burns of test groups compared to control group also indicates meaning number the mild degree of pain (1.97) in test group as compared to moderate degree of pain (4.64) in control group , using pair T-test there was significant difference between two groups (P=0.000) that indicates test severe pain test group as compared to control group.One important finding was the score of wound healing was a significant statistical difference between two groups (P=0.000). Additionally for all criteria of burn healing there was a significant difference P<0.05 between two groups that indicates better healing process & second degree burns in test group compares to control group.
Conclusion: it is suggested applying hydrocolloid dressing for second degree burns.

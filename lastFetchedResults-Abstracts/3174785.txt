This paper proposes a Model Predictive Control (MPC) for the boost dc-dc converter. Based on the state space description of the converter, a constrained optimal problem is formulated and solved. By regulating the current of the power circuit´s inductor to a proper reference, set by an outer loop based on an observer, the main control objective, which is the regulation of the output voltage at a reference value, is achieved despite changes in the input voltage and the load. Experimental results are presented to verify the controller´s feasibility and performance.

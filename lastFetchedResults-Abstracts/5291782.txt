This paper deals with induction motor deadbeat control. The main objective of such a control is the flux and torque dynamics, against feeding voltage drop and load torque disturbances, to comply under voltage and current limitations, the specific railway requirements, including line and motor harmonic management. A novel discretization method of the induction motor state-space equations is carried out, which leads to their exact inversion, and therefore to the calculation of the voltage space-vector components, to obtain in one-step, the flux and torque reference inputs. The magnetization current set-point is analytically calculated as a function of flux reference in transient analysis. This method is generalized to other types of motors or actuators such as surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous motors.

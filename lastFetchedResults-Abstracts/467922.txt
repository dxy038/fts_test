OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to compare anatomic and functional results of 2 procedures performed at vaginal hysterectomy for vaginal vault suspension in patients with advanced uterovaginal prolapse.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study was designed comparing 62 patients who underwent sacrospinous ligament fixation and 62 members of a matched control group who underwent modified McCall culdoplasty during vaginal hysterectomy and reconstructive pelvic surgery. The 62 pairs were matched for grade of uterine prolapse, age, parity, dystocia, menopause, body mass index, previous prolapse surgery, heavy work, constipation, and chronic cough.
RESULTS: Operative time and blood loss were significantly greater (P< .001) in the group with sacrospinous suspension. With a follow-up from 4 to 9 years, 17 (27%) patients receiving sacrospinous suspension had prolapse recurrence at any vaginal site compared with 9 (15%) patients receiving modified McCall culdoplasty (P = .14). Recurrent vault prolapse was recorded in 5 (8%) and 3 (5%) subjects, respectively (P = .72). Thirteen (21%) and 4 (6%) patients, respectively, had recurrent cystocele (matched odds ratio 4.1, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 14.2, P = .04). No significative difference was observed in postoperative sexual function.
CONCLUSION: Sacrospinous ligament fixation is not recommended as a prophylactic measure at vaginal hysterectomy in patients with uterovaginal prolapse. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:13-20.)

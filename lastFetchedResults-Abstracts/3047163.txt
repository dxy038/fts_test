This work presents a comparative investigation of the performance of the RePART model with the ARTMAP-IC model, when applied to two tasks of pattern recognition. Such investigation has as its main objective to verify whether the RePART model presents higher recognition rate than the performance presented by the other model. Also, a statistical method is applied to the results of the neural networks in order to analyse the significance from a statistical point of view of the neural network performances.

Objectives.
This study investigated whether echocardiographic Fourier phase and amplitude imaging can be used to evaluate ischemia-related regional wall asynergy.
Background.
Because myocardial ischemi delays the onset and peak of endocardial inward motion and reduces its magnitude, Fourier phase and amplitude analysis of two-dimensional echocardiograms may be used to evaluate regional wall motion abnormalities objectively by analyzing temporal sequence and magnitude of endocardial motion.
Methods.
Digital cine loops of left ventricular long- and shortaxis views were obtained in six anesthetized dogs at baseline and 1 to 30 min after coronary microembolization and were mathematically transformed using  first-harmonic Fourier algorithm to obtain phase angles and amplitudes of endocardial segments. Mean phase angles and amplitudes were compared with visual wall motion analysis based on  scoring system and quantitative analysis based on segmental fractional are shortening derived from planimetry.
Results.
Microembolization delayed segmental phase angles by 47 ± 44° in mild to moderate hypokinesi (fractional shortening [mean ± SD] 41 ± 13%) and by 77 ± 63° in severe hypokinesi (fractional shortening 13 ± 5%) and reduced segmental amplitudes from 80 ± 36 gray level intensity at baseline to 53 ± 34 in segments developing mild to moderate hypokinesia, and from 93 ± 36 to 35 ± 28 gray level intensity in segments developing severe hypokinesia. Shifts in segmental phase angles correlated better with dynamic shifts in segmental fractional are shortening than did changes in wall motion score (r = −0.65 vs. r = 0.52, p < 0.001).
Conclusions.
Echocardiographic Fourier phase imaging can be used to evaluate ischemia-related regional wall asynergy, displaying contraction sequence and magnitude in  simple, objective format

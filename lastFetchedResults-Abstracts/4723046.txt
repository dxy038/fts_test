A n-stage cascaded boost converter connected with a single active switch is usually used in applications with high conversion ratio. It has been reported that the dynamic of the transfer function output-voltage-to-duty cycle related with the first inductor is minimum phase and the second, third or n inductor current has right-hand side (RHS) zeros; as a result, it is obtained and increment of complexity in the controller design. In this paper a hybrid multi-objective controller is proposed, which can use any inductor current in the converter as a feedback and overcome the drawback of RHS; meanwhile it achieves an excellent output voltage control under disturbances either from supply voltage, load voltage or other perturbations. Experimental results are given for a 100 W three stage cascade boost converter with one single active switch taken as a benchmark.

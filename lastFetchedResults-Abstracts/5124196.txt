ParkinsonÂ´s disease (PD) is characterized by motor disabilities that can be alleviated reasonably with appropriate medication. However, there is a lack of objective methods for quantifying the efficacy of treatment in PD. We applied here an objective method for quantifying the effects of medication in PD using EMG and acceleration measurements and analysis. In the method, four signal features were calculated from the EMG and acceleration recordings of both sides of the body: the kurtosis and recurrence rate of EMG, and the amplitude and sample entropy of acceleration. Principal component approach was used for reducing the number of variables. EMG and acceleration data measured from nine PD patients were used for analysis. The patients were measured in four different medication conditions: with medication off, and two and three and four hours after taking the medication. The results showed that in eight patients the EMG recordings changed into less spiky and the acceleration recordings into more complex after taking the medication. A reverse phenomenon in the signal characteristics was observed in seven patients 3-4 hours after taking the medication. The results indicate that the presented method is potentially useful for quantifying objectively the effects of medication on the neuromuscular function in PD.

Objective: Our purpose was to evaluate the outcome of infants who underwent successful resuscitation after initial Apgar scores of 0 at both 1 and 5 minutes. Study Design: Eligible infants were identified through the perinatal database at the University of Tennessee, Memphis. Hospital records and long-term outcomes, where available, of babies who met the above criteria occurring between January 1986 and February 1999 were reviewed. Results: Thirty-three of 81,603 infants (0.4/1000 births) met our study criteria. Twenty-two (67%) babies died during hospitalization. Mortality decreased significantly from 100% for babies with a birth weight of <750 g to 38% for those weighing ≥2500 g at birth (P = .03). All 6 babies delivered before 26 weeks’ gestation died. The incidence of 10-minute Apgar scores >0 was significantly higher among survivors than among those who subsequently died (82% vs 33%, P< .05). Nine survivors had hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy diagnosed before discharge. Of the 7 infants with available follow-up, 4 had significant persisting morbidity. Two infants had normal neurologic examinations at follow-up. Conclusion: Survival in babies born with 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores of 0 is predicted by birth weight, gestational age, and 10-minute Apgar score. Long-term sequelae are common but not ensured.

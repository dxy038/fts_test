Personalized medicine will depend on sophisticated tools, analyses, and molecular level data and clinical information to provide optimized treatment based on each patientÂ´s individual characteristics such as health history, current health or disease status, and biochemical and physiological makeup. We discuss an approach to integrate clinical trial simulations with an optimization method to produce predictions of the best individualized treatment. Our objective is to optimize the treatment protocol by minimizing health risk to adverse drug reactions. This approach anticipates the era of genome-based medicine that requires sophisticated engineering, mathematical modeling and simulations to support best practice and clinical use of genetic data.

An approach based on the optimal placement of buildings that favors the use of solar energy is proposed. By maximizing the area of exposure to incident solar irradiation on roofs and facades of buildings, improvements on the energy performance of the urban matrix are reached, contributing decisively to reduce dependence on other less environmentally friendly energy options. A mathematical model is proposed to optimize the annual solar irradiation availability where the placement of the buildings in urban environment favors the use of solar energy resource. Improvements on the solar energy potential of the urban grid are reached by maximizing the exposure of incident solar irradiation on roofs and facades of buildings. The proposed model considers predominant, the amount of direct solar radiation, omitting the components of the solar irradiation diffused and reflected. The dynamic interaction of buildings on exposure to sunlight is simulated aiming to evaluate the shadowing zones. The incident solar irradiation simulation and the dynamic shading model were integrated in an optimization approach implemented numerically. The search for optimal topological solutions for urban grid is based on a Genetic Algorithm. The objective is to generate optimal scenarios for the placement of buildings into the urban grid in the pre-design phase, which enhances the use of solar irradiation.

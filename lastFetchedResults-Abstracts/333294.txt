With two ultrasonographic and two CT films of three cases of thyroid tuberculosis, we evaluate the ultrasonographic and CT findings and correlate them with the pathologic findings. They are demonstrated as heterogeneous hypoechoic mass on ultrasonogram and peripheral-enhancing low-density abscess on CT scan with regional lymphadenopathy. Ultrasonography (US) and CT can help the diagnosis of thyroid tuberculosis.

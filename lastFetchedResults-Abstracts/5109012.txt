According to the demand of integrated production and the characteristic of charge plan in the steel industry, firstly, use graph theory to describe charge plan; secondly, a bi-objective charge plan model is introduced in detail considering weight range, flow limitation and other factors; To solve this model, a two-phase heuristic algorithm (THA) is introduced, which deals with the simple graph with vertex clustering method firstly, and then design a novel probability match algorithm to solve the optimization model; Finally, the simulation with large-scale production data shows that the model and algorithm is feasible.

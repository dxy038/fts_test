The objective of this work is to develop a ZnO conductometric gas sensor to monitor two key pollutants in indoor environments: benzene and formaldehyde. Conductometric sensors are widely used for this purpose. The final aim of the sensor is to be integrated in an air quality measuring system connected to the HVAC (Heat Ventilation and Air Conditioning) system so that ventilation is activated according to the air quality within the building. As there is no EU common legislation about the target gases and detection limits, the authors have set them according to the recommendations of different agencies in Europe and the US.

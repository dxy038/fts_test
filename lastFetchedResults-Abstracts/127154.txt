After the victory of the Islamic Revolution, the movement launched by the Shi'ite Islamists and jurists needed to take position on various issues and explicitly and specifically express legal viewpoints for planning policies and programs in running the state. In this direction, they had to abide by their legal fundamentals in their taking positions on one hand, and to pursue the progress and prosperity of the state on the other. In fact, they were to provide an alternative pattern of renovation that could implement the intellectual accomplishments of the modern world in the Islamic Community. Consequently. they encountered serious subjective and objective queries and challenges in various fields which, as a whole, exerted great impacts on Shi'ite political jurisprudence.

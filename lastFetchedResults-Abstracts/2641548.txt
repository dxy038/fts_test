The  purpose  of  this  article  is  to  present  an  optimi
zation  model  for  designing  an 
acceptance  sampling  plan  based  on  cumulative  sum  of
  run  length  of  conforming  items. 
The  objective  is  to  minimize  the  total  loss  includi
ng  both  the  producer  and  consumer 
losses.  The  concept  of  minimum  angle  method  is  appl
ied  to  consider  producer  and 
consumer  risks  in  the  optimization  model.  Also  the 
average  number  of  inspection  is 
considered  in  the  constraint  of  the  model.  A  practi
cal  case  study  has  been  done  and  a 
sensitivity analysis is performed for elaborating t
he effect of some important parameters 
on the objective function. The results of sensitivi
ty analysis showed that the performance 
of the proposed model is logical, reliable in all t
he cases and also has better performance 
in comparison with classical method in most of the 
cases. A computational experiment is 
done   to   compare   the   different   sampling   schemes.   The
   results   of   computational 
experiment showed  that the proposed model  has bette
r performance due to smaller  ANI 
value in all cases.

In this paper we introduce a novel edge directed image interpolation algorithm so as to obtain an high-resolution image, given a low-resolution image. The interpolation is based on the local image directionality features estimated on the low-resolution image. The in depth analysis of the local edge features is accomplished at a low computational cost by filtering the low-resolution image by means of the first order filter belonging to the class of the Circular Harmonic Functions (CHF). The interpolation algorithm shows low computational complexity. Numerical results show that the CHF-driven interpolation outperforms state of the art estimators from both a subjective and objective point of view, in several simulation conditions.

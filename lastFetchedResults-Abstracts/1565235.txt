This paper is concerned with the lower semi-continuity of the efficient (Pareto) solution map for the perturbed quasiconvex semi-infinite vector optimization problem (QCSVO). We establish sufficient conditions for the lower semi-continuous property of the efficient solution map of (QCSVO) under functional perturbations of both the objective function and the constraints. Examples are designed to analyze the obtained results.

To help fabs improve their use of inspection tools a practical guide to inspection capacity and sample planning is presented. A comprehensive approach involving data collection, parameter estimation, and model based sample planning is covered. The objective is to enable yield engineers to develop basic inspection planning toolboxes in a spreadsheet and/or more effectively manage inspection planning projects. For parameter estimation, the use and performance of a hidden Markov model and the E-M algorithm is introduced

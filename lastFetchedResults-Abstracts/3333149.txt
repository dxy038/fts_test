This paper describes various approaches to secure interagency information sharing. The common objective of these approaches is to use federated credentialing as the basis for controlled access to federated, multi-agency information. The exemplary scenario for federated information sharing consists of FAA flight information being shared with authorized persons or organizations within a partner agency, such as the Department of Defense (DoD) and the converse. Approaches we explored involve an identity provider (IdP) entity that authenticates a user/client and provides a security token for consumption by a service provider (SP) entity accessed by the client. Since the emulated agencies maintain distinct security domains, secure information-sharing approaches involve varying combinations of IdP and SP entities spanning the emulated interagency boundary.

The performance of an acoustic absorbent lining can be significantly related to the shape of the introduced holes inside the lining, the general shape of holes can be designed by the topology optimization. In this paper, the finite element model of an acoustic absorbent lining is built, the acoustic and structure response characteristics are performed by used of the direct finite element method(FEM) when the plane acoustic wave is incident on the lining surfaces. The reflect coefficients are formulated and computed according to both the response results and the impedance translation theory. Then, the weight sum of reflect coefficients in a frequency range is chosen as the objective function, the densities of every elements are chosen as the design variables, a topology optimization design is performed for designing the general shape of holes inside the lining. The example results are presented for validating the effectiveness of the topology optimization.

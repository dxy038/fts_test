The availability of objective QoE models for voice, video-audio, multimedia is crucial for cost efficiently optimization of 4G networks, which show unprecedented traffic volume for video-audio/multimedia (e.g. streaming, mobile TV, mobile video telephony), data and voice services. Operators faced with the challenge of ensuring increased capacity, while maintaining and even improving users´ experience of the 4G mobile services, imminently need accurate estimators of the users´ subjective opinion of the perceived quality of a certain mobile service (e.g. voice, video, audio). The paper introduces a procedure for the evaluation and comparison of QoE models´ performance. The required statistical evaluation metrics and their usage in the assessment process are discussed. The paper also introduces the figure of merit for the statistical QoE models´ selection based on multiples evaluation metrics and test data sets.

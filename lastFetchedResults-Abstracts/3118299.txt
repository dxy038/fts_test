Information system based on intelligent optimization algorithm is provided in this paper to solve the vehicle routing optimization problem with time constraint. And a hybrid optimization algorithm-PBIL combined with Ant algorithm is proposed and applied to VRP. The objective function is to minimize the cost and reduce the loss caused by customerspsila time restriction. The probability matrix of PBIL algorithm is modified with the positive feedback and information disappearing mechanisms of Ant algorithm. Also, the probability statistics for the road traffic status distributed is considered in decision-making for the vehiclespsila routing. All the demands of customers are taken as the main constraints in this information system. And the optimal scheme is obtained by t he hybrid intelligent evolutionary algorithm. The actual case is used to test the algorithm and system. The result is excited.

Power quality has no standard definition. If you can accomplish what you want with the power available then it is generally considered ´good power quality´. Simple availability is only one determinant of power quality. However, when problems prevent reliable equipment operation, the malfunction is often attributed to a power quality problem. The philosophy of power quality monitoring has evolved from a strictly troubleshooting objective to a multitude of purposes. These purposes include: assuring compliance to a contractual or legal standard; determining preventive practices; and establishing a predictive baseline. This paper discusses the essential features of power quality monitoring including the instrumentation aspects and data analysis tools.

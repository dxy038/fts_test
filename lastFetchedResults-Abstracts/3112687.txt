Flight Electronics Division of Langley Research Center is developing a speceflight experiment called "Stabilized Ultra-Narrow Linewidth Laser-in-Space Technology Experiment" The scientific objective of the project is to explore the fundamental limits on frequency stability using a FM laser locking technique on a Nd:YAG non-planer ring oscillator in the vibration free and microgravity environment of space. This paper focuses on the control aspect of the laser frequency stabilization. The problem has been defined, role of feedback control in frequency stabilization has been established. The parameters of the discrete controller replacing the analogue controller has been determined.

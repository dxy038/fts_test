Objective: Our purpose was to determine whether insulin-like growth factors I and II preferentially stimulate uterine leiomyoma cells versus myometrial cells in monolayer culture.
Study design: Leiomyomas and normal myometrium were obtained at hysterectomy from five premenopausal women. Specimens were enzymatically digested for use in primary monolayer cell cultures. By use of serum-free media, insulin-like growth factor I or II was added in 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml concentrations to both cell types with the patient serving as her own control. Cell number, prolactin production, and proliferative index values were measured on day 15 of cell culture.
Results: Significant increases in cell number were found in the leiomyoma cultures (p< 0.05) treated with 10 and 100 ng/ml insulin-like growth factors I but not with insulin-like growth factos II. Neither factor exerted a stimulatory effect on myometrial cells.
Conclusion: Insulin-like growth factor sI preferentially stimulates leiomyoma cells in monolayer culture. These results suggest an autocrine-paracine role in vivo for this factor in conjuction with gonadal steroids in promoting leiomyoma growth.

This paper presents a real-time simulation of a sensorless control method for IPMSM drives based on Park Transformation with a reference frame fixed to the rotor and assuming a sinusoidal flux (sinusoidal back-emf). The objective of this paper is to Hardware In Loop (HIL) evaluation of a sensorless position estimation of the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) drive at standstill as well as the current controller. An anti-windup method is integrated within the controller to ensure a good dynamic performance during transients. Test voltages vectors are injected in such a manner the current samples are not affected. An asymmetric Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) allows to apply these test vectors each PWM period.

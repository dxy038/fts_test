Suitability of whole wheat flour for chapati making quality was evaluated with subjective and objective parameters. An instrument- based method using lnstron Universal Testing Machine (IUTM) for measuring force needed to tear chapaties was standardized. Elongation curve area (ECA) of unbaked and baked chapaties and its correlation with sensory scores was evaluated. Other quality parameters of wheat flour such as protein content, wet and dry gluten content, water absorption capacity.sodiumdodecyl SUlphate - sedimentation volume(SDC-SV) and elasticity recovery (ER) ratio were studied. Their relationship with sensoryscores of chapati and Instron measured ECA was evaluated. The results indicatethat ECA of baked and unbaked chapati as measured by lUTM can serve as an objective method to assess the suitability of whole wheat flour for chapati making quality.

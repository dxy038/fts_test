Advanced microcomputer technology has been used to design a distributed system which provides special features for control of a turbogenerator unit. An independent measurement system, controlled by a digital signal processor, samples both voltages and currents and processes them online, to produce all the quantities necessary to control the system. A structured system of various microprocessors is employed to allow a variety of control algorithms to be tested. The underlying theme of the project is modularity. Hardware and software configurations can be changed with minimum disruption to the overall system. Although the primary objective of the project is to improve the performance of power generating units, the system may also be used in other fields of control and monitoring

A smart RS-232 cable capable of automating the process of connecting two serial ports together has been designed. After making the physical connections, the user is required to input the baud rate and the port description: either listener or talker/listener. The custom-designed integrated circuit interrogates the ports and makes the logical connections of the TXD, RXD, DTR, RTS, CTS, DSR, DCD, and GND lines for transmission to take place. The design of the system has led to the development of an algorithm for interrogating RS-232 ports as well as a method for the interconnection of bidirectional signals where very little information about the other side is known. The design was performed on an Apollo 3000 workstation using the LIS (Laboratory for Integrated Systems) software, and the ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) was designed for implementation in a 3-&#956;m double-level metal process. Full-chip-level simulation results verify the correct operation of the smart RS-232 connection

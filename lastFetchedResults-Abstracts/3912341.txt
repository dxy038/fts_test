The main objective of the present work is the measurement and comparison of the dielectric properties of mixtures of two insulating liquids: synthetic ester liquid Midel 7131, used in the power industry, and THESO high permittivity oil developed by Tetra Corp. for pulsed power applications. It is shown that these two liquids can form stable mixtures with tailored dielectric properties. The dielectric properties of Midel 7131/THESO liquid mixtures such as their low frequency dielectric permittivities, dc conductivities and breakdown volt-time characteristics have been measured and will be discussed.

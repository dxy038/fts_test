Wireless Underground Sensor Networks (WUSNs) present a variety of new research challenges. Recently, a magneto-inductive (MI) waveguide technique has been proposed to cope with the very harsh propagation conditions in WUSNs. This approach allows for an extension of the transmission range, which can be quite limited if relays are not deployed. In this paper, tree-based WUSNs are considered with sensors connected via MI-waveguides. The objective of our work is to determine the optimal system parameters and topology in order to avoid bottlenecks in the system and achieve optimal network throughput.

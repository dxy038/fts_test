Temperature and humidity controlling system which has the function of alarm memory was designed by PROTEUS software. The MCU AT89C51 was used to control the whole system. The humidity and temperature sensor SHT11 was used as the data collector. The system compare the collecting temperature and humidity data with their normal value to decide whether modifying the temperature and humidity or not. The software of PROTEUS was used to do the simulation of the designed system to evaluate the designÂ´s feasibility and stability. So the debugging time in objective hardware was reduced, the development process was accelerated.

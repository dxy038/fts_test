In this paper, we present the optimization of the locations of the remote radio units for the distributed antenna systems with the multi-cell pilot contamination. Considering the two-cell distributed antenna system scenario with pilot contamination, we get the objective function of optimization by maximizing the lower bound of the cell averaged ergodic rate. Since the conventional squared distance criterion appropriate for the single-cell distributed antenna system may not be suitable for the multi-cell scenario, we get reasonable locations of remote radio units by applying the k-means algorithm generating the initial values and the gradient ascent algorithm maximizing the objective function. We compare the locations of remote radio units in the two-cell scenario considering pilot contamination with those not considering pilot contamination clearly, and simulation results show that the cell averaged ergodic rate considering pilot contamination is reasonably larger than that not considering pilot contamination.

Optimization problems in the steady state analysis of power systems aim at minimizing or maximizing some objective function. Traditional methods use mathematical programming techniques to obtain the optimum solution. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been shown to exhibit greater flexibility in solving the optimization problem. Genetic algorithm (GA) technique is used in the paper with a new formulation of system equations based on line flow variables. MATLAB GA toolbox is applied to solve the equations. An example system demonstrates the effectiveness of the formulation. Future extension are indicated.

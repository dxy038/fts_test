Many cometary coma features are only a few percent above the ambient coma (i.e., the background) and therefore coma enhancement techniques are needed to discern the morphological structures present in cometary comae. A range of image enhancement techniques widely used by cometary scientists is discussed by categorizing them and carrying out a comparative analysis. The enhancement techniques and the corresponding characteristics are described in detail and the respective mathematical representations are provided. As the comparative analyses presented in this paper make use of simulated images with known coma features, the feature identifications as well as the artifacts caused by enhancement provide an objective and definitive assessment of the various techniques. Examples are provided which highlight contrasting capabilities of different techniques to pick out qualitatively distinct features of widely different strengths and spatial scales. On account of this as well as serious image artifacts and spurious features associated with certain enhancement techniques, confirmation of the presence of coma features using qualitatively different techniques is strongly recommended.

Emissions tax is an environment protecting policies in
economy context. This study also aims at investigating
economic and environmental impacts of emissions taxation
levied on CO2 emitted from fuel and production process in
Iran. To get the objective a computable general equilibrium
framework based on the Iranian social accounting matrix of
1999 was used. CO2 is taxed based on World Bank (2004) estimated
damage cost. The results show that tax policy impact
on emission and macroeconomic variables depend on whether
energy subsidies are reformed. CO2 tax is more effective in
emission reduction after energy subsidy reform while implementing
it at the presence of energy subsidies does not induce
significant effects.

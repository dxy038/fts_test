Predicting fatigue crack growth in metals remains a difficult task because available models
are based on cycle-derivative equations, such as the Paris law, while service loads are often far from
being cyclic. The main objective of this paper is therefore to propose a set of time-derivative equations
for fatigue crack growth. The model is based on the thermodynamics of dissipative processes.
For this purpose, three global state variables are introduced in order to characterize the state of the
crack: the crack length a, the plastic blunting at crack tip ρ and the intensity of crack opening C.
Thermodynamics counterparts are introduced for each variable. Special attention is paid to the elastic
energy stored inside the crack tip plastic zone, because, in practice, residual stresses at crack tip are
known to considerably influence fatigue crack growth. The stored energy is included in the energy
balance equation, and this leads to the appearance of a kinematics hardening term in the yield criterion
for the cracked structure. No dissipation is associated with crack opening, but to crack growth
and to crack tip blunting. Finally, the model consists in two laws: a crack propagation law, which is
a relationship between dρ/dt and da/dt and which observes the inequality stemmed from the second
principle, and an elastic-plastic constitutive behaviour for the cracked structure, which provides dρ/dt
versus applied-load. The model was implemented and tested. It reproduces successfully the main features
of fatigue crack growth as reported in the literature, such as the Paris law, the stress-ratio effect
and the overload retardation effect.

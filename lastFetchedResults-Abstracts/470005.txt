Objective
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between different causes of preterm delivery (eg, maternal hypertension, small-for-gestational age [SGA], other) and cerebral damage (eg, cystic periventricular leukomalacia [c-PVL], grade III intraventricular hemorrhage [IVH], and intra-parenchymal hemorrhage [IPH]).
Study design
This study included 1902 very preterm singletons who were transferred to neonatal intensive care units in 9 French regions. We used logistic regression models to compare the risk of cerebral injury associated with maternal hypertension, SGA, and all other causes of preterm delivery.
Results
We found that the risk of c-PVL and grade III IVH was higher in infants born after preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) with short latency or idiopathic preterm labor than in infants born to hypertensive mothers. We show that SGA and antepartum maternal hemorrhage significantly increase the risk of IPH.
Conclusion
Our results show that infants born to hypertensive mothers have a lower risk of cerebral injuries than infants born following idiopathic preterm labor and PPROM because they are less exposed to prenatal infection.

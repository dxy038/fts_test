This paper studies the capacitated single-allocation hub covering location problem (HCLP) with fuzzy cover radius. Hob covering is one the four kind of hub location problems (P-hub median, hub location with fixed cost, P-hub center, hub covering) which has received the least attention in the literature. The objective of hub covering location problem is to find the minimum number of hubs considering the maximum allowable travel time. This paper employs the technique of fuzzy chance-constrained programming (FCCP). The fuzzy model is then converted to its crisp equivalent using possibility measures. The computational results shows that due to cover radius uncertainty, number of hubs and the allocation of non-hub nodes to hub nodes is changed by considering different confidence level which is defined by decision maker.

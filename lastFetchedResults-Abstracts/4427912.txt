Variable acoustics in auditoria represents a main object especially for which it concerns the contemporary music; listening parameters and especially the musicians requests have been so varied during last years that it is very difficult to find the objective parameters for good acoustics. With this type of variable room resonator itÂ´s possible to vary the absorption frequency and then the room response, with a relatively short time, through a step-motor insetted along the sliding duct of the resonator. This analogue device (variable room resonator) is digitally controlled by an easy database which drives the step-motor and so the absorption frequency variation.

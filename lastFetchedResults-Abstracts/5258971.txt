An operational tranconductance amplifier (OTA) is sized by applying multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. The OTA is designed using CMOS integrated circuit technology of 0.35 &#956;m. From the obtained feasible solutions, a tolerance analysis is performed for each width (W) and length (L) of the MOSFETs. This analysis helps to evaluate the W/L tolerances of the transistors so that the developed optimization approach choose the solution with the best performance that has the lowest sensitivity. The selected feasible sized-design is used to implement a universal active filter, showing that the associated tolerance guarantees good performance of the OTA.

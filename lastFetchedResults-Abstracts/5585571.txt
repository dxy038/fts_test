In this paper an approach for taking advantage of the information available in the social network tools of Learning Management Systems is presented. Specifically, our objective is to determine domain experts from their participation in the social networks. Our approach first integrates the different sources of information through an ontology based on the Dublin Core Metadata, and then applies Semantic Web technology to filter and classify each one of the social resources, so providing the basis for a better precision in the information retrieval process. The solution has been implemented following the paradigm of service oriented architecture.

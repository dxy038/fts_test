Power system restoration decision making optimization is important for its safe and rapid restoration after blackout occurred. Generally, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method is employed to provide decision support for dispatchers. Reasonable weights are conducive to decision making support. In order to reduce the subjectivity of weights, this paper proposes a novel weighting method. Firstly, the weighted least-square method is used to determine subjective weights according to the attributes preference of decision maker. Secondly, the information entropy theory is employed to acquire objective weights. At last, subjective and objective weights are combined together to obtain the final attribute weights. This combined weights can comprehensively take into account the subjective preference of decesion maker and the objective information of attribute values. Based on the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method, Shandong power grid is selected as an example to describe the application process of this method. Simulation results show that the method is feasible and effective. It can be used to set attribute weights for power system restoration decision making support.

The objective of the present paper is the design of a control scheme for effectively managing congestion phenomena in freeways and interurban roadways. Such systems are typically made of several road stretches connected to compose a network and, of course, the dynamic behavior of traffic in each stretch influences the state of traffic in the overall network. In this sense a freeway network can be considered and analyzed as a &#8220;System of Systems&#8221;. A distributed Model Predictive Control Scheme in which clusters of freeway cells are separately regulated is proposed in the paper. Moreover, the definition of an event-triggered scheme is included in the paper as well: in the proposed scheme the control action is not computed at each time instant as in the classical Model Predictive Control framework, but only when the system state fulfils specific conditions,.

The fabrication of high-density interconnect structures typically involves sequential processing of alternate layers of thin organic dielectric materials and conducting copper lines. With the continued push toward low-cost fabrication, large-area processing of thin-film materials is being aggressively pursued by the electronic packaging industry. The objective of the ongoing work at Georgia Tech in collaboration with the MCM-D consortium is to develop innovative materials, models, and processing techniques to facilitate large-area processing of alumina and silicon tiles. As the alumina and silicon tiles are commercially available in smaller dimensions, a palletization approach has been developed to facilitate large-area processing. In the palletization approach, alumina and silicon tiles are attached to re-usable glass pallets with an in-house developed thermally-stable, reworkable, and highly-compliant adhesive

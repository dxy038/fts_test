Using a Representative volume element (RVE) to represent the microstructure of periodic composite
materials, this paper develops a non-linear numerical technique to calculate the macroscopic shakedown
domains of composites subjected to cyclic loads. The shakedown analysis is performed using homogenization
theory and the displacement-based finite element method. With the aid of homogenization
theory, the classical kinematic shakedown theorem is generalized to incorporate the microstructure of
composites. Using an associated flow rule, the plastic dissipation power for an ellipsoid yield criterion
is expressed in terms of the kinematically admissible velocity. By means of non-linear mathematical
programming techniques, a finite element formulation of kinematic shakedown analysis is then developed
leading to a non-linear mathematical programming problem subject to only a small number of
equality constraints. The objective function corresponds to the plastic dissipation power which is to be
minimized and an upper bound to the shakedown load of a composite is then obtained. An effective,
direct iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the non-linear programming problem. The effectiveness
and efficiency of the proposed numerical method have been validated by several numerical examples.
This can serve as a useful numerical tool for developing engineering design methods involving
composite materials

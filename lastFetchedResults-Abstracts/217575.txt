Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in Iran.
Hypomethylation and/or hypermethylation of DNA have been described in Gastric
cancer and is presumed to be an early event in this process.
Objective: We hypothesized that Single nucleotide polymorphisms of DNMT1 gene
may be associated with the genetic susceptibility to Gastric cancer.
Methods: 200 patients and 200 controls, both with Iranian origin were studied.
Three polymorphisms were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. Allele frequencies and
genotypes were compared between the cases and controls. Odds ratios were
calculated and the interaction between polymorphisms, age and sex were
examined.
Results: There was no significant association between DNMT1 polymorphisms and
Gastric cancer.
Conclusion: We could not show any association between DNMT1 polymorphisms
and gastric cancer. Larger sets of polymorphisms and sample sizes are required to
test the possibility of association between polymorphisms of this gene and gastric
cancer.

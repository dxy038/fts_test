This paper introduced a spatial-temporal content- adaptive algorithm, which can precisely select an appropriate interpolation technique for high-quality deinterlacing according to the spectral, edge-oriented and statistical features of local video content. Our algorithm employs a linear-phase statistical- adaptive vertical-temporal filter to deal with generic video scenes and adopts a modified edge-based line-averaging interpolation to efficiently recover moving edges. In addition, annoying flickering artifacts are efficiently suppressed by a flickering detection and a field-averaging filter. As a result, our algorithm outperforms other non-motion compensated methods in terms of objective PSNR and reveals more impressive subjective visual quality.

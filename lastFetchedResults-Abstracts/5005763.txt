This paper presents a novel multi-objective operation planning model considering the transmission constraints and load characteristic of distribution system based on OPF. The problem is described as a multi-objective optimal power flow problem minimizing pool purchase cost and emission. The pool purchase cost and emission objectives are optimized individually in order to seek the extreme points of the trade-off surface and define the membership function of objective. Therefore, the multi-objective problem is reformulated into a new standard nonlinear problem by the fuzzy sets theory and max-min operator, and it can be solved by interior point method. While the ZIP load model is incorporated into the OPF, the demand is decreased due to the voltage sensitivity of load, therefore, the results of operation planning are modified by load characteristic of distribution power system. The simulation results for the IEEE 6-generator 30-bus System show the proposal model is effective to power system operation

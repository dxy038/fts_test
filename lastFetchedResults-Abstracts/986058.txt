The thermal design of multi-stream heat exchangers of the plate and fin type is presented. Although originally used in low temperature processes, their application is extrapolated to above temperature processes and it is shown that, conceptually, multi-stream exchangers could replace whole heat recovery networks. The approach is based on the use of temperature vs. enthalpy diagrams or composite curves, which show how a multi-stream exchanger can be subdivided into block sections that correspond to enthalpy intervals and indicate the entry and exit points of the streams. A design methodology for plate and fin exchangers in countercurrent arrangement, characterized by the maximization of allowable pressure as a design objective is extended to the design of multi-fluid exchangers. The methodology uses a thermo-hydraulic model which relates pressure drop, heat transfer coefficient and exchanger volume. The potential applicability of the methodology is demonstrated on a case study.

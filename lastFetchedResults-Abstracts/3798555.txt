This paper presents a coverage prediction model using the 2-D ray-tracing technique associated to a real-coded mono-objective Genetic Algorithm for optimizing the base station antenna location in an indoor environment. The model was applied in two examples of indoor scenarios to find the best location of the base station antenna by maximizing the lower electric field in the coverage area.

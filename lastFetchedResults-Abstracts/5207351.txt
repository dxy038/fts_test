We consider the problem of cross-layer resource allocation for single-hop, time-varying, wireless networks operating with rechargeable batteries under general arrival, channel and recharge processes. The objective is to maximize total system utility, as a function of the long-term rate achieved per link, while satisfying energy and power constraints. A policy with decoupled admission control and power allocation decisions is proposed that achieves asymptotic optimality for sufficiently large battery capacity to maximum power ratio (explicit bounds are provided). This policy is particularly suitable for satellite downlinks or sensor networks, which are most likely to satisfy the above condition. An extension to multihop networks is briefly described as well.

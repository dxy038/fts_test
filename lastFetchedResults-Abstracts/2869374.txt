Cooperative multiple-input-single-output (CMISO) introduces cooperative nodes (Coops) to reduce the energy consumption of the cluster head (CH) in cluster-based M2M capillary networks. Although CMISO reduces energy consumption of CH, it introduces additional energy overhead to Coops, which contributes to a reduction of network lifetime. In this paper, we propose a joint CH and Coops selection (JCCS) scheme with the objective of maximizing the network lifetime. An exhaustive search technique combined with merge-and-split operation based on Pareto order method is applied to select the best CH and Coops. Simulation results show that the proposed JCCS algorithm outperforms CMISO transmission with LEACH protocol in terms of network lifetime.

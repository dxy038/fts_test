<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Poly Cystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine condition that affects up to one fifth of the women of reproductive age. The overall prevalence of the depressive disorders has been shown to be about 12% in a large multi-centric study of obstetric-gynecologic patients. This study was designed to evaluate the distribution of depression and mental health status in women with PCOS.<strong><br />Materials and methods:</strong> This cross-sectional study was performed on 100 women with PCOS who were selected among patients attending the gynecologic and obstetric clinics of two referral centers. They completed Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). <br /><strong>Results:</strong> The prevalence of depression in women with PCOS was 45% according to BDI. According to GHQ-28, 30% of our patients were considered as possible cases of mental disorder. <br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> We found that the prevalence of depression was significantly high in women with PCOS. We believe that the treatment of PCOS must include psychological treatment to improve mental health status as well.</p>

Very often, huge uncertain information exists in multi-dimension multi-objective fuzzy optimum dynamic programming. Failure to take into consideration of this uncertain information will often lead to inaccurate results. Fully considering this kind of information, this paper proposes a multi-dimension multi-objective fuzzy optimum dynamic programming method under circumstances of complicated information.

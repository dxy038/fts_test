The use of multiple complex-valued Morse wavelets for the scalogram study of signals which are unidirectional at any time, but are bidirectional overall is considered. These wavelets are well-suited to identifying the forward and reverse components. Scalogram averaging which is possible due to the multiplicity of the complex-valued wavelets leads to a scalogram with reduced noise. Information from positive and negative scales can then be used to estimate a final "cleaned" scalogram. Quadrature Doppler ultrasound blood flow in the femoral artery is taken as an example to clearly illustrate the noise reduction.

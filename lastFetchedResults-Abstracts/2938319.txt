A fuzzy adaptive controller, which is able to solve the problems of classical adaptive controllers and conventional fuzzy adaptive controllers, is suggested in this paper. The suggested design method is applied to hybrid robot control. The architecture of a fuzzy adaptive controller using the robust property of a fuzzy controller is explained. A design procedure which can be carried out mathematically and systematically from the model of an objective system is suggested. This fuzzy adaptive controller is used in the control algorithm which is adaptive to the parametric uncertainty in hybrid force/position robot system, and its practicality is confirmed by an experiment on hybrid force/position robot system

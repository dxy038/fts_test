This article focuses on the diatom assemblages and geochemical composition of sediment cores retrieved from the Pomeranian Bay. We also discuss similarities and differences in the diatom assemblages and the palaeogeographic development of nearby regions. Our main objective was to determine the characteristics and rate of the Littorina transgression in the Pomeranian Bay area. Sediments were divided into units based on differences in the distribution of diatom ecological groups and in geochemical ratios, such as Mg/Ca, Na/K and Fe/Mn. This study identified lacustrine sediments deposited during the time of the Ancylus Lake. This lacustrine-period sedimentation took place in a shallow lake under aerobic conditions. The record of the onset of marine environment dates to 8900â€“8300 cal BP and corresponds to the Littorina transgression. After about 8300 cal BP, sedimentation took place in a deeper marine environment with higher biogenic production and anaerobic conditions. The abrupt appearance of marine diatom species and increased geochemical salinity indicators reflect the large impact of the Littorina transgression on the Pomeranian Bay environment.

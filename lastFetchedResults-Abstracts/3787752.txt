A formulation of the optimal power flow problem to include the minimum emission objective is presented in this paper. Fuel cost and emissions such as NO<sub>x</sub> objectives are included in the formulation. Emissions can also be included as constraints. The trade-off relation between fuel cost and emissions is also studied in this paper. Optimizing the objective for a whole period of time of different time intervals and system demands while satisfying a maximum limit on a constraint, such as the total emissions produced in the whole period while minimizing fuel cost, or the total fuel cost while minimizing emissions, is also covered in the study


Background and Aims: The objective of this study was the development of a checklist for assessment of students&rsquo; clinical skills in the clinical oral medicine. The second aim was the assessment of stake holders&rsquo; satisfaction of this checklist in comparison to the routine global rating method.

Materials and Methods: The checklist was developed in an expert panel sessions and the validity and reliability of checklist were assessed by CVI and test-retest method, respectively. All students (n=66) were assessed in 2 groups, one with developed checklist and another with global rating. At the end of the session, the satisfaction&rsquo;s level of staff and students were analysized using Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney test and the mean scores of students were analysized using Paired T test.

Results: Content validity index (CV I) of checklist was 0.88. Reliability of checklist confirmed with high correlation coefficient (0.9). Staffs&rsquo; satisfaction had no significant difference between the two methods
(Wilcoxon P=0.06). The mean score of students who assessed by checklist was higher than global rating with no significant differences (P=0.06).

Conclusion: Regarding the higher students&rsquo; satisfaction from checklist and more attention to component of assessment and more objectivity of this method and also higher score in checklist, it seems that the use of a checklist is more proper method for assessing the students&rsquo; clinical skills.

The principal output of the research undertaken within the NWTM (Next Wave Technologies &amp; Markets) Care in the Community Centre is a well-being demonstrator designed to explore compelling new methodologies for the delivery of health and social care services. This paper reports on domain specific modelling (DSM). The DSM project is responsible for developing a quantifiable model of wellbeing in a number of vulnerable target groups, and identifying activities of daily living that are potentially affected by a deterioration in wellbeing. The well-being model developed within this project illustrates how complex interactions can occur between objective and subjective elements, and how the system design stages might be broken down to deal with this complexity.

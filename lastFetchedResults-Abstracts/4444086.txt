This work proposes a new method for approximating the Pareto front of a multi-objective simulation optimization problem (MOP) where the explicit forms of the objective functions are not available. The method iteratively approximates each objective function using a metamodeling scheme and employs a weighted sum method to convert the MOP into a set of single objective optimization problems. The weight on each single objective function is adaptively determined by accessing newly introduced points at the current iteration and the non-dominated points so far. A trust region algorithm is applied to the single objective problems to search for the points on the Pareto front. The numerical results show that the proposed algorithm efficiently generates evenly distributed points for various types of Pareto fronts.

As global considerations about the environment are on the increase, those working in the field of architecture have carried out many initiatives to protect the environment. The KGBCC (Korean Green Building Certification Criteria) was developed in 2000 in Korea and has operated since 2002. The Apartment for Good Living competition has been held since 1996 as social interest in green residences increases. The objective of this study is to suggest improvements and further direction for the KGBCC by comparison with resident satisfaction levels. For this study, a questionnaire about satisfaction levels was taken by residents of KGBCC-certified apartments and ‘Apartment for Good Living’-awarded apartment in Dongtan District, Hwasung City, Gyeonggi-do, Korea. The survey results were compared and analyzed, and the comparison results of both apartment and the improvement direction of KGBCC were verified.

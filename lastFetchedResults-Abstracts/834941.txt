The objective of the paper is to advance a code for calculating the behaviour of aerosol-shaped fission products (FP) in the primary circuit of a nuclear reactor. This FP may come into the circuit from the fuel during a severe accident. The paper is focused on development of models for predicting the deposition and coagulation rates of aerosols. Comparisons of model predictions with experimental data and direct numerical simulations are discussed.

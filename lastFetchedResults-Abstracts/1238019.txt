In this paper, a general procedure is developed to find all non-dominated solutions of the multi objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problem. This procedure is based on the elastic constraints method and applies the identification of objective's bounds for it. The bounds of objectives are determined by solving single objective integer programming problems. First, the elastic constraints method is performed on a bi-objective and tri-objective problem respectively, then it is developed on a general multi objective integer programming (MOIP) problem. In this paper, a numerical example such as tri-objective assignment problem is presented to clear the proposed method.

Genetic algorithm has emerged as a successful tool for optimization problems. Previously, we proposed a task allocation model to maximize the reliability of a distributed computing system (DCS) using a genetic algorithm. Our objective is to use the same simple genetic algorithm to minimize the turnaround time of the task given to the DCS for execution and then to compare the resultant allocation with the allocation of maximal reliability as obtained by Vidyarthi et al. (2001). Comparisons of both the algorithms are made by illustrated examples and appropriate comments.

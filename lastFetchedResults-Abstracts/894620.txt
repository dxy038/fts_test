Abstract
The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of the oil shocks caused by
crude oil supply and demand on stock returns of Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE). For this
purpose, a Structural Vector Autoregressive model (SVAR) has been estimated based on
the monthly data (1991 to 2010) including world crude oil supply, world demand for
industrial products, real price of the crude oil and real stock returns in TSE variables.
Fluctuations of the real price of the crude oil are attributed to three structural shocks:
World crude oil supply shocks, world crude oil demand shocks and world industrial
products demand shocks. Furthermore, effects of these shocks on the real stock returns of
TSE have been studied in this study. The results show that the oil supply shock has no
significant impact on the stock returns, but the global demand shock and the oil specific
demand shock have a significantly positive impact on the Stock Returns of Tehran Stock
Exchange (TSE).

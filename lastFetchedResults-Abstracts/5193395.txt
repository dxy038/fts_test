This paper proposes a MAC protocol for information discovery in ubiquitous networks. The proposed protocol is based on proactive discovery in which wireless devices periodically send advertisement broadcasts. The objective of the protocol is to provide the specified discovery time of the single-hop neighbors in a mobile ad hoc network. Since collisions in wireless network degrade performance on the discovery time, a node selects an adequate broadcast rate considering the network topology. In this paper, we show that using information about the number of neighbors in combination with framed Aloha scheme can provide the specified discovery time. We also consider a simple basic power saving mechanism which allows significantly reduce the power consumption

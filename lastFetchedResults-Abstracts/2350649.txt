The goal of this paper is to propose, build and test an abrasion apparatus that will allow the investigation of tumbling mill steel media abrasive friction and wear as a function of the energies/forces acting in abrasion in a given mill. The following development is based on the possibility of estimating energy/force spectra in abrasion by using a discrete element charge motion model for mill simulation. The objective of the abrasion test is to develop forces in abrasion similar to those estimated in an industrial mill and determined from DEM charge motion simulations. The paper describes the test developed based on the ASTM G65 abrasive wheel test and standard where applied forces are increased and the abrasion wheel torque is measured. Initial tests explore abrasion behaviour using Ottawa foundry sand as the abrasive medium and two steels (1018, 1045). Test results look at abrasive wear over a range of applied forces, wheel rotation speeds, energies as well as wheel torque. Wheel torque is used to determine the friction coefficient over these test conditions. Future tests will look at the effect of various ore types on abrasive friction and wear of mill steel media.

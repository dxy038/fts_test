In this paper, an optimization model based on Prony analysis is proposed for the parameter optimization of FACTS devices, so as to damp the inter-area low frequency oscillation in the power system. The dominant mode damping ratio derived from Prony analysis as the optimization objective is introduced and an amplify ratio constraint is also included. To handle the nonlinearity of the optimization model, an improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is developed, in which a chaos operation is introduced to increase PSO population diversity and prevent the algorithm being trapped into local optima. Simulation results from IEEE 4-machine and 11-bus system preliminarily illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

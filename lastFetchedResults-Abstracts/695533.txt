Odors are a common occurrence at wastewater treatment plants, biosolids processing facilities and biosolids recycling locations. Accurate, objective measurement techniques are needed to monitor emissions, to develop new waste handling procedures and to reduce the production of the volatile gases. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of solid phase microextraction for measuring common odorants that are found in biosolids facilities. The odorants were collected and concentrated by solid phase microextraction (SPME) and then quantified by gas chromatography with detection by mass spectrometry. A 75-Î¼m Carboxen-Polydimethylsiloxane coating was used for the analysis of trimethylamine, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide and methyl mercaptan. Gaseous standards were generated for individual compounds and for dry and wet mixture from permeation apparatus. The differences in sensitivity between fibers, the competition between analytes and water vapor for the active sites on the fiber and the lack of production of artifacts make SPME suited for qualitative analysis and enables quick screening for the identification of compounds with adverse organoleptic characteristics.

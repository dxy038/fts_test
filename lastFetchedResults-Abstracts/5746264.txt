Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) is an international standardisation organisation for space data systems. It has been developing standard recommendations for the space communication networks. CCSDS is about to propose a new file transfer protocol for use both in space and ground based networks, named CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP). The main objective of CFDP is to overcome most of the difficulties in using terrestrial file transfer protocol in space link environment. The CNES, as one of the active participants in CCSDS, has successfully developed CFDP and demonstrated its utility for space use. This paper presents the organisation of CFDP and its reference scenarios. Then the CNES implementation of CFDP is described. The protocol description consists of the generation of the state transition diagram, different acknowledgement scheme recognitions, and quality of services. Finally, the paper discusses how the protocol is validated on a local area network using the CNES implemented space link simulator

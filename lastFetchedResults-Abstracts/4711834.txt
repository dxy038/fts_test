Based on the detailed discussion on the corresponding serial theories, the objective of our research design is to investigate how supply chain collaboration contributes to a retail company´s competitive strategy. We should plan to examine the critical elements of the value chain for a retailer to achieve cost leadership and seek to find answers to how a retailer can utilize collaboration in these critical elements of the value chain. The survey will be executed among the major retail companies in four countries of varying retail environments, and the results are expected to bring further light into the operational aspects of utilizing collaboration in supply chain to achieve and maintain a cost/price leadership position in the highly competitive retail markets of today.

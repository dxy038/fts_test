In multimodal presentations the perceived audiovisual quality assessment is significantly influenced by the content of both the audio and visual tracks. Based on our earlier subjective quality test for finding the optimal trade-off between audio and video quality, this paper proposes a novel method for relative multimodal complexity analysis to derive the fusion parameter in objective audiovisual quality metrics. Audio and video qualities are first estimated separately using advanced quality models, and then they are combined into the overall audiovisual quality using a linear fusion. Based on carefully designed auditory and visual features, the relative complexity analysis model across sensory modalities is proposed for deriving the fusion parameter. Experimental results have demonstrated that the content adaptive fusion parameter can improve the prediction accuracy of objective audiovisual quality metrics, compared to the fusion parameters obtained from the subjective quality tests using other known optimization methods.

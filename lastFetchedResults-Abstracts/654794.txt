The major objective of this research was to find the appropriate mix ratio of organic amendments for enhancing diesel oil degradation during contaminated soil composting. Sewage sludge or compost was added as an amendment for supplementing organic matter for composting of contaminated soil. The ratios of contaminated soil to organic amendments were 1:0.1, 1:0.3, 1:0.5, and 1:1 as wet weight basis. Target contaminant of this research was diesel oil, which was spiked at 10,000 mg/kg sample on a dry weight basis. The degradation of diesel oil was significantly enhanced by the addition of these organic amendments relative to straight soil. Degradation rates of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and n-alkanes were the greatest at the ratio of 1:0.5 of contaminated soil to organic amendments on wet weight basis. Preferential degradation of n-alkanes over TPH was observed regardless of the kind and the amount of organic amendments. The first order degradation constant of n-alkanes was about twice TPH degradation constant. Normal alkanes could be divided in two groups (C10–C15 versus C16–C20) based on the first order kinetic constant. Volatilization loss of TPH was only about 2% of initial TPH. Normal alkanes lost by volatilization were mainly by the compounds of C10 to C16. High correlations (r=0.80–0.86) were found among TPH degradation rate, amount of CO2 evolved, and dehydrogenase activity.

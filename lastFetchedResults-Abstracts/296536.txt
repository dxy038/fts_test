Objective
To investigate the influence of hair follicle dermal papilla cells (DPCs) on biological features of composite skin.
Methods
In the test group, xenogeneic acellular dermal matrix was employed as the frame, DPCs were seeded on the subcutaneous side, and epithelial stem cells onto the dermal papilla side of the dermal frame so as to construct a composite skin. In the control group, there was no DPC in the frame. The two kinds of composite skin were employed to cover skin defects on the back of the nude mice. Wound healing was observed 4 weeks after grafting and area was analyzed and contraction rate was calculated. The tissue samples in the grafted area were harvested for HE staining and the state of the composite skin was observed. The stress–strain curve of the sampled skin was measured, so as to calculate the maximal breaking power of the sample. The data were collected and statistically analyzed.
Results
HE staining indicated that the epithelial depth was increased (more than 10 layers of cells) in test group, with only 6–7 layers in control group. The skin contraction rate in test group on the 4th week after skin grafting (3.94 ± 0.013)% was much lower than that in control group (29.07 ± 0.018)% (P < 0.05). It was indicated by biomechanical test that the stress–strain curve of the composite skin in the test group was closer to that of normal nude mice skin in comparison to that in control group. The maximal breaking force of the composite skin in test group was (1.835 ± 0.035) N (Newton), while that in control group was (1.075 ± 0.065) N (P < 0.01).
Conclusion
Reconstruction of epidermis in composite skin was promoted by dermal DPCs seeded in the dermal matrix frame. As a result, there was less skin contraction in the composite skin with DPCs, so that the biological characteristics of the skin were improved.

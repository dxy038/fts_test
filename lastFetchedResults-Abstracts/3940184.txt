Reuse methodologies are now widely used to design digital circuits. They are based on the concept of intellectual property (IP), or virtual block of computing, characterized by a behavioral model, synthesizable or not. The design reuse for analog integrated systems is much less natural and less standardized. This paper addresses the issue of an analog design flow based on reuse, focusing on three key issues: the formal content of the IP block, the design of a reusable analog IP, and the organization of a design flow centered on an IP library. After a conceptual overview, this paper presents the methodological principles and details examples with a tutorial intention. The objective is to guide the designer involved in the process of developing analog IPs and corresponding design flow. This method is inspired by platform-based design and adapted here on an original case study: the design of full-custom neuromimetic integrated circuits, built from specific analog computational blocks. The development of reusable IPs represents an additional effort, mainly for behavioral modeling and characterization. Nevertheless, the steps illustrated in this case study show that the extra time provides a definite advantage to future design projects.

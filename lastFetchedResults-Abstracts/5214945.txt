Two main problems in wireless communications are (1) limited available spectrum and (2) inefficiency in the spectrum allocation policy. These problems lead to the blocking of both initial and hand-off calls. We propose a spectrum allocation scheme in two phases. In the first phase, a collision between two calls for spectral band allocation is resolved. In second phase, spectral band allocation among a number of calls is considered. The main objective for the schemes is to minimize the forced termination of hand-off calls and an opportunistic spectrum channel allocation is achieved by assigning different priority levels to different calls.

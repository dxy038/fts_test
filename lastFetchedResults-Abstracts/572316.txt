ABSTARCT: Line bisection task is a clinical task that its reliability and validity to assess right and left hemisphere functioning is considered by neuropsychologists. The purpose of present study was to determine the performance differences in male substance abusers when they use left and right hand to bisect the lines. Neuroligically normal individuals tend to bisect lines to the left of the midpoints but the results of this study showed that  substance abusers tend to bisect lines to the right of the objective midline when use their right hand. Based on the more right bias, it was concluded that right ward errors are results of left dominant hemisphere related to risk-taking behaviors and sensation seeking trait in substance abusers.

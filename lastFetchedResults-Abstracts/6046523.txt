Objective: To study the expression of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and the angiopoietin receptor (Tie-2) in colorectal cancer tissue, and analyze the correlation between their expression levels in colorectal cancer tissue and the histological differentiation of colorectal cancer; and to discuss their roles in the progression of colorectal cancer to provide new targets for the clinical treatment of colorectal cancer. Methods: The immunohistochemical S-P and RT-PCR methods were used to detect the expression of Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie-2 proteins and mRNA in the colorectal cancer tissue. Results: The expression of Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie-2 in the cancer tissues with poor, moderate and high histological differentiation indicated that the lower the tumor differentiation, the higher the expression of protein and RNA (P&lt;;0.05). Conclusion: The expression levels of Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie-2 are positively correlated with the progression of colorectal cancer.

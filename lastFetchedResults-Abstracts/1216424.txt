The objective of the present investigation is to analyze the influence of profile of blast furnace on the burden motion and stress field through 3D-DEM (three-dimensional discrete element method). It is clarified that the decrease of shaft angle speeds up the velocity of burden descending and decreases normal stress between particles or particle and wall. This change is good for the smooth operation of blast furnace. However, ore and coke would be mixed for the too small shaft angle (75°), which would influence the permeability in blast furnace. Thus, the appropriate shaft angle is around 80°. Decrease of bosh angle prevents the burden descending motion and increases normal stress between particles and bosh wall. Meanwhile, maximum normal stress acting on the wall moves from belly wall to bosh wall in the case of 68° bosh angle, which accelerates abrasion of refractory in bosh by friction force between particles and wall. Although burden descends smoothly in the case of 88° bosh angle, room is not enough for the ascending heated gas flow. Thus, the appropriate bosh angle is about 78°.

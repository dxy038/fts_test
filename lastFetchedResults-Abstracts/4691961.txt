This work presents a CSCL case study, for evaluating the Collage editor (an IMS-LD compliant authoring tool for collaboration scripts). 21 postgraduate students were guided to work in dyads and design their own CLFP-based collaboration scripts using Collage editor. The study objective was to provide additional evaluation data regarding the usability and efficiency of Collage editor as a tool for supporting beginner CSCL script designers. Students evaluated Collage as a user-friendly and intuitive tool (even for non-experienced users), while also suggesting a number of additions that could further improve its pedagogical usefulness and flexibility.

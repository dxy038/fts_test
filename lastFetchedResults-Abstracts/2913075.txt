The TELEMED-Project R0186, being funded under the RACE III European Community cooperative programme, will establish an extensive working communication network between widely dispersed medical experts and medical data resources within Europe until the end of 1992. The overall objective of the TELEMED-Project is to examine the problems which arise when participating physicians communicate over IBCN. The features and requirements specified are analysed in particular, so that an overall cooperative diagnosis and therapy can be realized as an application pilot now. In addition, the consequences of the corresponding organisation and operation of these services on the clinic work, legal, ethical and administrative issues must be examined

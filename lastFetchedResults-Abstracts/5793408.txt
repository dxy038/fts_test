In this paper, a new circularly-polarized antenna consisting of a circular wide-slot loaded by three radial metal strips is designed. By adjusting the proper position and length of each strip using optimization procedure of constrained multi-objective genetic algorithm combined with simulation software, the axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of the antenna along the normal vector is broadened, and the 13.9% common bandwidth for 1 dB AR and -10 dB return loss (RL) is achieved. Furthermore, the AR deteriorated with angle at different frequencies are displayed and studied.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to study prospectively the pregnancy outcome after first-trimester exposure to fluconazole, an effective antifungal agent teratogenic in animals. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a prospective cohort study of women who contacted three Italian teratogen information services. We compared the pregnancy outcomes of 226 women exposed to fluconazole with that of 452 women exposed to nonteratogenic agents, with use of logistic regression to control for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among the 226 pregnancies exposed to fluconazole there were 22 miscarriages, 1 stillbirth, and 7 infants with congenital anomalies. The prevalence of these outcomes and of neonatal growth parameters and the rate of neonatal complications were similar to those in the reference group. Women in the fluconazole group had a fivefold increased occurrence of induced abortions. CONCLUSIONS: First-trimester exposure to fluconazole does not appear to increase the prevalence of miscarriages, congenital anomalies, and low birth weight. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1996;175:1645-50.)

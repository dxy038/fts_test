A Lidar IN-situ Comparison (LINC) experiment was conducted at Bondville, IL during the second half of August and September 1999. A primary objective of LINC was to compare aerosol extinction and backscatter properties remotely sensed by lidar and in-situ sampled with a suite of instruments featuring a new 180&#176; backscatter nephelometer. The LINC experiment featured the use of two micro-pulse lidar (MPL) systems provided on loan from NASA Langley Research Center. Assistance in readying the lidars for deployment plus the loan of a slant-path mirror system was provided by the MPL research group at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. One of the MPLs was operated horizontally and aligned on the in-situ sampler inlet to permit lidar extinction. The second MPL was fitted with the moveable mirror system to enable vertical and slant-angle measurements. This paper reports first-look results of aerosol extinction retrievals from selected horizontal lidar measurements as well as vertical profiles from the second MPL system that demonstrate the variable structure of the atmospheric mixing-layer

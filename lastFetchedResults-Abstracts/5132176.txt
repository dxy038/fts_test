The traditional approach in an electrical power system is to have centralized large capacity power plants feeding power to distant load centers through an extensive transmission and distribution network. DG emerged as an alternative to upgrade transmission lines and increase the capacity of remote power plants. The connection of DG to a Distribution system meets the various challenges like power quality issues, contingency issues, voltage regulation etc. This paper proposes a technique by which a DG can provide voltage supported to the Distribution system by injecting reactive power in addition to real power. In this paper, separate Wind Turbine, Fuel cells based generation systems have been considered. These energy sources are coupled to an induction generator, which is interfaced to the grid through a rectifier inverter pair. The objective is to inject scheduled amount of real and reactive powers in the grid while maintaining the balance between input and output power. A separate Fuzzy controller has been incorporated to regulate the fuel input of fuel cells to compensate the changes in load demand. Normally wind turbine based DG injects the real power in the grid depending upon the prevailing wind speed. In this case DG remains unaffected by the variation in the load demand and the surplus power is fed by the utility itself. The simulations have been performed using MATLAB/SIMULINK.

Objective The purpose of our study was to assess the
knowledge, social distance and perception of social discrimination
towards persons with schizophrenia in the
general adult population of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Methods One thousand two-hundred fifty-four persons
were surveyed at different neighborhoods of the city of
Buenos Aires. Their knowledge about schizophrenia, personal
social distance and perception of social discrimination
were assessed with several questions. Afterwards, a
scale for each one of these measures was built.
Results Almost half of the general population believed
that patients with schizophrenia suffer from split personality
and that most of them are dangerous and violent.
Knowledge about schizophrenia in the general population
was moderate and it was associated with age and education.
Almost 80% of the population had less than one-third
of the maximum possible social distance score, but their
perception of social discrimination was high. Social distance
was greater in the elderly. Knowledge was correlated
weakly with social distance. Respondents directly related
with patients suffering from schizophrenia were more
knowledgeable about the illness, but had the same social
distance and perception of social discrimination than the
rest of the general population.
Conclusions The persons surveyed felt their own attitudes
are more favorable to people with schizophrenia than
‘most other people’s’ attitudes. The elderly should be
specifically addressed in specially designed anti-stigma
campaigns.

The objective of this study was to determine whether the weight of a vibrating handheld object influenced the perceived intensity of its vibrations. Experiments were conducted to determine the subjective equivalence of vibrotactile intensity for objects that had the same size but had different weights. The results suggest that for the same surface acceleration and hence the same movement, the heavier is the device, the stronger is the perceived intensity

This interim report describes investigation of leading software development tools used in development of aviation systems. It is a part of three-year effort with the ultimate objective to provide guidelines for a potential tool qualification. The hypothesis is that the tool qualification allows the developing organizations reduce the effort required to verify the artifacts produced by the tool. The saving on costly verification process is an incentive for pursuing tool qualification.

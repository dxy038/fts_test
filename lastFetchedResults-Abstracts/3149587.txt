Polarized Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (PBRDF) is one of the most important factors used to represent the property of the surface. Because there is complex nonlinear relationship between the experimental results and model parameters, genetic algorithm is used to retrieve the model parameters. One drawback of the traditional genetic algorithm is that the convergence speed is slow and easy to fall into the local minimization. On the base of the traditional genetic algorithm to retrieve the parameters, simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is used to optimize the modeling of the PBRDF. The model for PBRDF and the designation of the hybrid algorithm is given in detail. For one typical painted surface, both the experiment results and the model calculation results are given. The calculation results of the model are demonstrated consistent well with the experimental results. The error convergence curve shows that, the hybrid genetic algorithm can avoid falling into the local minimization, and shorten the running time for the target function. Therefore, it is applicable used as a reference for target feature extraction and recognition in the future.

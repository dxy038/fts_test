Objective: Glycodelin is an endometrial protein proposed to play an important role in embryonic implantation. We examined the effects of progestins and relaxin on glycodelin transcription, synthesis, and secretion. Study Design: Northern blotting, metabolic labeling, and fluorography were used to assess glycodelin messenger ribonucleic acid and protein synthesis in endometrial tissue and cells. Luciferase reporter constructs transfected into endometrial adenocarcinoma cells (Ishikawa cells) were used to determine whether progestins or relaxin could activate the glycodelin gene promoter. Results: Progestins but not relaxin stimulated glycodelin secretion in primary epithelial cell cultures. A 452–base pair fragment of the glycodelin gene promoter was activated 4.3 ± 0.7 times normal by 10-nmol/L promegestone; however, addition of relaxin to the same construct repressed progestin-stimulate promoter activation by >30%. Conclusion: Glycodelin transcription, synthesis, and secretion by endometrial epithelial cells were stimulated by progestins. However, relaxin failed to stimulate production of this immunomodulatory protein and, in fact, repressed progestin-stimulated activation of the glycodelin gene promoter.

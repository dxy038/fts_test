The influences of pH, sorption time and adsorbent dose(the effect of temperature on the removal and sorption capacity is negligible in the test) were investigated in batch experiments, and the removal of Cu<sup>2+</sup> and sorption capacity with modified sepiolites(MSs) were compared to those with original sepiolites(OSs). With the initial Cu<sup>2+</sup> concentration 50 mg/L at pH 10, the removal of Cu<sup>2+</sup> was 93.6% in 5h with 40g/L MSs by 0.8M HCI solution. The equilibrium process was described well by the Langmuir isotherm model with maximum sorption capacities of Cu<sup>2+</sup> on MSs. Good correlation coefficient was obtained for the pseudo second-order kinetic model. In the end, some tungsten mine wastewater containing low concentration of Cu<sup>2+</sup> was treated by MSs. It could be proposed that MSs by 0.8M HCI are an effective adsorbent for the removal of Cu<sup>2+</sup> from wastewater. Meanwhile, Our objective is to search a kind of low-cost adsorbent as a replacement for costly conventional methods of removing heavy metal ions(Cu<sup>2+</sup>) from wastewater with sepiolites, to improve the utilization ratio of sepiolites and to pursue a new approach for environmental protection and recycle treatment of mineral materials. Study on the associative methods for MSs and advanced treatment which should be strengthened will offer the theoret- cal foundation for the practical application.

With the rapid growth of the Internet, traditional broadcasters are under severe pressure from their competitors. In order to enhance their competitiveness, broadcasters need to provide not only traditional linear broadcast services but also new tri-play services. Traditional terrestrial broadcast systems need to be upgraded to next generation broadcast wireless (NGB-W) systems, where terrestrial broadcast and bidirectional access can be seamlessly converged. The usage scenarios and system requirements of NGB-W systems are analyzed. The challenges and trends of NGB-W systems are discussed, with focuses on terrestrial broadcast techniques and upper layer protocol stacks for NGB-W systems.

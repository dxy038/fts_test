THE AVAILABILITY of high-current semiconductor rectifying devices, high-grain magnetic amplifiers, transistors, and semiconductor diodes prompted this development. The practical objective of this design was to develop a rectifier of 10-kw rating that could compete with a motor-generator set and its controls for use by the Bell System. Higher efficiency and a reduction in over-all size over rectifiers of earlier design were the major inducements.

Background Mathematical models describing
the epidemiology of major depression are potentially
useful for epidemiological analyses, as decision
support tools and in economic analyses.The objective of
this project was to develop a Markov model based on
epidemiological theory that may be useful for decision
analysis and health services research. Methods Longitudinal
data from a Canadian national survey, the National
Population Health Survey (NPHS),were used.The NPHS
has collected longitudinal data on a cohort of 17,262
subjects since 1994. The analysis employed a Markov
tunnel in order to model the dependence of recovery
probabilities on episode duration. Results Episode incidence
ranged between 6.2 % per year in women under 35
to 0.26 % in men over the age of 65.A greater proportion
of subjects over 35 years old reported episodes lasting
more than 26 weeks. The probability of recovery declined
with increasing episode duration, independently
of sex.Under steady-state assumptions, a Markov model
integrating these parameters predicted a point prevalence
of approximately 2% in women and 1% in men
under the age of 55. In older age groups, the predicted
point prevalence declined in both sexes. Conclusions
These models support the hypothesis that sex differences
in major depression prevalence are due primarily
to differences in incidence rather than episode length.
These results also indicate that there is no meaningful
“central tendency” describing the distribution of
episode length in major depression episode. Estimates
of mean episode duration represent an intermixing of
frequent brief episodes with infrequent protracted
episodes.This finding may have important policy implications.

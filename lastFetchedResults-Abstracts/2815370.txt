In this paper, we introduce a full fiber-to-the-home system architecture. The introduced system is used to obtain a system bit rate of 10 Gbps and 20 Gbps downstream and 5 Gbps and 10 Gbps upstream. Wavelength division multiplexing passive optical network technique is used to share the overall bandwidth between 32 users with 0.8 nm spacing between each user. To reduce the overall cost of the proposed system, the bidirectional subcarrier multiplexed technique is used at the optical network unit to avoid using any optical laser sources at the receiver side for upstream data transmission. Quality factor, bit error rate, and eye diagrams are derived for different pulse shapes then used to compare the results in order to select the best pulse shape that gives the best performance. The pulse shapes used in this paper are non-return to zero, return to zero, saw-up, triangle, raised cosine, and hyperbolic-secant pulses. The results demonstrates that the non-return to zero pulse shape at bit rate of 20 Gbps at both downstream and upstream data transmission leads a high quality factor. Furthermore, at 10 Gbps return to zero is selected at the transmission side and hyperbolic-secant at the optical network unit.

Research on rainwater and greywater have been performed all over the world as a way of promoting potable water savings. The main objective of this article is to evaluate the potential for potable water savings by using rainwater and greywater in two houses in southern Brazil. An economic analysis is performed to evaluate the benefits of using rainwater and greywater either separately or together. Results indicate that the potential for potable water savings in both houses range from 33.8% (house B) to 36.6% (house A), considering that water for toilet flushing and washing machine does not need to be potable. By using rainwater, the potable water savings in house A would be 35.5% and in house B, 33.6%. When greywater is considered alone, potable water savings are lower, i.e., 30.4% in house A and 25.6% in house B. As for the use of rainwater and greywater combined, the potable water savings are 36.4% in house A and 33.8% in house B. The three systems that were investigated seem not to be cost effective as the payback periods were very high (above 17 years), but the greywater system was the most attractive one. The main conclusion that can be made from the research is that there needs to be government incentives in order to promote the use of rainwater or greywater in houses in southern Brazil.

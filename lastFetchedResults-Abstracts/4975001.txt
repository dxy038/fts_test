Paper presents simulation study of bidirectional Z-source inverter designed and applied as interface between three phase grid and energy storage. The idea of Z-source inverter improvement into bidirectional converter is described as well as operation principles and appropriate PWM methods. Author presents design issues and suitable control algorithm, illustrated by results of SABER simulation tests of 230V/5kVA Z-source inverter model.

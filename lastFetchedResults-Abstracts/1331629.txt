It seems using the Maxwell-Stefan (M-S) diffusion model in combination with the vacancy solution
theory (VST) and the single-component adsorption data provides a superior, qualitative, and
quantitative prediction of diffusion in zeolites. In the M-S formulation, thermodynamic factor (?) is
an essential parameter which must be estimated by an adsorption isotherm. Researchers usually utilize
the simplest form of adsorption isotherms such as Langmuir or improved dual-site Langmuir, which
eventually cannot predict the real behavior of mixture diffusion particularly at high concentrations of
adsorbates because of ignoring nonideality in the adsorbed phase. An isotherm model with regard to
the real behavior of the adsorbed phase, which is based on the vacancy solution theory (VST) and
considers adsorbate-adsorbent interactions, is employed. The objective of this study is applying
vacancy solution theory to pure component data, calculating thermodynamic factor (?), and finally
evaluating the simulation results by comparison with literature. Vacancy solution theory obviously
predicts thermodynamic factor better than simple models such as dual-site Langmuir.

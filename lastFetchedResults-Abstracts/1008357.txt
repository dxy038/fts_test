Poly(hexamethylene terephthalate) (PHT)/carbon nanotubes (CNT) nanocomposites containing 1% and 3% (w/w) of filler were prepared by two procedures: in situ ring-opening polymerization of hexamethylene terephthalate cyclic oligomers in the presence of CNT and melt blending of PHT/CNT mixtures. Arc discharge multiwalled carbon nanotubes, both pristine (MWCNT) and hydroxyl functionalized (MWCNT-OH), were used. The objective was to evaluate the effect of preparation procedure, nanotube side-wall functionalization and amount of nanotube loaded on properties of PHT. All nanocomposites showed an efficient distribution of the carbon nanotubes within the PHT matrix but interfacial adhesion and reinforcement effect was dependent on both functionalization and nanotubes loading. Significant differences in thermal stability and mechanical properties ascribable to functionalization and processing were observed among the prepared nanocomposites. All the prepared nanocomposites showed enhanced crystallizability due to CNT nucleating effects although changes in melting and glass transition temperatures were not significant.

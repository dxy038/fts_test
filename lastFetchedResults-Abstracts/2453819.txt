Fusion experimental reactors are a major step toward realization of fusion energy production by commerical reactors. The key objective is to demonstrate the scientific and technological feasibility prior to the demo fusion reactors. The ITER (international thermonuclear experimental reactor) is an experimental reactor and the engineering design has been initiated by the united efforts of the USA, EC, RF, and Japan after completion of the conceptual design activity. Since the reactor core components are activated by the D–T operation, advanced remote handling technologies are inevitably required for assembly and maintenance of the components under the radiation conditions. The key issues to be developed for the remote handling system are radiation hardening over 107 R h−1, precise position—posture control for handling heavy components without the interference in a limited reactor space, and tools for connection—disconnection and inspection. For this purpose, extensive technology developments in parallel with the engineering design are being conducted domestically and internationally through the ITER framework. This paper outlines both an overview of the remote handling system required for fusion experimental reactors and the recent status of remote handling technology development being conducted in Japan, EC and USA.

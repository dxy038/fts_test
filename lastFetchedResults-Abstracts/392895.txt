Objective
We describe four cases of medial meatal fibrosis, a rare condition of the external auditory canal, in which hearing improved following surgery.
Methods
Four patients with medial meatal fibrosis underwent surgical treatment and had been followed at the University of Tokyo during the last 5 years. We examined hearing improvement and recurrence. A patient had graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with her urethra and vagina, and two patients had methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection with their affected ears.
Results
All cases got hearing improvement without any major complications.
Conclusions
Medial meatal fibrosis may be treated satisfactory with surgical interventions.

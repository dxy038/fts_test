This work is directed towards a symbiotic architecture called Cognitive Relaying with Time Incentive (CRTI) for multiple Primary Users (PUs) in a Cognitive Radio network. The rationale of CRTI is that the PU with a weak transmission link seeks cooperation from the cognitive Secondary User (SU) nodes in its vicinity, and in return rewards them with an incentive time for their own communication. Since each PU has its own distinct bandwidth of operation, it is crucial to decide the most favorable use of the spectrum when relaying through the SU network. We propose two schemes-Band-Restricted Relaying and All-Band Relaying to achieve this objective. Cross-layer optimization problems are formulated for the relaying schemes which create the time incentive, as well as for the SUs to efficiently access this incentive. The proposed schemes are compared, and simulation results are furnished to demonstrate their differences and individual merits from the PU and SUÂ´s perspective.

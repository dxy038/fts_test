In France, within the framework of investigations of the feasibility of deep geological disposal of high-level radioactive waste, studies on corrosion products of steel over packs are ongoing. Such studies concern silica and radionuclide retention. The objective of the present work is to study sorption of silicic acid on compacted magnetite in percolation cells to attempt to simulate confined site conditions. Potentiometric titration of commercial magnetite was carried out with both dispersed and compacted magnetite. The titration of the magnetite suspension has been made with two different methods: a batch method (several suspensions) and a direct fast method (one suspension). The Gran’s function gave 1.7 (±0.4) and 2.4 (±0.5) sorption sites nm−2 with these respective methods but site densities as high as 20/nm2 could be obtained by modelling. The titration of magnetite compacted at 120 bars showed that the evolution of charge density on magnetite surfaces is similar for compacted and dispersed magnetite. Silicic acid sorption onto dispersed and compacted magnetite was similar with sorption site densities ranging between 2.2 and 4.4/nm2.

The comprehensive production arrangement is one of the optimal decision problems concerning the oil field development plan. It is a complex large scale system problem which includes multi-objectives and multi-factors and consists of many segments. For such a problem, we cannot do the research work segment by segment insolently. It is necessary to give a integrate study on the problem as a whole. Therefore, it is meaningful to find an effective method to solve the production arrangement problem as well as the development plan of an oil field. This thesis begins with the practical characteristics and importance of the oil field production arrangement. It gives then the description of present research situation of the oil field development plan. The research approaches and the characteristics of large-system theory are also presented. On this basis, the oil field production arrangement model is established. The model is resolved by means of decomposition &#8212; coordination principle of objective coordinate algorithm of large-system theory. In order to coordinate the demand of best output arrangement between the whole and each district of the oil field, it revised the objective function, and then, inferred the solution algorithm for the model.

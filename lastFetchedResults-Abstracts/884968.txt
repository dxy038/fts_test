Abstract
Introduction: Cervical cancer is the second most frequent cancer in women. The natural progression of cervical cancer, from pre- cancerous cell change to invasive disease, makes it one of the uniuqely preventable cancer that can be detected by screening (Pap smear, colposcopy) and treated before progression into invasive disease.  
Objective: Pathologic Findings of Endocervical Curettage in Routine Colposcopy in Abnormal Pap Smear
Materials and Methods: This cross- sectional discriptive study has been performed on 126 patients with abnormal pop smears who were refferd to maternity surgery in three different cities (Rasht, Uromieh, Mashhad). Demographic data and inspections of colposcopist, inclouded 1)Results of colposcopy and 2) results of cervical curretages as recorded in a questionnaire. Then, they were compared with endocervical curretage sampling. Pregnant patients with previous surgeries, gynecologic manipulations and patients with imperfect cases were excluded from the study.
Results: From all the cases, 94.4% had normal endocervical samples and 5.6% had abnormal ones. The highest incidence of abnormality belongs to the group with LSIL papsmear (low grade lesions in squamous endoepithelial cells). Therefore, it was not significant according to the statistical analysis. The results of endocervical curretages had no correlation with age, consent of colposcopy and pregnancy condition. But these results were significant for both groups (P < 0.01).
Conclusion: Considering the significant differences in the amount of abnormal endocervical curretages in the group with abnormal colposcopy versus the other group, curretage could be suggested in abnormal cases.

According to the principle of forecast feed forward compensation dynamic matrix control (DMC) and regarding its low calculating accuracy, bidirectional decoupling DMC is presented and applied in random long delay multi-input and multi- output (MIMO) networked control system (NCS) in this paper. This algorithm, therefore, expands the using field of DMC and resolves control problems in random long delay NCS. The feasibility and validity were finally demonstrated by the results of simulating experiments.

This paper concentrates on a slab designing problem for integrated steel production in which the downstream process constraint is taken into account. Considering the order demand specifications of the weight and width are interval values, and the weight of slab is fixed, a multi-objective mathematic programming model is formulated to minimize the quantity of slab, the total surplus weight and the quantity of slab specifications. A three-stage heuristic algorithm is proposed. The experimental results show the proposed model and algorithm are effective.

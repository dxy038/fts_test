For the principle of without duplication and redundancy, the attributes set to estimate the attempt is determined. The hierarchical structure model on estimating attack attempt is constructed, and the membership functions of attributes set are given. The subjective weight vector is calculated by binary comparison method, the objective weight vector is calculated by entropy method. With the introduction of adjustment coefficients, the integrated weight vector including subjective and objective weight is reasoned. The simulation and results show that the attack attempt estimating method is reasonable and effective, and can have reference value in threat assessment.

Objective: To identify which equation, Siri or Brozek, based on the two compartment model,
provides a more accurate conversion of body density (BD) in percent body fat (%BF) in a group of older
adults. Study design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Research Centre in Physical Activity, Health and Leisure,
Faculty of Sport, University of Porto. Participants: 60 older adults, aged 60-92 years. Measurements: Skinfold
thickness was used to estimate BD through Visser et al. prediction equation. The conversion of BD to %BF
was done with Siri (%BF-Siri) and Brozek (%BF-Brozek) formulas and these determined values were both
compared to Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (%BF-DXA) evaluations. Results: A strong correlation
between the %BF-DXA value and %BF-Siri (r=0.91, p<0.001) and %BF-Brozek (r=0.91, p<0.001) was found,
although %BF-Siri and %BF-Brozek overestimated %BF-DXA (p<0.001). The comparison of the %BF-Siri
and %BF-Brozek mean values also revealed significant differences (p<0.001). The %BF-Brozek reflects a
better agreement than the %BF-Siri with %BF-DXA with respectively a mean difference of -4.0%BF (limits of
agreement = -10.9 to 2.9%) and -5.7%BF (-12.6 to 1.2). The Bland and Altman plots confirmed that %BFBrozek
reflects a better agreement with %BF-DXA. Conclusion: The results of the present study show that the
use of Brozek equation may correspond to a more accurate alternative than Siri equation for the conversion of
BD in %BF in older adults

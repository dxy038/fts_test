13C NMR spectroscopy was employed for evaluating glucose and fructose isoforms content in Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena. With the use of reference spectra recorded in water for samples obtained with respect to set rules, a shift determination method for fructose carbon isoforms was introduced to determine the frauds present in unknown Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena samples. No sample preparation yields this approach highly reliable and time saving. Following this approach, for the first time, an objective analytical technique can be used alternatively to the actual procedures for Traditional Balsamic Vinegar certification.

   The objective of this experiment was to study an unknown disease which was encountered during rearing of Boophilus annulatus larvae originated from Mazandaran on a calf. Seven 3 to 6 month-old normal Iranian Holstein calves (expriment animals), 20 Holstein calves with similar age range and 30 adult Holstein cattle (field control animals); without history of infestation with ticks were studied. The calves No. 1, 2, 3 and 4 were experimentally infestated using the larvae of Boophilus annulatus in the first stage. Then, the blood of the diseased calves No. 3 and 4 invloved in maximum of fever was intavenously injected to the calves No. 5 and 6 respectively, which had not been diseased in the first stage of the study. Clinical examination, complete blood cell count, microbilogical culture of calves blood and treatment with some kinds of antibacterial agents were carried out. The clinical signs of the disease were recorded in each seven calves except for calf No.7 within 4 to 7 days after the infestation. Severe fever, rapid progressing anemia, leukopnea and neutropnea were observed in the diseased animals, which responded dramatically to sulphanamide+trimetoprime combination. The manifestation of rod and morula-like agents characteristically  similar to Anaplasma phagocytophila in cytoplasm of the neutrophills and also monocyts in the peak of fever and their disappearence after administration of the drug was the only etiological finding of the experiment. This study showed the agent of tick borne fever existed in Mazandarn, its relevent vector is Boophilus annulatus and had transovarial transmission.  The epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory aspects of the disease were completely similar to the disease inducable by Anaplasma phagocytophila infection. The diagnosis of the disease must be confirmed by additional serologic and particularly molecular biologic studies.

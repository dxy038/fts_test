Objective
To assess prevalence of cardinal signs and symptoms related to temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in subjects with shortened dental arches and to clarify the individual course of these signs and symptoms.
Methods

In this 9-year follow-up study, subjects with shortened dental arches (n = 74) were compared with subjects with complete dental arches (n = 72). Of three reported symptoms (pain, noises/clicking and restricted mobility of the lower jaw), and of two clinical signs (palpated clicking of the temporomandibular joint and restricted maximal mouth opening) estimates of mean scores were calculated by a mixed model. Suggested determinants for TMD (gender, time, bruxism, chewing side preference) were investigated by covariate analyses. Subjects with complete 9-year follow-up (shortened dental arches: n = 42; complete dental arches: n = 41) were described more detailed by frequency distributions, Pearson correlations of signs and symptoms, and fluctuation of the symptoms.
Results

Covariate analyses using the mixed model revealed no significant differences between the shortened and the complete dental arch groups (p > 0.05) with respect to symptoms and signs. Most prevailing effect was gender: females reported more frequently pain (p = 0.05) and noises/clicking (p = 0.03). Restricted mobility was significantly related with chewing side preference and bruxism habits (both: p = 0.01). In both groups, subjects with complete 9-year follow-up had low prevalence of serious symptoms and signs and symptoms fluctuated without demonstrable correlation.
Conclusion

In this 9-year follow-up, subjects with shortened dental arches had similar prevalence, severity, and fluctuation of signs and symptoms related to TMD compared to subjects with complete dental arches.

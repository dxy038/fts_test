Information Technology (IT) has touched and changed the lives of the younger generation in India in many ways but IT still has its role to play in making a significant impact to the quality of lives of the senior citizens of our country. This study is undertaken to address the objective of using technology to provide affordable health care and other essential services for senior citizens. This study will involve understanding the needs of the senior citizens in India and to find a way of using technology to improve their lives. The study will then focus on understanding how to design a system that will be accessible by virtually every senior citizen across the country. The aim of the research is to understand and specify the functional and technical requirements, explore the technology options available and help in concluding if cloud computing is the best technology option for designing the system to cater to the senior citizens.

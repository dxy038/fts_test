The objective of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) RiverEye program is to retrieve accurate river surface current values over a wide area using passive optical remote sensors. An extension of this program included a requirement to develop, construct and demonstrate a small Mid-Wave Infrared sensor package to be the payload for a small unmanned aerial vehicle. To meet the restrictions imposed by the payload limitations an innovative fast scanning mirror technology developed by Arete&#769; was used. A description of the innovative sensor package that comprises this transition capability is given along with the results of the demonstration flights and processing.

Current interest in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) has grown rapidly and can economically extend the boundaries of radio access networks. Recent research and developments indicate that MANETs will be a candidate in many private and public networks. Multihop radio access networks (MRANs) are access networks that provide Internet connectivity to the mobile nodes reside in an ad hoc network, MRANs increase the capacity of the network as well as improving the network coverage area. To provide network connection, more complexity will rise when mobility management extends to handle the location management of mobile nodes in an ad hoc network. The objective of this paper is to address new concepts in mobility management protocols for MRANs. This paper compares the handover performance in MRAN by means of simulation. We propose a generic signalling mechanism in MRANs that extends mobility management to support hybrid handovers. We also present an overhead comparison of proactive and reactive Internet connectivity mechanisms by means of simulation.

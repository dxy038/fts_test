This paper deals with comparisons between various coding schemes for the digital transmission of high quality sound signals typical of what will be transmitted through a Direct Broadcast Satellite System (DBS). Several PCM coding techniques using instantaneous logarithmic coding laws [1] (A-law and &#181;-law) or near-instantaneous coding law (block coding scheme) such as the NICAM 3 system [2] as well as the Adaptive Delta Modulation (ADM) [3] are compared in this paper. Several pre-emphasis/de-emphasis laws are also proposed to optimally shape the spectrum of the sound program signal before encoding [1]. An investigation of the properties of these laws is carried out and an evaluation, both objective and subjective, of the impact of their utilisation in a codec is presented.

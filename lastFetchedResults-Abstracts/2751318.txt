This paper proposes a single-stage three-phase-to-single-phase current-fed high step-up ac-dc matrix converter. The proposed converter inserts a boost-type matrix converter, which is formed by three boost inductors and six bidirectional switches, between a three-phase ac source and a Cockcroft-Walton voltage multiplier (CWVM). By using this topology associated with power factor correction technique, the proposed converter not only achieves almost unity power factor and sinusoidal input currents with low distortion but also obtains high voltage gain at the output end. Moreover, the matrix converter generates an adjustable-frequency and adjustable-amplitude current, which injects into the CWVM to regulate the dc output voltage and smooth its ripple. With this flexible injection current, the performance of the proposed converter is superior to the conventional CWVM, which is usually energized by a single-phase ac source. The operation principle, control strategy, and design considerations of the proposed converter are detailed in this paper. Finally, simulation and experimental results demonstrate the claims and validity of the proposed converter.

Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem in electrical power system is consider as a static, non-linear, multi-objective or a single objective optimization problem. As the power industrial companies have been moving in to a more competitive environment, OPF has been used as a tool to define the level of the inter utility power exchange. Basically, this research work provide a new approach to solve the single objective OPF problem considering critical objective function of reactive loss minimization for utility/industrial companies, while satisfying a set of system operating constraints, including constraints dedicated by the electrical network. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has been used for this purpose. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population based stochastic optimization technique. The system is initialized with a population of random feasible solutions and searches for optima by updating generations. The IEEE-30 bus system is considered throughout this research work to test the proposed algorithm.

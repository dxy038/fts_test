This paper is concerned with the stability and synthesis of fixed structure controllers satisfying robust multi-objective H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> performance for systems involving human-in-the-loop actuation. Closed loop robust stability conditions are studied for both sector-bounded and passive uncertainties. An iterative algorithm comprised of both genetic algorithms and semi-definite programming is presented for control synthesis purposes. This approach is used to design a 2-degree-of-freedom controller for an Electric power steering system. Experimental results using hardware-in-the-loop setup are given. The results indicate that the control design did satisfy the criteria for robust performance.

The temperature variation, phase transformation and phase-transformation plasticity are the main factors of inducing the initial strain in the quenching. In order to understand their effect on the residual stress of quenched part, a plane strain component is regarded as the study objective, and its FEM model is built. The effects of the initial strains on the quenching residual stresses are simulated using the self-developed FEM software. The stress components variation curves, the boundary displacements and the distortion of quenched part are given. The research results show that, the temperature reduction results in the uniform volume shrinkage of part, the phase transformation results in the uniform volume expansion of part, but the phase-transformation plasticity results in the unhomogeneous distortion of part.

Objective. Examine the neuromuscular response to functional knee bracing relative to anterior tibial translations in vivo.

Design. During randomised brace conditions, electromyographic data with simultaneous skeletal tibiofemoral kinematics were recorded from four anterior cruciate ligament deficient subjects to investigate the effect of the DonJoy Legend functional brace during activity.

Background. Knee braces do not increase knee stability but may influence afferent inputs from proprioception and therefore one might expect changes in muscle firing patterns, amplitude and timing.

Methods. Hoffman bone pins affixed with markers were implanted into the tibia and femur for kinematic measurement. The EMG data from the rectus femoris, semitendinosus, biceps femoris, and lateral head of the gastrocnemius were integrated for each subject in three separate time periods: 250 ms preceding footstrike and two consecutive 125 ms time intervals following footstrike.

Results. With brace, semitendinosus activity significantly decreased 17% prior to footstrike whereas bicep femoris significantly decreased 44% during A2, (P<0.05). Rectus femoris activity significantly increased 21% in A2 (P<0.05). No consistent reductions in anterior translations were evident.

Conclusion. Our preliminary findings, based on a limited number of subjects, indicate joint stability may result from proprioceptive feedback rather than the mechanical stabilising effect of the brace. Despite a significant increase in rectus femoris activity upon landing, only one subject demonstrated an increase in anterior tibial drawer.

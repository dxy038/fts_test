Objectives
The objective of this investigation was to determine the materials used in metallic post and core construction and investigate and the modes of failure that occurred resulting in post fracture.
Methods

Eighty-five fractured metal posts were clinically retrieved over a 5-year period. The tooth with the fractured post, and relevant clinical details were recorded. Investigation of the fractured posts was undertaken to determine their constituent elements and modes of fracture using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX).
Results

The results showed that 77% of the posts were cast and 23% wrought. The modes of fracture were ductile (67%) or brittle (52%) although some posts exhibited both within the same specimen. In addition, evidence of fatigue was present in 20% of posts and porosity in 48%.
Conclusions

A large variety of materials were used in the construction of post and cores although low-gold silverâ€“palladium alloy most commonly encountered. Their failure was predominantly ductile in nature although a significant amount of brittle fracture was also noted. Porosity within castings also appeared to be a contributory factor in some cases and this was particularly evident in high-palladium castings. Evidence of fatigue was noted in a minority of posts.

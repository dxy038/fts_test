A multi-objective optimization methodology is proposed which simultaneously considers the mechanical performance and the manufacturing cost from the early stage of design of composite laminated plates. Resin transfer molding process is chosen as the manufacturing process for its wide acceptance among industries. Interrelations between the structural parameters and the process parameters are identified. With proper assumptions, the multi-objective problem is formulated into a problem with a single objective function. As design variables, the stacking sequence of layers is investigated which minimizes the maximum displacement and the mold filling time. Injection gate location is also considered in order to minimize the mold filling time for a given structure geometry, material properties and loading condition. The genetic algorithm is adopted as the optimization scheme. The results from the sample problems illustrate usefulness of the developed methodology.

This paper addresses two issues related to a hypothetical division in the Canadian Forces Geomatics Organization, which is devoted to the production of information in support of the U.S. National Imaging and Mapping AgencyÂ´s (NIMA) Foundation Based Operations. First, the optimal configuration of the division is determined using queueing network and optimization principles. The second issue concerns the examination of the system behavior, given the system configuration. Bounding analysis, in classical queueing theory, is used to acquire insights into the problem. The contribution of the paper lies in the derivation of an alternative geomatics network architecture and the illustration that the L<sup>&#8734;</sup> norms on the expected steady-state waiting times between the two network representations, are equivalent. The objective of the revised architecture is that the theory of product-form solutions can be employed. In addition, the paper proposes a means to transform the nonlinear integer programming Internet protocol (IP) problem to a linear IP, using approximation techniques and pre-tabulated probability-related functions. Finally, in anticipation of the surge and volume of geomatics information in support of Joint Vision 2010, this workforce and workflow analysis is of utmost importance. This paper provides a timely contribution toward the resolution of some of these military organizational issues.

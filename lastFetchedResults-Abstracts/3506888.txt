It may sound like something out of a science fiction novel, but both NASA and private space companies are seriously discussing long-term off-world habitation. Under the current ´Vision for Space Exploration´, NASA plans to return astronauts to the Moon and then move on to the next challenge: Mars. 4Frontiers is a new company preparing for this challenge, developing strategies and technologies to be used in creating a permanent human presence on the red planet. While humans may not set foot on Mars for at least another decade, informative entertainment, Earth-based technology development and consultancy are the three business strategies that this company can master today. Efforts in these areas will lay the foundation needed to pursue their ultimate objective.

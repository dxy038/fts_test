Introduction & Objective: Preoccupation with body image is very common among adolescents.
Different factors such as socio-cultural patterns have effects on body image and adolescents’
satisfaction from that. This study was done to determine the relationship between the
satisfaction from body image and socio-cultural patterns among female adolescents in Rasht
city.
Materials & Methods: This descriptive-analytic study was done on 450 female high school
adolescents between 15 to 17 years old who were selected based on randomized cluster
sampling on 2011 in Rasht. Data was collected using demographic questionnaire, MBSRQAS,
SATAQ-3 and a balance and a tape measure to determine BMI. Data was analyzed by
descriptive and inferential statistics using SPSS 16.
Results: Mean scores of satisfaction from body image in the domains of “orientation to the
appearance” (49.92±4.85), “appearance evaluation” (23.75±3.82) and “satisfaction from body
areas” (36.31±6.33) were high while mean score of satisfaction from “preoccupation with
being overweight” (17.27±4.82) was low. There was seen a statistically significant
relationship between satisfaction from body image based on BMI and general patterns of the
society and athletes (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: The results of study showed that satisfaction from body image in high school
female adolescents of Rasht was high except from the domain of “orientation to the
appearance”. It also indicated that the subjects’ satisfaction from their body image was under
the influence of BMI index, general patterns of society and athletes. So it is needed to identify
the influential factors and provide proper trainings for the adolescents to improve their self

Some sufficient conditions are obtained for the global exponential stability of a solution and existence of the periodic solution to the general bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with distributed delay and impulsive by using the Lyapunov functional and some inequality technique. These results are helpful for designing a globally exponential stable and periodic oscillatory BAM neural network, and the conditions can be easily applied in practice. An example is also given to illustrate our results.

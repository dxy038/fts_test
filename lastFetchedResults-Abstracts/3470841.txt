Based on the design concepts of linear induction motors, an electromagnetic device has been constructed to investigate its feasibility for noncontacting steel-plate conveyance system applications. The system is intended to provide the desired lift, propulsive, and guidance forces to the steel plate simultaneously. Three-dimensional (3-D) field distributions and force characteristics have been investigated through a system state model and finite element analysis. Satisfactory results in the systemÂ´s intended 3-D directions are provided to verify the suitability of the design objective.

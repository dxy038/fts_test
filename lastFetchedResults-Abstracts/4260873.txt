We present a pixel-level color image sensor with efficient ambient light suppression using a modulated RGB flashlight to support a recognition system. Bidirectional photo integrators realize in-pixel demodulation of a projected flashlight with suppressing an ambient light at short intervals during exposure time to avoid saturation from ambient illumination. Every pixel has a capability of depth and color capture. A prototype chip has been designed using 0.35 &#956;m CMOS process and successfully tested.

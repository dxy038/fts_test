In many signal processing applications, widely used in new multimedia based systems, finite precision representation effects are of great concern. When hardware platform are involved, such for VLSI designs, these problems are particularly important, in order to obtain high performance, compact and power-conscious architectures. In particular fixed point effects have not yet been emphasized enough for the forthcoming standard JPEG 2000. In this paper a detailed study of quantization noise effects and their hardware impact is presented. The final objective is to investigate the possibility to exploit finite precision data representation in order to design low cost and low power systems

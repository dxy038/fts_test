A 69-year-old woman was admitted to hospital 4 times from November 2007 to June 2009. The patient had silicosis complicated by broncholithiasis, esophagobronchial fistula, and relapsed tuberculosis. She had worked as a stone crusher for 3 years and was exposed to a large amount of quartz dust. Barium esophagography, gastroesophageal endoscopy, and biopsy suggested esophageal-related chronic inflammation and ulcer, which probably caused the repeated esophagobronchial fistulas observed. Bronchoscopy revealed a free broncholithiasis in the left main bronchus. The patient was readmitted a fourth time, for the relapse of silicotuberculosis. After 9 months of antituberculous therapy, she was doing well until the recent last follow-up visit.

The objective of the present study is to develop a numerical mass transport model that can simulate chlorine disappearance mechanisms under low flow conditions. The model accounts for axial convection and radial diffusion in a pipe under turbulent, transitional and laminar flow regimes and uses realistic velocity profiles. The bulk decay coefficient assumed to be constant in previous models is taken to be a function of residence time of water in pipes based on the findings of the experiments by laboratory tests. Furthermore, a methodology is introduced to convert simple one dimensional model solutions into refined results as if they were calculated by a much more precise two dimensional model.

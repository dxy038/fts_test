In this paper, we present a novel objective quality metric that takes the impact of frame rate into account. The proposed metric uses PSNR, frame rate and a content dependent parameter that can easily be obtained from spatial and temporal activity indices. The results have been validated on data from a subjective quality study, where the test subjects have been choosing the preferred path from the lowest quality to the best quality, at each step making a choice in favor of higher frame rate or lower distortion. A comparison with other relevant objective metrics shows that the proposed metric on average provides a more precise correlation with the subjective results.

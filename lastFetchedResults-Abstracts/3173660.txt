In China, Hangzhou is the first city to set up the Public Free-Bicycle System. There are many and many technology problems in the decision of intelligent dispatch. Among of these problems, how to list the busy station is very important to design the location of storehouses. Now, there are near 4000 stations in Hangzhou. In this paper, a new data classification method is used to recognize the busy station, which is called Support vector machine (SVM). The original model is a quadratical programming with linear inequalities constraints. In order to get the optimal solution, a new solution method is proposed. The constraints are moved away from the original optimization model by using the approximation solution in the feasible space. Three points under one control parameter smoothing function is used to smoothen the objective function of unconstrained model. It is a sixth order polynomial function. The smoothing performance is investigated. Actually, the busy stations can be recognized from the given data set.

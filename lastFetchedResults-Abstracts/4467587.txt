In order to evaluate the human-machine interface layout of oil rig driller control room effectively, a kind of evaluation method that uses CATIA software simulation and Fuzzy AHP (Fuzzy-Analytic Hierarchy Process) was put forward. According to the drillersÂ´ visual area, human body size, comfortable joint range and so on physiological characteristics, CATIA was used to evaluate the accessibility, visibility, and comfort objectively. Combining with the expert opinions of drillers, such as psychological characteristics, operating habits and experience, the evaluation level and evaluation indexes were determined, Fuzzy-AHP evaluation method was used to realize the conversion of qualitative index to quantitative index, and overcome the subjectivity of the evaluation. This comprehensive method balanced the objective evaluation and subjective evaluation, and realized the scientific evaluation of human-machine interface layout of driller control room. Finally the further research work was pointed out.

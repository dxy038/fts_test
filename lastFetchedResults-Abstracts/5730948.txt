In recent years, the public concern on human biological effect of mobile phone is increasing due to the widely used of mobile phones by public including the children. As a consequences, a safety guidelines have been established by the various public organization such as World Health Organization (WHO) and International Commission on Non-Ionization Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). The main objective of this paper is to investigate and study on the human biological effect that may cause by the used of 900 MHz and 1800 MHz mobile phones. For the purpose of the assessment, Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) is used to simulate the modeling of mobile phone attached to human head in order to obtain the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) value of mobile phones that absorbed into human head. The minimum SAR value stated by International Commission on Non-Ionization Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) is 2 W/kg. When the limit is exceeds, it may produces adverse human health effects that contribute to reverse cell membrane polarity, alter brain waves and damage DNA. This leads to cancer and memory loss. However, mobile phones are designed with low power and operate at high frequency, resulted in lower SAR value comparing to 2 W/kg that stated by ICNIRP. Other temporary biological or potential human health effects that may produce by mobile phones are heating, headache, fuzziness, fatigue and nausea. By the way, further studies or researches are needed in order to draw more complete picture of health risks that may cause by the used of mobile phones.

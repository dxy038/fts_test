The objective of this paper is to obtain minimum order input-output equations for a class of linear time-varying digital filters in state equation with constant dimension state vector. It is shown that the minimum order of the input-output equation may not be identical to the dimension of the state vector and there exists a nonunique solution for the minimum order input-output equation.

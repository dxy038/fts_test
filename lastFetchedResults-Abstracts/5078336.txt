This paper proposes a novel fault detection algorithm in a brushless DC (BLDC) motor drive system. This proposed method is configured without the additional sensor for fault detection and identification. The fault detection and identification are achieved by a simple algorithm using the operating characteristic of the BLDC motor. The drive system after the fault identification is reconfigured by four-switch topology connecting a faulty leg to the middle point of DC-link using bidirectional switches. This proposed method can also be embedded into existing BLDC motor drive system as a subroutine without an excessive computational effort. The feasibility of a novel fault detection algorithm is validated in simulation and experiment.

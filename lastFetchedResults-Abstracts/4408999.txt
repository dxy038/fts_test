The objective here is to eliminate the manual work of classifying genres of song in each song. With this startup work songs can be classified in real-time and proposed parallel architecture can be implemented on the multi-processing system as well. In this paper a set of features are obtained like beats/tempo, energy, loudness, speechiness, valence, danceability, acousticness, discrete wavelet transform etc., using Echonest libraries and are fed into the Parallel Multi-Layer Perceptron Network to obtain the genres of the song. The proposed scheme has an accuracy of 85% when used to classify two genres of songs that are Sufi and Classical.

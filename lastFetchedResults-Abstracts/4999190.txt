We address two of the most critical steps of domain engineering: namely, the definition and analysis of a domain also known as domain analysis (DA) and the development of object oriented frameworks (OOF). It aims to demonstrate, based on experimentation, the adequacy of the combined use of DA and OOF techniques to capture domain knowledge in the design activities and facilitate the production of domain components which can further be instantiated in individual and different applications. Sodalia, a telecommunication software company, adopted systematic software reuse as a key strategic imperative to reach its objective of high quality and rapidly deployed software applications. To achieve these objectives, we defined and implemented a reuse based software process based on domain analysis, called SodaliaÂ´s Object Oriented Domain Analysis (SODA). It has been defined starting from existing methodologies (PROTEUS and FODAcom), adapting and integrating them into an evolutionary domain environment

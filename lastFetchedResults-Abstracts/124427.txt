Objective: The purpose of this article was to determine the validity, reliability and standardization of Tool Matching and Form Matching Tests from General Aptitude Test Batteries. Method: The study population was the entire first grade students of Isfahan high schools. In this study 1200 subjects (600 first grade girl students and 600 first grade boy students) were selected randomly from 32771 students. Tool Matching and Form Matching Tests were tested on the subjects. Results: Discrimination power of the Form Matching Test Questions was adequate except in the questions number 1, 3 and 34 to 60. The reason for low discrimination coefficient of questions 34 to 60, was the short time for answering. The discrimination power for Tool Matching Test in questions 15, 21 and 28 to 49 was adequate, but it was low or nil in the other questions. Chronbach alpha was used to evaluate the reliability of Tool Matching and Form Matching Tests; the Chronbach alpha were 0.90 and 0.87, respectively. Factor analysis was used for the evaluation of the validity of these tests. The results showed that the Tool Matching and Form Matching Tests from General Aptitude Test Batteries have adequate and acceptable validity. Conclusion: Using the results of this study two sets of the instrument containing 31 and 28 questions with accompanying norms are available for use in educational consultations.

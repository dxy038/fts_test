Distributed autonomous robotic units are dynamically assigned to manufacturing targets in a model of a complex manufacturing environment such that an objective function like the total profit is optimized. The introduced control of the robotic units is based an a self-organization approach motivated by the selection of modes in pattern formation of physical, chemical or biological systems. This approach is even resistant against sudden changes like breakdowns of some robotic units. In the present work, it is shown how environmental feedbacks like time delays from manoeuvring around obstacles can be considered such that, opposite to many other approaches, feasibility of the solutions can be guaranteed.

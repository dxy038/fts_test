The author presents observations on a simplified and cost-effective HIRF certification procedure for aircraft and avionics systems. The objective of performing avionics system tests at the bench level as embodied in the RTCA DO-160 test procedures and at the aircraft level as in the new HIRF advisory circular is an attempt to perform meaningful tests of these systems. The premise is if the system is not upset by the test signal then the system would not be upset by flying in the existing electromagnetic environment. The problem is in how to be reasonably sure that the tests are practical, economical, and safe. Most importantly, these measures are truly of the susceptibility of the systems as they will be operated. The author attempts to trace some fairly simple but logical observations from recent experiments and analysis that make this complicated process yield itself to some order

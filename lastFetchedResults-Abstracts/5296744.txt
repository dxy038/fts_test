This paper discusses a new method for designing a family of ISI-free pulses that equal or outperform several recently proposed pulses in terms of ISI performance in the presence of sampling errors. We propose a new family of improved Nyquist filters derived from an ideal staircase frequency characteristic using interpolation with polynomial functions. The performance of new ISI-free pulses is studied with respect to the ISI error probability, in the presence of timing error. The objective of this paper is to analyze the performance of this family of Nyquist pulses which provides flexibility in designing an appropriate ISI-free pulse shape.

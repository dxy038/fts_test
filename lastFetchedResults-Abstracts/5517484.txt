The current injection bump system in HLS storage ring, which is designed 8 years ago, has been operated 5 years up to the present with acceptable performance. Due to inherent limitation of HLS (Hefei Light Source) storage ring, there are some deficiencies of the design. For the potential of full energy injection, reasonable design objective was summed up. Then, physical design of new bump system was brought forward. Using simple formula, the acceptance to injected beam and perturbation on stored beam were estimated approximately. Finally, the ELEGANT software was used to simulate the injection process with new designed bump system. The simulation results showed that, the injection efficiency would be higher than 90% and perturbation on stored beam would be small enough, which are very essential to full energy injection and top-up operation of HLS.

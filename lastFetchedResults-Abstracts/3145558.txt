Color differences between different views can cause performance degradation in multiview video coding. In order to overcome this problem, in this paper a local color correction method based on histogram segmentation is proposed. In the proposed method, we correct the color changes in the different segmentation regions between the current picture and the reference picture. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the traditional global linear color correction methods with objective mean of disparity values and subjective visual quality, and achieves better correction results.

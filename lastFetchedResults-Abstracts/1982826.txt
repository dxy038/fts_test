Starch samples from seven major dry pea (Pisum sativum L.) cultivars grown in North Dakota, US was isolated and their physicochemical properties investigated. The objective of the study was to establish the basic foundation of advanced research on physical and chemical modification to improve the functionality of dry pea starches grown in the region. Isolated starch samples were analysed by high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). Amylose percentages were in the range of 32.2–41.1%. Granules were elliptical or spherical with smooth surfaces based on microscopic analysis. Starch samples had similar gelatinisation transition temperatures and displayed ‘C patterns’. The swelling factors of dry pea starches influenced by temperature were determined at 10° intervals between 50 and 90 °C with continuous mixing. The pasting profiles were studied using a rapid visco analyzer (RVA), which exhibited different pasting profiles. This study indicated that dry pea cultivars grown in the region possess starch with different physicochemical characteristics.

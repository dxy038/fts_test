Genetic regulatory networks can model dynamics of cells. They also allow for studying the effect of internal or external interventions. Selectively applying interventions towards a certain objective is known as controlling network dynamics. In this paper, the issue of how the external interventions affect the network is studied. The effects are determined using differential gene expression analysis. The differential gene expression problem is further studied to improve the power of the given method. Control problem for dynamic discrete regulatory networks is formulated.

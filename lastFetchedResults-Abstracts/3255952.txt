In this paper, we propose the use of preference-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization techniques (P-EMO) to address various software modelling challenges. P-EMO allows the incorporation of decision maker (i.e., designer) preferences (e.g., quality, correctness, etc.) in multi-objective optimization techniques by restricting the Pareto front to a region of interest easing the decision making task. We discuss the different challenges and potential benefits of P-EMO in software modelling. We report experiments on the use of P-EMO on a well-known modeling problem where very promising results are obtained.

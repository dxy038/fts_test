Error concealment can be regarded as a sort of error resilient coding techniques. This paper proposes a method to recover lost blocks in stereoscopic images. We first utilize the correlation to perform disparity estimation to match the corresponding blocks for lost ones. And then we calculate the boundary smooth degree (BSD) for each recovered block. If BSD exceeds the threshold, it means that the boundary is discontinuous which mainly results from high detailed blocks, edge blocks or occluded blocks. So we consider neighboring blocksÂ´ BSD and estimate the content of a lost block, and adaptively use different methods to conceal it. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can greatly improve the subjective and objective quality of the reconstructed image.

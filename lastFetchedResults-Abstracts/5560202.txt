A novel wideband planar polygon slot antenna with a metamaterial inspired reactive coupling element is presented. The antenna is printed on a Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) substrate and shows bidirectional radiation characteristics. The antenna, including the ground plane, occupies and area of 2.5 &#215; 2.0 cm<sup>2</sup>. An impedance bandwidth of 17.5% is measured for the single antenna with a center frequency of 11.4 GHz. A 16-element antenna array utilizing this novel antenna is also presented. The simulated antenna array achieves a gain of 14.9 dBi with a radiation efficiency of 67% and an impedance bandwidth of 21%.

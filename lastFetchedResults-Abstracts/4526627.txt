High voltage transmission lines and low voltage distribution lines often share a corridor with railroads. The load currents in these lines radiate an electric field that induces voltages and currents in the rails, which are connected by cables to the signal system electronics. These voltages and currents can exceed 100 V and 100 A and seriously affect the signal systems. The objective of this paper is to describe the induction process and the application of an impedance bond mitigation technique with both analytical and experimental results. Application of this method to a 25 km long diesel freight railroad corridor is discussed

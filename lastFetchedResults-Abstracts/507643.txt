Introduction and objective: Today cutaneous fungal infections of man include a wide variety of disease. Malassezia are normal flora of skin and cause pityriasis versicolor and foliculities under suitable conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the antifungal effects of chloroformic, methanolic and aqueous extracts of henna leaves on Malassezia.
Materials and methods: One hundred grams of dried and powdered henna leaves were extracted using distilled water, methanol and chloroform solvents, separately. The used solvents were removed under reduced pressure. The extracts with different concentrations were mixed mycobiotic agar and covered with a layer of olive oil. In each tube, skin scales of patients with pityriasis versicolor were inoculated. In order to study the inhibitory effects of each henna extracts, the culture tubes were kept at 37?C for about 14 days and the growth of Malassezia colonies were checked every 3, 7 and 14 days after culture. 
Results: Results have shown that chloroformic extract of henna at 3 and 4 (V/V%) completely inhibit the growth of Malassezia. Methanolic extract of henna at 0.25 and 3 (V/V%) inhibit the growth of Malassezia. Aqueous extract of henna at 0.25, 0.5, 4 (V/V%) completely inhibit the growth of Malassezia. Miconazole nitrate as standard antibiotic in almost all concentrations has completely inhibitory effect on Malassezia. 
Conclusion: The results demonstrated that henna has antifungal activity against Malassezia. In addition aqueous extract is more effective on Malassezia than methanolic and chloroformic extracts.

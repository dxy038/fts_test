The objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of dietary composition and duration of feeding on subcutaneous (s.c.) adipose tissue and M. longissimus dorsi (LD) colour and pigment concentrations of heifers. Fifteen heifers were permanently housed and fed a concentrate diet (PH-CON). Fifty-four heifers were grazed on pasture (PAS) for 90d, housed and offered concentrates (PAS-CON), 200 g grass silage (GS)/kg dry matter (DM) (PAS-GS20), 500 g GS/kgDM (PAS-GS50) or zero-grazed grass (PAS-GRA). To facilitate assessment of the temporal pattern of tissue colour, 3 heifers/treatment were slaughtered at housing (following 7d adjustment to diets) and 28, 56, 91 and 120 days thereafter. Yellowness (‘b’ value) of s.c. adipose tissue and lightness (‘L’ value) and redness (‘a’ value) of LD were recorded 48 h post-mortem. β-Carotene and lutein contents of s.c. adipose tissue and total LD haem pigments were determined. At housing, s.c. adipose tissue ‘b’ values of the PAS group (mean = 13.47) were higher (P &lt; 0.01) than those of the PH-CON group (mean = 10.35) but there was no difference in β-carotene or lutein concentrations. The change in s.c. adipose tissue ‘b’ for each diet following housing was best described by the following equations: PH-CON: y = −0.087 (SE 0.0347) X + 0.0005 (SE 0.00029) X2 + 10.06 (SE 0.600), MSE 1.94, R2 0.57, P &lt; 0.01. PAS-CON: y = −0.102 (SE 0.0286) X + 0.0006 (SE 0.00024) X2 + 13.32 (SE 0.598), MSE 2.30, R2 0.62, P &lt; 0.001. PAS-GS20: y = −0.106 (SE 0.0296) X + 0.0008 (SE 0.00025) X2 + 13.10 (SE 0.618), MSE 2.46, R2 0.47, P &lt; 0.01. PAS-GS50: y = −0.077 (SE 0.0269) X + 0.0006 (SE 0.00023) X2 + 13.29 (SE 0.552) MSE 1.95, R2 0.38, P &lt; 0.05. PAS-GRA: y = −0.018 (SE 0.0079) X + 13.77 (SE 0.528), MSE 2.28, R2 0.24, P &lt; 0.05, where y = ‘b’ value, x = days post-housing (d96–d216) and MSE = mean square error. Treatment had a significant effect on s.c. adipose tissue β-carotene and lutein (both P &lt; 0.001) with PAS-GRA and PH-CON tending to have the highest and lowest concentrations, respectively. PH-CON heifers tended (P = 0.058) to have lower LD haem pigments and lighter LD than other heifers. It is concluded that, while concentrate feeding led to the greatest decrease in s.c. adipose tissue yellowness relative to PAS-GRA, choice of dietary ingredients and duration of feeding will depend on the stringency of the colour criteria in particular markets.

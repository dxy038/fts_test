Background and Objective: Shoulder has the greatest range of motion among our body joints. This makes this joint susceptible to dislocation and subluxation. The most common form of instability of the shoulder is anterior dislocation. Bankart’s essential lesion is the most common cause of recurrent anterior shoulder instability. In this study the results of Bankart operation have been evaluated.
Subjects and Methods: Thirty cases of recurrent shoulder dislocation underwent open Bankart surgery using anchor suture were selected.  These operation were carried out from 1390-1380 in Razi and Emam hospitals in Ahvaz.  The cases were evaluated for joint instability, pain according to numerical rating scale, DASH and Rowe Scores, range of motion and movement limitation. Data was analyzed using Fisher exact test and SPSS17 program.
Results: The mean age of the patients was 6.65±33.7 years. The mean forward elevation, internal rotation, external rotation and abduction were 150, 47, 36 and 156 degrees respectively, which were just a little less than normal lower limits. Mean reduction of external rotation was 5 degree  (20-0). According to ROWE score the excellent, good and faire result were 64%, 23% and 13%. DASH score mean was 38.83 ( normal range 66-30). None of them had recurrence or osteoarthritis in radiography.
Conclusion: According to the results of this study it seems that open Bankart surgery is an effective method for reducing pain and recurrence of shoulder dislocation.

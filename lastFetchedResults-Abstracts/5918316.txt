This paper presents a Multicriteria Decision Aid methodology for planning energy storage and sustainable mobility, in an isolated system. The objective of this research is to enhance the sustainability of the analyzed case study (Sa&#771;o Miguel Island), by comparing a set of alternatives for energy storage and sustainable mobility. The alternatives characterization and evaluation is made through the calculation of meaningful attributes, namely: carbon emissions, overall costs and reliability. An analysis of the most interesting alternatives is also performed.

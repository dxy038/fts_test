In order to solve the Multi-objective optimization(MOO) problem in active vibration isolation (AVI) system based on flexible foundation, Four-terminal parameter method is introduced in the paper to analysis the power flow transfer characteristics of a two-stage AVI system. Through systematic analysis, the vibration isolation question can be viewed as a MOO problem and then we can take the advantages of neighborhood propagation genetic algorithms (NCGA) in MOO, employ iSIGHT software to optimize the control system parameters, finally get the Pareto optimal solution. Background on the optimal parameters, an experiment is designed, which the results show that when the air springs were utilized as passive vibration isolation (PVI) components and electromagnetic actuator as an AVI components in a vibration isolation system, we can get significantly integrated isolation performance. It also certified NCGAÂ´s effectiveness in the aspect of multi-objective optimization.

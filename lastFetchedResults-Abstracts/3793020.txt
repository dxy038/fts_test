This paper reports on unique educational and research facilities to teach and perform research on harmonic related problems. The facility consists mainly of computer-based three-phase harmonic generators, a data acquisition system to process the data digitally, and a computer control system to control the harmonic level. Application of the system in teaching, studying and investigating appropriate solutions to harmonic related problems is the primary objective. The interaction of power industry representatives in formulating the different problems is also reported. A brief summary of different teaching projects and the concepts of the computer based system are also included.

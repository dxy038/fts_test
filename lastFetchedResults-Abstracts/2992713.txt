The objective of this paper is to achieve tracking control of a class of unknown nonlinear dynamical systems using a fuzzy logic controller (FLC). A repeatable design algorithm and stability proof is examined for an adaptive fuzzy logic controller that uses basis vectors based on the fuzzy system, unlike most standard adaptive control approaches which use basis vectors depending;on the unknown plant (e.g. a tediously computed "regression matrix"). A e-modification approach to adapt the fuzzy system parameters is investigated. With mild assumptions on the state-feedback linearizable nonlinear systems, using this adaptive fuzzy logic controller the uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop signals is presented and that the controller achicves tracking. In fact, the fuzzy system designed is a model-free universal fuzzy controller that can be applied for any system in the given class of systems.

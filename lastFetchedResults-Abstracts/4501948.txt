Assessment of the effect of multiangular polarized incident light on the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) of vegetation and soil samples is presented in this paper. The samples were evaluated with a reference to 99% white Spectralon calibration standard in the UV-VIS-NIR spectral range. The BRF of the samples was found to be strongly influenced by the polarization of the incident light at different multiangular geometries.

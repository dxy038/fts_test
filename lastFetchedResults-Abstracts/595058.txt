Objective: To evaluate the results of surgical treatment of nonunion fracture clavicle by compression plate and bone graft.Material and Methods: This study was conducted in the department of orthopaedic and Trauma Khyber Teaching hospital Peshawar from December 2001 to December 2003. Fifteen cases of non-union of the clavicle fracture after conservative treatment were included in the study. Non-union of clavicle resulting from other mode of treatment like primary open reduction and internal fixation were excluded. The nonunion was excised and fixed with 3.5 mm dynamic compression plate. The site was grafted with cancellous bone graft.Results: We have been successful in all 15 patients with early return to normal mobility of the joints. The consequent narrowing of the shoulder girdle is fully acceptable for appearance and activities of the shoulder girdle. We obtained bony union within 4 months in all these cases.Conclusion: We have found this method a useful treatment for the nonunion of clavicle after conservative treatment has failed. The technique is simple and does not require any special instrument. It facilitates an early return to normal activities of shoulder girdle and gives a quick recovery from non-union.

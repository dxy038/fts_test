In this paper we present the results of an experimental analysis of voice traffic over 802.11b networks when protected by IPSecurity mechanisms. The main concern is the objective measurement of the impact due these mechanisms by means of our corrected ITU-T E-model implementation, showing more precisely how the associated security overhead decreases speech quality and channel capacity.

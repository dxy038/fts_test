Towards attribute Synthetic assessment, this paper put forward a Synthetic assessment method based on the combination weighting method. Single index attribute measurement function was used to determine each measuring pointÂ´s single indicators of degree of membership and form a matrix, the comprehensive weights defined by AHM Weighting method and similar rights law were used to establish a multi-index Synthetic measure matrix, and judgment was made according to confidence criteria. The simulation results showed that this method can compensate for the limitations of fuzzy Synthetic evaluation method, and it is more scientific and reasonable than single-weighting method, because it can avoid the inaccuracy of the subjective factors of evaluation and overcome the incompleteness of the objective weights which do not consider the customer needs. The method is straightforward and presents trustful and reasonable evaluation results.

This paper deals with optimized training sequences to estimate multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) channel states in the presence of spatial fading correlations. The optimization criterion is the entropy minimization of the error between the high multi-dimensional and correlated channel state and its estimator. The globally optimized training sequences are exactly solved by a semi-definite programming (SDP) of tractable computational complexity O((M<inf>t</inf>(M<inf>t</inf> + 1)/2)<sup>2.5</sup>), where M<inf>t</inf> is the transmit antenna number. With new tight two-sided bounds for the objective function, the optimal value of the generic SDP can be approximately solved by the standard water-filling algorithm. Intensive simulation results are provided to illustrate the performance of our methods.

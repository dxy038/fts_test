Background and Objective: Anal fistula is a tract between anorectal canal and perianal skin. It usually develops after perianal abscess and it is one of the most common surgical diseases that presents with persistent drainage from the tract. Recurrence of fistula and gas or fecal incontinence are important problems after surgical management of fistula particularly in recurrent fistula. The aim of this study is to evaluate the rate of recurrence and incontinency after open fistulectomy with repair of sphincter muscles.
Subjects and Methods: In a prospective interventional semi-empirical study 98 patients with recurrent fistula were evaluated for recurrence and incontinency during 10 years (1999-2008) follow up after treatment by fistulectomy and primary sphincter muscles repair. Results: From 98 patients (96 male and 2 female) of recurrent anal fistula, 27 patients have high anal fistula and 71 have low (common) fistula-in-ano. Ninety six patients were developed prolonged neither gas incontinence nor recurrence. One patient who was considered as type 2 diabetes, presented with wound infection postoperatively. In this patient fistulectomy and sphincter repair was performed after control of wound infection. One male patient was developed long life gas incontinence.
Conclusion: In compare with other surgical methods, fistulectomy and sphincter repair was shown the lowest rate of recurrence. One case of permanent gas incontinence and no case of fecal incontinence was found. Sci Med J 2011; 9(6):571-579

Existing mobile network infrastructures, for example the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), are based on mission specific, specialized network nodes/entities that are interconnect via standardized interfaces in a static manner, each providing a specific service/function. One common practice adopted by many Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) in order to cater to increasing traffic demand is the over provisioning of network and processing resources. However, this approach results in increased CAPEX and OPEX and in view of future load forecasts this approach is no longer considered feasible or economical. In this paper we address this specific issue and propose the concept of softEPC, which leverages the recent advances in cloud technology concept such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and virtualization techniques in the realm of mobile networks. A softEPC is considered as a virtual network of Evolved Packet Core (EPC) functions over a physical transport network topology. This will enable the on-demand and load-aware dynamic instantiation of network functions and services at appropriate locations in response to the actual traffic demand. The main objective of this approach is to increase the utilization of network resources by flexibly and dynamically placing the network functions/services where most appropriate to provide optimum service and where resources are available to increase the number of services provided to mobile users. The benefits and gains of this approach will be demonstrated by means of simulation results.

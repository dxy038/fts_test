In this paper a gradient-based optimization approach for path synthesis problems is proposed. To achieve this objective, a specific formulation is developed to obtain the exact elements of the gradients. Hence, sensitivity parameters for all the design variables are determined giving a first order relationship between the parameters of interest. This information is used in the optimization algorithm to ensure the convergence and to enhance its rate. The method is capable of handling equality and inequality constraints and mobility conditions.

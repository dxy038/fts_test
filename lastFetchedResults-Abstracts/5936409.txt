The authors propose a class of detail-preserving edge enhancing filters which consist of multiple substructures, each performing noise attenuation. The filters shown have a certain detail preserving ability while enhancing blurred edges. The root signal properties of the unidirectional edge enhancing filters are discussed. Bidirectional edge enhancing filters are also introduced to enhance the blurred edges with different directions. Computer simulations demonstrate the detail preserving and edge enhancing abilities of the filters

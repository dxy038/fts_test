Refrigerated dough is a flour-based, unbaked product that is stored between 4 and 7 Â°C. Maintaining the dough quality during storage is very crucial. Starch functionalities have important effects on flour and dough quality. The objective of this research was to determine the physicochemical changes of starch in refrigerated dough during extended storage. Two wheat flours with different amylose/amylopection ratio were used in this study. The relative percentage of amylopectin decreased up to 10.51%. Overall, we observed that the pasting properties and thermal properties of starch were changing during the storage: peak viscosity decreased up to 23.06%, breakdown viscosity decreased up to 57.70%, and setback viscosity decreased up to 41.25% compared to flour samples during 34 days refrigerated storage. We detected the variation in starch granular morphology. These results showed that physicochemical properties of starch changes during refrigerated storage, which may have significant impacts on end-product quality.

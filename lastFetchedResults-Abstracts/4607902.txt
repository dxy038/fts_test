This paper describes a high definition display adaptive resampling algorithm which based on the direction oriented interpolation algorithm. In the large display market, FPD has become common than CRT in these days. Although the FPD has high panel resolution, the interlaced signal cannot be displayed on FPD. Thus, FPD requires more adaptive image signal processing for display high resolution and progressive signal. The proposed algorithm is designed to improve objective and subjective quality even though requires computational burden. Algorithm that were developed and implemented on this system includes edge pattern based region classifier and filling strategies for digital display.

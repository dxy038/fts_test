Objective: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the relation between a new index we created for the assessment of distal radius fractures involving the ulnar styloid, and the clin¬ical outcome. Methods: We devised a radiographic separation index (RSI), to evaluate the displacement of the ulnar styloid. We used this index in 44 patients (28 men and 16 women; mean age: 43.2 years; range: 24-64 years) with distal radius fractures involving the the ulnar styloid. In all cases, the distal radius fracture was fixed using a volar locking plate. The styloid fracture was treated con¬servatively. The relation between the RSI value and clinical results was then investigated. Results: In the 44 patients there were clinically 38 excellent, 4 good, and 2 moderate results. RSI ratios ranged from 2% to 11%. The patients with an excellent result had an RSI ratio of less than 5%. We found a significant correlation between the RSI ratio values and the clinical outcomes. Conclusion: Our results suggested that the RSI can be used as a predictor of the clinical outcome in patients with distal radius fractures involving the ulnar styloid.

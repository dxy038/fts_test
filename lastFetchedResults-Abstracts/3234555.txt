This paper investigates the optimization of Single-phase induction motors. Induction motors are widely used in industry and household. To improve efficiency and torque of single-phase induction motor (SPIM) various approaches have been proposed. It is impossible that all the parameters of optimizations are taken into account, because there are many parameters in the design of motor. So the objective functions for the optimization are very complex. Some issues such as stator and rotor slots, stator winding and choice of core material, have significant impacts on motor design. In previous articles the effects of these parameters on the density of the magnetic field have not been discussed. First, we investigated the impact of changing each parameter on motor design. Then, effects of all parameters will be considered in the motor design. At the end of each section of optimization the simulation has been verified by Maxwell software. Simulation results in improving the efficiency and torque of the motor SOB-1 and SOB-2 are compared with each other.

The main objective of this work is to quantitatively study the extraction problem of distributed parameters of unparallel transmission lines, especially for one specific type of unparallel transmission line model. The infinitesimal transmission lines are equivalent to the parallel transmission lines, and the estimation method of distributed parameters is presented based on the original physical definition of distributed parameters. Numerical experiments show that distributed parameters are related to axial variable and the angle of wires, it represents the nonuniform characteristic of parameters; when the angle of the wires is close to zero, the distributed parameters are the same as the parameters of parallel transmission lines, which validates the effectiveness of the method.

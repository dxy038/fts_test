Introduction
c renal failure (CRF) in growing children can affect their physical growth status. The objective of this research was to study the craniofacial morphology of children with CRF as evaluated by cephalometric analysis.
s
-three growing children with CRF were included in this study. They were divided into three groups according to age ranges. The age ranges were &gt;5–11 (group 1); &gt;11–14 (group 2); &gt;14–16 (group 3). Another twenty-three matching controls (in age and gender) were also included. Lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken as part of these children's orthodontic records. Lateral cephalometric radiographs were corrected for magnification distortion, digitized, and cephalometric analysis was performed. Data were analysed using ANOVA test.
s
sults showed that CRF patients in all age groups have statistically significantly decreased posterior cranial base lengths. Posterior facial heights showed a significant decrease in CRF patients in groups 1 and 2. Younger CRF patients (group 1) showed statistically significant increased gonial angle and FH-Mandibular plane angle, SN-Mandibular plane angle and decreased posterior to anterior face height ratio, total anterior facial height (N-Me), Mandibular body length (Go-Me), upper anterior facial height (N-ANS), Y axis length, pterygomaxillary-A point length.
sion
r children (groups 1 and 2) with CRF showed a decrease in posterior facial growth (posterior facial height and posterior cranial base) when compared to matching normal controls. This decrease is not significant in older group (group 3). This finding suggests that children with CRF might catch up in growth with normal subjects and most of the earlier retarded growth features disappear with age.

This paper discusses stabilization of an optimization procedure to determine an appropriate semivariogram parameter using the empirical semivariogram for Kriging-based approximation. From a viewpoint of a computational cost for constructing a surrogate model, a semivariogram fitting approach using the empirical semivariogram can be usable for the parameter estimation of a semivariogram function. However, instability of the optimization procedure for determination of the semivariogram parameter may be observed in some cases and it causes to generate an invalid surrogate model.

is problem, a simple technique for stabilization of the optimization for the parameter determination is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach employs a normalization technique of input data with respect to values of variables and an objective function. The proposed method is applied to some numerical examples, and the numerical results illustrate validity and effectiveness of the proposed method.

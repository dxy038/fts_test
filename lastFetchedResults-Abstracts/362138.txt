Study objective: We sought to determine the feasibility of discharging Mark 1 atropine and pralidoxime autoinjectors into small, sterile vials to facilitate the potential intramuscular injection of these antidotes, particularly pralidoxime, on a milligram per kilogram basis to small children. Methods: Autoinjectors were swabbed with isopropyl alcohol and then discharged into emptied, sterile, plastic 10-mL vials. This was repeated with the investigator garbed in standard personal protective gloves and full face mask and hood. The autoinjector injection surfaces were cultured. Results: The autoinjectors were easily discharged into the vials without need for practice or special dexterity, even when investigators were garbed in protective gear. A small core of rubber stopper might be injected into the vial, and thus, the vial contents need to be withdrawn through a filter needle before reinjection. The autoinjector injection surfaces were sterile after alcohol swabbing. Conclusion: Autoinjectors might be a readily available source of concentrated pralidoxime for potential intramuscular use in small children. [Ann Emerg Med. 2002;40:405-408.]

The coach evaluation system is established in this paper by using fuzzy mathematics model. The necessity and main principles of the coach evaluation system are analyzed. First of all, Delphi method and frequency statistics method are used to determine the indexes of the evaluation system, and then the weight of each index is calculated by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and literature method. Secondly, the legendary coach is evaluated by the primary, secondary (objective evaluation system) and final selection model (subjective evaluation system). Take National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for example, the best basketball coach in this century is evaluated in the end. After testing the model, it can not only provide references when looking for the &#8220;legendary coach&#8221; but also help Sports Administration to establish incentive mechanism to train more excellent coaches.

Background and Objective: The time of admission to delivery center can have an important impact on the outcome of labor. This study aimed at comparing the post delivery consequences in women admitted in latent and active phase of Labor.
Material and Methods: This descriptive  study was conducted on 500 parturients, in Taleghani hospital of Tabriz, divided into two equal groups of latent phase (N = 250) and active phase (N=250). For data collection, we used  a demographic Questionnaire,  a  Checklist for assessing the third and fourth labor stages and the results of mothers' physical examination (pre discharge and 10 days after delivery).
Results: In accordance with age, number of pregnancy, delivery , abortion, stillbirth and the number of natural pregnancy, the difference between two groups was not significant.  But about the complications of 4th stage of labor, postpartum hemorrhage and pre- discharge Hb & Hct, the difference was significant. Apgar score in the first minute (p < 0.03), Cord ABG (p < 0.001) and the interventions conducted on infants such as resuscitation (p < 0.001) were significantly different between two groups of latent and active phase.
Conclusion: Admission in the latent phase is accompanied by increased complications and early  medical interventions. Hence, admitting in latent phase is not recommended unless there are some specific medical indications.

Objective
To determine possible differences of composition in the course of lactation, phospholipid (PL) classes (phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin) and fatty acid composition of PL and triacylglycerol (TGs) fractions of milk fat were analyzed in 66 samples from mothers from Granada (Spain) who gave birth to full-term infants. Analyses included colostrum, transitional milk, and mature milk.
Methods

After milk fat extraction, PLs and TGs were separated by thin-layer chromatography and fatty acids of each fraction were converted into their methyl esters, which were analyzed by gas chromatography. PL classes were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography using an evaporative light-scattering detector.
Results

Mature human milk showed a lower content (P = 0.020) of PLs than did the other milks. Percentage of sphingomyelin was constant for all stages of lactation, whereas the percentage of phosphatidylcholine in mature milk was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than in colostrum and transitional milk. TGs in mature human milk contained lower percentages (P < 0.001) of arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and nervonic acid. Docosahexaenoic acid and nervonic acid also showed a significant decrease (P < 0.001) in total PLs from colostrum and mature milk.
Conclusions

The composition of PL classes and fatty acids in PLs and TGs in milk of mothers in Granada (Southern Europe) is different from that in milk from mothers in other parts of the world. In addition, the ratio of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids delivered in the form of PLs to long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids delivered in the form of triacylglycerols diminishes as lactation proceeds.

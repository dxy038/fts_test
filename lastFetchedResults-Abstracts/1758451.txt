Objective
ermine availability of and test whether on-site mental health providers (MHP) is associated with greater odds of reported mental health consultation and referral among primary care pediatricians.
s
ricians were identified from the American Medical Association's 2004 physician directory and stratified by region. Six hundred were randomly selected to receive a mail survey. The main independent variable was on-site MHP. The dependent variable was reported frequency (4-point rating) of mental health consultation and referral. Estimates were weighted to account for survey design and nonresponse.
s
l response rate was 51%. The majority of respondents were male (56%), age ≥46 years old (59%), white (68%), and practicing in suburban locations (52%). Approximately half reported consultation with (44%) or referral to (51%) MHP always or often, but a few (17%) reported on-site MHP. After adjustment for demographic and practice characteristics, pediatricians with on-site MHP were more likely to consult (odds ratio [OR] 6.58, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 3.55- 12.18) or refer (OR 4.25, 95% CI 2.19–8.22) than those without on-site MHP. Among those without on-site MHP, pediatricians with greater practice burden were less likely to consult (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48–0.99) or refer (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.54–1.04) than those with lesser burden.
sions
ediatricians in the United States experienced practice-related burdens that limit mental health collaboration, but those with co-located services reported a greater likelihood of consultation and referral. Policy changes that encourage co-location of mental health services and limit practice burden may facilitate mental health consultation and referral.

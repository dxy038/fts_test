Background: Shallot (Alium hirtifolium Bosis) belongs to genus Liliaceae There is more than 500 species in this genus. Shallot produces a cluster of bulbs from a single planted bulb. This plant has been used as an additive in foods for many years, but there is little study about antibacterial activity of Shallot
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine antibacterial activity of Shallot against clinical isolated bacteria.
Methods: Crude juice of shallot (Alium hirtifolium ) was tested for it's growth inhibitory effect on 4 Gram-negative and 2Gram-positive species Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using dilution method.
Results: All test organisms were inhibited by shallot juice. The MIC for Gram-negative enteric rods including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis ranged between 78-624 µ /ml. while the MIC for pseudomonas aeruginosa was 20-80mg/ml.The MIC for Gram -positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus strains and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were 156-312µ/ml and 19.5-78µ /ml respectively.
Conclusion: It is concluded that Crude juice of shallot has antibacterial activity against both gram positive cocci and Gram-negate rods. It is believed that antibacterial activity of shallot depends on its thiosulfinate components.

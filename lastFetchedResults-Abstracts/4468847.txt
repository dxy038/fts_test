Two new families of bidirectional DC/DC converters suitable for high frequency high efficiency operation are proposed, based on single-cycle resonant (SCyR) topology. The ZCS/ZVS and ZVS/ZCS-SCyR bidirectional converter families are capable of resonant operation from no-load to full-load, and they have load independent PWM-like characteristics. Experimental results supporting the proposed concept are reported

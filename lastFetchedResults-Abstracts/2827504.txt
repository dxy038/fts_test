The main objective of this paper is to allocate the reactive power load and loss of any power system network in presence of SVC with consideration of all reactive power resources present in the system. The contribution of each reactive power resources to cater a particular load has been calculated using proportional sharing technique. In addition to that an effort has been made to allocate the reactive loss among the reactive power resources. In this paper, FC-TCR type SVC has been considered to observe its effect on reactive load as well as loss sharing. Proposed technique has been simulated using a 203 bus multi-machine practical power system (WBSEB system). This study can be of great benefit for generating agencies to know the exact reactive loss sharing of a particular generator and therefore to modify the charges applicable for reactive power pricing.

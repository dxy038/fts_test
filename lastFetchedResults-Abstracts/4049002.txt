An automated procedure based on evolutionary computation and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is proposed to synthesize the optimal distribution of nanoparticles (NPs) in multi-site injection for a Magnetic Fluid Hyperthermia (MFH) therapy. In particular a bi-objective formulation of the synthesis problem is considered taking into account both surface and volume temperature distribution in the tumor region.

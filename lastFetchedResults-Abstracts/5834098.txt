The objective of this paper is to design a finite-time controller for Lorenz system in discrete-time. First, a discrete model is derived through the Taylor series expansion. In the next step, a discrete-time terminal sliding mode controller (DTSMC) is developed to reach a finite-time and high precision control. The stability analysis of DTSMC is presented in the presence of external disturbance and model uncertainties. Numerical simulations of Lorenz system are shown and compared with a discrete-time sliding mode control (DSMC) to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

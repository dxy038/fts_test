In this paper, we discuss the inverse classification problem, in which we desire to define the features of an incomplete record in such a way that will result in a desired class label. Such an approach is useful in applications in which it is an objective to determine a set of actions to be taken in order to guide the data mining application towards a desired solution. This system can be used for a variety of decision support applications which have pre-determined task criteria.

This paper describes a new 3-D framework for the construction of a hybrid motion compensation model to reduce blocking artifacts in a highly scalable video coding system. Previous works have focused primarily on using control grid interpolation (CGI) or over-lapped block motion compensation (OBMC) to reduce blocking artifacts. However, both methods generate distinct side effects, such as PSNR degradation or poor de-blocking results, during the de-blocking process. The main objective of our proposed model is to achieve better visual quality and maintain satisfactory coding efficiency simultaneously by integrating the advantages of CGI and OBMC. The introduction of the dual mode selection between CGI and OBMC provides a more flexible mechanism to adjust our objective function and thereby achieves higher objective and subjective coding gains. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves improved coding efficiency in terms of both PSNR and visual quality.

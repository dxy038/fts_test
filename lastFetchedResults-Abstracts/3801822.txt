Based on requirements specified by several investigators engaged in studies involving electrical stimulation through electrodes chronically implanted in brain substance, an electrical stimulator was designed and built. The instrumentation problems encountered in stimulation studies are discussed to emphasize the need for certain features adapting the instrument to the biophysical characteristics of living brain tissues. The resulting stimulator output is bidirectional, current-regulated and isolated, and provides isolated monitors for current ranges from 0.1 mA to 10 mA and pulses from 0.1 ms to 10 ms wide.

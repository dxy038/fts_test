Objective: The aim of the current study was to investigate levels of placenta growth factor in the tissues and sera of the patients with gestational trophoblastic disease and to determine its usefulness for the treatment of gestational trophoblastic disease. Study Design: Placenta growth factor concentrations were measured in the tissue homogenates of 12 normal placentas, 33 complete hydatidiform moles, and 6 gestational choriocarcinomas. Serum placenta growth factor levels were determined in 59 women with normal pregnant course, in 30 women with complete hydatidiform mole, in 36 women with persistent gestational trophoblastic disease, and 100 nonpregnant healthy volunteers. Results: Serum and tissue placenta growth factor levels in the patients with mole tended to be decreased compared with the levels in normal pregnancy; the levels were increased significantly in patients with choriocarcinoma. When serum placenta growth factor levels were >20 pg/mL (normal upper limit in nonpregnant women), placenta growth factor–to–human chorionic gonadotropin ratios were increased significantly in patients with persistent gestational trophoblastic disease. Conclusion: Serum placenta growth factor levels are not of any predictive value in patients with hydatidiform mole. However, elevated serum placenta growth factor levels with increased placenta growth factor–to–human chorionic gonadotropin ratios are suggestive of persistent gestational trophoblastic disease.

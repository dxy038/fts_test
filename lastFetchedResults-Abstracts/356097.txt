The objective of this study was to examine the endothelial function of internal mammary artery in patients with coronary artery disease and in heart transplant recipients. Therefore the response of this artery to increasing concentrations of acetylcholine (1, 10, 20 Î¼g/min for 2.5 minutes each) was assessed in 6 patients in a control group, 16 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD group) matched for risk factors with 16 heart graft recipients (who underwent transplantation for nonischemic heart failure), and 12 patients with coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease (PVD group). Diameters of proximal and middle segments of internal mammary artery were measured by quantitative angiography. The responses to the first concentration of acetylcholine were attenuated in these three groups compared with the control group. At the highest concentration of acetylcholine the diameter increase was similar in the control and CAD groups, whereas the responses remained significantly impaired in the transplant and PVD groups. However, after selective infusion of l-arginine (30 mg/min for 11 minutes), the precursor of endothelium-derived nitric oxide, was performed, the responses to acetylcholine were restored in these two latter groups. Endothelin plasma levels were significantly enhanced in the PVD group, which exhibited the most severe impairment in acetylcholine-induced vasodilation. Thus some patients with CAD, mainly those with advanced atherosclerosis, and cardiac transplant recipients exhibit internal mammary artery endothelial dysfunction, and this abnormality seems reversible.

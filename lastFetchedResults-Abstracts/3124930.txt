With extension of simulation scale and deep development of modeling technique, increasing demands are placed on natural environment truthfulness simulation in all kinds of simulation technique domain. In VRML, the two frequently used programming nodes are Background and Fog. Background node is regularly used to produce virtual space background, maybe either gradient rendering background or panoramagram rendering background, further linking the two. Fog node is mainly used to produce VRML virtual atmosphere effect. Scene´s fogging treatment should not only reflect fog´s objective existence, but also give an expression of fine effects of fog light and shade, creating an obscure meaning of poem. Paper mainly introduced these two kinds of virtual atmosphere and space natural simulation technology and their design application.

Introduction & Objective: In spite of several treatment methods which are being used to treat exudative age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) like laser therapy, Intravitreal steroids injections or anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), no method has been yet presented as the best treatment way. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of combined transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) with subtenon triamcinolone acetonide (TA) injection in treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in patients with ARMD.
Materials & Methods: In this clinical trial, 63 eyes of 57 patients with CNV secondary to exudative age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) were studied. All CNVs (including 20 predominantly classic and 43 predominantly occult lesions) were treated with diode laser (810nm). In 20 eyes with predominantly classic CNVs, 20 mg and 40 mg subtenon triamcinolone was injected in 12 and 8 eyes respectively. The patients were followed for a mean of 9.1 months (ranging from 5.5 to 16 months). The average number of treatment sessions was 1.25. in 43 eyes with occult CNV, 20 mg and 40 mg subtenon triamcinolone was injected in 31 eyes and in 12 eyes respectively. Mean follow up time was 12 months (4.5 to 23 months). Mean treatment times was 1.17. A variable spot size of 0.8, 1.2, 2 and 3 mm was used depending on the size of CNV; and treatment was given in one area for 1 minute. Thermotherapy was adminstered through a contact lens at a power range between 120-560 mw. At the end of treatment, each patient randomly received 20 mg or 40 mg subtenon triamcinolone acetonide injection in superotemporal quadrant. Outcome was assessed with clinical and angiographic examination.collected data were analyzed by one-sample and	paired -sample T test, using
SPSS software.
Results: At the end of the study in first group, visual acuity remained stable (0 to ± one line) in 14 out of 20 (70 %) of eyes, improved (> one line) in 2 of 20 (10 %) eyes and showed a decline (> one line worsening) in 4/20 (20 %) eyes. In second group thirty one eyes (72.1 %) had stable vision (± 1 line), 4 eyes (9.32 %) had better vision more than 1 Sine and 8 eyes (18.6 %) had more than 1 line decrease in vision.\r
Conclusion: All CNVs were closed in last follow up. No statistically significant difference was found between two groups in clinical and functional with 20 mg and 40 mg injection of subtenon TA. Combined TTT and subtenon injection of TA in eyes with exudative ARMD can be an effective method to stabilize visual acuity of these patients.

The increasing requirement to the clean and renewable energy has led to the rapid development of wind power systems all over the world. With growing usage wind power in power systems, impact of wind generators on subsynchronous resonance (SSR) is importance. SSR is a well-known phenomenon in a series compensated power systems which can be mitigated with Flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) devices. In this paper for damping the SSR, a Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) has been used. This paper used wind and steam turbine as a hybrid energy production system. In order to have an optimal control on pitch angle in high speed of wind, fuzzy logic damping controller (FLDC) has been used. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the ability of the Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) for mitigation of SSR. In order to conduct the studies, the IEEE second benchmark model on SSR is adapted with the combination of synchronous wind generator based wind turbine.

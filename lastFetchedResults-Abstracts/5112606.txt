A fully parameterized angularly zigzagged planar self-complementary dual-armed sinuous antenna with diameter D = 73.8 mm is optimally designed and simulated with Ansoft HFSS&#8482; v.13. Ultra-wideband (S<sub>11</sub> &#8804; -10 dB), good transient properties, full polarization, and high gain (5 dBi-7 dBi) are acquired within band 1.5 GHz-15 GHz. Three linearly polarized bands (AR&#8805;30 dB): f<sub>1</sub>=3.1 GHz (2.85 GHz-3.78 GHz, 30%), f<sub>3</sub> = 5.5 GHz (5.28 GHz-5.84 GHz, 10%), f<sub>4</sub> = 8.4 GHz, f<sub>5</sub> = 10 GHz (7.87 GHz-10.41 GHz, 25.4%) and two circularly polarized bands (AR&#8804;15 dB): f<sub>2</sub> = 4.6 GHz (4.2 GHz-4.75 GHz, 12%, RHCP), f<sub>6</sub> = 13.4 GHz(11.54 GHz-15 GHz, 25.8%, LHCP) are obtained within this band. Gain patterns of these bands are all bidirectional in broadside (Theta = 0&#176;) and almost azimuth-free in horizontal plane with 26&#176;-140&#176; axial ratio beam width. So it is very attractive to application in ultra-wideband multi-polarization systems, such as electronic warfare, track and guidance radar, radio astronomy and other communication systems.

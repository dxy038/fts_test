Background and Objective: Educational software as a learning-centered approach, provides a rich source that could be an opportunity to enhance learning and increase learning skills. It creates a collaborative environment that allows learners and teachers to search, and to study a variety of issues. This study intends to evaluate the impact of educational software designed for teaching fundamental nursing and midwifery students' practical skills.
Materials and Methods: This research is a semi-empirical study. In this study, 381 nursing and midwifery students (193 nursing students and 188 midwifery students) in first semester were selected through simple random sampling. They were assigned to intervention and control groups. First, both groups were trained in the traditional way and their practical skills were examined by means of appropriate check-lists; then educational software was used to train the intervention groups. In this period, students of control group had time to review and practice their skills routinely. Practical skills of both groups were re-evaluated using SPSS 16 software with t-test and paired t-test.
Results: The results showed that the mean and standard deviation of test scores (exam1) in both intervention and control groups were not significantly different (p > 0/05); whereas in exam 2 in the intervention group compared with the control group, a significant difference was observed in the mean and standard deviation of the students' scores (p < 0/05).
Conclusion: Test results showed that educational software can be used as an effective teaching strategy. In addition, cognitive psychomotor performance of students may be improved.

Various methods are known for the evaluation of taste. The most reliable but contemporarily least objective data are obtained using human taste panels. Analytical tools like electronic taste sensing systems and chromatographic analysis enable a less subjective evaluation.

s study, two herbal extracts as well as lozenges containing those extracts were investigated by HPLC measurements, two electronic taste sensing systems and a human taste panel. The resulting data were compared to each other and evaluated in terms of their informative value.

l sensors of the electronic tongues were able to detect differences between the unprocessed herbal extracts and lozenges. However, different extract concentrations in the fabricated lozenges could not be investigated by taste sensing systems as all sensor sets led to similar results.

nsory two-row-triangular test, the human taste panel identified the lozenge with the lowest herbal extract amount to be the only differing sample (significance level α = 0.05). Different herbal extract mixtures and deviations of extract concentration in lozenges remained undetected.

deviations were proven by HPLC measurements.

now, complementary measurements using different analytical tools and human subjects are recommended for complete information about products’ taste.

Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) is an anti-viral drug having low bioavailability due to low permeability and pH dependent solubility. In this study, self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS) of ADV were developed with the objective of increasing its bioavailability by enhancing its intestinal permeability and minimizing the effect of pH. Preliminary screening was carried out to select oil, surfactant and co-surfactant. Ternary phase diagrams were constructed to identify the area of nanoemulsification. The nanoemulsion system selected from the phase diagram was transformed into solid-SNEDDS (S-SNEDDS) by lyophilization using D-mannitol as cryoprotectant. The formulations were characterized for transmittance, globule size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, cloud point, robustness to dilution, effect of pH and temperature, microscopic properties, in vitro and ex vivo drug release parameters. The liquid SNEDDS (L-SNEDDS) showed mean globule size of 110 ± 10 nm while mean globule size of 150 ± 16 nm was obtained with S-SNEDDS. The formulations were found to be robust to dilution and showed cloud point at 80–85 °C. TEM and SEM studies of nanoemulsion reconstituted from S-SNEDDS demonstrated the spherical shape and size of the globules. Results of DSC and XRD studies confirmed that the drug was incorporated in the S-SNEDDS. No significant difference was observed in the globule size within physiological variations of pH and temperature. The in vitro and ex vivo drug release from ADV SNEDDS was found to be significantly higher in comparison to that from plain drug suspension, irrespective of pH. Thus, SNEDDS were found to be instrumental in reducing the effect of pH variability of ADV and improving the release performance of ADV, indicating their potential to improve the oral bioavailability and thus the therapeutic efficacy of ADV.

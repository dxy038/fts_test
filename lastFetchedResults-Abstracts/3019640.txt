An approach for IIR equalizer design based on the impulse response symmetry is presented. Design is based on numerical optimization. General form of the objective function is given and its special cases are analyzed. It is shown that the general form gives the best results while the special cases can be more appropriate for the implementation. Practical aspects of the implementation are considered and the choice of the optimization starting point is discussed. MethodÂ´s features are illustrated by an example.

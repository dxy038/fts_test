In this paper, physical-layer network coding (PLNC) which is widely considered recently in the wireless communications research area is applied to bidirectional broadcast relay channels. During this work, mutual information transfer between two groups of users which can not directly communicate with each other is provided by a relay and the PLNC technique. Each user in each group transmits its own information to all other users. Analytical outage and bit error probability expressions for the considered system are derived and obtained results are supported by computer simulations. The effect of the user number on the system performance is also evaluated.

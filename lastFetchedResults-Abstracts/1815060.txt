The objective of the present study was to examine whether cinnamic acid exerts antitumor activity against colon cancer cells in vitro. For this purpose we investigated the effect of cinnamic acid on cell proliferation and on the differentiation markers alkaline phosphatase, sucrase and aminopeptidase N in human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2). Cinnamic acid (2.5–8.0 mM) prolonged the doubling time and inhibited the DNA synthesis of growing cells. The antiproliferative effect occurred rapidly after 2 h of treatment with 8.0 mM cinnamic acid and reached nearly maximal values after 8 h of treatment. Sucrase and aminopeptidase N activities were stimulated under cinnamic acid treatment (4.0–8.0 mM), while alkaline phosphatase activity was inhibited in postconfluent cells (8.0 mM). Similar effects on enzyme activities were seen in non-proliferating cells. Cinnamic acid did not alter the adhesion to collagen matrix or cell viability. Intracellular cAMP levels were decreased significantly after 1 h of treatment with 8.0 mM cinnamic acid, suggesting that cinnamic acid induces its effects on enzyme activities partly by modulating the cAMP signaling pathway.

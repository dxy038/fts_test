This paper presents a behavior-based approach to formation maneuvers for groups of mobile robots. Complex formation maneuvers are decomposed into a sequence of maneuvers between formation patterns. The paper presents three formation control strategies. The first strategy uses relative position information configured in a bidirectional ring topology to maintain the formation. The second strategy injects interrobot damping via passivity techniques. The third strategy accounts for actuator saturation. Hardware results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies.

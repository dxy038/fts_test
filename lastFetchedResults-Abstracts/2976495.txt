The objective of forward link power allocation is to ensure the necessary signal quality at each mobile from the cell site. Especially, to cover the whole service area, the signals conveying control information should be provided with sufficient strength even at a cell boundary. This paper describes a power allocation model in order to show how to allocate powers for the control signals transmitted on the forward link and how much power should be equipped for each base to deliver an amount of information. And specific engineering issues are then discussed with numerical examples, which include: selection of an adequate ratio of pilot power to total power transmitted at a base station; the effect of transmit power limitation on the capacity; and introducing optional data services into existing networks

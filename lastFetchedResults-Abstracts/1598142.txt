The objective of this paper is to introduce a fuzzy distance measure for generalized fuzzy numbers (GFN). It computes the fuzzy distance between two generalized fuzzy numbers and also LR-type fuzzy numbers. The metric properties of the proposed measure are also studied. Some numerical examples have been considered here for applying the proposed fuzzy distance measure and the results are compared.

This paper proposes the design of fuzzy controllers for the attitude stabilization of the Republic of China Satellite (ROCSAT-1). In the first step, the original satellite controllers, two classical linearized controllers, are superseded by two fuzzy controllers. The objective is to obtain faster convergent time and lower steady-state error. The two fuzzy controllers will be consolidated to form one fuzzy controller in the next step, to obtain the same effectiveness of control. To demonstrate a fuzzy controllerâ€™s performance, interference to disturb the attitude stabilization is added during the simulation.

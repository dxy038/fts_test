Composite materials have been widely used in various industries due to their superior mechanical properties. Drilling is a very common machining operation to install fasteners for assembly of laminates. Delamination, however, is a serious concern in the drilling of fiber reinforced composite materials, because it reduces their compressive residual strength. This paper studies the effects of drilling parameters on the thrust force, adjusted delamination factor and compressive residual strength of uni-directional glass/epoxy resin. The design of the experiment was based on the Taguchi method. The results highlight the importance of the feed rate for maximizing the compressive residual strength of drilled laminates. The Acoustic Emission (AE) technique was also used to monitor both drilling process and compression test. The objective was to establish a correlation between AE parameters and mechanical characteristics. The results reveal that root mean square (RMS) can be used for monitoring thrust force and AE energy for compression force.

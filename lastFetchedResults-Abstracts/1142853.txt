The objective of this study was to assess the impact of adding buttermilk concentrate to the denaturation and microparticulation process of cheese whey protein concentrate. For this purpose, the two concentrates were mixed and co-denatured (pH 4.6, 90 °C,) and homogenized. The presence of buttermilk significantly increased aggregation yield and decreased water-holding capacity of aggregates up to a buttermilk:whey protein ratio of 75:25. Modification of rheological properties suggests that denatured whey protein interacted with casein. A thiol blocker, N-ethylmaleimide, was added before heating to measure the role of disulphide bond formation in the aggregation process. Results showed that both covalent and non-covalent interactions were involved in aggregate formation. Ultrasound treatment was applied during denaturation process and was shown to influence aggregate formation. It appeared that under increased turbulence and cavitation conditions, aggregation yield was increased and water-holding capacity decreased.

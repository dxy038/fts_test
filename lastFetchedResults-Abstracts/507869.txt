Relations between Iran and India, two ancient civilizations, go far back in
history. However, the contemporary politico-economic relations between
these two major Asian powers, especially after the Islamic revolution in Iran
in 1979, are affected by various different domestic, regional and
international elements. The main objective of this research is to analyze the
dominant foreign policy trends in Iran-India relations during the last three
decades. A historical review of the evolution of transitional trends in Iran
and India's foreign policy approaches, especially during the Post-Cold War
era, with an emphasis on the role of different internal, regional and
international elements in shaping these approaches, would bring new light
on the study of relations between these two countries. The effects of these
different approaches on Indo-Iranian relations and the future perspective of
these policies will be analyzed in this paper.

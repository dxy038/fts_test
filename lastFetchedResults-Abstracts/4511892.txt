Integration of electric vehicles (EVs) in distribution circuits introduces challenges such as increase in load demand and voltage drops during peak load hours. These concerns call for a study to evaluate impacts of EV charging on primary and secondary voltages. Hence the objective of the paper is to present practical approaches in carrying out such a study. The paper begins by laying out criteria of circuit simulators for evaluating voltage quality concern. The paper then describes the modeling of three-phase and single-phase distribution circuits, conventional and electric vehicle loads, and their corresponding load profiles. Once simulation models are established, evaluation procedures are described. Circuit parameters for the study include the location of secondary service, the EV load location within a secondary circuit, and the size of the EV load and charger. The paper also describes how results should be interpreted. The simulation tools developed and the analytical approach discussed in the paper will help utilities in evaluating voltage quality impacts of EV loads on their distribution circuits and possibly designing efficient mitigation schemes, addressing the effects of EV charging.

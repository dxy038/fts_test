In this paper, a prevalent type of zero-voltage- transition bidirectional converters is analyzed with the inclusion of the reverse recovery effect of the diodes. The main drawback of this type is missing the soft-switching condition of the main switches at operating duty cycles smaller than 0.5. As a result, soft-switching condition would be lost in one of the bidirectional converter operating modes (forward or reverse modes) since the duty cycles of the forward and reverse modes are complement of each other. Analysis shows that the rectifying diode reverse recovery would assist in providing the soft-switching condition for the duty cycles below 0.5, which is done by a proper design of the snubber capacitor and with no limitation on the rectifying diode current rate at turn-off. Hence, the problems associated with the soft-switching range and the reverse recovery of the rectifying diode are solved simultaneously, and soft-switching condition for both operating modes of the bidirectional converter is achieved with no extra auxiliary components and no complex control. The theoretical analysis for a bidirectional buck and boost converter is presented in detail, and the validity of the theoretical analysis is justified using the experimental results of a 250-W 135- to 200-V prototype converter.

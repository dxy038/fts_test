Voltage stability problem is an emerging phenomenon in planning and operation of modern power systems with high penetration levels of wind generation. The level of voltage stability/instability depends, amongst other factors, on the degree of penetration of wind generations and on their connected locations. The objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of wind generation on voltage stability in transmission networks, consideration the intermittent nature of wind generation and their penetration level. A voltage collapse proximity indicator VCPI, based on network loadability is used to investigate the impact of wind generation on voltage stability. The IEEE 30-bus system is used as a test case, and simulation is carried out using the Powerworld&#174; simulator. Wind generation is connected to the transmission network at buses considered critical due to the value of their voltage magnitude, and the penetration level is varied from 5% to 35% to assess the impact on voltage stability.

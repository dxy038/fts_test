Introduction: Smoking is one of the major factors threatening the health of community, especially the young. It is a complex behavior associated with psycho-social, biochemical and economic factors. Health Belief Model tries to describe health behaviors focusing on beliefs and attitudes.
Objective: This study aims to determine the relationship between four constructs of the Health Belief Model (HBM) (Perceived Severity, Perceived Susceptibility, Perceived Barriers and Perceived Benefits), and cigarette smoking among male students at Guilan University of Medical Sciences.
Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 222 male medical university students of Guilan in 2011. Data were collected using a two part questionnaire including items about demographic features (age, study major, number of children in family,…) and the four HBM constructs. Data analysis was performed using the Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests.
Results: Mean age of the students was 22.3±3.2 years and 87.4% were single. In total, 51 students (23%) were current smoker. Results of Mann- Whitney test showed significant differences in perceived barriers(P=0.002) and perceived benefits(P=0.000) between male smokers and nonsmokers. Results of multivariable logistic regression analysis also indicated that having smoker friends(OR=16.68), age(OR=1.32), mother with high education level(OR=7.51), more perceived barriers(OR=2.195) and low perceived benefits toward non-smoking(OR=0.621)are closely related with smoking.
Conclusion: The results suggest that constructs of HBM can be considered when examining the related Factors with cigarette smoking and developing smoking prevention programs.

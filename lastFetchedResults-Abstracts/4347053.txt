The concept of reuse partitioning in cellular system design is introduced. It is shown that reuse partitioning has the potential for: &#8226; Increasing system capacity over that which can be achieved with a single reuse factor for a given performance objective. &#8226; Affording greater protection to those system users that need it most. &#8226; Being fully compatible with the concepts of overlaid cells and retained channel sets. &#8226; Having a minimal impact on cell-site RF architecture. &#8226; Providing a near continuum of equivalent reuse factors in cellular system design. The implications of reuse partitioning on cellular system performance, growth, channel assignment, RF hardware, supervisory-audio-tone (SAT) assignment, and channel selection and control are discussed.

In mobile Peer-to-Peer networks (MP2P), packet losses are usually shown in bursts due to temporary peer failure or mobile channel disruption. This paper investigates how to apply Forward Error Correction (FEC) interleaving to overcome this issue and provide a guaranteed streaming service in MP2P, where a peer usually receives data from a set of heterogeneous peers through heterogeneous links. Some theories are developed for characterizing the problem, which help us to design a simple spiral packet-source allotment algorithm that implements near perfect FEC interleaving among sources with objective of maximizing throughput subject to an application-specific target packet loss rate. The simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme in aspects of combating burst loss and adaptability to peer/link heterogeneity for offering guaranteed streaming quality with high throughput under MP2P.

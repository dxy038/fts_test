In decision-making process, the index weight is identified as a core issue. The traditional correlation index weight determining method requires the experts to give the weights in the form of definite numbers based on experience. But in many cases , the experts in determining weights only give interval grey number weights which including of both certainty and uncertainty. This article, through a certain mathematical transformations, improved the traditional method of grey correlation degree seeking weights to get the new index weight reflecting in the subjective and objective factors simultaneously. And we applied the new method in the final instance. Our method expands the range of correlation method of seeking weight.

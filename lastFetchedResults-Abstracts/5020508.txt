Natural resource management (NRM) has become an important global issue, due to the increasing population and human activities. Natural ecosystems are exposed to spatial environmental factors and unexpected stochastic disturbances may occur in ecosystems, with concomitant losses or gains of ecological and economic resources. Such spatial environmental factors and disturbances may impede management and recovery strategies for natural resources. In drylands, the water-limited ecosystem, vegetation is strikingly patterned, showing a heterogeneous distribution which has an adverse effect on agriculture productivity. In this study, a robust fuzzy observer-based tracking controller is designed to manage the productivity in spatial agricultural systems under stochastic disturbances. A fuzzy spatial state space model derived via finite difference approach is introduced to represent the nonlinear spatial agricultural system. Based on this model, a fuzzy robust observer-based tracking controller is proposed to control nonlinear spatial agricultural system to track a desired reference trajectory. The main objective of this work is to provide a robust tracking control to efficiently manage nonlinear spatial agricultural systems with stochastic disturbances in the fields to achieve some desired nature resource management or recovery.

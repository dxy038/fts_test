The paper summarizes a joint study by the U.S. Air Force and TASC, Inc. that models aerospace support equipment usage during a deployment of fighter aircraft. The model explains the present role of the equipment, and introduces a possible alternative. The main objective of the study, to replace the current support equipment system while maintaining efficiency, is illustrated. The implementation of the model in IMDE, an object-oriented discrete-event simulation package, is then described. The two options are compared; results are displayed showing the number of sorties aborted with each equipment arrangement

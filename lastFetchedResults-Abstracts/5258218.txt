The objective of this work is to solve the problems of On-board Computer (OBC) in Micro-satellite. With the limit of size and weight, and the requirement of multifunction and high-performance, itpsilas almost impossible to design an eligible Micro-satellite OBC by regular methods. To address this issue, this paper researches reconfiguration technique, and proposes one OBC design based on it. The reconfigurable OBC can achieve the multifunction and high processing ability, and there are several measures to ensure the reliability.

Objective: Mismatch negativities (MMN) elicited by frequency and duration changes in a sequence of repetitive tones were recorded in test and retest sessions from 45 subjects.
Methods: Tones presented with a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of 0.5 s were to be ignored while attention had no instructed focus in one group and was directed to an active visual vigilance task in a second group of subjects.
Results: MMN amplitude was larger for duration deviants, the focus of attention had no systematic effect. Individual replicability of the MMN amplitudes was generally better when duration deviants were used. In addition, directing attention to the visual task increased the retest reliability of the duration deviance MMN. In this condition, the test-retest correlation coefficients were above 0.8 at all frontal scalp sites (0.87 at F4).
Conclusions: The study shows that the deviant type as well as the attentional condition may have substantial effects on the stability and replicability of MMN potentials. The choice of the appropriate task condition is essential for using the MMN in group comparisons and as a diagnostic tool in individual cases.

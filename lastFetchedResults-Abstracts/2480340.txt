Background: Physiotherapy information system is one of health information systems that is used to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of physiotherapy department. Studies have shown that due to usability problems, user interaction with some information systems is difficult. The objective of this study is to evaluate user interaction problems with physiotherapy information system. Materials & Methods: This study is a cross-sectional, descriptive research which is done using heuristic evaluation method. In this study the user interaction problems of a physiotherapy system using in 105 hospitals were identified, classified and rated based on their severities by three evaluators. Data were gathered using a data collection form designed in Excel. Results: In this study 82 unique interactive problems were identified. Most of them with 28% (n=23) were related to unconformity of system design with real world conventions. The mean severity of these problems was major. The lowest numbers were related to the problems; lack of help and documentation in the system and error prevention, with major and minor severity respectively. Conclusions: A number of systems, which are used in many health care centers, such as evaluated system in this study suffer from several problems that endanger user interaction with the systems and can lead to error and patient harm. To identify and eliminate this sort of problems we recommend that usability evaluation of these systems to be carried out regularly to enhance users satisfaction, workflow and patient safety.

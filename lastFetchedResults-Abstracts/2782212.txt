This paper presents the design and implementation of a single-phase on-board bidirectional plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charger that can provide reactive power support to the utility grid in addition to charging the vehicle battery. The topology consists of two-stages: a full-bridge ac-dc boost converter; and a half-bridge bidirectional dc-dc converter. The charger operates in two quadrants in the active-reactive power (PQ) power plane with five different operation modes (i.e., charging-only, charging-capacitive, charging-inductive, capacitive-only, and inductive-only). This paper also presents a unified controller to follow utility PQ commands in a smart grid environment. The cascaded two-stage system controller receives active and reactive power commands from the grid, and results in line current and battery charging current references while also providing a stable dynamic response. The vehicleÂ´s battery is not affected during reactive power operation in any of the operation modes. Testing the unified system controller with a 1.44 kVA experimental charger design demonstrates the successful implementation of reactive power support functionality of PEVs for future smart grid applications.

The main objective of this paper is to obtain improved active suspension control for the full car model. The conventional passive suspension and semi-active suspension systems do not provide passenger comfort and vehicle handling against the road disturbances. To tackle this problem, an adaptive wavelets neuro-fuzzy (AWNF) based control strategy is used for active suspension control. The AWNF control has the robustness abilities and good generalization properties. The performance of the active suspension system is determined by the displacement and acceleration of the vehicle. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme, the full car model is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and subjected to a varying road profile. The performance of the AWNF based active suspension system is compared with passive and semi-active suspension system.

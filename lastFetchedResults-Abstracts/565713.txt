Introduction: Disorder in drinking, fluid deprivation, severe
disabilities, increase in water excretion from kidney and non-kidney route
and increase in salt consumption are the main causes of hypernatremia. The
objective of this study was to determine ocular signs due to hypernatremia
Method: 50 male Wistar rats, weighing 250 + 20 g were allocated
randomly to 5 groups. Test groups consumed 2, 3,3.5 and 4 percent salt
concentrations respectively as potable water, control group used tap water;
with similar living conditions for all groups. Ophthalmic examinations with
slit-lamp and fundus camera were performed. Eye response to light and
manuel stimuli was considered. This experiment with similar condition was
done on pig and rabbit.
Result: Short time using of 2% salt solution was not associated
with fast and significant ocular changes but its prolonged use accompanied
with vascular damage and other ocular signs. Retinal and vitreous
hemorrhages were observed 3-4 days after drinking 3% and higher salt
solutions followed by an increase in serum sodium level. Other ocular signs
in test groups include: vitreous shrinkage, cornea and lens opacities, swelling
of optic disc, blindness, vitreous collapse and finally phthisis bulbi.
Conclusion: By hypernatremia and hyperosmolarity formation,
vitreous lose some of its fluid contents and vitreous shrinkage lead to
vascular damage, retinal and vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment.
Continuous hypernatremia brought conjunctivitis, corneal and lens opacities,
swelling of optic disc, blindness, vitreous collapse and finally phthisis bulbi .

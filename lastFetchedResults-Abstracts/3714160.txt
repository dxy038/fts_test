The main objective of this paper is to discuss various aspects of implementing a specific intrusion-detection scheme on a micro-computer system using fixed-point arithmetic. The proposed scheme is suitable for detecting intruder stimuli which are in the form of transient signals. It consists of two stages: an adaptive digital predictor and an adaptive threshold detection algorithm. Experimental results involving data acquired via field experiments are also included.

The power allocation in decode and forward (DF) relaying for cooperative cognitive radio network (CCRN) with an objective of maximizing energy efficiency (EE) is a constraint nonlinear non-convex fractional programming problem (CNNFPP). The optimization needs to satisfy the primary users interference constraints and secondary users outage constraints. We proposed the optimal power allocation in DF relaying by transforming the CNNFPP power allocation problem into a concave fractional program. We also present numerical results to demonstrate the effect of different network parameters on the EE of CCRN.

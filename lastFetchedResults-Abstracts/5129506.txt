In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of a 2 Dimensional Optical Code Division Multiple Access system (2DOCDMA), with electronic coding and decoding functions. We present a modified construction method of Multi-Wavelength Optical Orthogonal Codes (MWOOC) which permits high flexibility for the code parameters choice. Our objective is to evaluate the 2D code performance, with a Conventional Correlation Receiver (CCR) and a more complex one named Parallel Interference Cancellation receiver (PIC). For example, for a Bit Error Rate (BER)10-9, 30 simultaneous users and an electrical implementation, we show that contrary to the CCR, the use of a PIC receiver leads to workable 2D code solutions.

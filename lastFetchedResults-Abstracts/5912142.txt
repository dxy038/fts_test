This technical paper investigates the correlation of body mass index (BMI) and human physical condition using resonant field imaging system (RFI).The results show the state of health level of students using physiological analysis. Frequency measurement is taken for 40 students including male and female students of electrical engineering around 8 am to 6 pm. The objective is to investigate the relationship of different health condition with different BMI category such as underweight, normal, overweight and obese. Based on the results presented, it is concluded that the samples with normal BMI are generally healthier. This shows that there is a clear and direct psychosomatic connection to the area of bioenergy. It also implies that pure and high frequency electrofield energy is projected from parts of the body.

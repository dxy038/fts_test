This paper considers the centralized spectrum allocations in resource-constrained wireless sensor networks with the following goals: (1) allocate spectrum as fairly as possible, (2) utilize spectrum resource maximally, (3) reflect the priority among sensor data, and (4) reduce spectrum handoff. The problem is formulated into a multi-objective problem, where we propose a new approach to solve it using modified game theory (MGT). In addition, cooperative game theory is adopted to obtain approximated solutions for MGT in reasonable time. The results obtained from numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm allocates spectrum bands fairly with well observing each sensorÂ´s priority and nearly minimal spectrum handoffs.

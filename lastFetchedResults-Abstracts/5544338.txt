The objective of this study is to realize a real-time video/voice over IP (VVoIP) applications that has implemented by a Hadoop cloud computing and it is denoted CLC-IHU. It really outperforms the previous P2P connected VVoIP (called SCTP-IHU) due to the easy-to-use and high-performance video phone call. User does not need to know what is a real IP used to ring a video phone call to the receiver. Next based on client/server architecture users employ web interface to achieve VVoIP connection with thin clients where the seamless handoff delay between base stations is in average 1.631 sec under mobile wireless environment. Therefore video phone call adopts an easy TCP connection instead of the complicated PR-SCTP protocol because of web interface not supported by PR-SCTP. Moreover, CLC-TCP scheme reduces computation load and power consumption dramatically for thin clients. In order to verify the effectiveness and efficiency in access control for preventing illegal intrusions from the outside of the cloud, the rapid facial recognition and fingerprint identification via Hadoop cloud computing has been done successfully within 2.2 seconds to cross-examine the subject identity exactly.

Discusses how recognizing the importance of detailed assessment of INMARSAT capabilities for supporting alerting needs throughout the World, the USSR administration has carried out, in 1984-1987, a series of tests within the elevation angle range 10&#176; to O&#176;. Involved in the tests were Soviet ships equipped with INMARSAT Standard A ship Earth stations. The test objective was to investigate the effects which are essential for establishing reliable communication channels at low elevation angles. A particular attention was given to the telex channel performance as more susceptible to the influence of disturbances. Results of the investigations are described

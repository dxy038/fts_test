The study was conducted in Adama and
Bishoftu towns, on beef produced from Arsi breed cattle with
objective of evaluating beef eating quality with trained
sensory panellists. Beef sample was aseptically collected from
longissimus dorsi chuck for sensory evaluation. Breed type
was determined by phenotypic traits and age was determined
with dentition. The production system being practiced by the
animals selling and buying farmers were subsistence
production systems. Age and production system has
significant effect on tenderness of beef (P  <  0.0001).
Production systems have significant effect on beef juiciness
(P  <  0.05). The trained sensory panellists rated 5.23, 5.20 and
5.47 for beef tenderness, juiciness and flavour of beef
respectively. There was no variation in proximate qualities
due to age and production system effect and their
interactions (P  >  0.05). The protein and fat content of
longissimus dorsi chuck of Arsi cattle were 22.10 and 6.86,
respectively

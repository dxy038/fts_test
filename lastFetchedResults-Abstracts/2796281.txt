The objective of this paper is to investigate the potential of RapidEye imagery in mapping agricultural land cover and land use types in Songnen Plain, northeast China. A new object-oriented decision tree classifier is applied to analyze the classification results of spectral feature inputs from RapidEye imagery. The incorporation of a red edge band in multi-spectral RapidEye sensor has great potential for improving agricultural land cover and land use classification. The highest positive effects are observed for vegetation classes in the study area.

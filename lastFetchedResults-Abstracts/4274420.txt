We propose a multi-objective optimization framework based on genetic algorithms to enhance the performance of a video codec. The framework is designed to jointly minimize the complexity, memory usage in the encoder, bit rate and maximize the quality of the compressed video stream. In particular, the optimization framework is designed to determine the optimum coding parameters for the H.264 AVC video codec in a memory and bandwidth constrained environments. This was demonstrated through extensive experiments and mathematical formulation that resulted in the optimum solution for the optimization problem as the final outcome.

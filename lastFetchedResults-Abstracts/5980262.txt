Admission control in diffserv-based next generation network (NGN) is still objective of the worldwide research (as in the IST projects DAIDALOS II and WEIRD) since the behavior of existing solutions does not comply with the requirements imposed by the infrastructure and the network operators. This paper describes the problem of edge-to-edge admission control in NGN, with a special attention to the admission of multicast traffic, and describes the possible way to design a decision algorithm. Moreover, this paper propose a fuzzy-logic based admission controller that is easy to implement, has a low computational cost and needs only small information, about the network controlled, to take its decision. Extensive OPNET simulations with multicast traffic validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

A module identification numerical optimize method, which based on axiomatic design theory, is proposed. Firstly, a series of property relationship which faces to product lifecycle is divided into four kinds of correlation degree, and then the integrated relationship matrix of product component is obtained. Secondly, the optimization function of module identification which based on the principle of axiomatic design (namely, close cohesion and loose coupling) is established. Thirdly, the numerical optimization method of the product module identification is constituted, using genetic simulation annealing algorithm. Some key issues such as creating the synthesis relationship matrix, building the objective optimization function, disposing the single component module, coding the chromosome and judging the new chromosome validity are solved. An example is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the related approaches proposed.

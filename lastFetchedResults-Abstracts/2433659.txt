Mathematical multi-conditional functions are of many applications in the field of water resources management. Throughout the present Study, the Logical Genetic Programming (LGP) rule (along with an integration of these functions) is employed to derive reservoir hedging rule in the operating intervals of the baseline and climate change. The most appropriate values of release in the entire interval are extracted as based on the available water. The objective function is to minimize Long-term Shortage Ratio (LSR). The results obtained from the extraction of hedging rule in the supply of demand rationing rule by LGP are compared with the Traditional Genetic Programming (TGP) results for the baseline and climate change conditions using efficiency indices. The results show as based on the employed LGP approach and under conditions of climate change, relative to baseline indices, the reliability would decrease (34%), vulnerability increase (37%) and while resiliency being decreased (29%). Also, based on TGP and in the same situation the indices of reliability, vulnerability and resiliency would respectively, decrease (25%), increase (15%) and decrease (14%).

This paper proposed bidirectional DC-DC converter employing soft switching technique. Compared to conventional bidirectional converters, the main switches of proposed converter are operated without switching losses. Moreover, auxiliary switches have been implemented, and the switches are operated under zero current switching (ZCS) condition. To verify the validity of the proposed converter, mode analysis, simulation and experimental results are presented.

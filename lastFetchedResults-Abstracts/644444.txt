Abstract 
The objective of this study was to investigate electrolyte alterations in urine and blood of cows diagnosed with Left displacement of the abomasum (LDA) and to identify the occurrence of paradoxical aciduria in these cows from July 2007 to April 2009. Fifty two cows were diagnosed as LDA by Shahrekord University Veterinary Service clinicians. Blood samples were collected from jugular vein and urine samples were obtained from all cows by spontaneous micturition. Also, fecal score was determined (1, 2, 3 and 4). Out of 52 cows, twelve developed paradoxical aciduria (23.07 %) with mean urine pH 5.86±0.56 and forty did not develop paradoxical aciduria (76.93%) with mean urine pH 8±0.1. Cows that developed displacement of the abomasum and paradoxical aciduria had lower serum calcium, Magnesium, phosphorous and potassium than without paradoxical aciduria. The serum sodium was higher in animals with paradoxical aciduria than those had not paradoxical aciduria. The urine calcium, Magnesium and phosphorous in the group that developed paradoxical aciduria was higher than the group that did not develop paradoxical aciduria. In cows with paradoxical aciduria the urine sodium and potassium was lower than those without paradoxical aciduria. Fecal score 4, 3, and 2 was observed in 55.55, 33.33 and 11.12 % of cows with paradoxical aciduria and fecal score 1, 2 and 3 observed in 50, 40 and 10 % of those without paradoxical aciduria respectively. Paradoxical aciduria was not occurred in the all of cases of LDA except in those that developed diarrhea and dehydration. Therefore in the cases of LDA that occurred paradoxical aciduria the veterinarians must attention to correct the abnormality in blood electrolytes than those without paradoxical aciduria.

The operation of a Newton s law system generalized irreversible Carnot-engine with heat
resistance, heat leakage and internal dissipation is viewed as a production process with exergy
as its output. The finite-time exergoeconomic performance optimization of the engine is investigated
by taking the profit maximation criterion as the objective. The focus of this paper is
to search the compromised optimization between economics (profit) and the utilization factor
(efficiency) for finite-time irreversible cycles. The analytical formulae concerning optimal profit
versus efficiency, the maximum profit and the corresponding efficiency are derived

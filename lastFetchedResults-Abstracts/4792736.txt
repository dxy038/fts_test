Modern welding controllers play many crucial roles to achieve multi-objective optimization of arc welding processes. Their fast response and robust V-I characteristics help achieve better arc stability, efficiency, reduce weight and cost, maintain constant current of shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) using all type of electrodes over wide application range. It, however, as side effects, is susceptible to cause increased health hazards to derail multi-objective optimization program. In this pure manual process, arc is extinguished in constant current by increasing the arc length till the controller can sustain. In that process, it produces large unusable heat that particularly causes a lot of discomfort to the welder and co-workers. The present article recommends, through practical implementation, the use of sliding surface in sliding mode control (SMC) to optimize arc light intensity and heat generation in arc column in order to convert mechanism of manual arc extinction of the process welder friendly.

The objective of this paper is the accurate prediction of segmental duration in a Spanish text-to-speech system. There are many parameters that affect duration, but not all of them are always relevant. We present a complete environment in which to decide which parameters are more relevant and the best way to code them. This work is the continuation of Cordoba et al. (1999), where all efforts were dedicated to an unrestricted-domain database for a male voice. In this case, we are considering a female voice in a restricted-domain environment. This restricted-domain offers several advantages to the modeling: the variation in the different patterns is reduced, and so most of the decisions we have made about the parameters are now based in more significant results. So, the conclusions that we present now show clearly which parameters are best. The system is based in a neural network absolutely configurable

The objective of this paper is to introduce a TSK (Takagi-Sugeno-Kang) fuzzy model-based servo control design approach for an active oscillation suppression stage using triple configuration of hybrid electromagnets as active force generators. Furthermore, the authors apply zero order disturbance observers to estimate not only velocities but also equivalent external disturbance acting on gap clearance of hybrid electromagnet. Validity of the proposed method is verified through experimental studies

The paper presents Ultra-Wideband system model as a point to point wireless-USB link in the home network for high speed transmission of gray scale video. Objective of High speed video data transmission is achieved by using multidimensional Hermite pulse shape modulation (2d-5d) at the transmitter. The proposed UWB system is cost effective as it uses simplified receiver structure instead of rake receiver. Video to be transmitted is compressed by using lossless algorithm to retain its original quality at the receiver. The paper investigates the performance of the proposed system for higher data rates with simplified hardware over the transmission distances of 4m and 10m. The BER simulation results of the said system over UWB channel models CM1 and CM3 have been assimilated for video transmission speeds up to 3.3 GHz using of 5-dimensional Hermite modulation. The received video is tested for its quality using two measures PSNR and SSIM.

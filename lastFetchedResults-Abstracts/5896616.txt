The objective of this paper is to propose an approach to decentralized resilient networked robustly exponentially stabilizing with H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-norm bound &#947; observer-based controller for a class of uncertain symmetric composite continuous-time systems with nonlinearities. Such systems are composed of identical nominal subsystems, symmetric nominal interconnections, norm-bounded parameter uncertainties, and nonlinear perturbations. The effect of data-packet dropout and communication delays between the plant and the controller is included in the controller design. It is shown how this methodology can lead to a reduced-order control design with sampled delayed feedback. A delay-dependent approach and additive gain perturbations in the gain matrices are used to obtain a robustly exponentially stable overall closed-loop system with H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-norm bound &#947; by using a decentralized control architecture.

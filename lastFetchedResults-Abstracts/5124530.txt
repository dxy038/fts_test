Technology Assessment is the study and evaluation of new technologies. It is based on the premise that developments and discoveries within the scientific and medical communities are relevant to the population at large. Proper technology assessment is an approach that is vital to address the current limitations of the worker´s compensation system. The aim of this presentation is to discuss the need for objective diagnostic tools, such as Electrodiagnostic Functional Assessment (EFA), in the workers´ compensation system with a focus on musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). Workers´ compensation musculoskeletal claims may benefit from a wireless assessment to diagnose and monitor soft tissue injuries and this technology may be applicable to wellness and healthcare programs.

This article deals with selecting the best point of connection for shunt active power filters in multibus power distribution systems. In this article, a numerical analysis based on analytical formulation that uses the power distribution system voltage and current transfer matrices is derived providing a user friendly and general tool to determine the most adequate point of connection for shunt active filters, improving the compensation effectiveness. The validity of the developed method is verified by theory and computer simulation. The main objective of shunt active power filters is the elimination of current components that affect power distribution efficiency, such as harmonics and reactive components.

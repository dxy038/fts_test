The objective of this study was to analyse the associations between ovine prion protein (PrP) genotypes and reproduction traits in three German meat sheep breeds. Reproduction traits were age at first early lambing, age at first late lambing, first lambing interval, second lambing interval and total number of lambs born. The data set included 595 genotyped German Texel sheep among 5225 recorded sheep, 351 genotyped German Black-Headed Mutton among 10 177 sheep and 282 genotyped Suffolk sheep among 2849 sheep. Linear animal models were employed for the analysis of the PrP-genotype effect. The PrP-genotype effect was analysed by comparing the most frequent PrP genotypes ARR/ARR, ARR/ARQ, and ARQ/ARQ. In a more general analysis three PrP genotype classes of animals with two, one or no copy of the ARR allele were compared. In most cases, no significant associations were found between the PrP genotypes and the reproduction traits investigated. Only for the traits age at first early lambing in German Texel and second lambing interval in German Black-Headed Mutton and Suffolk could a significant association with the PrP genotype be observed.

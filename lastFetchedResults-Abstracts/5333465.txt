Proximity services are a particular class of location-based services (LBS) in which a subscriber is alerted when other participants (called buddies) are nearby. Existing works in the field of privacy preservation in LBS propose techniques specifically designed for this type of service. The objective of this demo is to present the Pcube system that makes it possible to visually show the different performances of these techniques in terms of privacy protection and precision of the service. The system includes a server component providing the proximity service, a web-based client application and a client application for mobile devices. Four different privacy-preserving techniques existing in literature have been implemented and will be compared during the demo, with a particular focus on the evaluation of the recently proposed Longitude protocol.

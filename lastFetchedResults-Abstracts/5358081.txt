A VANET consists of vehicles equipped with on board units (OBUs) that can communicate with each other and the road side base stations. Due to the mobility and sparse distribution of vehicles, the delivery delay of messages in the VANET is mainly caused by the message transmissions between vehicles. The message delivery delay directly impacts the deployment of applications in VANET, and hence, an in-depth study of message delivery delay in the VANET is significant. In this paper, we focused on the investigation of the message delivery delay in the V2V stage with a bidirectional setting. The bidirectional traffic was modeled as a combination of two Poisson point processes. Based on the sub-additive ergodic theory, we found theoretically that the message delivery delay has a linear relationship with the message forwarding distance. Further, the upper bound of the coefficient of the linear relationship has an exponential polynomial relation with the density of vehicles on the road and decreases with the increment of the velocity of the traffic.

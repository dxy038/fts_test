Therefore, introducing the foreign capital with certain scale and structure safely and effectively to debtor countries appears very important. On the assumption that the debtor country only borrows 5 kinds of money at the beginning of the loan period, i.e., U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, HK. dollar, pound and euro and with the loan period of five years, we set up the multi-objective linear programming model of the optimal currency structure. Then Matlab mathematical software is used to solve the model. Finally, the analytic conclusions are given.

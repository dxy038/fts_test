Objective
rs like BisGMA (Bisphenol-A-glycidyldimethacrylate) and comonomers like TEGDMA (triethyleneglycoldimethacrylate) are used in dental restorative materials in order to build up the three-dimensional network of filling materials. Since earlier investigations revealed uptake and subsequent metabolism of unpolymerized remainders of (co)monomers, the present experiment investigates the metabolic urine pattern of guinea pigs (n = 4) after application of TEGDMA or BisGMA (each dose = 0.02 mmol/kg body weight = 100%), respectively.
s
e investigations BisGMA was pre-dissolved in DMSO and subsequently diluted with 0.9% NaCl solution (final DMSO concentration 1%) and TEGDMA was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl solution. The solutions were administered with a gastric tube into the animals. Control animals received either 0.9% NaCl or 0.9% NaCl solution with 1% DMSO solution.
s
24 h in collected urine the following metabolites were identified. After administration of TEGDMA (mean relative concentration of administered substances) ± s.d. [%]; n = 4): unchanged TEGDMA: 12 ± 1.5%, MA: 2.4 ± 0.8%, and triethyleneglycol: 35 ± 2.2%. After administration of BisGMA (mean ± s.d. [%]; n = 4): unchanged BisGMA: 11.4 ± 2.7%, MA: 2.2 ± 0.6%, and bisphenol-A-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)ether: 60.1 ± 5.2%).
sion
ther metabolites like the previously identified intermediate 2,3-epoxymethacrylic acid and derived reaction products were identified in the urine, indicating that these metabolites must have reacted further.

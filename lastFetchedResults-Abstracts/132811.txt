Background.: Ascorbic acid with low & high density has agonistic & antiagonistic effects on both dopaminergic & gglutamatergic systems respectively . These two systems directly affect learning & memory.
Objective: To determine the effect of ascorbic acid on spatial learning.
Methods : Through an experimental study (Qazvin 1998) male rats (220-280 gr) were trained in an 8-arms radial maze apparatus. Ascorbale (100,500,1000 mg/kg,LP) was injected to the subjects & some rats recieved ascorhate (4,8 rig/up that were injected into Ventral Tegmental Area (VIA).
Findings: The injection of Ascorbate (100-500 mg/kg LP) facilitates spatial learning dose-dependently but 1000 mg/kg of Ascorbate impairer it.
The injection of 4ug/ul of Ascorbate into VIA facilitates spatial learning whereas injection of 8ug/ul of Ascorbate impaires it.
Conclusion : Ascarbate facilitates spatial learning when used with low or average dose and conversely impaires it when used with high dose.

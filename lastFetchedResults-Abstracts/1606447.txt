In this paper, the long-run dynamics of a resonant converter is studied. The modelling of the resonant converter can be done using various approximations and the long-run dynamics of the two dimensional cases were earlier analysed. In this paper, we discuss results that can be extended to the three dimensional case. It seems that limit cycles describe the long-run dynamics in important situations in the three dimensional case, too. Our objective is to relate the limit cycles found previously in the two-dimensional case to those found now in the three dimensional approximation.

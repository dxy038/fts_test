The objective of this task force report is to provide an
examplanation of the phenomena of very fast transients which can
occur in Gas Insulated Substations. The simulation of the GlS for this
iype of transients should be suitable for frequencies from 100 kHz up
to 50 MHz. The corresponding equivalent circuits developed in
previous work of CIGRE have been reported. Accuracy of the
simulation of this phenomenon and verification with field
measurements are given. An example of a GIS calculation with
detailed input data is presented which could be used for the
recalculation of the results.

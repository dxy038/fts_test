This paper describes the process of setting up a hierarchical decision model for non-profit organizations to use for evaluation and selection of projects. Based on the Constrained Weighted Factor Scoring Model for project evaluation and selection, referring to the Mission-Objective-Goal-Strategy-Action(MOGSA) Model and the Expectancy Theory, we set up a prototype for the project selection of non-profit organizations. Based on the prototype model for project selection of non-profit organizations, we investigated the Non-profit Organization S by interview and survey questionnaire, and then set up the model for them to select projects. The weights of criteria are derived from the survey questionnaire and demonstrate how we use this model to assist the decision making process with three charity event projects. By doing this, we built up the model for them to improve their decision making process in project evaluation and selection.

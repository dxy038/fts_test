This paper presents a new approach in decision making to identify all the relations among the important variables of supply chain and business strategies, as well as to choose the best consistent strategies. The Analytical network process not only is capable of supporting the multi-criteria decision making in systems with feedback and inter-dependency, but also is applicable in multi-objective decisions. Since any gap between supply chain and business strategies can cause risks and additional costs for organization, this paper proposes new integrated framework using ANP to choose the optimal strategies guarantying their consistency with each other.

The assessment of the conditions of the equipment installed in any network is of paramount importance to reach the target objective of the quality of the supply. Usually, the conditions assessment is achieved by the measurement of some quantities linked to some ageing phenomena, the measurements can be carried out both during service or out of service conditions. This technique is normally applied to the most important equipment such as large power transformer due mainly to the complexity and the cost of the of the monitoring systems. Thank to the new technology, nowadays it is possible develop reliable monitor systems to be installed also in important but low cost equipment. The paper reports the description of a system developed to monitor transformers in MV/LV substations, together with the results obtained in the first months of activity.

A solution to the adaptive control of constrained robots in the presence of uncertainty in the robot model parameters is presented. The controller design is based on a singular systems model representation and fixed controller design. The adaptive control law consists of the computed torque controller plus the introduction of the parameter estimates and an additional compensation through an extra signal. Some properties of the reduced form robot model are presented and exploited to prove the asymptotic tracking properties of the adaptive controller. Also, the inclusion of the impedance control objective allows the accommodation of tangential forces that may appear in the constrained task

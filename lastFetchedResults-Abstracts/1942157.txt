The objective of the present work was: (i) to enable biodiesel production from acid waste lard; (ii) to study the esterification reaction as possible pre-treatment at different temperatures, catalyst amount and reaction times; (iii) to evaluate biodiesel quality according to EN 14214 after basic transesterification of the pre-treated fat; and (iv) to predict the impact of using such waste as raw material in mixture with soybean oil. Temperature and catalyst amount were the most important reaction conditions which mostly affected biodiesel quality, namely viscosity and purity. The selected pre-treatment conditions were 65 °C, 2.0 wt% H2SO4 and 5 h, which allowed obtaining a product with a viscosity of 4.81 mm2 s−1 and a purity of 99.6 wt%. The proposed pre-treatment was effective to enable acid wastes as single raw materials for biodiesel production with acceptable quality; however, low yields were obtained (65 wt%). Alkali transesterification of a mixture of waste lard and soybean oil resulted in a product with a purity of 99.8 wt% and a yield of 77.8 wt%, showing that blending might be an interesting alternative to recycle such wastes. Also, because in addition to using conventional and relatively economical processes, some biodiesel properties depending on the raw material composition (such as the iodine value) might even be improved.

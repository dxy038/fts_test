There is interest in growing peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) for forage, but little is known about the nutritive value and forage quality of modern cultivars. The objective of this study was to compare the chemical composition and in sacco degradation kinetics of three cultivars of peanuts (cv. ‘C99-R’, ‘Georgia-01R’, and ‘York’) at either stage 2 or 8 maturities when fresh and field-cured. Herbage yield was at least 3000 kg DM/ha for all cultivars at both maturities. Crude protein (CP) was greater (P &lt; 0.0001) at R2 stage than at R8 stage; whereas, neutral detergent fiber (aNDF), acid detergent fiber, and Lignin (sa) were greater (P &lt; 0.01) at R8 than R2 maturity stages. Water soluble carbohydrate and acid detergent insoluble nitrogen was not different (P &gt; 0.07) among cultivars, maturity stage, or harvest forms. In vitro true digestibility was greatest (P &lt; 0.02) for C99-R and least for York. Undegradable intake protein concentration was greatest (P &lt; 0.04) in York and least for C99-R. Maturity had a greater effect on the degradation kinetics than harvest form or cultivar. The dry matter (DM) and CP in the soluble wash fraction (A) and insoluble but degradable fraction (B) and the effective ruminal degradability were greater among all cultivars and both harvest forms of the R2 maturity stage than the R8. The undegradable DM, aNDF, and CP in the undegradable fraction were greatest (P &lt; 0.002) for all three cultivars at R8 maturity. The rate of degradation of DM and CP in the B fraction was faster (P &lt; 0.001) at R2 stage than at R8 stage; whereas, rate of aNDF degradation was not different (P &gt; 0.09) among treatments. Lag of DM, aNDF, or CP degradation was not different (P &gt; 0.1) among treatments. The cultivars C99-R and Georgia-01R are recommended for further feeding trials.

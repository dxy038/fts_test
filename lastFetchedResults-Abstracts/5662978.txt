The general macroscopic examination of semen evaluation includes sperm density, concentration, motility and morphology. Among these general evaluations, the morphology assessment is widely considered to be one of the most important evaluations of male sperm characteristics. With the use of computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) techniques, more objective, accurate and precise outcomes of sperm morphology assessment can be obtained, comparing to manual methodology. In this article we will make a brief introduction to the common CASA techniques, commercial products and future work.

Wireless networks, while evolving to provide an unprecedented variety of services, often encounter heterogeneous nodes. In the mean time, ultra-wideband (UWB) link emerges as a promising physical layer candidate for a wide range of wireless networks. In addition to the potential of very high data rate, the ultra-wide bandwidth also provides enhanced flexibility for transceiver designs with variable complexity, which is particularly suitable for networks with heterogeneous nodes. However, to establish physical communication links between nodes with distinct complexity requirements, asymmetric UWB transceivers need to be designed. Towards this objective, we utilize their similarity with multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems and deploy the geometric mean decomposition (GMD) approach to achieve optimally in terms of both channel throughput and bit error rate (BER). Analysis and simulations corroborate the effectiveness of our transceiver designs

This paper addresses dispersion curve numerical computations for specific ribbed plates. Precisely, wave propagation in
the direction parallel to the ribs is the main objective. First, analytical calculations are performed for such ribbed plates
after which the results are compared to a more general numerical procedure. This procedure reuses a reduced finite element
model of the ribbed plate and extracts guided multi-mode propagation parameters. Comparisons of analytical and numerical
estimations show very good agreement. Finally, the experimental results obtained in the companion paper are considered.
Specifically, experimental and numerical dispersion curves are compared over a wide frequency range. Close
concordance is obtained allowing the dispersion curves to be fully interpreted.

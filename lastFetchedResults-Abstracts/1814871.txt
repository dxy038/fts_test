The location-allocation problem is one of the effective and efficient decision-making model in association with Facility Design topic. The requirements related to establishment and facility location selection, according to slightly criteria, is called locating. The severity of the damage caused by lack of proper locating as obvious and in many cases, its damages are irreparable. Among these cases, is locating of medical emergency services that the damages are fatal and irreparable. In this research, in order to locate the Assistance centers (emergency services) in district six of Tehran, the synthetic model of set covering problem and multi objective planning have been used. The objectives of maximizing the whole covered population and minimizing the whole transportation distances from demand locations to allocated servers, were taken into consideration. After coding the model via incremental simulated annealing algorithm in MATLAB software, final ranking of options has been done by utilizing REGIME technique. The conclusions showed that districts 4 ( Yousef Abad â€“ Amir Abad ), 8 ( Shariati Sindokht ), 9 ( Jahad Square), 12 ( Behjat Abad ), and 17 ( Valiasr Square) are chosen as proper locations to allocate unreach centers.

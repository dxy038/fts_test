Topographic profile reconstruction and ground surface change detection are actually being measured by SAR and differential SAR interferometry. The deal is how topography is estimated from interferometry especially the relative sensitivity of measured radar phase to topography and changes in topography. The objective of this paper is to combine several DEM (Digital Elevation Model) resulting from different interferometric processing by taking into account the coherence information in order to improve the topographic profile accuracy. For that purpose different conjunctive operators are used in data fusion processing. The resulted digital elevation models are evaluated using Mean Square Error (MSE) according to a local reference DEM.

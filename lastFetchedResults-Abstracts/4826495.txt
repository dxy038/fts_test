This paper proposes two reduced switch count AC-AC converters. The proposed topologies allow single-phase to single-phase power conversion. The converters provide bidirectional power flow and power factor control. A control strategy is proposed to obtain the maximum voltage rating of the converters. The system can be used for applications in which the load operates with frequency constant. Experimental and simulated results are presented.

The influence of external neutron sources in the process to obtain the criticality condition is estimated. To reach this objective, the three-dimensional neutron diffusion equation in two groups of energy is solved, for a subcritical PWR reactor core with external neutron sources. The results are compared with the solution of the corresponding problem without external neutron sources, that is an eigenvalue problem. The method developed for this purposes it makes use of both the nodal method (for calculation of the neutron flux) and the finite differences method (for calculation of the adjoint flux). A coarse mesh finite difference method was developed for the adjoint flux calculation, which uses the output of the nodal expansion method. The results regarding the influence of the external neutron source presence for attaining criticality have shown that far from criticality it is necessary to calculate the reactivity values of the system.

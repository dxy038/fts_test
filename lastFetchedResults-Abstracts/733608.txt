Objective.
It has been suggested that the promotion of moderate-intensity physical activity has created a widespread belief that moderate activity offers greater health benefits than vigorous activity. The present study was designed to test this hypothesis in Britain, where moderate activity has solely been recommended since 1995.
Methods.

Nationally representative survey of 1191 Britons aged 16–65 surveyed from March 3rd to May 12th 2006.
Results.

In support of the hypothesis, 56% of men and 71% of women aged 25–65 indicated that moderate activity offered greater health benefits than vigorous activity and indicated that moderate activity was recommended.
Conclusions.

Policymakers have an obligation to equip the public to make fully informed decisions about physical activity and health. British physical activity guidelines should be amended because most men and women erroneously believe that moderate activity offers greater health benefits than vigorous activity.

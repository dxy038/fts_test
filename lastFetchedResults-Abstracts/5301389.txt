Broadband over power-line (BPL) is a relatively new ground breaking technology that may provide, in the not too distant future, many innovations in the broadband market,. It is a technology capable of sending data signals through the power lines thus enabling the possibility of a local area network (LAN) or Internet access via the power-lines and power sockets in our home. In this project we explore the possibility of the diffusion of this technology in Jamaica, and also conclude on the feasibility of its implantation as both a means of setting up a LAN and as a means of broadband Internet access. Our sources vary from previous publications on the technology, and also surveys conducted on students at the University of Technology. A qualitative research was undertaken. The main objective of this research was to investigate the possibilities of broadband over power-line technology, as compared to other existing network solutions (WiFi, Ethernet cabling). The feasibility of its practical implementation was also explored in the study. We also carried out three implementations of the technology, to asses the capabilities and limitations of the BELKIN BPL adapters that were purchased for the study. Our findings are illustrated throughout the body of this research.

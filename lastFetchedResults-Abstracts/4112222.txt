This paper present a fast disparity estimation algorithm based on limited range, directional search and selective sample decimation is presented. The proposed algorithm has focused on reduction of complexity while retaining good objective performance. The simulation results show: that complexity can be significantly reduced while the PSNR for Y, Cb and Cr is close to the one of full search. In addition, the entropy for disparity vectors is reduced compared to the one of full search

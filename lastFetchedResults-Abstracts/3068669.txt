Testing of VLSI circuits can cause generation of excessive heat which can damage the chips under test. In the random testing environment, high-performance CMOS circuits consume significant dynamic power during testing because of enhanced switching activity in the internal nodes. Our work focuses on the fact that power minimization is a traveling salesman problem (TSP). We explore application of local search and genetic algorithms to test set reordering and perform a quantitative comparison to previously used deterministic techniques. We also consider reduction of the original test set as a dual-objective optimization problem, where switching activity and fault coverage are the two objective functions.

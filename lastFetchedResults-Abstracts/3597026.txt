In this paper, a centralized volt/VAr control (VVC) algorithm for a distribution management system is presented. The algorithm is based on the oriented discrete coordinate descent method and takes into account all the optimization objectives of interest in distribution system analysis: minimum power loss, power demand or the number of control steps to keep the system within constraints. Although the optimization method used belongs to the traditional class of combinatorial integer programming, the algorithm provides good speed for real-time application. Numerical examples illustrate how well the VVC algorithm works for the different types of objective functions and itÂ´s advantages in comparison with other possible optimization strategies

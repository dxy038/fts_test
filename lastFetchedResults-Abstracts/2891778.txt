This paper presents a study of the impact of Distributed Generation (DG) in the operational planning and design of Medium Voltage (MV) distribution networks. The proposed model considers the planning of MV networks for reducing power losses, voltage drop and investments in reinforcements using Genetic Algorithm (GA). Planning MV distribution networks involves cable replacement, sizing and positioning of capacitor and DG and phase load balancing. The objective function to be minimized includes operational costs of proposed changes, power losses and voltage constraints. A power flow for radial distribution networks based on a backward/forward sweep using current summation was developed to validate the solutions.

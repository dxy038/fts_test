Objective
iewed our experience with dilation of the upper urinary tract caused by the conglutination of distal ureters after orthotopic neobladder reconstruction using the split-cuff nipple ureteral reimplant technique.
als and methods
anuary 2000 to April 2007, 250 consecutive patients underwent radical cystectomy and orthotopic neobladder reconstruction. Ureterointestinal anastomosis was performed using the split-cuff nipple technique in 291 renoureteral units. The patients from a single center were followed up for a mean period of 8 months (range 1â€“22) after surgery. We incised the conglutination band using a transurethral endoscope. Patient characteristics, endoscopic technique, measurement of serum creatinine levels, and results of ultrasonography, cystoscopy, and excretory urography were collected.
s
ephrosis was found in 8 patients (14 renoureteral units) due to the conglutination of the distal ureters to each other (n = 6) or to the neobladder wall (n = 2). After the incision procedure, seven patients had obvious improvement in renal function and hydronephrosis, and their symptoms disappeared. In 1 patient, hydronephrosis developed again because of ureteroenteric stenosis after 7 months and was resolved by open surgical revision. The hydronephrosis had improved greatly in this patient by 5 months after revision.
sion
tination of the distal ureters is a cause of hydronephrosis after orthotopic neobladder reconstruction using the reimplant technique with the split-cuff nipple. Cystoscopy is mandatory in following up patients who have hydronephrosis with the split-cuff nipple ureteral reimplant technique, not only to confirm the diagnosis but to treat the complication by incising the conglutination band. Continued follow-up is required to evaluate the long-term results of this treatment.

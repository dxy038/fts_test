Modular photovoltaic (PV) power conditioning systems (PCSs) require a high-efficiency dc-dc converter stage capable of regulation over a wide input voltage range for maximum power point tracking. In order to mitigate ground leakage currents and to be able to use a high-efficiency, nonisolated grid-tied inverter, it is also desirable for this microconverter to provide galvanic isolation between the PV module and the inverter. This paper presents a novel, isolated topology that is able to meet the high efficiency over a wide input voltage range requirement. This topology yields high efficiency through low circulating currents, zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and low-current switching of the primary side devices, ZCS of the output diodes, and direct power transfer to the load for the majority of switching cycle. This topology is also able to provide voltage regulation through basic fixed-frequency pulsewidth modulated (PWM) control. These features are able to be achieved with the simple addition of a secondary-side bidirectional ac switch to the isolated series resonant converter. Detailed analysis of the operation of this converter is discussed along with a detailed design procedure. Experimental results of a 300-W prototype are given. The prototype reached a peak power stage efficiency of 98.3% and a California Energy Commission (CEC) weighted power stage efficiency of 98.0% at the nominal input voltage.

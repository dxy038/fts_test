Objectives To (1) highlight the profile of the needs for
care among a sample of persons with schizophrenia, using
the Camberwell Assessment of Needs (CAN-EU), in
comparison with the international data; (2) assess the
association of patientsâ€™ needs with socio-demographics,
clinical characteristics and objective quality of life (QOL);
and (3) compare the perceptions of patients with those of
the staff.
Method Consecutive outpatients in stable condition were
interviewed with the CAN-EU and measures of QOL and
psychopathology.
Results There were 130 patients (68.5 % men, mean age
36.8). The highest frequency of unmet needs was for
money (29.2 %). About a fifth of the subjects expressed
unmet needs for six other items, including accommodation.
The mean total needs was 8.67(7.1), the total met needs
was 5.29 and total unmet needs was 3.38. The dimension
with the highest frequency (40 %) of unmet needs (functioning)
is constituted by items that are related to family
care at home. Staff identified significantly more needs than
patients. Higher levels of needs were significantly associated
with severity of psychopathology and negative affect,
and not participating in outdoor activities. The mean
number of needs was similar to reports from developing
countries and higher than those from European countries.
The met/unmet need ratio was similar to European data.
Conclusion Despite free health services and family support,
a number of our treated community-dwelling persons
with schizophrenia had problems meeting basic and healthcare
needs. The findings call for a consideration of techniques
for enhancing the capability of families to cope with
the care of patients

Online social networks, the modern social platform in creating connectivity, and social relations it is forming and encouraging are far-reaching in its capacity to connect and interconnect people. The connected space that has multiple interconnections created a network which is global, social and cultural. ´Third space´ is thinking differently of the significance and the meanings of space by scaling beyond the inadequacy of dualism, as in mental and physical space. The discourse on Third space emerges to set aside the ´either/or´ manner of this dualistic categorizing to encompass ´both/and also´ logic that allows an ´Other´ set of choices. This study is an initial step towards a hypothetical stance which would examine the discourse on Third space in relation to the networked social media with the eventual objective of arguing that networked interactive space is the Third space.

Firstly, we analyze abroad software quality evaluating status quo, put forward a fuzzy synthesis evaluating model based on the principle of information diffusion, with teaching software´s specific condition, synthesis consideration and evaluating criteria´s special instance. This method not only can educe scientific, accurate, objective evaluating results quickly and conveniently, but also overcomes traditional method´s disadvantage of information distortion effectively, so that it has good using effectiveness in practical application of the simulating teaching software evaluating electronic business.

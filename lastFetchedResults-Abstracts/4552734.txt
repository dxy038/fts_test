This paper presents a microcontroller based health monitoring system intended to monitor and early detect situations when heart rate and blood oxygen level are out of their safe ranges, or presents uncommon fluctuations in time. The main objective of this project is to prevent emergency situations by informing the patient to take actions before his health condition get worse and needs emergency medical care. The patient can take his medicine or suspend current activity that caused system alerts, like going up the stairs or emotional affecting activities. Monitoring scene is at home, sometimes the patient feels no pain or other symptoms that indicate that he is in danger, when symptoms are present it is more difficult to treat the patient. We purpose a low cost mobile monitoring and alerting device, which communicate with a personal computer located in the range of a wireless or Bluetooth network and automatic analyze and record data into database for later review. In this paper we present hardware and software structure of the system, operation theory, implementing costs, power consumption and experimental results involving adult persons. We made three type of experiments: at first we monitored Pulse and Oxygen saturation level during sleep, then effort while going up the stairs, and in third experiment, we analyzed non regular heart beats.

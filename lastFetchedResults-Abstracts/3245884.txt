Today millions of people suffer from a condition called Tinnitus or tinnitus described as enigmatic in the literature due to the lack of clinical diagnostic tools. To date, there are many diagnostic methods for determining the psychoacoustic characteristics of the disease, none have been merely when definitive diagnosis of a lens, on the contrary depends largely on the patientÂ´s description, making diagnosis and subjective clinical unreliability having no actual physical record of it. Therefore, it was decided to test the hypothesis proposed by Dr. Ramiro Vergara, which states that all have a sound source Tinnitus real, and design and implement a biomedical equipment capable of capturing the sound signals generated in the ear of patients with this Acufenometro condition called Objective. The main purpose of this paper is to show the development of the computer tool designed for the objective determination of Tinnitus and laboratory testing and in patients who demonstrate the veracity of the claims of the hypothesis of Dr. Vergara.

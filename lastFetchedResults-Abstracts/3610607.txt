This paper addresses the problem of assessing distortions produced by watermarking 3D meshes. In particular, a new methodology for subjective evaluation of the quality of 3D objects is proposed and implemented. Two objective metrics derived from measures of surface roughness are then proposed and their efficiency to predict the perceptual impact of 3D watermarking is assessed and compared with the state of the art. Results obtained show good correlations between the proposed objective metrics and subjective assessments by human observers

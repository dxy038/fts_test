BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Menopause is one of the most critical periods in a woman’s life. The symptoms that women experience during this stage are among the most important health care challenges. This study aimed to investigate the effect of self-directed learning on the early symptoms of menopause (primary outcome) and the frequency of hot flashes (secondary outcome).
METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 124 postmenopausal women, whose medical records were available at Vali-Asr Health Center, were evaluated in Islamshahr city in 2014. The subjects were allocated to intervention (self-directed learning) and control groups (62 subjects per group) via random cluster sampling. For the purpose of training, three booklets, including the symptoms of menopause and methods of prevention, were given to participants on a specific day during three consecutive weeks. Early menopause symptoms were assessed using Greene scale (0-63) before and 4 weeks after the intervention. Data were analyzed using generalized linear model (IRCT code: 201305063027N25).
FINDINGS: There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of demographic characteristics or the mean Greene score before the intervention. Four weeks after the intervention, the mean Greene score was significantly lower in the intervention group (95% confidence interval: 6.4-8.5, adjusted difference: 7.5), compared to the control group. Four weeks after the intervention, the frequency of hot flashes was significantly lower in the intervention group, compared to the control group (-1.9 to -6.6, -3.9) (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Self-directed learning could reduce the early symptoms of menopause. Therefore, this method of learning can be considered as a suitable way to enhance women’s health and prepare them for dealing with the irritating symptoms of menopause via health interventions.

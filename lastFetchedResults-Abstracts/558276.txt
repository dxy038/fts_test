The increment of load variation in a power transmission system can lead to potential failure on the entire system. This is due to the fact that the system has to work under a stressed condition. Therefore an attempt to increase reactive power support should be conducted. Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) can be one of the means to alleviate this problem. This paper presents Evolutionary Programming (EP) technique for transmission loss minimisation and calculation of static VAR compensator (SVC) in power transmission system. The objective of the study is to employ EP optimization technique for loss minimisation along with installation cost calculation and voltage profile monitoring. The optimizations are made on two parameters namely the location of the devices and it sizes. The SVC devices are installed in the system in order to enhance the system security; performed on the IEEE 30-bus RTS for several loading conditions. The simulations results are compared with those obtained from the Artificial Immune System (AIS) technique in the attempt to highlight its merit

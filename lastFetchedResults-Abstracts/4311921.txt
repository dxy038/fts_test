In this paper we propose a topology control algorithm for the wireless mesh network, where each node is equipped with m non-steerable directional antennas. Our objective is to maximize the minimal traffic delivery ratio from each node to the gateway nodes, by adjusting the orientation of the directional antennas appropriately. We show by simulations that our proposed algorithm improves traffic delivery ratio significantly, compared with the random network. Moreover, we study how each parameter, such as the beam width of antennas, the number of antennas on each node, has impact on the network performance.

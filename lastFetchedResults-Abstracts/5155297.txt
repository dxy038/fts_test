In the research fields of Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR), tracking and registration methods are still one of the most important topics. The tracking research field is highly active, and numerous methods appear on a regular basis. The TrakMark working group (WG) was established 2009 to create a benchmark test that permits objective and accurate evaluation of the tracking methods. This year, the workshop will cover a wide range of topics concerning AR/MR registration, tracking and benchmarking. Key areas include, but are not limited to: &#8212; Vision-based registration, camera localization &#8212; Visual SLAM, structure from motion, camera calibration, sensor fusion &#8212; Natural feature tracking, object tracking, feature detection, feature description &#8212; Comparison of methods, evaluation of methods, suggestion of new benchmarking scheme &#8212; Survey of tracking papers.

The objective of this paper is to control the speed of a DC motor model efficiently by using SMC. A separately excited DC motor has been chosen for this purpose. First PID controller is applied to control the speed of the motor both linear and non-linear model and then SMC is applied for the same non-linear model. Modeling and simulation work has been done in MATLAB. The results obtained shows that SMC gives better performance as compared to PID. While PID is not capable to give the desired result satisfactorily in case of non-linear systems, SMC has robust nature in presence of such disturbances. And hence is a better approach for the same.

In the traditional Surakarta game, the single objective search technology which has to degrade the search depth to meet the single time constraint is often used. So dynamic nonlinear search technology, based on the &#8220;military strength&#8221; fuzzy set, is used to find the best answer to meet with the search time and the multi-objective search depth. The fuzzy model of the &#8220;military strength&#8221; is established by following a large number of experimentsÂ´ data. And according to the changes of the game, global evaluation value is adjusted. And then, combined with the experiments we get the empirical equation. So the rule of multilevel search depth is established after multiple linear regression statistics. Multilevel search depth can also be adjusted to get the optimal solution of dynamic search under the multiple constraint conditions. The experiment proves that the overall strength is distinctly improved in the computer game of Surakarta by using the technology. And it is verified by the experiment.

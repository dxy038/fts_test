Objective
To evaluate the association of atrial septal abnormalities – patent foramen ovale (PFO), atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), or the combination of both (PFO + ASA) – with cryptogenic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in older patients.
Methods
We examined the prevalences of PFO, ASA, and PFO + ASA in 132 consecutive patients aged 55 years or more who underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for evaluation of ischemic stroke or TIA. We compared patients with cryptogenic stroke/TIA and those with stroke/TIA of known cause.
Results
PFO + ASA was more common in patients with cryptogenic stroke/TIA than in patients with stroke/TIA of known cause (12/62 or 19% vs. 2/70 or 3%; adjusted odds ratio, 7.4; 95% CI, 1.4–38.2). Differences between groups for isolated PFO, and isolated ASA were not significant. The association of PFO + ASA with cryptogenic stroke/TIA was confirmed in the subgroup of patients aged 75 years or more (odds ratio, 15.0; 95% CI, 1.5–146.7).
Conclusion
This study indicates a significant association of PFO + ASA with cryptogenic stroke or TIA in older patients.

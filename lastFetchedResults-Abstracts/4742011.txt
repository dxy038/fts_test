The objective of this paper is to illustrate the role manufacturing tolerances and practices play on the initial unbalance in final motor armature assemblies. Assemblies consisting of several components can have a tolerance build-up which can make the balancing process difficult and time consuming. This build-up of tolerances will invariably create eccentricity errors, causing a shift in the principal axis of inertia. A shift in this axis with respect to the rotational axis is what is known as unbalance

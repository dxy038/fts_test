In the course of the optimal design of Two-stage function, Selecting the design variables, Setting constraint conditions, we could build the optimization model of Two-stage of Helical Gear Reducer, Using the MATLAB Optimization Toolbox and its algorithm, what we want is to make the reducer smallest and save more materials. Through analysis of the outcomes compared with the design data, the optimized objective value has reduced by 35.28%, and the centre distance by 11.60%, It turns out that, Based on this algorithm, it was more accurate and more efficient to optimize. And of important reference value for solving other problems related to the optimization in mechanical design.

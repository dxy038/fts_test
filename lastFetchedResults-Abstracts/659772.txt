Although there are different devices for rapid and low cost monitoring of some soil properties, extended field surveys, both in space and depth, seem to be necessary for mapping of these and other soil attributes. In this study, electromagnetic induction device (EM38) has been introduced as a tool for rapid and low cost measurement of soil salinity and other attributes. Main objective of this study was to test and evaluate capabilities of this device for monitoring soil cations and anions in addition to salinity in Azadegan plain, west of Iran. For this purpose, soil samples were taken at different locations and depth intervals, simultaneously with EM38 readings. Relationships between EM38 readings and anions, cations, salinity and Sodium Absorption Ratio (SAR) were investigated through statistical analysis approaches. Results of this study indicated significant correlations between EM38 readings and soil sodium measures as well as SAR. The mentioned result suggests this device as a rapid tool for measurement of soil sodium in different parts of the country.

In this letter, a new method is presented to synthesize contoured beams by specifically shaping a single reflector antenna. The algorithm is based on the iterative-field-matrix (IFM) method, which finds a linear relationship, in a matrix form, between a local surface distortion and the difference of the nominal and objective far-field patterns. The matrix is inverted using singular value decomposition (SVD) and Tikhonov regularization; as a result, fast convergence is achieved. The method has been successfully applied to synthesize contoured beams for two different scenarios.

A bubble movement model, which taking account the effect of gas compressibility, is developed. The analysis of the bubble is based on a quasi equilibrium formulation, which guarantees complete compatibility with the unit cell model. The results show that the gas movement in a horizontal pipe decreases the pressure drop, and the outlet pressure is higher than the one without any gas. The gas compressibility causes pressure fluctuate peak value. The length of bubble affects less on the pressure drop, while the amount of gas plays a major role on pressure drop.

Provisioning of mobile video streaming is hitting toward to limitations in channel quality and capacity as well as in terminal processing power. These known limitations, network settings, and video content influence the end user quality. In this article we investigate the estimation of perceived video quality for mobile streaming scenarios. Firstly, we analyze streaming content and usage scenarios. Secondly, we define objective video parameters which reflect the sequence motion character and its content. Finally, video quality estimation methods based on these parameters are developed and compared with common methods. The presented results show that the proposed approach provides powerful solutions for automatic subjective video quality estimation.

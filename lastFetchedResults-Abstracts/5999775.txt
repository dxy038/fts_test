We present a technique for the visualization, simulation, animation and modeling in 3D of some ophthalmological parameters such as: eye movements, pupilar response, visual field and visual evoked potentials (VEP). The NewTek Video Toaster is the base of the video processing system used combined with ophthalmologic instrumentation. This technique will permit objective diagnostics of pathologies presented in people submitted in biomechanic studies and pre-post surgery analysis. The video can be manipulated at different velocities, projections, movements and it creates 3D animations producing a video-diagnostic immerse in virtual environments and man-machine interaction

Background
A substantial delay in distribution of influenza vaccine occurred in the 2000–2001 influenza season. Our objective was to quantify the impact of this delay on immunization rates, location of receipt of immunization, and patient attitudes and beliefs about the influenza vaccine.
Methods

Inner-city and suburban medical practices that received influenza vaccine supply on-time or late in the season (late-receipt) were selected. A random sample of elderly patients from each practice completed telephone interviews.
Results

Of 775 eligible patients, we interviewed 72%. The odds of receiving influenza vaccine in late-receipt practices compared to on-time practices did not significantly differ in either the suburban stratum (adjusted OR = 0.9, 95% CI 0.5–1.6) or the inner-city stratum (adjusted OR = 1.5, 95% CI 0.8–2.8). Very few respondents (4%–11%) reported changes in their beliefs about the vaccine, its safety or efficacy, from previous years. More patients in late-receipt practices reported receiving influenza vaccine at locations other than their regular doctor's offices in the shortage year compared with the previous year.
Conclusions

The 2000–2001 influenza vaccine delay changed vaccination location, but did not change influenza vaccination rates.

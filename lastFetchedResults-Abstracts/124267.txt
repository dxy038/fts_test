Background: The risk of coronary artery disease increases with increasing of blood pressure both in hypertensive and normotensive persons; on the other hand nutritional factors have a significant effect on blood pressure.
Objective: To determine the effect of daily sodium, potassium, calsium intake and BMI on blood pressure.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was implemented on 195 nonpregnant normotensive women aged 15-46 years in Marand in 1999. Food intake was assessed by 24-hour recall method during two consequent days and daily nutrient intake was calculated using food processor software. Weight, height and blood pressure were measured and then BMI was calculated by weight / height^2 formula.
Findings: Results showed a direct significant relation between daily sodium intake with systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p= 0.05 , p= 0.01) and also intaking daily sodium per 1000 kcal the relation was stronger (p=0.008 , p=0.006) .SBP and DBP had an inverse significant relation with daily potassium intake (p=0.05 , 0.04) . Na/I< ratio relationship with SBP and DBP was stronger than sodium and potassium alone (P =0.005 , p<0.0001), there were no significant relation between daily calcium intake and blood pressure. BMI had signicant effect on DBP but not on SBP.
Conclusion: Based on these results reducing sodium intake, increasing potassium intake and controlling weight are recommended so as to control blood pressure.

Background: Tanacetum sonbolii Mozaff. is an endemic species of Tanacetum growing in Iran, west Azerbaijan. The composition of its essential oil can be varied due to conditions of selected extraction method. Thus, the selection of suitable extraction method is very effective to obtaine essential oil in native state.
Objective: The purpose of this study is to apply head space sorptive extraction method at ambient and high temperature condition for essential oil extraction of Tanacetum sonbolii Mozaff.
Methods: The compositions of extracted essential oils were investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Also, solvent, temperature and time of desorption step and time of sorption step that influence on extraction efficiency were optimized.
Results: Results indicated that temperature of extraction method had significant effects on essential oil content. Using hydrodistillation method, 26 components, representing 96.5% of the oil were indentified but only 6 compounds (95.6% of the oil) were found in essential oil using HS-SE at real condition (23 ?C). Comparison of the major components percent levels of essential oils were shown that 81% of HS-SE essential oil is ?- and ?-pinene. While using hydrodistillation method, about 50% of essential oil is sesquirerpenes such as ?-cadinol and globulol.
Conclusion: The sampling of essential oils at 23?C by HS-SE compared to conventional extraction methods at high temperature (such as hydrodistillation) caused to have different extractions results.

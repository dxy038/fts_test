Background: Studies have shown that Physalis alkekengi reduces implantation and induces antifertility in rat. In Iranian traditional medicine it is believed that this plant has abortifacient and antifertility activities.
Objective: The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of Physalis alkekengi ripe fruit hydroalcoholic extract (PFE) on uterine contractility and its possible mechanismis). Materials and Methods: Extraction of Physalis alkekengi fruit was carried out by maceration method (70% alcohol). Uterus was dissected out from adult non-pregnant rat
(Wistar) and contracted by KCI (60mM) or oxytocin (IOmU/ml) in an organ bath containing De Jalon solution and the effect of PFE on the uterine contractions was investigated. Furthermore, the role of a- and ~-adrenoceptors, opioid receptors, nitric oxide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate synthesis inhibitors on the extract effects
were evaluated. Results: KCI- and oxytocin-induced uterine contractions were inhibited (p<O.OO 1) by the cumulative concentrations of the extract in a concentration dependent manner. Incubation of uterus with propranolol (Ip.M) andL-NAME (IOOJlM) attenuated thePFE
antispasmodic effect (p<0.05). But the PFE effect was unaffected by phentolamine (1IlM), naloxone (1JlM) or methylene blue (1OIlM). In Ca2
+- free with high potassium (60mM) De Jalon solution, cumulative concentrations of CaCl2 (0.1-0.5mM) induced uterine contraction concentration-dependently (p<O.OOl). Uterus incubation (5min) with
PFE (O.25-1.75mg/ml) attenuated the CaCl2-induced contractions (p<0.05). Conclusion: It seems that the extract induced antispasmodic effect mainly via calcium influx blockade and partially through blocking ~-adrenoceptors and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. However, neither a-adrenoceptors nor opioid receptors or cGMP synthesis
were involved.

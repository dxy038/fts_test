In any organization, the allocation of buildings and offices space to departments and employees is a challenging task. In organizations office space allocation problem, employees are allocated to buildings and offices space so that some objectives are satisfied and the optimize allocation is obtained. So if this problem is modeled well, some advantages will be achieved. For example: increasing synergy among the employees, using of space optimally, and decreasing costs.  Because of this problem is an optimization problem based on different constraints, so at the first we attempt to specify these constraints by experts. It is possible that under some circumstances, the appropriate combination of criteria for creating of fitness function does not take place, so we attempt to use multi-objective optimization with pareto solution. We use multi-objective bee colony algorithm to reach this objective. In this method, we have a set of optimal solutions instead of an optimal solution. This set has optimal solutions that each of them is optimal and does not have any priority to other solutions. In this situation, user can select an optimal solution from that set with consideration of existing conditions. Bee colony algorithm can solve continues and discrete problem and has simple operations. In this research, this algorithm has ability to modeling a problem and responding to the demands in appropriate time.

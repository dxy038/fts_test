To exploit microelectronics progresses for next processor generations, it is crucial to design new tools allowing a better adequacy between architectures and applications. The Facse project, which we present in this paper, strives to achieve this objective. As the two aspects of the system (hardware and software) are taken into account simultaneously, it is possible to increase the performances significantly. Facse is based on the use of adapted heuristics to guide search towards the most promising architecture and compiler optimization configurations in one side and rapid evaluation methods of these configurations on the other side.

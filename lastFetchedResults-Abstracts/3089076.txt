This paper presents a mathematical model to evaluate the impact of different latent periods on the epidemic of tuberculosis. Analysis results show that the disease-free equilibrium P<sub>0</sub> is globally asymptotically stable and disease is eliminated from population if R<sub>0</sub> les 1. However, the proof of stability of the unique endemic equilibrium P* is still a challege. Numerical simulation demonstrates that P* is globally asymptotically stable if R<sub>0</sub> &gt; 1.

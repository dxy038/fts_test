Today in Process of economic integration and Common market establishment,
Economic blocks have special importance. In this regard, neighborhood, integration
and economic similarity, co language are influencing factors on deepenmg of
commercial and economic relationship between countries. However. at a general
concept, aforementioned are subset from broad concept of contiguity in commercial
trade, trade index measurement such as Cosines critena and trade concentration and
economic homogenous indexes e. g. Economic freedom degrees. per capita income
convergent, state role on economy, are explaining countries strategies towards
blocking and regional- business integration, The objective of this study IS to examine
the possible enhancement of regional trade integration of agricultural products
among the Organization of Islamic countries (0lC) members. By implementing
various blocks, it is expected that contiguity may reduce heterogeneity in the
structure of the OlC countries' economies, and in contrast, mise the degree of trade
similarity. Accordingly, a statistical analysis of agricultural trade relationship in the
regional blocks, in addition to their degrees of economic freedom and economic
similarity, enables us to evaluate a reduction in the economic heterogeneity of the
blocks established actually and potentially in OlC. The imj>lication is that deepening
trade integration in the current blocks (such as ECO, GCe) based on contiguity will
expand inter-block trade flows among the OlC countries

The objective of the paper is to develop a structural compliance model for a general serial manipulator that includes both joint and link compliance sources in any general distribution of revolute and prismatic joints. A primary feature is that special consideration is given to modeling the variable focal compliance properties of a robot containing one or more prismatic joints. A more reliable method for placing the link compliance frames is also introduced. An improved linear quasi-static compliance model for serial robot structure comprised of both revolute and/or prismatic joint is provided

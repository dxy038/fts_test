Objective
mined social support, stress, and selected demographic variables as predictors of depression among African Americans with hypertension.
s
al data collected on 194 hypertensive African Americans ranging in age from 30 to 88 years (mean age = 58.3 years, standard deviation = 12.2; 63% were female) were analyzed in the present study. Hierarchic regression analyses were conducted using two models of depression. The first model included basic demographic characteristics of the sample, including age, sex, educational attainment, income, and employment status. In the second model, the psychosocial variables of stress and social support were added to determine their predictive value.
s
rst model accounted for 14% of the variance in depression and identified sex and age as significant predictors. The second model, in which two psychosocial variables were added, accounted for 45.2% of the total variance, with age, stress, and social support as significant predictors.
sions
 and social support are significant predictors of depression in a hypertensive African American population, beyond the influence of various demographic variables. These results have implications for prevention and intervention strategies with the target population.

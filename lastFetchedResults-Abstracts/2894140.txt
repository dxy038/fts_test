The matrix converter (MC) is an array of controlled bidirectional semi-conductor switches that allows direct ac-ac conversion without an intermediate dc link. To extend its future application, multilevel matrix converter can be a proposed solution due to its merits in multilevel output, high voltage application, high power conversion, improved harmonics issue and less voltage step, etc. This paper presents an improved voltage balancing control using utility function on a capacitor-clamped multilevel matrix converter; the improved modulation strategy based on amplitude coefficient is employed to improve the performance in terms of modulation precision. Simulations and experimental results from a small-scale experimental prototype are presented to validate the theoretical findings.

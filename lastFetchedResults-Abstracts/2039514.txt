Background & Objective: For greater success of the discipline of medical education and recognition of its weaknesses and strengths, performing a comparative study and utilizing the experiences of successful universities is necessary. This study was performed to compare the elements of the curricula of medical education discipline in the universities of Dundee (Scotland), Calgary (Canada), and Maastricht (Holland) with Iran.
Methods: Data were gathered by searching university websites and communicating with them. The 3 universities of Dundee, Calgary and Maastricht, which had a high ranking in the medical education major, were selected as the study sample. The research model used in this study was the Beredy model that specifies the four stages of description, interpretation, proximity, and comparison in comparative studies.
Results: The universities of Dundee, Calgary, and Maastricht, in stating the general characteristics of curriculum, have clearly focused on education in the field of medical sciences. Elements of mission, vision, and value were not observed in their curricula. In the universities of Dundee and Maastricht, educational strategies and the reason for their application, and the manner of course presentation had been explained. All 3 universities enrolled bachelor students. The course of research in education was emphasized by all universities.
Conclusion: Based on this comparative study the curriculum of medical education in Iran seems complete and comprehensive. However, for quality improvement, the revision of goals and strategies of the discipline is necessary. Moreover, the presentation of courses in two forms of virtual and traditional education, admission of bachelor (BSc) students, replacement of compensatory course with prerequisite courses, and emphasizing of research method in education courses are recommended.

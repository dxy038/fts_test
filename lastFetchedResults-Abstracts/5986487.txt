The performance of the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) degrades due to chaos when its parameters fall into a certain area. Therefore, chaos should be suppressed or eliminated. The drawbacks of the existing control methods are analyzed. The nonlinear feedback principle is developed by using the direct-axis and the quadrature-axis stator voltage as manipulated variables. The control target attains unique asymptotically stable equilibrium under the nonlinear feedback principle. In this manner the control objective can be implemented. The method investigated in this paper can be physically realized and the control forces put into force at any time. The target of this method may be any point in the strange attractor. The influences of the model error and measurement noise upon the control performance are studied by simulations. Simulation results show the effectiveness of this method in the presence of the model error and the measurement noise.

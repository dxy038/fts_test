This study presents early data in the development of a novel mouse model of heart failure utilizing thermal ablation on cardiac valves to induce valvular regurgitation. Thermal ablation of the valve was achieved through the application of radiofrequency (RF) electrical current. The objective was to apply enough energy to induce valve stiffening and retraction, which was hypothesized to produce valve insufficiency and blood regurgitation in vivo. Preliminary studies were performed to develop a workable energy delivery catheter that could be inserted through the carotid artery to the aortic valve. Catheter position between the aortic valve leaflets was verified by echocardiography. Valve function was evaluated before and after the thermal insult using Doppler measurements near the valve inflow and outflow, and early results demonstrate that the energy delivery catheter could successfully induce acute valve insufficiency. Further study is needed to refine the catheter to provide greater control over the degree of thermal damage and resulting changes in cardiac physiology.

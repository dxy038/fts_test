In this work a microgrid is established within the geographical perspective of interest. The characteristics of the grid and its urban are employed to determine the candidate points for establishment of EV charging stations. The investment costs and operation costs are calculated for each station realizing the required constraints. This process resulted in optimum selection of EV stations. The optimization is achieved based on two different types of preliminary assumptions. In the first one, it is assumed to have only one station, while in the second one possibility of having multi-stations is considered. Using the total investment and operation costs as the objective function of optimization, the single station is found as the response to the problem of first type in above. Next, solving the multi-objective function of optimization problem the new multi-stations solution is found.

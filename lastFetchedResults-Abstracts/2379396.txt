For seismic exploration, it is the basis for better data acquisition to select better line layout in line with morphosequent and geologic conditions, provided that the objective of underground exploration is met. To ensure that the seismic line layout in areas with high-steep mountains and low signal-noise ratio is helpful for the seismic execution, launching, and receiving, a line assessment and semiautomatic optimization method was defined on the basis of remote sensing information through exploitation, study, and practices in complex-surface seismic area. The method is used to evaluate the applicability and launching and receiving conditions at line positions with such information as digital elevation model (DEM), slope, relative humidity, surface roughness, and lithology, so as to select the better layout from optional seismic lines generated from the original seismic layout. The application in the Qiulitage exploration area in the west of Tarim Basin proved that the method can improve the seismic data acquisition conditions and applicability of lines, promoting the data quality and cutting down the exploration cost.

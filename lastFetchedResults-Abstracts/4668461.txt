This paper describes a method to solve the problem of tracking a particle size distribution (PSD) trajectory in semi-batch emulsion polymerization. The definition of a suitable objective function, for the development of an optimal recipe, in terms of the full PSD, is a challenging problem. A method is proposed to circumvent this problem. The process of the evolution of the full PSD is decomposed into the sub-processes of nucleation, growth and coagulation. A technique is proposed to control these individual mechanisms separately, and hence produce the desired overall PSD. The multiobjective optimization problem that results is solved using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. Also, the experimental implementation of these results is discussed.

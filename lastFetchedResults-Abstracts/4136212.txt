The Quality of Service Metrics (QoSM) Committee of the Alliance for Telecommunication Industry Standards (ATIS) Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) Interoperability Forum (&#928;F) is tasked with defining how objective quality metrics can provide meaningful IPTV performance measures. This group has reviewed current objective quality models as well as the processes by which such models are validated. This article describes current practices in validating objective quality models and presents a new, streamlined process that can be implemented to achieve more efficient and effective model validation. Of main interest for IPTV are models for predicting video and audiovisual quality; however, the process also applies to the validation of perceptual quality models (PQMs) for other modalities. The proposed process offers vendors a fast route to validating objective PQMs while providing industry with the assurance of independent, unbiased model evaluation.

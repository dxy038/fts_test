Photovoltaic power plants pose some challenges when integrated with the power grid. The PV plants always focus on extracting the maximum power from the arrays. This makes the PV system unavailable for helping in regulating the grid frequency as compared to conventional generators. The objective of this paper is to introduce a pseudo power point tracking which provides frequency regulation functionality to PV systems. This method is fast and helps in creating a reserve which can be utilized for frequency stability. Control technique discussed in this paper allows the control over the amount of active power injected into the grid. This paper also discusses the energy storage option for frequency regulation.

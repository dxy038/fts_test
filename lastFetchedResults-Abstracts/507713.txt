OBJECTIVE: In traditional medicaments, Teucrium Polium is used as anti-fungal, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic. Modern researches have shown that use of T. polium in vitro leads to decrease in fatty acids. To confirm the anti-diabetic evidences of Teucrium polium this survey was done to evaluate the effect of boiled aqueous extract of T. polium on serum lipids, body weight and glucose, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and  Creatinine (CRT) in diabetic male rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 20 male rats became diabetic by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). The animals were divided randomly into two groups. The aerial parts of Teucrium polium was powdered, drenched and boiled. The experimental diabetic groups received this boiled extract (2% and 4%) freely for two weeks but the control group received tap water. Liver enzymes and biochemical parameters (cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, urea and Uric Acid) were measured by kinetic (Enzymatic) and colorimetric methods.
RESULTS: Our results showed that 4% dose of T. polium can decrease serum glucose and triglyceride significantly (P < 0.05), but cholesterol, urea, U Acid, ALT, AST and CRT were not significant between the test and control groups after using T. polium. 2% concentration of T. polium does not have any effect except on body weight. 
CONCLUSION: Although the aqueous extract of Teucrium polium has hypoglycemic properties and can improve body weight in experimental animals, it seems that it does not have any effect on other factors and is not suitable as an alternative treatment

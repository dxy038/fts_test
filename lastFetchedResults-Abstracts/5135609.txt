This paper introduces a technique to detect the EMI environment of MCU relying on itself. The measurement setup is explained in detail. Furthermore, based on measurement, an output signal data library and susceptibility results are achieved. Finally, we present a technique which can detect disturbance and PMS (program multi-switching) system which can increase the reliability of MCU control DC Motor system and guarantee system speed. The final objective of the work is to develop software technique to increase the reliability of MCU system in the automotive field.

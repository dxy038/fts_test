Information systems (IS) development approaches are considered with particular reference to information requirements analysis. The majority can be classified as adopting a unitary, objective perspective. This fails to fully recognise the interpretative, inter-subjective nature of information and the importance of informal as well as formal data processing systems. This paper aims to contribute to the discussion on tools and methods for systems development by providing a contrasting perspective on information requirements analysis as a process which is socially mediated. A framework is developed which places information requirements in the context of strategic IS development. This features social communication networks centrally in this process and raises implications for practice in IS development

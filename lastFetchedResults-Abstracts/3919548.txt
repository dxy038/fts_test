The motion compensation-discrete cosine transform (MC-DCT) coding is an efficient compression technique for a digital video sequence. However, the compressed video signal is vulnerable to transmission errors over noisy channels. In this paper, we propose a robust video transmission algorithm, which protects the compressed video signal by inserting redundant information at the source level. The proposed algorithm encodes every lth frame in the semi-intra frame (S-frame) mode, in which the redundant parity-check DC coefficients (PDCs) are systematically inserted into the compressed bitstream. Then, the decoder is capable of recovering very severe transmission errors, such as loss of an entire frame, in addition to detecting the errors effectively without requesting any information from external devices. The proposed algorithm is implemented based on the H.263 coder, and tested intensively in realistic error prone environment. It is shown that the proposed algorithm provides much better objective and subjective performances than the conventional H.263 coder in the error prone environment

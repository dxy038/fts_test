The objective was to determine the effect of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), GnRH analogue (GnRH-A) or oestradiol administration on luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) release in GnRH-immunised anoestrous and control cyclic heifers. Thirty-two heifers (477 ± 7.1 kg) were immunised against either human serum albumin (HSA; controls; n = 8), or a HSAGnRH conjugate. On day 70 after primary immunisation, control heifers (n = 4 per treatment; day 3 of cycle) received either (a) 2.5 μg GnRH or (b) 2.5 μg of GnRH-A (Buserelin®) and GnRH-immunised heifers (blocked by GnRH antibody titre; n = 6 per treatment) received either (c) saline, (d) 2.5 μg GnRH, (e) 25 μg GnRH or (f) 2.5 μg GnRH-A, intravenously. On day 105, 1 mg oestradiol was injected (intramuscularly) into control (n = 6) and GnRH-immunised anoestrous heifers with either low (13.4 ± 1.9% binding at 1:640; n = 6) or high GnRH antibody titres (33.4 ± 4.8% binding; n = 6). Data were analysed by ANOVA. Mean plasma LH and FSH concentrations on day 69 were higher (P &lt; 0.05) in control than in GnRH-immunised heifers (3.1 ± 0.16 vs. 2.5 ± 0.12 ng LH ml−1 and 22.5 ± 0.73 vs. 17.1 ± 0.64 ng FSH ml−1, respectively). The number of LH pulses was higher (P &lt; 0.05) in control than in GnRH-immunised heifers on day 69 (3.4 ± 0.45 and 1.0 ± 0.26 pulses per 6 h, respectively). On day 70, 2.5 μg GnRH increased (P &lt; 0.05) LH concentrations in control but not in GnRH-immunised heifers, while both 25 μg GnRH and 2.5 μg GnRH-A increased (P &lt; 0.05) LH concentrations in GnRH-immunised heifers, and 2.5 μg GnRH-A increased LH in controls. FSH was increased (P &lt; 0.05) in GnRH-immunised heifers following 25 μg GnRH and 2.5 μg GnRH-A. Oestradiol challenge increased (P &lt; 0.05) LH concentrations during the 13–24 h period after challenge with a greater (P &lt; 0.05) increase in control than in GnRH-immunised heifers. FSH concentrations were decreased (P &lt; 0.05) for at least 30 h after oestradiol challenge. In conclusion, GnRH immunisation decreased LH pulsatility and mean LH and FSH concentrations. GnRH antibodies neutralised low doses of GnRH (2.5 μg), but not high doses of GnRH (25 μg) and GnRH-A (2.5 μg). GnRH immunisation decreased the rise in LH concentrations following oestradiol challenge.

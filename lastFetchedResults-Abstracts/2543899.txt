Abstract

Objective

Dyslexia is a neurological dysfunction (also known as a learning disability) that characterized by disability in reading in spite of normal intelligence. Bothe genetic and environmental risk factors are contributing into the condition.

Diagnosis of dyslexia is based on examination and investigation of the patient’s memorial, spelling, visual, and reading skills. It is the most common learning disability, affecting 3%–10% of the school population. Modern neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown a correlation between both functional and structural differences in the brains of children with reading difficulties. Hence, to address this issue, the auditory brainstem responses of children with dyslexia were investigated.

 

Materials &Methods

Fifty two children with dyslexia (30 males, 22 females) were selected after examination by speech therapist. In addition, fifty two control children were included as well. The IPSI and contralateral ABR tests were conducted on both cases and controls. Click stimuli were used at 75 nHL intensity. The study focused on absolute latency of wave V in both groups.

 

Results

Absolute latency of wave V in contralateral showed differences between children with dyslexia and control group, but no significant results were found in IPSI testing.

 

Conclusion

The current data provide an evidence for brainstem and its function in signal processing and the role of brainstem nucleus on processing and delivering the information to each hemisphere.

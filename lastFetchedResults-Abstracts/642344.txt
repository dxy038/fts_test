Objective
Although the influence of saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), lipids, cholesterol levels, and other blood lipids has been established, few studies have examined the influence of these dietary lipids on the composition and histologic damage of organs in situations of hypercholesterolemia. Biliary lipids come from the liver, and this organ is essential in cholesterol homeostasis; thus, it may be helpful to evaluate the inter-relations among biliary, hepatic lipids, and hepatotoxic effects in situations of hypercholesterolemia with different dietary lipids. This study investigated whether administration of diets differing in fatty acid profiles (ω-3 PUFA, ω-6 PUFA, or MUFA) influence the content of biliary lipids, the lithogenic index of gallbladder bile, and the development of hepatic fibrosis in hypercholesterolemic rabbits.
Methods

Thirty rabbits were randomized to one of five groups. A control group received rabbit chow for 80 d. The remaining four groups received a 50-d diet that contained 3% lard and 13% cholesterol to provoke hypercholesterolemia. After this period, three groups were fed for another 30 d on a diet enriched with ω-6 PUFAs, MUFAs, and ω-3 PUFAs, respectively. Liver, bile, and plasma lipid compositions, lipid peroxidation in hepatic mitochondria, and histologic hepatic lesions were analyzed.
Results and conclusions

There was a beneficial effect of MUFA and ω-3 PUFA on hepatic fibrosis in hypercholesterolemic rabbits because both dietary fats led to recovery from hepatic lesions. However, because intake of ω-3 PUFA provoked lithogenic bile in rabbits, MUFA intake would be more advisable.

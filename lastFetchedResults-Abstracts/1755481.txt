Objective
jective of this study was to determine and compare patient and general practitioner (GP) preferences for the treatment of depression in patients with cancer.
s
tment preference questionnaire was completed by 100 patients who had been diagnosed with both cancer and major depressive disorder and by 86 GPs who had had experience of at least 1 patient with cancer and depression. Participants were asked to rank options for how depression should be treated, who should deliver the treatment, and where treatment should occur.
s
p three preferences of patients and GPs for how depression should be treated differed (P&lt;.001). Patients preferred talking treatment alone, whereas GPs preferred a combination of drug and talking treatment. Both patients and GPs preferred treatment to be given by the GP, with older patients having a stronger preference for this. Counselors and cancer nurses were also popular preferences; mental heath professionals were unpopular. The preferred place of treatment was primary care for both patients and GPs, although many patients preferred treatment in the cancer center.
sion
ive and acceptable services for depressed cancer patients need to take patients and GP preferences into account. A model of service that allows a choice of initial treatment modality and collaborative care between primary care and cancer center nurse would meet this requirement.

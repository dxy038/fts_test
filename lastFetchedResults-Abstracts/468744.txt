Objective
Our purpose was to implement and evaluate an orientation program for residents, focusing on outpatient clinical skills.
Study design
Eleven of 12 residents participated in a clinical skills orientation program immediately preceding the academic year. The skill stations included evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding, intrauterine device insertion, basic infertility evaluation, endometrial and vulvar biopsies, pelvic organ prolapse quantification examination, hysterosalpingography and office hysteroscopy, ultrasound scanning, labor and delivery triage, and clinic administrative responsibilities. Before test, after test, and anonymous resident evaluations were used to evaluate the program.
Results
First-year residents demonstrated a statistically significant increase in posttest scores compared to pretest scores (42.5% vs 71.3%, P = .003). Only first-year resident posttest scores for the labor and delivery triage and basic infertility evaluation stations demonstrated statistically significant increases over pretest scores (14.3% vs 46.4%, P = .009; and 41.7% vs 83.3%, P = .049, respectively). Sixty-four percent of the residents rated the program as “very helpful.” Most residents felt that the program was well organized and that the facilities were conducive to learning; all of the participants recommended an annual clinical orientation program.
Conclusion
A clinical skills orientation program was well received and strongly desired by residents. First-year residents appeared to benefit the most from this orientation.

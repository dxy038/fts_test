Bursting has been observed in many sensory neurons, and is thought to be important in neural signaling, sleep, and some disorders of the brain. Bursting neurons have been studied via various types of conductance-based models at the single-neuron level. Important features of bursting have been reproduced by this type of model, but it is not certain how well the behavior of populations of bursting neurons can be represented solely by that of individual neurons. To study bursting neurons at the population level, a conductance-based model is incorporated into a mean-field model to yield a mean-field bursting model. The responses of the model to sinusoidal inputs are studied, showing that neurons with various different initial states are capable of phase-locked or intermittent firing, depending on their baseline voltage. Furthermore, depending on this voltage, the bursting frequency either slaves to the original unperturbed bursting frequency or approaches a steady value when the external driving frequency increases. Finally, use of white noise perturbations shows that the bursting frequency of the neurons remains the same even under a more general external stimulus.

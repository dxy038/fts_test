With the term infomobility we refer to the broad range of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) information services. Despite the increasing efforts on development of infomobility services, it is recognized that they still show significant limitations in providing end users with reliable and seamless information. In this paper we argue that a systemic approach is needed to foster the growth of novel solutions for the delivery of integrated realtime and always-on infomobility services, to be seamlessly provided across different transport operators, modes and geographical areas. The proposed approach - conceived and implemented within the ongoing SIMob research project in Tuscany Region (Italy) - relies on the definition of an &#8220;Open Working Environment&#8221;, i.e. a socio-technical environment whose objective is to facilitate the co-operation of stakeholders to foster the growth of an integrated infomobility system at regional scale. Its main constituents are: a Cooperative Network of stakeholders, including regional and national subjects from Public Administrations, Enterprises and Research Bodies; an Architectural Framework, providing the reference technological baseline enabling the rapid configuration and deployment of different technological capabilities.

The concept of Quality Of Life has two objective and subjective dimensions. The objective dimension equals social relationship, capitals; both of the individual and social one; and social structures which are the indexes of high quality life. The subjective one equals life satisfaction. At this article we have studied the concept of Quality Of Life qualitatively. Surveying of the monthly; Marz Haye No (new boundaries) - the journal which was printed in the Pahlavi (the second) period- we have studied the American representated Quality Of Life. The communicators of this journal were trying to offer that the United States is a modern country and has the best quality of life. So this way could propel the Iranian society to the American kind of modernization. The hidden ideology of this monthly can be cleared by critical discourse analysis.

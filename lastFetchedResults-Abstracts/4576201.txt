Transformer is one of the most sensitive and complex elements of a power system. Nowadays, simulation is a common and effective way for behavior analysis of this element. The main objective in this paper is protective studies of power transformer. In this study a transformer model based on the self and mutual inductances has been proposed. Also a 230/63 kV, 125 MVA transformer with two-winding and three-legged core has been simulated. Obtained simulation studies are compared with test data. Obtained results confirm validity of the developed method

Multimedia GIS constitutes a very promising new user interface concept for ubiquitous environments of GIS applications. Geospatial video services will be an important class of application for users of ubiquitous GIS or LBS. A novel approach is presented for linking between geospatial videos and nonspatial data using remotely sensed data. We have identified three key challenges (georeferencing; content creation for geospatial videos; bidirectional linking) that should be addressed to enable linking among geographic hypermedia such as 2D maps, 3D virtual environments and geospatial videos. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is effective in retrieving geospatial video clips and nonspatial data

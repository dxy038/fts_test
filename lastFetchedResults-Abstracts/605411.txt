Objective: To evaluate bread consumption in the hospitals and health centers (South, Shahr-e-rey, Eslamshahr) that are under covering of Tehran University of medical control.
Methods: In a descriptive study, Usability of breads in hospitals and health networks covered by Tehran University of medical sciences, randomly were investigated. Our tests were Colorimetric, alkalinity and the amount of salt. All samples were selected from bread bakeries producing breads Barbari and Lavash or hospitals in the areas at least once a term study, and at every turn three specimens of bread (overall 615 No) in the sealed packages were collected.
Results: This study showed that 46% and 41% of Barbari bread samples respectively (south of Tehran, Shahr- e - rey and Islamshahr) had mean test colorimetric positive and high alkalinity (PH > 6) , 8% High salt(salt > 2%) and overall 45% of Barbari bread samples and 80% of their rumal was unusable. And respectively 55% and 55% of Lavash bread samples had mean test colorimetric positive and high alkalinity and 32% had High salt and overall 65% of Lavash bread samples in that three mentioned areas were unusable and finally the result shows that 64% of Tehran university hospitals Lavash bread samples also were unusable.
Conclusion: In this study, respectively 59 and 64 percent of bread consumed in the three regions and hospitals for their high alkalinity were unusable and contained high salt and soda so their consumption is Harmful for everybody specially for patients that must limit their Na intake, so preventing from taking soda has special importance and Pervasive action for controlling of bread alkalinity must be done.

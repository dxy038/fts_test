New medical devices and services enabling citizenpsilas health care anywhere and anytime are expected in the near future. However, to become a reality these devices must be supported by personalized services which satisfy user needs. In this paper we propose a general approach to manage the complexity of ambiguously related information for providing enhanced, user-specific services in the self-care domain. The global architecture is driven by a compositional model between a domain-specific and a context-awareness model, which aggregates the citizenpsilas and the devices profiles, the citizenpsilas healthcare characteristics and available signal processing methods. The final objective is to support automatic composition of services helping any citizen to select an optimal and personalized sensor system and to improve decision-making.

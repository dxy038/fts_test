This paper studies the terminal sliding mode control (TSMC) issue considering the fault-tolerant design. In the proposed scheme, TSMC can keep the merits of conventional sliding mode control (SMC), including robustness to uncertainties and/or disturbances, fast response, and easy implementation. Moreover, by using TSMC, the system states of TSMC will converge in finite time to the control objective point, i.e., equivalent point, after the systems states intersect the sliding surface. Simulation results show the advantages of the proposed method.

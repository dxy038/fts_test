The Taguchi method is a statistical approach to overcome the limitation of the factorial and fractional
factorial experiments by simplifying and standardizing the fractional factorial design. The objective of
this study was to optimize the fabrication of gelatin nanoparticles by applying the Taguchi design method.
Gelatin nanoparticles have been extensively studied in our previousworks as an appropriate carrier for drug
delivery, since they are biodegradable, non-toxic, are not usually contaminated with pyrogens and possess
relatively low antigenicity. Taguchi method with L16 orthogonal array robust design was implemented
to optimize experimental conditions of the purpose. Four key process parameters – temperature, gelatin
concentration, agitation speed and the amount of acetone – were considered for the optimization of gelatin
nanoparticles. As a result of Taguchi analysis in this study, temperature and amount of acetone were
the most influencing parameters of the particle size. For characterizing the nanoparticle sample, atomic
force microscope and scanning electron microscope were employed. In this study, a minimum size of
gelatin nanoparticles was obtained at 50 ◦C temperature, 45 mg/ml gelatin concentration, 80 ml acetone
and 700 rpm agitation speed. The nanoparticle size at the determined condition was less than 174 nm.

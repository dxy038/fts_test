The objective of the IRIDIUM program is to achieve a global personal satellite communication system based on a network of 66 communications satellites placed in low earth orbits. A key component of each of these satellites is the Main Mission Antenna (MMA), which consists of 3 fully active phased array panels, and provides the L-band link from the satellite to the ground users. Each phased array panel produces 16 beams, for a total of 48 beams per satellite, with users on the ground communicating with the IRIDIUM network through the satellite whose beam covers the user. The link quality and capacity specifications of the IRIDIUM system place unusual requirements on the MMA. These requirements have led to the synthesis of a novel electromagnetic and structural architecture for the MMA panels. Each MMA panel contains over 100 lightweight patch radiators.

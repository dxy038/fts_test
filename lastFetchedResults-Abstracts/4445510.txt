An alternative way for increasing the efficiency of transportation management system is to usef dynamic multi-zone dispatching. This problem concentrates on the quantities of inbound and outbound in each area and it is modified from the multi-zone dispatching. The factors of the rearrangement penalty of the area, in each zone, including time periods are also included. The objective of this research is to manage zones with minimal imbalance scenario via an application of the Bees algorithm. Multiple solutions can be found in some cases. Decision making for the best effective solution should be then considered together with other scenario like zone boundary and distance between areas. In some cases the imbalance from the last iteration is not met the minimum, it can be accepted due to its nonsignificant difference. This study also found that number of zones affect iterations toward the optimum. Number of areas affects the imbalance. The parameters of zone and area are then the important variables for these multi-zone dispatching systems.

This paper presents implementation of Root Raised Cosine (RRC) filter at transmitter of 3G-WCDMA wireless communication by using VHDL programming language on Field Programmable Logic Array (FPGA). The main objective of this project is to reduce the inter-symbol interference (ISI) which will affect the bandwidth required for transmission the data. MATLAB 7.0 is used to design RRC filter for generating filter coefficient and checking its functionality in WDCMA transmitter. Then RRC filter coding is generated by VHDL in XILINX application and being verified in Model Sim SE 6.3f before it being synthesized using Xilinx ISE Simulator. All the results produced will be verified for make a comparison.

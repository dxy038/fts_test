A concept of design architecture with a database for an intelligent sheet metal forming system was proposed to enable designing of a process control system without experts who are skilled and experienced in the forming process. In this study, the proposed architecture was applied to the variable blank holding force control technique for circular-cup deep-drawing. The system is available for three objective functions which are typical process requirements, cup wall uniformity, cup height improvement and energy saving. The availability of this design architecture is confirmed by experiments on aluminum alloy sheets

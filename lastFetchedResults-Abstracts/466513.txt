Objective: Our objectives were to establish an outpatient program for uterine artery embolization of fibroids and to monitor the following: percentage of patients who required immediate hospitalization or admission within 2 weeks, outcomes in terms of the degree of ultrasound regression of the fibroids, patient satisfaction, reduction of pressure symptoms, and reduction of bleeding. Study Design: Patients were screened by a gynecologist with the use of a designed care algorithm; they then underwent uterine embolization, performed by an interventional radiologist. Patients were evaluated at 6 weeks and 6 months after the procedure, and ultrasound studies were performed both before and at 2 to 6 months after the procedure. Results: Of 35 patients, 29 (83%) went home on the day of the procedure, whereas 6 were observed overnight. Three (9%) patients required admission within 1 week. Of 26 patients, 24 (92%) were satisfied with the reduction of bleeding, and 14 of 18 (78%) were satisfied with the reduction in pressure symptoms. The mean decrease in uterine volume was 36%, and the mean decrease in the size of the dominant fibroid was 49%. Conclusions: Uterine artery embolization for the treatment of uterine fibroids might be done on an outpatient basis with a low rate of same-day admissions and delayed admissions. Patient satisfaction was high, and uterine artery embolization might become an accepted option for the treatment of uterine fibroids. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;184:1556-63.)

Introduction: Heart murmurs are common findings of physical examination of children, but most of them are,
innocent. Recognizing the etiology and associated factors with heart munnurs can help us in differential
diagnosis of them. In attention to high prevalence of heart murmurs and low prevalence of congenital heart
diseases in children, diagnosis of the innocent murmur with pathologic murmur is important.
Objective: Determine the prevalence of heart murmurs and extra sounds, etiology and associated factors in the
heart of the first-grade students in Rasht, 2006-7.
Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 4080 first-grade students in Rasht. At
first, all students were examined by educated physicians and the cases with positive findings in cardiovascular
examination Were referred to the clinic of pediatric cardiology hospital. Echocardiography, Electrocardiography !
and if it was necessary Chest X ray, Angiography and Laboratory evaluations were performed for the students
with a murmur and heart extra sound who were examined by pediatric cardiologist. Following the determination
of definitive diagnosis and complementary history from the parents of the children, all collected data were
analyzed by SPSS 15.
Results: Among 4080 students (2055 boys,2025girls), 320students (7.8%) had a heart murmur and extra sound
that among of them 292 students(7.15%) had a murmur and 52 students (1.27%) bad a extra sound .The
prevalence of innocent and pathologic murmurs in the girls were (4.88% and 2.12%) and in the boys were
(4.91% and 2.38%), respectively The prevalence of congenital heart diseases (except MYP) were 1.8%.
including MR (0.93%), TR (0.51%), TVP (0.147%), VSD (0.12%), PS (0.12%), ASD (0.07%), PI
(0.07%),AS(0.02%),PDA(O.02%),PPH(O.02%) and Ebstein anomaly (0.02%). The prevalence of MVP was
2.38% and in the girls it was 1.2 times more than in the boys (p<o.05). The most frequency of pathologic
murmurs were in the children which their mothers were 35-39 years old (51%). The relative frequency of !
i
pathologic murmurs in the children. which their mothers used ranitidine and NSAID in the pregnancy, were:
higher than in other groups. The relative frequency of pathologic murmurs in the children. which their mothers
used hair dyes during pregnancy (37%) was higher than the other group (28%).
Conclusion: The present study confirms previous studies, which murmurs arc most common finding m children
and most of them are innocent. There is no requirement for diagnostic and therapeutic modality. On the other
hand, children with pathological murmurs ought to be referred to a pediatric cardiologist for evaluation and
treatment.

With their simple geometries and capabilities for system integration, planar resonators have attracted considerable interest for microelectronics and microwave circuit applications. Together with MEMS technology and smart materials, they have been used on telecommunications, radio frequency identification, remote sensing, etc. The design of these devices is complicated by many conflicting requirements that must be taken into account. Often, researchers are compelled to carry out complex numerical computations and trial-and-error experiments to achieve acceptable performances. This paper reports on a multi-objective optimization method employed in the design of a planar resonator used as a passive wireless strain sensor. The technique can provide designers with a systematic and efficient approach to achieve the optimization of the geometry of the device based on the application requirements. Numerical results from nonlinear programming are shown and tradeoffs are discussed.

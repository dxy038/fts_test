In this paper, a novel method using Bees Algorithm (BA) is proposed to determine the Available Transfer Capability (ATC) of power transactions between source and sink areas in the deregulated power system. The objective of the algorithm is to maximize a specific point to point power transaction with system constraints violation through global optimal search. The security constraints that considered in the system are line thermal and voltage limits. In order to validate the proposed algorithm as an optimization tool for ATC determination, an IEEE30 bus system is used. A Repeated Power Flow (RPF) method is used for comparison purposes. The test results clearly indicate that Bees Algorithm can be efficiently used for this kind of nonlinear integer optimization specifically for calculation of ATC in deregulated system.

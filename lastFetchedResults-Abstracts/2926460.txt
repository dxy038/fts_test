The objective of this work package was to produce monomode passive waveguide components for distributing optical signals within fibre optic networks. ICI and GMMT collaborated to develop materials and processing routes to provide passive waveguide splitters with performance comparable with alternative technologies that could potentially be manufactured at low cost. This involved a complex series of tasks from chemical synthesis to component assembly including fibre interconnection and packaging

Help desks are computer-aided environments that assist customer response centers in providing front-line phone support to external and internal customers. With the proliferation of diverse software and hardware, the centers need to handle more and more incoming calls for help. Since customer support centers are often the first point of contact for customers, it is important to ensure customer satisfaction when a call is placed. The objective of this project is to develop a case-based help desk system to support both call center personnel and customers. The process of system development, including knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation, system implementation, and verification are discussed with an emphasis on the structured and automated development method applied to the process.

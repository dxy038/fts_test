Part III of this three-part series of papers describes the synthesis of roller and sliding hydraulic steel gate
structures performed by the Mixed-Integer Non-linear Programming (MINLP) approach. The MINLP
approach enables the determination of the optimal number of gate structural elements (girders, plates),
optimal gate geometry, optimal intermediate distances between structural elements and all continuous and
standard crossectional sizes. For this purpose, special logical constraints for topology alterations and
interconnection relations between the alternative and Þxed structural elements are formulated. They have
been embedded into a mathematical optimization model for roller and sliding steel gate structures GATOP.
GATOP has been developed according to a special MINLP model formulation for mechanical superstructures
(MINLP-MS), introduced in Parts I and II. The model contains an economic objective function of
self-manufacturing and transportation costs of the gate. As the GATOP model is non-convex and highly
non-linear, it is solved by means of the ModiÞed OA/ER algorithm accompanied by the Linked Two-Phase
MINLP Strategy, both implemented in the TOP computer code. An example of the synthesis is presented as
a comparative design research work of the already erected roller gate, the so-called Intake Gate in Aswan II
in Egypt. The optimal result yields 29)4 per cent of net savings when compared to the actual costs of the
erected gate.

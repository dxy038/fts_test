Automation of negotiation constitutes a key mechanism allowing agents to interact one another autonomously and efficiently to reach mutually beneficial agreement. Nevertheless, building an agent with ability to negotiate autonomously in a given environment is a task of no ease. It compels to agents to acquire the means to resolve their conflicting objectives, correct inconsistencies in their knowledge of other agentsÂ´ worldview, and coordinate a joint approach to main domain tasks for the benefit of all agents concerned. This paper, thus, proposes a comprehensive model of negotiation for interactions between agents based on fuzzy logic. Likewise its predecessors, this paper will take agent negotiation to another height making it more efficient and effective. By efficient and effective, we mean the use of fuzzy logic which allows dealing with ambiguity and the natural approximation of common sense reasoning. To achieve this objective we customized our reasoning model in a way that all the negotiation process follows a unique protocol based on fuzzy logic.

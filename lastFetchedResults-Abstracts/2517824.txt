Background: Angiogenic factors are set of growth factors that directly and indirectly enhances vessels in the tissue. On the other hand, seem to medicinal extract some herbs can interact with growth factor pathways. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of six weeks of progressive aerobic training and aqueous extract of Crataegus monogyna on VEGF variations and plasma angiopoetin-1/2 in male Wistar rats.
Methods: 32 male Wistar rats, 4-6 months old, were randomly divided into four groups: control Crataegus monogyna, training Crataegus monogyna, control saline and training saline. A milli liter aqueous extract of Crataegus monogyna 100 g per body weight orally immediately after training, five days in a week for six weeks from the end of the second week was given to mice. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA at the significant level P < 0.05. 
Results: the results showed that progressive endurance training reduced VEGF of plasma in the training group, Crataegus monogyna group and training-Crataegus monogyna group comparing the control group. Plasma ANG-1 concentration reduced in the training, Crataegus monogyna and training-Crataegus monogyna groups while plasma ANG-2 concentration significantly increased in the Crataegus monogyna group (P=0.022) comparing with the control group. The ratio of plasma ANG-2 to ANG-1 significantly increased in the Crataegus monogyna group (P=0.028) comparing with the control group.
Conclusion: The findings suggest that combination of aerobic training and Crataegus monogyna extract has no synergistic effect on anti-angiogenesis indicators.

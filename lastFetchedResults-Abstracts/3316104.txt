In Wireless Sensor Network (WSNs), routing protocol is an important aspect to utilize network resources fairly. Normally, routing mechanisms are selfish in nature and are based on a single objective criterion, e.g., hop count. This behaviour is inappropriate for a long lasting communication as it causes performance degradation in the entire network and ultimately leads to network congestion. To enhance network performance, we propose a Co-operative Selection Reactive Routing Protocol (CSRP) that cooperatively selects the End-to-End (ETE) route by considering the traffic load along with the hop count. We compared CSRP with AODV using ns-2.35 in terms of ETE throughput, ETE delay, and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). The results reveal that CSRP improves throughput by 20.95%, reduces delay by 18.65% and increases PDR by 56.41%.

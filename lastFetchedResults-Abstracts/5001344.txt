In this paper, we propose a new method about how to get objective pulse width of traditional Chinese medicine. Through using the three-region multipath pulse detecting system which developed independently by ourselves, we tried to set up the discriminate score of pulse width-T. And according to T, we established the pulse width coefficient. Meanwhile, we hope our research is good for the pulse quantitative research.

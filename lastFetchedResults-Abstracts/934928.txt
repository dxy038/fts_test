During food consumption, complex oral processing occurs to transform the food into a bolus, ready to be swallowed. The objective of this study was to relate food, saliva and bolus properties, by using model dairy products, to better understand the role of saliva in bolus formation. Un-stimulated and stimulated saliva was collected from 5 subjects and biochemical and enzymatic properties were measured. Food bolus was then obtained from 8 different dairy products, varying in composition and ranging from liquid to gelled samples. The rate of saliva incorporation, pH, spreading ability and bolus rheological properties were determined. Some correlations seemed to exist between lysozyme activity and bolus properties. Subject and food product had a significant effect on almost all bolus properties. The rheology of bolus was highly correlated with food product texture. Even though preliminary, this approach could be used to better understand stimulus release and perception during food consumption.

This paper addresses a static, n-job, single-machine scheduling problem with sequence dependent family setups. The setup matrix follows a special structure where a constant setup is required only if a job from a smaller indexed family is an immediate successor of one from a larger indexed family. The objective is to minimize the maximum lateness (Lmax). A two-step neighborhood search procedure and an implicit enumeration scheme are proposed. Both procedures exploit the problem structure. The enumeration scheme produces optimum solutions to small and medium sized problems in reasonable computational times, yet it fails to perform efficiently in larger instances. Computational results show that the heuristic procedure is highly effective, and is efficient even for extremely large problems.

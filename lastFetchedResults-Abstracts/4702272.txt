This paper proposes a Tabu search-based method to transit network design problem. The whole design is performed in two phases. Firstly, the method of shortest path is used to produce a good initial solution. Then, Tabu search generates new solutions to realize the objective of decreasing user cost. And the computation result shows its good usability in Transit network design and optimization solution.

The objective of this study was to develop a new measurement technique for the determination of pore size distributions (PSDs) of polymeric and ceramic membranes, including NF, UF, and MF membranes. The proposed method uses the fractional rejection (FR) concept of a solute in membrane pores. Experimental measurements were conducted using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) columns and a refractive index (RI) detector. A specially designed membrane filtration unit was also used. Two different macromolecules, including nonionic polyethylene glycols (PEG) and natural organic matter (NOM) with ionizable functional (carboxylic and phenolic) groups, were used as solutes. Membrane PSDs, determined with PEG and NOM, can be defined as absolute and effective membrane PSDs, respectively. Two different types of membranes (flat-sheet polymeric and tubular ceramic) were used in this work. Experimental procedures include three major steps: (1) measurements of relative molecular mass (RMM) distributions of solutes included in the membrane feed and corresponding permeate, (2) the calculation of solute FR, and (3) PSD determination.

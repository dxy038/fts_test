In this paper, a new kind of iterative algorithm - Ascending iterative optimization algorithm is investigated. The following steps are the basic procedure of this algorithm. Step 1, establish a Minimum and maximum model based on the concrete example with the help of 0-1 variables. Step 2, establish the objective function targeting on the Minimal Time for police cars to reach the last intersection which is required to be blocked. Step 3, solve the objective function with Lingo programs, confirming the reasonable scheduling scheme of police forces from all the Police Service Platforms.

It has aggressive behavior and tendency to recurrence and it has been named benign cystic neoplasm. OKCs have different radiographic appearance such as unilocular to multilocular radiolucency. In some cases, they have been observed in the interradicular area but in rare cases they can be found in periapical radiolucency in apex of non-vital teeth that may be mistaken with lesions of endodontic origin and cause mistreatment.
Case Report: A 33 year old male patient came to clinic because of swelling in the anterior region of mandible that was repaired with endodontic treatment. In the histological diagnosis of radiolucent lesion, inflamed odontogenic keratocyst was reported. 
Conclusion: Diagnosis based on clinical finding may risky because it can lead to inappropriate treatment. In most of the cases, microscopic examination of all material surgically removed is necessary for diagnosis. This is especially recommended when treatment of lesion is not successful with routine treatment.

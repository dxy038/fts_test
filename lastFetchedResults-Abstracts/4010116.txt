An interleaved totem-pole boost bridgeless rectifier with reduced reverse-recovery problems for power factor correction is proposed in this paper. The proposed converter consists of two interleaved and intercoupled totem-pole boost bridgeless converter cells. The two cells operate in phase-shift mode. Thus, the input current can be continuous with low ripple. For the individual cells, they operate alternatively in discontinuous current mode and the maximum duty ratio is 50%, which allows shifting the diode current with low di/dt rate to achieve zero-current switching off. Zero-voltage switching is achieved in the MOSFETs under low line input. Furthermore, the merits of totem-pole topology are inherited. The common-mode (CM) noise interference is rather low. And the potential capacity of bidirectional power conversion is retained. In brief, the conduction losses are reduced, reverse-recovery process is improved, and high efficiency is achieved. The interleaved totem-pole cell can also be applied to bidirectional dc/dc converters and ac/dc converters. Finally, an 800 W, 100 kHz experimental prototype was built to verify the theoretical analysis and feasibility of the proposed converter, whose efficiency is above 95.5% at full load under 90 V.

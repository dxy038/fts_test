DC hybrid power systems are of interest for future low emission, fuel-efficient vessels. In spite of the advantages they offer onboard a ship, they result in a complex, interconnected system, which requires effective analysis tools to enable a full realization of the advantages. Modeling and simulation are essential tools to facilitate design, analysis, and optimization of the system. This paper reviews modeling of hybrid electric ship components including mechanical and electrical elements. Power electronic converters are modeled by nonlinear averaging methods to suit system-level studies. A unified model for bidirectional converters is proposed to avoid transitions between two separate models. A simulation platform using the derived models is developed for the system-level analysis of hybrid electric ships. Simulation results of power sharing among two diesel generators, a fuel cell module, and an energy storage system are presented for three modes of operation.

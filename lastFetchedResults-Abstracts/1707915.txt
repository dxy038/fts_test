The adherence level of steel/polymer/steel assemblies has been evaluated by using a wedge test, performed at different wedge introduction rates. Polymer viscoelastic properties have also been investigated through tensile and relaxation tests performed at various solicitation rates. The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of the solicitation rate on both adherence level and tensile and relaxation behaviour in order to understand the effect of polymer viscoelastic properties on adherence energy, especially its rate sensitivity. The final objective was to establish a quantitative correlation (taking into account the contribution of adhesive viscoelastic properties) in order to obtain a constant adherence value, independent of the introduction rate.

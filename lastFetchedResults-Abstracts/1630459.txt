Nanoparticle mediated delivery of antineoplastic agents, functionalized with monoclonal antibodies has achieved extraordinary potential in cancer therapy. The objective of this study was to develop a drug delivery system comprising O-carboxymethyl chitosan (O-CMC) nanoparticles, surface-conjugated with Cetuximab (Cet) for targeted delivery of paclitaxel (PTXL) to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) over-expressing cancer cells. Nanoparticles around 180 ± 35 nm and negatively charged were prepared through simple ionic gelation technique. The alamar blue assay indicated that these targeted nanoparticles displayed a superior anticancer activity compared to non-targeted nanoparticles. The nanoformulation triggered enhanced cell death (confirmed by flow cytometry) due to its higher cellular uptake. The selective uptake of Cet-PTXL-O-CMC nanoparticles by EGFR +VE cancer cells (A549, A431 and SKBR3) compared to EGFR −VE MIAPaCa-2 cells confirms the active targeting and delivery of PTXL via the targeted nanomedicine. Cet-PTXL-O-CMC nanoparticles can be used a promising candidate for the targeted therapy of EGFR over expressing cancers.

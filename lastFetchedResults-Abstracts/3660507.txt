A block-oriented programmable design with switching network interconnect is proposed for fast turn-around, low manufacturing cost, and layout-independent high-speed systems. We introduce the architecture and investigate the constraints and properties originated from the architecture. We show that routability is the most crucial concern for a successful design, and propose objective functions as well as algorithms for switching network optimization. The mapping for the circuits is performed by partitioning, placement, and routing using a maximum matching method. The integration of the whole system demonstrates excellent results in terms of circuit usage.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

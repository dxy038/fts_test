Well-being is a multifaceted concept, having intellectual origins in philosophy, psychology, economics, political science, and other disciplines. To date, methods to assess well-being are performed infrequently (e.g. yearly) and superficially, resulting in highly aggregated observations. Our objective is to create a measurement framework for assessing (human) well-being with a much higher observation frequency (e.g. daily). In decreasing the time between observations of well-being, we believe that better processes for the management of social groups and communities (e.g. a workforce) can be implemented. In this paper, we discuss our experiences and findings from the implementation of a gamified Facebook application for the measurement of well-being. We pay special attention to the accuracy of well-being observations, and the efficacy of various gamification incentives on continued use by users. Our results show that gamification provides a suitable environment for extracting accelerated, realistic, truthful self-reporting for the measurement of human flourishing.

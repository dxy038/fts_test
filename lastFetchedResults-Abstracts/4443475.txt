Communities are vehicles for efficiently disseminating news, rumors, and opinions in human social networks. Modeling information diffusion through a network can enable us to reach a superior functional understanding of the effect of network structures such as communities on information propagation. The intrinsic assumption is that form follows function-rational actors exercise social choice mechanisms to join communities that best serve their information needs. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was originally designed to simulate aggregate social behavior; our proposed diffusion model, PSODM (Particle Swarm Optimization Diffusion Model) models information flow in a network by creating particle swarms for local network neighborhoods that optimize a continuous version of HollandÂ´s hyperplane-defined objective functions. In this paper, we show how our approach differs from prior modeling work in the area and demonstrate that it outperforms existing model-based community detection methods on several social network datasets.

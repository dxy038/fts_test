This paper presents a comparative study among three evolutionary and search based methods to solve the problem of channel selection for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems. Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) method is compared to Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) and single objective Sequential Floating Forward Search (SFFS) method. The methods are tested on the first data set for BCI-Competition IV. The results show the usefulness of the multi-objective evolutionary methods in achieving accuracy results similar to the extensive search method with fewer channels and less computational time.

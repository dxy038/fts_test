A low-complexity vector propagation (VP) algorithm is introduced for the estimation of bidirectional motion vector fields in image sequences. The proposed VP algorithm exploits the strong correlation between forward and backward motion vector fields in image sequences. The performance of the VP algorithm is compared to that of a bidirectional multiresolution block-matching (MRBM) motion estimation (ME) algorithm. Computer simulation results demonstrate that with the VP algorithm, the computational workload of the bidirectional ME is reduced by a factor of nearly 2. The robustness of the VP algorithm is extensively tested using computer generated image sequences and real movies for a motion picture restoration (MPR) system. It is shown that the VP algorithm is robust enough to be used in the computationally demanding MPR algorithm, in which the performance of the novel VP algorithm is close to that of a bidirectional MRBM ME algorithm. With this technique, other video processing systems that desire to take advantage of bidirectional motion estimation can now do so without an excessive increase in computing time

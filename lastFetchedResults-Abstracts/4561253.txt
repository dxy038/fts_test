Radio frequency (RF) and microwave (MW) radiation are electromagnetic radiation in the frequency ranges 3 kHz - 300 MHz, and 300 MHz - 300 GHz, respectively. While there have been many benefits from the use of RF frequency, people nowadays are concerned that a long-term exposure could affect their body biological system and health. The recent increase in the usage of mobile telephone has raised the public awareness on the effect of RF radiation. This research is conducted by setting up RF electromagnetic radiation experiment in such control environment to identify and study the devices that have potential to release any RF frequency that may effect on human health. The study for this research project concentrates on the radiation 1.8 GHz of RF on life sample since GSM1800 is commonly used around the world in mobile communication voice data calls. The GSM frequency bands or frequency ranges are the cellular frequencies designated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for the operation of the GSM for mobile phones. Apart from that, a body temperature analysis between unexposed life sample and exposed life samples less than 1.8 GHz RF signals was conducted. The objective is to study the changes of body temperature effect on RF frequency exposure to Swiss Albino mice. A comparison is made between control cage mice which are free from any radiation and exposed cage mice. The main objective is to compare the effect in terms of their body temperature between male and female mice in control cage and exposed cage. The methodology was conducted by exposing mice to RF frequency within 2 months whereby the temperature was captured twice a day. This experiment also may assist to understand and study about the effects of RF radiation to life sample.

Permanent-magnet Linear oscillating motor can perform a precision oscillation task without exceeding a given limit on allowable average power dissipation. In this paper analysis of an axial flux permanent magnet linear oscillating motor (PMLOM) along with a suitable speed and thrust control technique is described. Microcontroller based IGBT Inverter is developed to control the PMLOM. Also its performance parameters, such as the force, current etc. are experimentally assessed. The objective of this paper is to determine the forces for aluminium mover embedded with rare earth permanent magnet experimentally and analytically through FEMM software and develop a low cost solution for its control.

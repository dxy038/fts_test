Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze cervical specimens and semen from a closed colony of baboons for the presence of the papillomavirus consensus L1 gene. Study Design: Cervical swabs were collected from lightly anesthetized female baboons. Semen was collected from a male baboon by standard electroejaculation techniques. Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from the cells by two different methods and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction targeting the L1 consensus gene common for >25 genital papillomaviruses. Results: Analyses of the polymerase chain reactionâ€“amplified products did not reveal bands for the papillomavirus in either the cervical specimens or the semen. Conclusions: The hypothesis of a linkage between primates with papillomavirus as a common factor is not supported by the results of this study. This information is also important in assisting clinicians in setting up specific pathogen-free colonies of baboons. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;182:1016-7.)

This paper introduces an original, dextrous, active and modular minimally invasive instrument dedicated to coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Its design is obtained by a generic evolutionary optimization process using Pareto-based multi objective genetic algorithms and including highly realist simulations and experimental models of the surgical gesture. The optimal instrument has 5 intra-body DOFs, is actuated by brush-less micro motors and is position controlled. Its optimization, mechanical design and performances are discussed.

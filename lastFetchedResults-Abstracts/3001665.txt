The present study is intended to evaluate the board level reliability of PBGA assemblies under thermal and mechanical loading. The main objective is to characterize the reliability of Pb-free solder joints with various assembly conditions. For the purpose of benchmarking, specimens with conventional Sn-Pb eutectic solder are tested in parallel as well. During the course of this study, a five-leg experiment is designed with various combinations of solder materials and peak reflow temperatures. The reliability tests include temperature cycling, three-point bending, and random vibration. It is found that the Pb-free solder joints have a much longer thermal fatigue life than the 63Sn-37Pb solder. Although there is no significant difference, the 63Sn-37Pb solder joints seem to perform slightly better than the Pb-free solder under the mechanical loading

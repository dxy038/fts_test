Objective
We sought to determine the effect of supplemental antioxidant vitamins C and E on the rate of preeclampsia in high-risk pregnant women.
Study design
Women at risk for preeclampsia (previous preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes, or multifetal gestation) were recruited at 14 to 20 weeks' gestation and randomly assigned to receive either 1000 mg of vitamin C and 400 IU of vitamin E or placebo daily in addition to their regular prenatal vitamins. The primary outcome was the occurrence of preeclampsia. An estimated sample size of 220 women in each arm was determined to be necessary to demonstrate a 50% reduction in the rate of preeclampsia.
Results
Funding was terminated after 109 women had been recruited; 9 were lost to follow-up or withdrew. We analyzed data from the remaining 100 women to look for differences in outcome and to estimate the required sample size for future studies. The rate of preeclampsia was not different: 17.3% in women who received supplemental vitamins C and E, versus 18.8% in the placebo group. Assuming a baseline rate of preeclampsia in the placebo group between 15% and 20%, we can estimate that 500 to 950 women in each arm will be required to show a clinically important reduction in the rate of preeclampsia.
Conclusion
The potential benefit of vitamin C and E supplementation to prevent preeclampsia in women with clinical risk factors is smaller than we estimated. Future studies of antioxidant vitamin supplementation in this population will require more than 500 women in each arm.

This paper presents the application of shunt active power filter to suppressing harmonic pollution caused by nonlinear loads. Fuzzy logic controller and hysteresis band current are respectively used to regulate the DC bus capacitor voltage and to obtain the sequences pulses of a shunt active power filter. The main objective of this study is to improve the performance of a shunt active power filter to obtained get sinusoidal source currents with very weak ripples, zero consumption of reactive power and a best total harmonic distortion confirmed to the international standards recommendation. Simulation results are presented and discussed.

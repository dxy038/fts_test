This paper discusses a distance learning system with reality transmission capability. Actual experience is crucial for education, in that much knowledge is obtained through the comparison of predictions with experimental results. Reality transmission capability allows real experiments to be performed in a distance learning system. Requirements for such a system are: (1) reality transmission capability, (2) bidirectional information transmission capability, and (3) independence of time and location. Experimental results are presented using a cutting simulator composed of a user interface to determine the cutting conditions, a stability lobe diagram and a display of cutting force, auditory and tactile information. A micro-machining experience system and a remote manufacturing system using a real time tracking vision system as an advanced user interface are also presented. Furthermore, a technology transfer experiment using the networked manufacturing system with reality transmission capability is discussed.

The objective of this paper was to develop a real time computer controlled feedback apparatus to the doctor of chiropractic while delivering the treatment forces. A portable system consists of a three-dimensional force transducer, laptop computer, and a custom developed software. The program allows the doctor to view graphically and quantitatively the forces being applied using his hand and can change the amount of applied forces in real time. The system was used in training the new doctors of chiropractic. The device has been useful in improving the delivery of treatment forces by these inexperienced chiropractic students and chiropractors.

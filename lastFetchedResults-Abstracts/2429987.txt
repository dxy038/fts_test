Objective: There is a substantial amount of evidence suggesting that alteration in some
hormones is associated with depression. The aim of the study was to assess the serum
level of thyroid hormones and leptin in patients with depression.
Subjects and Methods: In this case-control study, 63 patients with different degrees of
depression and 69 healthy, age and sex matched control subjects were selected. The
Beck Depression Inventory was used to classify the degree of depression into mild,
moderate, and severe. The level of Leptin, thyrotropin (TSH), thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine
(T3) were estimated using commercially available kits and Free T4 index
was calculated.
Results: Leptin and T3 levels were significantly decreased and T4 rose in the depressed
women as compared to the healthy controls (P  <  0.05, P  <  0.001, and P  <  0.001 respectively).
Furthermore, the serum level of leptin was significantly lower and T4 was significantly
higher in sever depressed women compared to moderately or mildly depressed
women (P  <  0.001 and P  <  0.01, respectively).
Conclusion: This study showed that thyroid and leptin hormones malfunction in depressed
women. Thus, inclusion of thyroid and leptin screening test in the case of deessed
patients might be required in proper management schedules.

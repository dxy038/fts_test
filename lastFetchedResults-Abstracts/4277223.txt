The objective of this research is to reveal the mechanisms associated with the initial formation of people´s trust in mobile banking. And this research fills a research gap by focusing on online to mobile trust transfer process, which has received almost no attention. For this, we attempt to understand the effect of four antecedent factors (perceived security, perceived privacy protection, compatibility and relative advantage) on shaping a customer´s initial trust in mobile banking. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of customers´ online banking trust on the initial trust in mobile banking and its antecedents. The study tests hypothesis by using a sample of 313 cell-phone users who have used online banking before. Results show that online trust positively influence initial trust in mobile banking and customers´ perceived security and privacy protection of mobile banking. Thus, online-to-mobile trust transfer process should be considered when designing multichannel strategies and attracting customers to use mobile banking.

A novel integration method for the production of cost-effective optoelectronic printed circuit boards (OE PCBs) is presented. The proposed integration method allows fabrication of OE PCBs with manufacturing processes common to the electronics industry while enabling direct attachment of electronic components onto the board with solder reflow processes as well as board assembly with automated pick-and-place tools. The OE PCB design is based on the use of polymer multimode waveguides, end-fired optical coupling schemes, and simple electro-optic connectors, eliminating the need for additional optical components in the optical layer, such as micro-mirrors and micro-lenses. A proof-of-concept low-cost optical transceiver produced with the proposed integration method is presented. This transceiver is fabricated on a low-cost FR4 substrate, comprises a polymer Y-splitter together with the electronic circuitry of the transmitter and receiver modules and achieves error-free 10-Gb/s bidirectional data transmission. Theoretical studies on the optical coupling efficiencies and alignment tolerances achieved with the employed end-fired coupling schemes are presented while experimental results on the optical transmission characteristics, frequency response, and data transmission performance of the integrated optical links are reported. The demonstrated optoelectronic unit can be used as a front-end optical network unit in short-reach datacommunication links.

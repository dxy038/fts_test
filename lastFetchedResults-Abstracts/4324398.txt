Frequency selective surfaces (FSS) are microwave filters that are analogous to filters in electric circuits. We present a two-step approach to designing the FSS. The basic unit-cell geometry of the FSS is first determined by using a multi-objective GA (MGA), with a specific combination of dielectric support layers. Once the unit-cell geometry has been determined, we employ the hierarchical GA (HGA) to improve the performance of the filter. We present a band-pass FSS filter design to illustrate the application of the method.

Core competence evaluation of modern service industry cluster has been a very significant theoretical and practical problem of the research on industry cluster. The goal of the investigation is to assess core competence of modern service industry cluster accurately and visually. In order to get the priorities of evaluation factors, hierarchy of core competence of modern service industry cluster is developed first. Analytic Hierarchy Process is adopted to evaluate the subjective weights and entropy method is used to get objective weights of the indexes in the second level. Synthesized priorities are combined by the two methods. Parallel coordinates chart is formed based on the marked points in x-axis which is marked off in accordance with the priorities above. Further more characteristic elements of parallel coordinates chart are used to evaluate core competence of modern service industry cluster quantificationally. The examples demonstrate that use parallel coordinates chart as a diagrammatic representation to assess core competence of modern service industry cluster is feasible. It is not only intuitionistic and visual, but also can get quantitative value of core competence of modern service industry cluster.

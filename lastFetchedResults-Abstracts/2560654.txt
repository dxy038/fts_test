This  paper  deals  with  a  multi-objective  integrated  inventory  model  to
coordinate a two-stage supply chain including a single buyer and multiple vendors. The earlier work 
on the problem is limited to considering only one type of discount. This paper extends the problem 
under the multiple quantity discount environment. We try to minimize the system cost, number of 
defective items, number of late delivered items and maximize the total purchasing value. Numerical 
examples are presented to provide some insights into the proposed model and different discount 
schemes. Results obtained from sensitivity analysis show that changes in unit prices have a 
relatively large effect on the objective function; as the upper bounds of discount intervals are 
reduced, the value of objective function decreases. It is also seen that the order quantity from 
the suppliers increases as the number of suppliers offering all unit quantity discounts increases.  
In addition, we use a solution approach that is not used by previous studies on this problem, and 
the obtained results show that the DE algorithm, proposed in this study, outperforms the PSO 
proposed by Kamali et al.  1] in both solution quality and computational time.

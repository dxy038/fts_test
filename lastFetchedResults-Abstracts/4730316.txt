A new fast and efficient large-signal time domain circuit design routine for MMIC and M3IC oscillators has been developed by combining a quasi-two-dimensional MESFET/HEMT physical model with lumped element circuit models. The main objective is to synthesise microwave and mm-wave two terminal negative conductance devices, which can then be applied to the optimal design of oscillators. Common source, drain or gate configurations can be used in this synthesis procedure along with series and/or shunt feedback arrangements. This is the first time that the synthesis of a two terminal negative conductance has been achieved using a physical model for the active device.

This paper presents a technique for the calibration of multi-beam laser scanners. The technique is based on an optimization process, which gives precise estimation of calibration parameters starting from an initial estimate. The optimization process is based on the comparison of scan data with the ground truth environment. Detailed account of the optimization process and suitability analysis of optimization objective function is described, and results are provided to show the efficacy of calibration technique.

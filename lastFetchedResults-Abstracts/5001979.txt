In this paper, a discrete-time output feedback controller that stabilizes the class of nonlinear Lipschitz systems is presented. The applicability of the controller design in the robotics field is thoroughly discussed from both the modeling and design perspectives. It is shown that the objective of stabilizing the robot manipulator continuously using a discrete-time controller can be achieved using a direct sampled-data design approach in which neither the plant model nor the controller need to be discretized a priori, and where the robot measurements are only available at discrete points of time. The proposed design is shown to have important advantages over the classical emulation approach that has been used to solve similar problems. Simulation results on a nonlinear model of the single link flexible joint robot are presented.

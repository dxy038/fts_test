Objective: Patients suffering from mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis may be treated with unloader
knee orthoses or laterally wedged insoles. This study aimed to identify and compare the effects of two
orthoses in these patients.
Methods: 56 patients with medial compartment knee OA were evaluated when wearing an unloader knee
orthosis and insoles with a 6Â° lateral wedge which were randomly assigned. Testing was performed at
baseline and after 6 months of use with the two types of orthoses. The KOOS score was used to assess
outcomes in this study. A paired T test was used for comparing base line and the 6th month post
interventions KOOS sub scale score. An independent T test was used for analyzing the efficacy between
the two orthoses.
Results: Each of the interventions improved all the parameters comparing to the baseline condition
(P=0.000). However, in comparing the effect between these orthoses, we did not find significant
differences in activities of daily living (P=0.871), or sports and recreational activities (P=0.351). The pain
and symptoms (P=0.000) were, however, significantly different between the two interventions.
Conclusion: The unloader knee orthoses were more effective than lateral wedge insoles in reducing pain
and symptoms.

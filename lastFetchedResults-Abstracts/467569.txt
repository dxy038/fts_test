Objective: The study was undertaken to evaluate the outcomes of indigent women with possible ectopic pregnancy who were cared for in a public teaching hospital outpatient clinic by multiple residents. Study Design: Retrospective review of patients seen in the Obstetric-Gynecologic Urgent Care Center at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center from September 1, 2000, through August 30, 2001, was performed. Results: Of the 243 women being evaluated for possible ectopic pregnancy, 4 required surgical intervention during their diagnostic workup and 58 were lost to follow-up. Of the 31 women given methotrexate therapy, 25 successfully completed therapy, 2 required surgery, and 4 were lost to follow-up. Substantial investment was needed to contact patients who missed appointments. Conclusion: It is feasible to manage women with possible ectopic pregnancies on an ambulatory basis in a public teaching hospital, but close oversight is needed and both staff and patients must commit to significant follow-up. Local protocols can be modified to reduce the numbers of visits required. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:1541-50.)

Robust regression by least median squares, LMS, which is able to determine linear tendency provided that at least 50% of the experimental points comply with this tendency, has been applied to data from various titrations. The procedure based on the LMS regression provides an objective criterion for the determination of the end point; it can be reproduced and automated completely, thus contributing to a more versatile titration analysis. Under normal working conditions, concentrations with variation coefficients between 2% and 4% have been determined in amperometric titrations, between 0.5% and 5% in conductometric titrations of strong/weak acid and its mixtures, and around 1.5% in spectrophotometric and potentiometric titrations.

An estimate of audio quality, as perceived by the listeners, has become an important parameter. Objective audio quality assessment methods have been used to overcome the main drawbacks of subjective assessment methods such as time consuming and running costs. This paper presents experimental results using EAQUAL, a software tool based on ITU-R BS.1387-1 Recommendation for objective audio quality assessment. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of EAQUAL within the framework of audio-streaming over wireless packet networks.

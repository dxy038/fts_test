With the institution of the M. Barry Carlton award for the best paper of the year, a real personal incentive has been established to generate interesting and informative papers for publication in the PGMIL Transactions. This marks another step taken in the long-range program to develop a professional journal of unique significance in the field of military electronics. The objective of the program is to stimulate new lines of thought. By cross-breeding the various scientific disciplines, even old ideas can take on new importance. By presenting the fundamental concepts underlying the present state of the various electronic arts, and perhaps speculating upon some of their logical extensions, new concepts may evolve that could lead ultimately to truly important discoveries.

Distributed generation allows achieving large savings or causing technical problems, depending on the generation size, type and location. The optimal location and sizing of DG is a challenging problem and requires a multiobjective programming approach. In this paper the aspects of the DG siting and sizing problem are highlighted considering the simultaneous optimization of several objective functions from the point of view of different stakeholders of the distribution system. A procedure able to identify the maximum allowable penetration level of DG in a given distribution network, considering the possibility of a non-optimal location of the DG units, is presented.

This article considers a single machine scheduling problem with an availability constraint under simple linear deterioration. The non-preemptive case is taken into account as well. The objective is to minimize the makespan in the system. The addressed problem is first described as a 0â€“1 integer programming model, and is then solved optimally. Subsequently, we prove that the addressed problem belongs to NP-hard. Thus, some heuristic algorithms based on the bin packing concepts are provided for solving the addressed problem. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm H3 performs well. In addition, a good strategy that sets the maintenance to start epoch when half the jobs have been already processed is suggested as well.

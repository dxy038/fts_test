Researchers often identify robust design as one of the most effective engineering design methods for continuous
quality improvement. When more than one quality characteristic is considered, an important
question is how to trade off robust design solutions. In this paper, we consider a bi-objective robust
design problem for which Pareto solutions of two quality characteristics need to be obtained. In practical
robust design applications, a second-order polynomial model is adequate to accommodate the curvature
of process mean and variance functions, thus mean-squared robust design models, frequently used by
many researchers, would contain fourth-order terms. Consequently, the associated Pareto frontier might
be non-convex and supported and non-supported efficient solutions needs to be generated. So, the objective
of this paper is to develop a lexicographic weighted-Tchebycheff based bi-objective robust design
model to generate the associated Pareto frontier. Our numerical example clearly shows the advantages
of this model over frequently used weighted-sums model.

To aid authenticity, accuracy and reliability of subjective measurement of VoIP quality measurements, this paper proposes a model that has been created from the subjective MOS, instead of using existing objective measurement methods for VoIP quality measurement. The proposed model of VoIP quality measurement method is based-on Thai users. The data has been gathered from conversation-opinion tests with 400 Thai subjects, referring to packet loss and packet delay effects. This model is called the Thai subjective VoIP Quality Evaluation model (ThaiVQE). It has been evaluated by testing with a test set of subjective MOS, then the results have been compared with the E-model results. Based-on Thai subjects, the evaluation result shows that ThaiVQE can provide better accuracy and reliability than the E-model with improvement of over 20%.

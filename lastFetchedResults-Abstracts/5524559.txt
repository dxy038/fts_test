A system for gait assessment based on smart insoles instrumented with flexible sensors as part of ZigBee network nodes and Bluetooth inertial measurement nodes is presented. The system was developed to objectively record and measure ground reaction force, acceleration and direction of feet in order to provide information to physiotherapists for objective evaluation of rehabilitation effectiveness. Gait characterization is made using time domain and time-frequency domain analysis of the signals. A small, light and portable wireless sensor network for quantitative gait impairment measurements in a more natural environment was designed.

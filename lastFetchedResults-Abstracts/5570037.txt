Based on the fuzzy mathematics and chaos optimization theory, this paper proposes an algorithm of the Multi-objective Fuzzy Mutative Scale Chaos Optimization Algorithm (MFMSCOA) to solve various types of Multi-objective Optimization Problems (MOP). The multi-objectives optimization problems will ex-press the fuzzy optimization problems by delimiting membership degree functions of objective functions in a fuzzy way. Then, according to the Maximum and minimum rule of the fuzzy set theory, one can transfer a multi-objective optimization problem into a single objective nonlinear programming problem by applying the idea of fuzzy asymmetric method and the biggest satisfaction principle in fuzzy set theory. Lastly, the most sat-is factory solution will be obtained by the application of MFMSCOA. Theoretical analyze and Simulation results show that the proposed MFMSCOA is feasible and effective. It will provide a novel way to solve the multi-objective optimization problems.

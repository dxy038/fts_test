Presents an outline of the work done in the EC co-funded project ACE Designs. The objective of this project was to develop rear contact solar cell designs and to demonstrate their applicability as an alternative crystalline silicon technology for industrial module production. An overview of the results is given with links to the most relevant, publications for further details. The most important result of this project was that rear contact solar cells are a feasible, attractive and cost effective alternative to the well-known front contacted solar cell.

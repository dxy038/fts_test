Lightning is one of most serious threats to successful launch operations. The objective of this study was to investigate the characteristics of Cloud-to-Ground (CG) lightning flashes in the South Korean peninsula from statistical information, to support space launch operations.

 flash density, number of flashes, flash polarity, flash hours, median peak current and the interrelationship between flash hours and flash density were calculated using lightning observation data for 2004â€“2008 from the Korea Meteorology Administration (KMA). During this period 2,314,034 CG strokes and 1,152,475 CG flashes over the South Korean peninsula were detected by the Korean Meteorological Administration Lightning Detection Network (KLDN). Lightning occurred intensively during June, July and August. The mean percentage of positive flashes was 8.72%. The median peak current of positive flashes showed seasonal variations, while the median peak current of negative flashes did not. The maximum and minimum of median peak current for positive flashes was 76.2 kA in January and 17.6 kA in August respectively. Linear regression analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between flash hours and density. The correlation coefficient was derived by 0.5680.

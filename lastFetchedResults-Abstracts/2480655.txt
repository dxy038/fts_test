Abstract
Objective: The aim of this study was evaluating the relationship between maternal serum lipid measured at 13-23 weeks of pregnancy and subsequent glucose intolerance.
Materials and Methods: In a prospective study, 624 pregnant women prior to 23 weeks were eligible for the study. Primarily, serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride were measured. Women were grouped according to tertiles determined by the distribution of maternal serum lipid concentration among the entire cohort. Then, all patients at 24-28 gestation weeks were screened with a 50gr oral glucose test. The prevalence of abnormal GCT was compared among the lipid profile tertiles.
Results: The number of women with abnormal GCT was less in the group with TG concentration in lower tertile in comparison with the groups with TG concentrations in the higher and middle tertile (P < 0.001, P=0.004 respectively) .
Conclusion: Triglyceride levels early in pregnancy are associated with abnormal GCT.

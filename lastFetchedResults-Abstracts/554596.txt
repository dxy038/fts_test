The paper considers the problem of solving an
open transportation problem in conditions when demand
exceeds supply. The transportation problem is considered
to have fuzzy objective, fuzzy constraints, and fuzzy
decision variables. To solve this problem without adding
any fictitious supplier is impossible. The proposed paper
describes development of a new method that would
provide a better and realistic solution to the transportation
problem considering fuzzy conditions and that would be
free of other complications of classical methods.

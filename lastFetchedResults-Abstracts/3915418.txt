The sal- and cal-functions of the well-known Walsh functions are used to construct a simple and minimal Walsh function generator. Codes at random sequence or a sequence of codes at random time are generated. A generated code automatically enables a particular stimulus (which may be visual or audible) or any appropriate objective external stimulus (depending upon the response time and the reflex action) to be measured. The time accuracy is determined by the particular application and upon the particular response. This particular measuring system is designed for measurements of response time of the man-machine interaction but measurements can be extended with minor modifications to response time of interest to medical, biological, physiological, and psychological fields.

Background: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic and plenty disease and one of the important
causes of morbidity and mortality in the world with restrict available medical treatments. The objective of this study was to
assess whether psycho-educational plans (self management and behavior modification) administered in primary care have
beneficial effects on symptoms of patients with COPD.
Material and Methods: The study was a prospective, unblinded, randomized controlled trial of usual care vs. usual care plus
structured education on the use of 8 sessions of “self management and behavior modification” group education: a simple
educational package on life style modification and assumption of special behaviors in different situations of disease. The
study was conducted in two educational hospitals (Khorshid & Alzahra) in Isfahan, Iran. Participants were 42 patients with
COPD randomized into control or intervention groups. The primary outcome measure was change in severity of COPD
symptoms that measured with "Clinical COPD Questionnaire" (CCQ). The data were analyzed with SPSS software and
statistic examination called Ancova- Repeated measure and Mancova-Repeated measure.
Results: Self management and behavior modification education were associated with significant higher decrease in mean
score of CCQ in symptom, functional state and mental state domains but had no effect on change in mean score of
CCQ-Total.
Conclusion: Mean score of CCQ in symptom, functional state and mental state domains was lower in the intervention group
but there was no difference in mean score of CCQ-Total due to “self-management and behavior modification” plans.

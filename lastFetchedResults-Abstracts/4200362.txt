In the Multimedia and Mobile Agent Research Laboratory an underway work is conducted toward combining management policies and Mobile Agents in the area of collaborative applications. The goal is to have a collaborative system thoroughly based on agents and highly flexible and dynamically manageable through multi-level policies. Towards this objective, we have designed a global framework to support policies. This framework is used to define, store and evaluate policies defined through multiple levels of the collaborative system. Moreover, the policies are distributed judiciously over the application. This paper describes the Policy Management System we have elaborated and illustrates its integration with the V-Team system

Multimedia modelers from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and US Department of Energy (DOE) are collaborating to conduct a comprehensive and quantitative benchmarking analysis of four intermedia models: MEPAS, MMSOILS, PRESTO, and RESRAD. These models represent typical analytically based tools that are used in human-risk and endangerment assessments at installations containing radioactive and hazardous contaminants. The objective is to demonstrate an approach for developing an adequate source term by simplifying an existing, real-world, 90Sr plume at DOE's Hanford installation in Richland, WA, for use in a multimedia benchmarking exercise between MEPAS, MMSOILS, PRESTO, and RESRAD. Source characteristics and a release mechanism are developed and described; also described is a typical process and procedure that an analyst would follow in developing a source term for using this class of analytical tool in a preliminary assessment.

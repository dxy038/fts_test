Conclusions in light of fatigue data, subjective data and validity data &#8226; Some support for more muscle fatigue for outboard displays and resistive displays &#8226; Highest fatigue prevalent in &#8216;flying&#8217; shoulder &#8226; Strong preference against touch in the overhead location &#8226; Validation of need for hand stabilization &#8226; Validation of higher errors for outboard position being due, at least in large part, to handedness. &#8226; Low correlation between objective and subjective muscle fatigue data is interesting &#8212; Data shows people were experiencing more fatigue than they thought they were

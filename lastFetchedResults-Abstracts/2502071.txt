Objective(s): Nepeta binaludensis Jamzad (Lamiaceae) has been used in folk medicine of Iran to cure various diseases. The plant is an endemic species to the country that has recently been identified in Razavi Khorasan province. To evaluate the antioxidant and anti-melanogenesis of N. binaludensis, in this study the inhibitory activity of different extracts of N. binaludensis in murine melanoma B16F10 cells is investigated.Â 
Materials and Methods: The effects of petroleum ether, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts isolated from the plant on melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells were investigated.To assess the inhibitory effects of this plant on melanogenesis, various assays were used including cytotoxicity, inhibition of mushroom tyrosinase and cellular tyrosinase, determination of melanin content, the effect of extracts on reactive oxygen species and western blot analysis of proteins involved in melanogenesis process.
Results: The content of melanin and the activity of tyrosinase were significantly reduced with different extracts of N. binaludensis in cells. Reactive oxygen species was also significantly decreased following the treatment of cell with the mentioned extracts, while a resazurin assay showed no cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we have found that the plant decreased the amount of tyrosinase and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor proteins, which verify the role of suppression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor protein in melanogenesis inhibition.
Conclusion: Taken together the data indicate that N. binaludensis has inhibitory activity on melanin synthesis with no cytotoxic effects in B16 melanoma cells. Therefore, it merits future investigations to apply as whitening agent in hyperpigmentation.

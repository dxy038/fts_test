H.264 can provide both objective and subjective image quality superior to existing standards by adopting new technical developments. But these developments increase the complexity and computation load of motion estimation greatly and make the encoder too complex to be applied in real-time applications. Although many fast algorithms are proposed, most of them would easily be trapped into local minimum. In this paper, we proposed a fast algorithm based on SAE reuse that can efficiently reduce the computational cost and quicken the matching speed while keeping the same quality.

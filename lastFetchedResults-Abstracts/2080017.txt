The main objective of this research is to develop a model of the dynamics of stream aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. This research involves both theoretical and experimental aspects. The theoretical portion includes the development of a simulation model of macroinvertebrate community dynamics. This model is written using STELLA software [Stella Software Technical Documentation]. The experimental portion focuses on the validation of the model by comparing its simulations with observations from Holly Springs Creek in South Carolina, USA. The model developed through this research reflects the most important links between the aquatic insects, the dominant macroinvertebrates of most streams, and their environment, enabling insight into relationships in lotic ecosystems. This knowledge provides a theoretical basis for a better understanding of various environmental interactions in streams, making it possible to use the model for the theoretical analysis of macroinvertebrate community functioning, studies of lotic ecosystems, and stream management.

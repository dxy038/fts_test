The Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE) is considered to be a propulsion system of next generation air vehicles. Structural simplicity and performance reliability enabled pulsejet to be exemplary for the use in mini aerospace vehicle. The objective of the present study is to model an efficient Pulse Detonation Engine. A number of simulation are done in order to understand the flow field variation and PDE performance. CFD software FLUENT is used to simulate the influence of single and double inlet PDE performance. In the current study, single and double inlet engines are drawn and meshed in GAMBIT and later on imported to FLUENT for analysis. The results of the simulation were discussed using velocity, pressure contours and with various other plots. The preset paper can be used as a reference for future enhancement.

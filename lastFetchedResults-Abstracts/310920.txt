Objective. To establish a surgical simulation system of skin sutures using a three-dimensional finite element method.

Design. Three-dimensional finite element models were developed from point data obtained with a rapid three-dimensional surface-measuring device and postoperative profiles were evaluated using these models.

Background. Since suturing a wound may result in undesirable skin extrusion, it is important to make the extrusion as inconspicuous as possible. We have investigated a means of determining appropriate suture methods to decrease the extrusion.

Methods. Affected body parts were measured non-invasively with a rapid three-dimensional surface-measuring device. Finite element models were prepared, and an appropriate method for reducing skin extrusion was evaluated by attempting various suturing methods.

Results. Two kinds of finite element models were prepared: a conventional spindle model and a modified S-shape model. The height of the extrusion of the modified S-shape model was decreased by 40% in comparison with that of the spindle model. These results agreed with clinical findings.

Conclusions. Due to this surgical simulation system of skin sutures, with a rapid three-dimensional surface-measuring device and three-dimensional finite element analysis, it was possible to design an appropriate suturing method and to evaluate the postoperative skin profiles. The modified S-shape suture method would be a recommendable method.

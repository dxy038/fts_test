The paper outlines the IECEx scheme currently being prepared for voting within the membership of the IECEE with the objective of establishing a &#8220;World Class&#8221; Certification scheme for electrical equipment intended to be used in hazardous areas. Harmonised standards are the starting point with IEC appointed Testing Houses issuing IEC &#8220;Certificates of Conformity&#8221; which would be valid worldwide without further testing or certification. The proposals are based on the existing scheme within Europe and the risks and benefits are discussed both from the manufacturer´s and user´s point of view

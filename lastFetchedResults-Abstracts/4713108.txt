This paper presents two comprehensive models of DC subway traction system to simulate the starting-up process using Matlab/simulink. One is DC motor driven, the other is AC motor driven. The model includes substation rectifiers, the track and the different driven subway trains. The objective of the model is to study the short circuit faults and the train starting current. Analysis and conclusion of simulation results are given, which pointed out the difficulty of discrimination remote short circuit current against train starting current.

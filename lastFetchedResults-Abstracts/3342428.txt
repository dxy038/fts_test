Now use of social networking site becomes so usual thing in day to day life of the people. The people using the OSNs are more connected to society. While connecting the people shares lot more data and contents with each other. The social networking sites like Face Book, Google+, Twitter provide the userÂ´s own space to share the contents like images, comments, other sharing contents and along with that the privacy policies also. But still there is a problem of privacy and security of data and content when the multiple users belong to the same content or data. In this paper we propose the new system or an approach which protects the shared data in multiple user environments. Here we formulate the model for access control for multiuser environment. We will formulate the mechanism of authorization for shared data in OSNs. Here we will also focus on the fake identity in social networks and its solution. One more problem of private data leakage on such a sites that also going to resolve by providing the different mechanism for protecting data. The scope of this proposed system is there where the privacy and protection of the shared data is important in multiuser environment like OSNs. The objective is to decrease the privacy issues in multiparty access control and to improve the protection and security of the shared data in OSNs when there are multiple parties to control. Also to supply the authorization mechanism in multiparty environment along with the fake identity attack prevention. Along with this we are going to propose new system for hiding private information from the social networks by masking mechanism.

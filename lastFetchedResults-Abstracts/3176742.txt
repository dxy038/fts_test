Cafeterias play a vital role in universities, however, in China, where shows a high frequency of occupational ill health at university cafeterias´ staffs, few researches have been conducted on ergonomics in university cafeterias. The objective of this study is to investigate the physical ergonomics situations in Chinese university cafeterias and find out the reasons behind such a high occupational diseases frequency. Investigation in our university´s cafeteria and ergonomic simulation of providing meal tasks at peak hours were carried out. Cafeteria´s situation was simulated by using Siemens Jack. Four main task analysis toolkits (TAT) were used; they were NIOSH, Metabolic energy expenditure, Ovako Working Posture Analysis (OWAS) and Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA). This study demonstrates that reducing the working hours and minimizing the loads on staffs´ hands show benefits for reducing exposure to occupational illness during Chinese university cafeterias´ working. It is urgent to develop programs that provide staffs with necessary ergonomics knowledge and skills regarding proper working postures.

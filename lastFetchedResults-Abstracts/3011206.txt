Waveform concatenation has been the method used in many low-quality speech synthesis experiments. The objective of this study was to find new ways to overcome the inherent difficulties in concatenating speech sample waveforms. Our experiments in Finnish and Polish show that it is feasible to develop simple and inexpensive synthesizers with natural and high-quality human-like characteristics. The implementation can be based on standard microprocessors and D/A-converters without expensive signal processing hardware. This paper describes the results of the experiments and conclusions to the design of speech synthesis that we call the microphonemic method.

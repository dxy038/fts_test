Background: Hypoxia is a common phenomenon in human solid tumors which by increasing in angiogenesis induction cause tumor growth survival and metastasis.
Inhibitory factor hypoxia regulatory factor (HIF1AN) by binding to transcription co activators         )CBP/P300(, inhibits hypoxia inducible factor (HIF1?). 
Objective: The relationship between HIF1AN expression and vascular invasion in colon tumors.
Methods: The study included 101 patients with colon adenocarcinoma which were divided to vascular invasion and non-vascular invasion groups. Tumor paraffin blocks were immunohistochemistry stained for HIF1AN and were assessed for intensity and extent of positivity.
Statistical relation of marker expression and clinic pathologic findings were assessed. Data were analyzed by SPSS 21 software and logistic regression and chi-square test. 
Findings: Nuclear immunoreactivity of HIF1AN was different between two groups. Statistical relation between low HIF1AN expression and tumor vascular invasion were seen (P=0.01). No relation was found between tumor differentiation, depth and HIF1AN.
Conclusion: Evidence showed that the low expression or incorrect position of HIF1AN in nucleus of tumor cells was effective on HIF1? inhibition failure and factors associated angiogenesis increased. The HIF1AN played an tumor suppressor gene (TSG( role in colon tumors and decreased protein in the nucleus of colon cancer cells increased the expression of angiogenesis factors and vascular invasion.

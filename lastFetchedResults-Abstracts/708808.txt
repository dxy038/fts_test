Background and Objective: Visfatin is a recently discovered adipokine. Previous studies have shown a direct relationship between plasma visfatin levels and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The current study was conducted to investigate the effect of aerobic exercise on plasma level of visfatin in type 2 diabetic men treated with metformin.

Materials and Methods: Thirty-six men with type 2 diabetes who consumed metformin (age 46.08 ± 3.08 years, BMI 30.1± 2.32 kg/m2) volunteered to participate in this study. Subjects were randomly assigned in 2 groups. In this respect, 18 subjects were in the aerobic exercise group (3 days per week, 35 to 50 min per day, 40-55% heart rate reserve) and 18 subjects in the control group. Fasting plasma visfatin, insulin, glucose and HbA1c concentrations were measured before and after 8 weeks of exercise in these diabetic patients. For analysis of data, repeated measures ANOVA was used.

Results: The findings showed that plasma visfatin level, insulin, glucose, HbA1c, BMI, WHR and body fat percentage significantly decrease in aerobic exercise group as compared to control group (p < 0.05). The peak rate of oxygen consumption (vo2 peak) significantly increased in aerobic exercise group as compared to control group (p < 0.05).

Conclusion: The present study showed that decreased plasma visfatin level induced by aerobic exercise is most likely the result of improving glycemic status in type 2 diabetes patients treated with metformin.

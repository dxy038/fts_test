This study presents a novel fundamental modulation strategy with selective harmonic elimination (SHE) for multilevel inverters. Compared with conventional schemes, more kinds of stepped waveforms can be adaptively synthesised and it is more possible to obtain the optimal solutions for the SHE problem, especially at low-modulation indices. The control purpose, SHE and fundamental voltage control, for a cascaded 11-level inverter is formulated as multi-objective optimisation problem which is solved by using shuffled frog leaping algorithm in this study. The theoretical and experimental results are presented to confirm the validity of the proposed modulation scheme.

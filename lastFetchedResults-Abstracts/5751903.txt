The technology-based innovation model in China has passed through stages as: Secondary innovation, Portfolio innovation and Total Innovation Management (TIM). The Total element Innovation (AEI), All Involvement Innovation (AII) and All Time-Space Innovation are three main aspects of TIM theory. The objective of this paper is to study the interaction between AEI and AII. We conclude that AII is the foundation of AEI and also influenced by AEI. Finally, the case study of Haier, the famous Chinese film, will help to support our conclusion.

The objective of this paper is to propose a new velocity measurement method for an electro-mechanical fin actuator. The model of the electro-mechanical fin actuator includes uncertainties such as unknown disturbances and parameter variations in flight condition. In this paper, model following sliding mode controller (MFSMC) is used as a position controller of the electro-mechanical fin actuator, due to the robustness against these uncertainties. MFSMC requires not only position information but also velocity information. Usually, analog tachometers have been used for velocity feedback in an electro-mechanical fin actuator. However, using these types of sensors have problems such as the cost, space, and malfunction. These problems lead to propose a new velocity measurement method using linear type Hall-effect sensor. In order to verify the proposed method, several experiments are performed with a fin actuator. It is shown that the MFSMC with a new velocity measurement method using linear type Hall-effect sensor can satisfy the requirements without using of velocity sensor.

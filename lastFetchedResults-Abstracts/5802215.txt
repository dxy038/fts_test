The paper looks at the problem of Ultra Wideband (UWB) impulse beamforming using linear array, when the desired signal and several interferences from different directions are received by the antenna array. These signals and interferences are UWB signals having Gaussian power spectral density form. The objective is to suppress the interferences, while keeping the power of desired signal unchanged. In this paper we propose a UWB smart antenna which points its main beam towards prestreed direction of the array and suppresses interference and noise coming from other than the look direction of the array. Antenna weights are calculated adaptively to meet the above conditions. We also analyze the SESfR (Signal to Interference noise ratio) of the array for different interference directions, when the desired signal is coming in prestreed direction. Finally simulation results show the suppression capabilities of the proposed smart antenna.

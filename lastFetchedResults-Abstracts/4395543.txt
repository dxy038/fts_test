A photovoltaic (PV) module integrated converter (PVMIC) composed of a PV panel and its parallel-connected bidirectional flyback converter is proposed for solving the partial shadow problems. The PVMIC includes sleeping mode, energy feedback mode, bypass-diode mode and DC module mode. Based on PVMIC, the novel PV generation system adjust the operating modes to accommodate the different shadow level and thus to ensure maximum power output of the PV array. In this approach, the PV system has higher conversion efficiency, higher PV output power and enhanced operation functions in the condition of partial shadow. The feasibility of proposed method is verified by the simulations and experimental results.

Isfahan is one of the touristic poles of Iran that is famous due to its historic and natural aspects. Mâdies, several manmade streams derived from Zayandeh-rood river constructed originally to irrigate the farmlands, today constitute part of natural aspects and the structure of the city. Because of their unique characterand belonging only to Isfahan, Mâdies are very important as natural and historic heritages of the city. Therefor their maintenance and rehabilitation is one of the main objectives of city managers. Mâdies have similar functional, physical and spatial characteristics with greenways. This resemblance led to their improvement as real greenways with same standards. To do this, at the first step, an evaluation is necessary to define what are the differences and similarities between Mâdies and greenways which constitute the main objective of this study. In order to achieve this objective, at the first step, Mâdies and greenways and their respective characteristic have been identified and categorized through the literature available such as documents, maps and texts. Considering the standards of greenways as the basis, a comparison has been down using 24 indicators categorized in 7 groups of criteria. Data has been gathered through observation, recording and questionnaire and then the quantification has been down explaining the modality of measurements and units. The findings show that in order to transforming Mâdies to a network of ideal greenways some criteria need to be improved in priority such as “sociability (D)”. Explaining according weaknesses and strengths, the best category is “safety (C)”.

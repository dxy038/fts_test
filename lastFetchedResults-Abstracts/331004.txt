Sealing of approximal enamel lesions by infiltration with low viscous resins seems to be a promising approach in non-operative dentistry and should bear advantages compared to remineralization or invasive treatment.
Objective

The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the penetration ability of five dental adhesives and a fissure sealant into initial enamel lesions for an application time of either 15 s or 30 s.
Methods

In each of 54 specimens of bovine enamel, three windows were demineralized for 14 days. Subsequently, two windows were etched with phosphoric acid for 5 s in order to degrade the surface layer, whereas one window served as untreated control. The specimens were randomly divided into six groups and a fissure sealant as well as five different adhesives were applied onto the subsurface lesions and allowed to penetrate for either 15 or 30 s. Overlying material was wiped away and the resins were light cured. To visualize the penetrated resins and the remaining pore structures, the specimens were infiltrated with a low viscous fluorescent resin and studied using a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM).
Results

For Helioseal, Heliobond, Resulcin Monobond, and Excite an application time of 30 s resulted in significantly higher (p<0.05; t-test) penetration depths (47–105 μm) compared to 15 s (29–49 μm).
Significance

Helioseal, Heliobond, Resulcin Monobond, and Excite are suitable for sealing artificial subsurface enamel lesions in vitro. After an application time of 30 s a significant deeper penetration could be observed for these materials.

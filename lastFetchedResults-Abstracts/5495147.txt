Based on combination of the microstructure and catalytic performance of desulphurizer, the paper proposes the evaluation model for desulphurizer performance based on Fuzzy Probabilistic Neural Network Model (FPNN) which combines the relative membership degree in fuzzy mathematics with Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). In addition, the results of MATLAB simulation verification show that the calculation of this method is succinct rapid, and the evaluative result is objective.

The question of why bank customers decide to cross-buy and to enhance their relationship with a bank has received scant attention in the literature, and has not been appropriately investigated in prior studies. The first purpose of this study is to address this research gap by developing and assessing an objective research model to weigh the factors that affect intention of cross-buying insurance in banks. The second purpose of this study is to identify the resulting degree of satisfaction of these factors. The gaps between the factors of cross-buying intention and the resulting satisfaction are recognized by using the "Importance Performance Analysis." On the basis of the findings, bancassurance strategy makers can identify and allocate the marketing or operational resources for an organization accordingly.

Some illustrative examples are provided to identify the ineffective and unrealistic characteristics of existing approaches to solving fuzzy linear programming (FLP) problems (with single or multiple objectives). We point out the error in existing methods concerning the ranking of fuzzy numbers and thence suggest an effective method to solve the FLP. Based on the consistent centroid-based ranking of fuzzy numbers, the FLP problems are transformed into non-fuzzy single (or multiple) objective linear programming. Solutions of FLP are then crisp single or multiple objective programming problems, which can respectively be obtained by conventional methods.

An integrated dimensional and drive train optimization method was developed for light-weight robotic arm design. The method deals with the determination of optimal link lengths and the optimal selection of motors and gearboxes from commercially available components. Constraints are formulated on the basis of kinematic performance and dynamic requirements, whereas the main objective is to minimize the weight. The design of a human-like arm, which is 10 kg in weight with a load capacity of 5 kg, is described.

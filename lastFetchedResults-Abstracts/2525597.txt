Study on release rate of nonexchangeable potassium (NEK) is necessary for management and optimum use of soil resources and determination of availability and supplying power of potassium in soils containing potassium minerals. Information about NEK release rate in Fars Province calcareous soils is limited. The objective of this study included an investigation of the dynamics of NEK in some soils from Fars Province by successive extraction with 0.01M Oxalic acid and determination of the relation between kinetics of NEK release with soil properties and clay mineralogy. The results of this experiment showed that the initial NEK release rate was rapid, but slowed down later on. Results showed that cumulative K release ranged from 91 to 233 mg kg-1(average 144.3 mg kg-1). The amount of NEK released after 1028 h was significantly correlated with CEC, NEK, and CCE.  Elovich, power function and First order equations described well the NEK release kinetics based on their highest determination coefficient and their lowest value of the standard error of the estimate. Maximum of potassium release was observed in Vertisols, probably because of high amount of clay content and the clay mineral of smectite and mica. Also, the amount of K release was in the following order: Vertisols > Alfisols >  Inceptisols >  Entisols > Aridisols. In the correlation test, the rate constants in the kinetic equations were correlated with some chemical properties and particle size distribution.

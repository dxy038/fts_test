The static and centralized routing of voice and data traffic in burst switched networks is addressed. It is assumed that the routing allows random bifurcation in voice and data paths and preemptive priorities for voice requirements. A study is made of routing of voice only, by using a multicommodity flow model with linearized link losses and average network loss as a minimization objective. Solving the resulting linear program, it is observed that optimal routing strategies prefer to freeze a requirement at an early stage of its path rather than those requirements that are close to their destinations. A study is made of the voice-data interaction at the link level using an available fluid-flow model, and the combined link performance is translated as a maximum flow constraint on a link. This constraint may have undesirable effects on the voice, such as introducing routes with flow absorbing loops, and unfair freezing of some requirements. All conflicting multiple objectives and constraints are included in a linear programming formulation, and it is shown how parameters can be tuned to produce desirable voice and data paths

A multi-robot system is formed when a group of robots interact with the environment as a single system. This system can also be in formation in order to accomplish tasks rather difficult or impossible to achieve with a single robot. A nonlinear model predictive formation control (NMPFC) was used to converge a group of middle sized mobile soccer robots towards a desired target using the concept of active target tracking. This paper presents a novel approach on formation controller´s weight tuning in order to minimize an objective function that reflects the controller´s efficiency with respect to a given criteria. Furthermore, the results of simulation and experiment with real robots are presented and discussed.

A reliable differential evolution (DE) based algorithm for solving environmentally constrained economic dispatch (ECED) problem is presented in this paper. Environmentally constrained economic dispatch (ECED) problem is obtained by considering both the economy and emission objectives. A price penalty factor approach is used to convert the bi-objective ECED problem into a single objective function. Equality constraints on power balance as well as inequality constraints on generation capacity limits of the generators and transmission losses are considered. A six-unit test system is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results of the proposed method based on DE are compared with other standard methods. It is found that convergence rate of the proposed method is excellent and the results obtained by the proposed method are superior in terms of fuel cost, emission output and losses. It is further observed that the computation time is considerably reduced in DE.

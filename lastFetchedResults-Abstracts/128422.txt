Objective: The purpose of this study to evaluated a double blind randomized clinical trial effect of allopurinol in chronic nonbacterial prostatitis in comparison to the ofloxacine.
Materials and Methods: Our cases (N-56) were randomly assigned to two groups: "interventional group" received alluporinol in addition to the routine antibiotic therapy with ofloxacin (n-=27) and "control group" received placebo with ofloxacine (n29). Patients' scores based on the National Institute of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Score and four glass test recorded before and after therapy in both groups.
Results: The two groups were similar regarding outcome variables. In the first month of the study, a significant but similar improvement in symptom scores was observed in both groups. Conclusion: We did not find any advantage for allopurinol in management of chronic prostatitis versus placebo in patients receiving routine antibacterial treatment.

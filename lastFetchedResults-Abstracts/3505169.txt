Software reliability measurement during the testing phase is essential for examining the degree of quality or reliability of a developed software system. A software-reliability growth model incorporating the amount of test effort expended during the software testing phase is developed. The time-dependent behavior of test-effort expenditures is described by a Weibull curve. Assuming that the error detection rate to the amount of test effort spent during the testing phase is proportional to the current error content, the model is formulated by a nonhomogeneous Poission process. Using the model, the method of data analysis for software reliability measurement is developed. This model is applied to the prediction of additional test-effort expenditures to achieve the objective number of errors detected by software testing, and the determination of the optimum time to stop software testing for release

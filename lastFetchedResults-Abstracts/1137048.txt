Introduction: We conducted a multi-centric phase II study to evaluate the tumor response and safety of the
combination of vinorelbin and docetaxel in treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients.
Patients and methods: Forty one metastatic breast cancer patients, who had at least one measurable lesion and
had not been treated for metastasis before, were enrolled from March 2006 to June 2009. Treatment contained
vinorelbine 25mg/m2 IV and docetaxel 30mg/m2 at day 1 and 8. Cycles were repeated every 21 days for 6 cycles.
We evaluated response to chemotherapy every three weeks and toxicity every week.
Results: The mean age of patients was 50.4 years (range 30-81). Twenty eight patients (68.2%) had received prior
neoadjuvant anthracycline based chemotherapy. No patient had received adjuvant chemotherapy within the
last 3 months. Twenty four patients (58.3%) had two or more metastatic sites. Thirty six patients were evaluable
for their response. An objective tumor response (either complete response or partial response) was achieved
in 32 (88.8%) and complete response was seen in 9 (25%) patients. Thirteen patients (31.6%) developed grade
3-4 neutropenia and neutropenic fever was reported in 11 (26.8%). Grade 3 anemia was observed in 1 patient
(2.4%). No grade 4 non-hematological toxicity was noted and the most frequent grade 3 non-hematological
toxicities were hair loss (39%), stomatitis (7.3%) and diarrhea (4.8%). Median time to progression was 7 months
and median overall survival was 11 months.
Conclusion: Vinorelbine-docetaxel combination shows a considerable tumor response and manageable toxicity
as the first line treatment for metastatic breast cancer. It seems logical to conduct phase III trials to further
evaluate this regimen.

A strategy for grid power peak shaving and valley filling using vehicle-to-grid systems (V2G) is proposed. The architecture of the V2G systems and the logical relationship between their sub-systems are described. An objective function of V2G peak-shaving control is proposed and the main constraints are formulated. The influences of the number of connected EVs and the average value of the target curve are analyzed. The rms and the standard deviation of the difference between the target and planned curves are proposed as indices for measuring the degree of matching between the two curves. The simulation results demonstrate that peaking shaving using V2G can be effective and controllable, and the proposed control algorithm is feasible.

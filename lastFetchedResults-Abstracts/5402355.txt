The main objective of this paper is to describe the KAARE (knowledge availability, access, retrieval and extraction) system, a generic business model for knowledge extraction of semi structured and unstructured data from Web pages. The system is ontology driven and provides a set of generic tools that will enable an effective access, retrieval and filtering of information available on the World Wide Web. The interactive model is composed of five managers namely the query manager, the ontology manager, the search manager, the information manager, and the presentation manager. Each manager is responsible for carrying out the delegated tasks from which valid inferences can be made.

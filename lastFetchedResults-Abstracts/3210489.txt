In view of uncertainty or unascertained of attribute value, three tasks were accomplished with technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) based on credibility theory: (1)A weigh calculation model on credibility measure maximum chance-constrained multiple objective programming (CCMOP) was worked out, then it was changed into single objective decision model for calculating weight easily, (2) Considering unascertained of attribute value, a optimistic critical values ordering method based on chance was put forward, (3)A simulation hybrid algorithm of decision model on TOPSIS based on chance constrained was built.

Video transmission on unreliable networks can produce artifacts on received images due to either the loss of a part of the bit-stream or its corruption. In this paper we describe a H.264/AVC decoder robust to transmission errors, which contains an innovative algorithm, based on temporal correlation between frames and scene change detection, that greatly improves the objective and subjective quality of incorrectly decoded images, with a computational complexity allowing real-time implementation.

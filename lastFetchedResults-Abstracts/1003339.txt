Objective (s): Achieving the objectives of planned programs in the Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) depends on the successful implementation of operational planning (OP). In the last few years an attempt was made to deploy OP in different units. This paper reports on a system design and using process reengineering models in order to renew the existing OP.
Methods: Data were collected by several approaches including literature review, focus group discussions, interviews, and questionnaires. Ten principles were set on how to redesign the existing operational planning system. Based on these principles, main processes, procedures, and standards were redesigned in both regulations and procedures.
Results: The results showed three important strengths of the operational planning system: support of top managers, law, and the experience of ministry of health in implementation of operational planning. The most important challenges of current OP system were: weakness in coordination, and audit and accreditation of the process. Thus a new OP was proposed. Strengths of the new OP model includes compatibility with result chain activities, existence of a scientific OP glossary, project oriented approach, compatibility of decision making levels with the structure of MOHME, documentation, establishment of the relationship between employer, contractor, and the spectator, categorized evaluation, timing, clear relation between OP and allocated budget, encouragement, and education of process owners and finally internal and external compatibility of programs.
Conclusion: Despite various strengths of existing OP systems, critical success factor of the newly proposed model is the audit of the defined programs and projects.

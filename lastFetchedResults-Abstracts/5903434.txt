Energy-efficient use is a critical issue in the design of wireless multi-hop networks such as wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. Location-based routing protocols are known to have high efficiency, robustness, and scalability and are suitable to be deployed in wireless multi-hop networks. In this paper, we present the design of an energy-efficient localized geographic forwarding algorithm. The design objective is to prolong the lifetime of wireless multi-hop networks. To achieve this goal, our algorithm design employs the strategies of localized implementation of DijkstraÂ´s algorithm and energy criticality avoidance when making decisions on next hop selections for packets forwarding. Simulation results demonstrate that our designed algorithm can achieve high performance in terms of network lifetime.

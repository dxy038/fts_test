Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently widely used in medical image diagnosis. However, MR scanners are extensively used in climes and thus are rarely accessible for experimentation. In consequence, the number of images available for image processing methods evaluation is too low and there appears a need for a method to generate synthetic images. In their previous works, the authors studied various methods for blood vessels segmentation and tracking. Effectiveness of the designed algorithms requires objective verification which implies repetition of experiments for large number of images and comparing the results with some ground truth models. Therefore, this study aims at designing a computer system which implements numerical routines for generation of synthetic MRA images. In particular, in this paper we study the performance of various configurations of assembled computer grid and analyze their potential in angiographic image synthesis.

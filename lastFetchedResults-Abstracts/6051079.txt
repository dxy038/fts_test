The code-excited linear predictive (CELP) coder is considered to be a good candidate for speech coding at low bit rates. Although the speech quality of this coder is good, certain distortions can still be perceived. The long-term predictor is a crucial part in CELP coder. The authors introduce some procedures to find the long-term predictor parameters. They improve the synthetic speech quality quite a lot both in objective (signal-to-noise ratio) and subjective (listening tests) measures

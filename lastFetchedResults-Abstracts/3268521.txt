The Hybrid4 PSA Peugeot Citroe&#776;n architecture is one of the most complex HEV (Hybrid Electric Vehicle) in the market. This vehicleÂ´s architecture is called double parallel HEV. The complexity of this technology makes its control complex. The objective of this paper is to highlight the different benefits of this architecture regarding different driving cycles. The Energetic Macroscopic Representation is used to describe and to deduce the systematic control.

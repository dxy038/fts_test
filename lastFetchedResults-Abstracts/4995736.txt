Exergoeconomic and thermoeconomic analysis are among powerful and effective tools to find the best solutions between the two objective functions that can be used by energy engineers, minimizing economic cost and maximizing exergetic efficiency. In this research, operating parameters of a gas turbine power plant that produces 140 MW of electricity is optimized by using exergoeconomic principles and PSO algorithm. The comparison of results between the PSO algorithm and the base model shows very good improvements, i.e. the fuel mass flow rate by optimized parameters is 11.24% lower than the base case. Also the exergetic efficiency is 6.55% more than the base case. The verification by fuzzy logic shows that total matching PSO results and base case is 99.5%.

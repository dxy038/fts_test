IPTV is an emerging multimedia network application over prevalent Internet. IPTV over P2P streaming network preserves significant advantages in scalability over conventional client-server architecture. IPTV media content delivered in P2P networks over public Internet still preserves the issues of privacy and intellectual property. In this paper, we use SIP protocol to construct a secure application-layer multicast overlay network, called SIPTVMON, with load-balancing and stability. SIPTVMON can secure all the IPTV media delivery paths against the eavesdroppers via elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), SIP signaling and AES encryption. The proposed SIPTVMON also optimizes the load-balancing overlay tree by not only the link bandwidth to minimize the service latency, but also the life time to minimize the service degradations from frequent users´ joins and leaving. The performance results from simulation and experiments in very large scale demonstrate the SIPTVMON´s cost-effectiveness in quality of privacy protection and stability with good perceptual quality of objective PSNR values for IPTV.

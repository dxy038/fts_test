The direct conversion of solar light into mechanical power within nonequilibrium phase transitions of first order had been presented at previous IECEC 1998 on the concept of the renewable thermodynamics of self-organized heat cycles to describe several new physical phenomena in liquids. This paper is to promote the principles of renewable thermodynamics created by observation of spontaneous physical processes converting light &#8220;by itself&#8221; into mechanical power for new engineering design of the actual engineering constructions powered by sunlight. Several solar renewable heat cycles are modeled by using perfect gas powered by light to find how thermodynamics of reversible cycles can be involved in the concept of applied renewable thermodynamics to study available thermal and actual efficiencies of prospective constructions. Both concepts are considered in parallel to find the fundamental restriction for direct conversion of sunlight in different new power and propulsive systems. The master equation for motion of a vector state having both mechanical and thermal degrees of freedom proposed to solve the problem of efficiency. The problem to have the actual efficiency beyond thermal efficiency (Carnot theorem) has formulated as a principally available objective for new generation of direct solar energy conversion systems

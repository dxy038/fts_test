The purpose of this paper is to implement association rule mining algorithm using Nvidia CUDA framework for general purpose computing on GPU. The major objective is to perform performance comparison of association rule mining algorithm using C based implementation on Intel Quad Core/Core2 Duo CPU with CUDA based implementation on Nvidia G80 and GTX 200 series GPU. The final outcome of this research is the bitmap based association rule mining algorithm and its performance statistics on CPU and GPU.

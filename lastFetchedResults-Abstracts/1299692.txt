Background and Objective: Method of student evaluation affects way of their studying. The aim of this study was to compare nursing student performance in essay and multiple-choice questions in mother and child health examination in Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences.
Materials and Methods:  In this study, scores of forty multiple-choice questions in final examination of 121 nursing students over four years of graduate study were compared with the scores of forty essay questions. Data was analyzed by paired t-test and Pearson correlation test with P < 0.05 as significant.
Results: Mean and standard deviation of scores in students were 14.72±3.7 for essay questions and 16.53±2.4 for multiple-choice questions (P < 0.001).There was a positive correlation between the essay and multiple-choice questions(r=0.93). 
Conclusion: Students' performance was better in multiple-choice questions than the essay questions. Use of multiple-choice questions may result in the success of students who do not think analytically. Therefore, we suggest using different types of questions including essay questions in addition to multiple-choice questions in examinations.

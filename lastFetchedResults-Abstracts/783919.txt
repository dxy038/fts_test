Objective To determine the distinctions between the client–
keyworker relationship and the client–vocational
worker relationship by assessing their impact on clinical
outcomes and exploring the associations between the two.
Methods As part of an international randomised controlled
trial of supported employment (n = 312), client–keyworker
relationship and client–vocational worker relationship were
each tested against clinical and social functioning 6 months
later. Associations between the two relationships over time
were explored.
Results Client–keyworker relationship predicted quality
of life, while client–vocational worker relationship, as
rated by the client, did not predict any clinical or social
functioning outcomes. Vocational worker-rated relationship
predicted reduced depression. The client–keyworker
and client–vocational worker relationships were correlated,
but this did not change over time.
Conclusion The impact of the client–vocational worker is
likely to be on the shared task of finding employment,
rather than on clinical and social functioning. Good client–
vocational worker relationships do not detract from client–
keyworker relationships

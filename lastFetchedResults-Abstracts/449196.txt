Purpoe
To evaluate macular volume in normal and glaucomatou eye uing optical coherence tomography (OCT).
Deign
Cae control tudy.
Method
The author aeed 272 eye of 164 ubject a part of an intitutional tudy at New England Eye Center in Boton, Maachuett; 202 eye were in the tudy group and 70 eye in the control group. Eye were categorized a normal (70 eye of 43 ubject), glaucoma upect (70 eye of 44 ubject), early glaucoma (70 eye of 47 ubject), or advanced glaucoma (62 eye of 43 ubject). ubject underwent analyi with the commercially available OCT1 unit. Optical coherence tomography macular neuroenory retinal thickne map were ued to calculate macular volume for comparion to Humphrey viual field teting, intraocular preure meaurement, and tereo biomicrocopy of the optic nerve head and nerve fiber layer.
Reult
Uing repeated meaure regreion, macular volume in normal (2.37 ± 0.11 mm3) glaucoma upect (2.33 ± 0.16 mm3), and early glaucoma eye (2.27 ± 0.13 mm3) wa ignificantly greater than in eye with advanced glaucoma (2.12 ± 0.23 mm3, P = .0001, P = .0001, and P = .0008, repectively). Macular volume in normal eye wa ignificantly greater than in early glaucoma eye (P = .01).
Concluion
Optical coherence tomography retinal macular volume correlate with known tructural defect of glaucoma, providing a potential objective and quantitative parameter for evaluation. Our data how a ignificant difference in macular volume between normal, glaucoma upect, and early glaucoma eye, compared with advanced glaucomatou eye a well a between normal and early glaucomatou eye. Thi correlate with a trend of decreaing macular volume in eye with more advanced dieae.

In this paper, we study a pair of fuzzy primalâ€“dual linear programming problems and calculate duality results using an aspiration level approach. We use an exponential membership function, which is in contrast to the earlier works that relied on a linear membership function. As the fuzzy environment causes a duality gap, we investigate how choosing the exponential membership function impacts this gap. This issue is particularly important for fuzzy linear programming where, in general, the primal and dual objective values may not be bounded.

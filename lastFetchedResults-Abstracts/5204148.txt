The present paper introduces a novel harmonics voltage compensation solution for nonlinear (diode rectifier) load operation in stand alone PMSG with bidirectional converter motion sensorless vector control. Both the case of three phases and two phase output of the load side converter, with voltage symmetrisation by negative component active cancellation, are treated. The latter is called unbalanced load handling. The main solutions for motion sensorless vector control of the two back-to-back PWM converters with loops to compensate output voltage harmonics and its negative sequence for diode rectifier load are introduced, implemented and validated through experimental results on 2.2 Kw PMSG systems.

This paper examines the improvement that can be attained with perfect knowledge of the sound source directivity pattern and orientation in beamformer designs in the problem of speech acquisition. Data-independent beamformers are derived through formulation of a constrained optimization problem with a unity-gain constraint. Using computer simulation, these beamforming schemes are compared to the delay and sum (DS) beamformer and the best single sensor in a reverberant room environment. Criteria used to measure performance are: (1) the direct to reverberant ratio, to assess extent of reverberation suppression; and (2) an objective measure of speech intelligibility called the speech transmission index (STI). For human-speaker source directivity, simulation results show that modest improvements to performance are obtainable.

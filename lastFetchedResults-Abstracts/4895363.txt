GMV, leading a European consortium, has recently been responsible for the development of SCOS-2000 Release 4.0 (SCOS-2000 R4.0). The overall objective of the project, as described in this paper, was the production of the SCOS-2000 R4.0 infrastructure mission control system for the European Space Agency. The main tasks performed are: porting of the system to new operating system versions (Linux SUSE 9.0) and a preliminary analysis of the work to be done for the porting to new hardware platforms (64 bits platforms), implementation of the first set of the SCOS-2000 multi-domain requirements, producing the core multi-domain system, development of a number of re-engineering and harmonization activities on the existing system, integration of a number of patches from SCOS-2000 maintenance projects for bug fixing and integration of system improvements from missions

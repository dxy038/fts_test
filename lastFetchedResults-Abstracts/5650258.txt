In this paper, we utilize sender-based Forward Error Correction (FEC) techniques to enhance the robustness of packet loss recovery for AVS Mobile speech and audio (AVS-M) codec. Two FEC schemes are proposed which take the advantage of the codec´s structure characteristics and do not introduce extra delay. The objective and subjective listening tests results show that the two methods achieve higher reconstructed quality than the codec´s original frame erasure scheme in the case of packet loss.

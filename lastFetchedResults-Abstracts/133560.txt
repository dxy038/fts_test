Background:Pityriasis rosea is an acute, inflammatory and self- limited disease which is characterized by a primary scaly plaque (herald patch) followed by a generalized, symmetrical papulosqumous eruption (mostly on trunk and proximal extremities).Objective:To determine the efficacy of erythromycin in the treatment of patients with pityriasis rosea.Patients & Methods: In this double- blind randomized clinical trial, 46 patients with pityriasis rosea in two equal groups were treated with oral erythromycin 1 gr per day or placebo for seven days and were followed 1,2 and 6 weeks after treatment. The response to the treatment was evaluated as complete , partial and no response.Results: In 48% of the case group and 13% of the control group complete response was seen at the end of first week of treatment. Moreover, these rates reached 91% and 57% at the end of second week, 100% and 87% at the end of sixth week, respectively. The differences between two groups were statistically significant after first and second weeks.Conclusion: Oral erythromycin was effective in the treatment of patients with pityriasis rosea. Also, it reduces the duration of disease.

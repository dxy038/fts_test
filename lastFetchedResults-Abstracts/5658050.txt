Decomposition-based methods are an increasingly popular choice for a posteriori multi-objective optimization. However the ability of such methods to describe a trade-off surface depends on the choice of weighting vectors defining the set of subproblems to be solved. Recent adaptive approaches have sought to progressively modify the weighting vectors to obtain a desirable distribution of solutions. This paper argues that adaptation imposes a non-negligible cost -- in terms of convergence -- on decomposition-based algorithms. To test this hypothesis, the process of adaptation is abstracted and then subjected to experimentation on established problems involving between three and 11 conflicting objectives. The results show that adaptive approaches require longer traversals through objectivespace than fixed-weight approaches. Since fixed weights cannot, in general, be specified in advance, it is concluded that the new wave of decomposition-based methods offer no immediate panacea to the well-known conflict between convergence and distribution afflicting Pareto-based a posteriori methods.

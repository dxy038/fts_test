The objective of this paper is to examine application possibilities of a conversion method in a new confrontational pattern-based design method used for IT systems evaluation. First, the authors present characteristic features and assumptions of the new methodology. Next, they conducted a study verifying the application of this methodology in the analyses preceding the execution of the project aiming at creating a new comparison engine, based on the model which received the highest scores in the evaluation. The results of the study were analysed, and the authors examined their usefulness with regard to the application of the presented method.

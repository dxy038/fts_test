Background and Objective: Professional radiation workers are occupationally exposed to long-term low levels of ionizing radiation. Occupational health hazards
from radiation exposure, in a large occupational segment of the population, are of special concern. Biological dosimetry can be performed in addition to physical dosimetry
with the aim of individual dose assessment and biological effects.
Methods: In this biodosimetry study, some hematological parameters have been
examined in 40 exposed and 40 control subjects who were matched by gender, age
and occupational records (±3 years) in Kermanshah hospitals in Iran (2013-2014).
The occupational radiation dose was measured by personal dosimetry device (flm
badges). The data was analyzed using SPSS V.20 and statistical tests such as two-sided
Student’s t-test.
Results: Exposed subjects had a median exposure of 0.68±1.58 mSv/year by flm
badge dosimetry. Radiation workers with at least a 10-year record showed lower values of Mean Hemoglobin (Hb) and Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) compared to
the control group (p < 0.05). The mean value of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) in personnel
working in Radiology departments seemed to show decrease in comparison with other
radiation workers.
Conclusion: Although the radiation absorbed doses were below the permissible
limits based on the ICRP, this study showed the role of low-level chronic exposure
in decreasing Hb and MCV in the blood of radiation workers with at least 10 years
records. Therefore, the fndings from the present study suggest that monitoring of hematological parameters of radiation workers can be useful as biological dosimeter, and
also the exposed medical personnel should carefully follow the radiation protection
instructions and radiation exposure should be minimized as possible.

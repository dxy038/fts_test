Objective
The purpose of the present study was to investigate if the sodium channel blocker and memory enhancer, vinpocetine, was capable to overcome the epileptic cortical activity, the abnormalities in the later waves of the auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and the hearing loss induced by 4-AP at a convulsing dose in the guinea pig in vivo.
Methods
EEG and ABR recordings before and at specific times within 2 h after the injection of 4-AP (2 mg/kg, i.p.) were taken in animals pre-injected i.p. with vehicle or with vinpocetine (2 mg/kg) 1 h before 4-AP. The amplitude and latency of the ABR waves induced by a monoaural stimulus of high intensity (100 dB nHL) at 4 and 8 kHz pure tone frequencies and the ABR threshold were determined in the animals exposed to the different experimental conditions.
Results
Vinpocetine inhibited the EEG changes induced by 4-AP for the ictal and post-ictal periods as well as the alterations in amplitude and latency of P3 and P4 and the increase in the ABR threshold induced by 4-AP.
Conclusions
Vinpocetine prevents the retro-cochlear alterations and the hearing decline that accompany the epileptic cortical activity.
Significance
Vinpocetine could be a promising alternative for the treatment of epilepsy.

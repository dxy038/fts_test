Background: Today, it has been revealed that some plants have active components with acaricidal properties, which they can be used as a promising alternative for the control of ticks and others arthropods.
Objective: The main aim of this work was the evaluation of the effect of Consolida orientalis and Adonis vernalis extracts on eggs and larval stage of Rhipicephalus bursa and Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum.
Methods: To determining the efficacy of plant extracts on eggs and larval stage of ticks, dipping method was used. Two extract suspensions with different concentrations (100%, 10% and 1%) were used. The number of hatched larvae was considered as a hatchability criterion and the immobility of larvae was considered as larval death.
Results: The plant extracts used in this study showed considerable acaricidal effects on treatment groups in comparison with control group (p < 0.05%). The egg hatchability rate of R. bursa exposed to the highest concentrations of C. orientalis and A. vernalis extracts were 30% and 34% respectively, while the egg hatchability rate of H. anatolicum anatolicum exposed to the same concentrations of extracts was zero. The effects of different concentrations of extracts on larval stage of ticks were dose and time dependent. 
Conclusion: In light of LC50 in different days, the anti-tick effect of C. orientalis extract on eggs and larval stage was higher than A. vernalis. The results indicated that the resistance of R. bursa to the extracts was more than H. anatolicum anatolicum.

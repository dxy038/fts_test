Objective of the study is the simultaneous measurement of three sepsis relevant parameters using a novel point-of-care system. Investigated parameters are C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and procalcitonin (PCT). The format is a fluorescence and microarray-based sandwich immunoassay. Studies to determine the optimum conditions for an automated assay process are shown. Then tests series with antigens spiked in buffer are carried out to establish the process and resulting in standard curves. The characteristics like limit of detection, lower limit of quantification, precision and accuracy are analyzed. In a hospital patient samples have been tested for CRP with the system. The assay processing and read out is done automated by the system which consists of the bioassay, the read out based on planar waveguide technique and a fluidic set-up. This fluidic set-up is sophisticated but simple, including a syringe pump, a valve, a bubble trap and a flow cell and deals with small sample volumes. Further the readout performance of the system is tested and compared with an established biochip reader.

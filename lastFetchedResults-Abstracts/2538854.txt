Background  objective: Honey and Aloe vera have traditionally used for its healing effects on burn wounds. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of honey and aloe vera on the burn wound healing process in rat.

Materials  Methods: This was an experimental study performed on 24 adult male rats. Following ether anesthesia, a second degree burn wound of 250mm2 was made on back of each rat. After confirming burns, the rats were divided into 4 groups (6 in each group).Control group, group 1 treated with Honey and Aloe vera, group 2 treated with Aloe vera and group 3 nbsp;treated with Honey three times per day. Evaluation was made through measuring the area of the healed region and data were analyzed using one way ANOVA test.

Results: This study was indicated of a decrease of 123 plusmn;34/024 mm2 in burn wounds size after treatmentnbsp; in honey and Aloe vera group which was greater than those in others(Pvalue =0/009)nbsp; andnbsp; honey group was only shown to havenbsp;nbsp; decreased the burn wounds size greater than the Aloe vera group.

Conclusion: Combination of honey and aloe vera was found to have more healing potential on seconddegree burn wound. Faster healing process, less complications and easy availability of honey and Aloe vera are among the reasons suggesting more clinical trials using this preparation.

With increase in energy demand, the utilization of renewable energy sources like solar and wind energies become important. Energy Storage Systems (ESS) with bidirectional converters are essential to overcome the intermittent nature of these renewable sources. In this paper a coupled inductor based SEPIC/Zeta bidirectional converter having reduced ripple in output voltage and low voltage stress on switches is presented. This converter is suitable for use in distributed power system. A simulation study is carried out to compare the performance of the converter with and without coupled inductor, also for different values of coupling coefficients. Simulation results confirmed that performance of the modified converter is more reliable for renewable energy storage systems than conventional converters.

Background
Coronary endothelial dysfunction (CED) and DHF are both associated with myocardial ischemia and CAD risk factors. The objective of the this study was to determine if CED and CAD factors are associated with diastolic dysfunction before the development of occlusive CAD or clinical heart failure.
Methods

Patients with normal ejection fraction and nonocclusive CAD who underwent coronary endothelial function studies were identified. Left ventricular relaxation was assessed by tissue Doppler assessment of early diastolic ascent of the septal mitral annulus (Ea). Multiple linear regression was used to investigate whether coronary risk factors influenced diastolic function after adjusting for the presence of CED.
Results

A total of 160 patients had adequate assessment of diastolic relaxation. With multiple linear regression models, %Î”CBF (P = .018) was associated with a higher Ea; in contrast, older age (P < .001), female sex (P = .028), higher left ventricular mass index (P = .016), and higher nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = .022) were associated with a lower Ea.
Conclusion

Coronary endothelial dysfunction and hyperlipidemia are independently associated with impaired relaxation in patients with normal ejection fraction in the absence of occlusive CAD and heart failure. The current study suggests a new potential mechanism for the development of endothelial and diastolic dysfunction in humans.

Objective: The purpose of this paper is firstly to highlight the ease with which the antegrade balloon aortic valvuloplasty can be performed with the Inoue balloon and secondly, the utility of the Inoue rubber nylon self-positioning balloon catheter used for twin valve dilatation. Study design: Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty is being increasingly practised for treatment of multivalvular stenoses. We describe the case of a young (21 years), male who successfully underwent combined dilation of rheumatic mitral and aortic stenosis via the transseptal antegrade approach using Inoue balloon catheters for both valves. Result: Following the procedure, the mitral valve area increased from 0.6 cm2 to 1.7 cm2 and the peak systolic gradient across the aortic valve decreased from 100 mm Hg to 8 mm Hg without causing significant regurgitation at either. Conclusions: This report highlights the ease of performing balloon aortic valvuloplasty via the antegrade transvenous route and utilizing the advantages of Inoue balloon catheter.

Hesperaloe funifera(Agavaceae) is being investigated as a new specialty-fiber crop for arid lands. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of reduced solar radiation on photosynthesis and growth in this CAM species.
Peak CO2uptake integrated through 24 h was found to be highest during the fall. Although shading greatly reduced CO2uptake in fall and winter, the decrease was not statistically significant for the spring and summer. Total biomass was significantly different for the three light treatments, with average fresh weights of 5243 g, 4488 g, and 3671 g for the full-sun, 53%-sun, and 20%-sun treatments, respectively. The greatest differences were found in the crown growth, which would affect future production of both leaves and flower stalks.
Photosynthesis and growth results suggest that the cultivation ofHesperaloe funiferawill be favored in well-lit environments characteristic of arid or semi-arid climates

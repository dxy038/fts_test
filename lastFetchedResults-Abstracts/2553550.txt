Background and Objective: Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that destructs the dental attachment apparatus. Interleukin-18 is an effective pro-inflammatory cytokine in destruction of periodontium. Since smoking is an important risk factor for periodontitis, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of smoking on levels of salivary IL-18 in smoker and non-smoker individuals with either healthy periodontium or periodontitis.
Materials and Methods: A total of 18 individuals referred to dental clinic were divided into four groups (n=20) (Non-smoker with healthy periodontium, non-smoker with periodontitis, smoker with healthy periodontium, and smoker with peridontits). Bleeding on probing, clinical attachment loss, probing pocket depth and plaque index were registered for each group. Salivary sampling was performed and levels of IL-18 were measured by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent test. Data were analyzed by one way ANOVA, Tukey test, t-test and chi-square test. P < 0.05 was considered significant.   
Results: The results showed a significant differences in the above mentioned clinical parameters and levels of salivary IL-8 among groups (P < 0.05). Smokers with periodontitis had the highest and non-smokers with healthy periodontium had the lowest salivary IL-8 level.
Conclusion:  According to the present study it seems a significant increase occurs in levels of salivary IL-18 in individuals with periodontitis, but the effect of smoking on IL-18 levels is minor and non-significant.

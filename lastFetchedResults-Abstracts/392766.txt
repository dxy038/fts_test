Objective
We analyzed equilibrium test findings in patients with Bell's palsy to confirm that such findings occur not only in patients with Hunt's syndrome but also in patients with Bell's palsy.
Methods
Subjects were 83 patients with Bell's palsy, 45 patients with Hunt's syndrome, and 82 patients with unilateral chronic otitis media without history of vertigo or ear surgery (for control). They were treated in our inpatient department and underwent equilibrium testing during the period 1983â€“2002. All subjects were at least 20 years of age. The following were analyzed: (1) presence of vertigo, (2) presence of abnormal equilibrium test findings, (3) relation between the degree of paralysis and abnormal equilibrium test findings, and (4) relation between the degree of recovery from paralysis and abnormal equilibrium test findings. Equilibrium testing consisted of a gaze nystagmus test, a spontaneous nystagmus test, positional and positioning nystagmus tests, and a caloric test. The incidence of abnormal findings in each test was compared between the three groups.
Results
Abnormal equilibrium test findings were observed in patients with Bell's palsy. No association was observed between the results of equilibrium tests and the degree of facial paralysis in patients with Bell's palsy. However, some of the equilibrium test results were significantly associated with the degree of facial nerve recovery.
Conclusions
Although our study was limited in its lack of true control subjects, our data suggest that patients with Bell's palsy show a significantly high incidence of vestibular abnormalities.

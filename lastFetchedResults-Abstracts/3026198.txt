This paper describes the graduation thesis course (CT) of the computer engineering program at UnicenP, at University in Curitiba, south of Brazil. The main objective of this course is the consolidation of the several contents and concepts handled throughout the entire engineering program. The graduation thesis is an interdisciplinary activity, obligatorily outlined for software and hardware development, the two great subject areas of the program. Each student develops his own project or in two students´ teams during the school year. A professor is assigned for each student´s supervision. The supervision begins still in the project´s proposal definition phase and lasts until its defense before the board of examiners of the GT. The projects´ evaluation is carried through by the Board of Examiners, which is composed by the faculty, either supervisors or assigned by the program´s chair. The student, however, proposes the work themes subject to the approval, adaptation or substitution on the part of the commission of the course.

Packaged magnetic bubble test circuits made with 4-&#181;m period ion-implanted circuits were operated over -55&#176; to +110&#176;C. The circuits used bidirectional transfer and nondestructive detection and were made on bismuth-containing magnetic garnet films. Passivated circuits that incorporated an improved transfer conductor design were operated on films with higher Gilbert damping parameters. Potential advantages to using films wih lower bubble aspect ratios for ion-implanted circuits are discussed. However nondestructive readout (NDRO) detection was not realized with these "flat" bubbles.

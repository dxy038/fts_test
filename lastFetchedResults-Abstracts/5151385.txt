The objective of this paper is to analyze the SIP signaling traffic generated by the upcoming RCS-e (Rich Communication Suite-enhanced) mobile service, whose launch is planned in 2012 by the major European mobile operators [1]. With this aim, a tool has been developed to evaluate the volume of the signaling and media traffic generated by the RCS-e services, at the UNI and the NNI interfaces of an IMS network. The results show that 90% of the RSC-e signaling flows is made of the SIP REGISTER and OPTIONS messages. Then, we analyze the tuning of the timers associated to these messages. We conclude this study by recommending some means to optimize the amount of the SIP signaling messages.

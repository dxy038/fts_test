A 2-dimensional shape optimization method for permanent magnet configurations, which is based on a combination of nonlinear programming and field analysis with a complex representation technique of the 2-dimensional magnetic fields, has been developed. As a typical problem example, computational results for a segmented dipole magnet are presented. The results show that the objective function values are reduced significantly and a very uniform dipole field is obtained at the magnet center. The validity of the method is also discussed by comparison with the theoretically presumed solution

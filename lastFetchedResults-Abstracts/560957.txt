Contrary to modern aesthetics, in Plato beauty is related to being. So, the essence of beauty should be envisaged in relation to being. For instance, beauty in Phaedrus is defined as radiation or splendor of the Good. From this follows that beauty is objective reality: a beautiful thing is not beautiful because one judges it to be so; it is beautiful in itself, independently of human mind.
The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between beauty and being in Symposium and Phaedrus.

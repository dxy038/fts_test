Unsaturated conditions favour the oxidation of sulphide minerals from mine wastes, which results in the release of contaminant products into groundwater. An abandoned high-sulphide impoundment in the Iberia Pyritic Belt, wherein tailings have undergone oxidation for more than 28 years, was investigated for hydrological purposes. The objective was to understand the interactions between those mining tailings and the atmosphere under natural semiarid conditions (wet and dry seasons, short intensive rain events and strong daily temperature differences during the dry season).

the deposition, the sequence of waste textures that results from the sedimentation process is strongly dependent on the distance to discharge point. The spatial continuity of the sedimentation layers was studied by means of small scale dynamic penetration tests.

ermo-hydraulic characterization of the waste includes the determination of the water retention curve, saturated and unsaturated permeability, pore size distribution and thermal properties for the different textures.

heric and waste physical measures, from 2002 to 2006, were performed using different techniques. The important changes in the salinity of the waste avoided the use of a single calibration for the electromagnetic sensors; a valid alternative was the evaluation of the water content from thermal conductivity estimations.

y, a numerical model using the HYDRUS-1D software is presented. Model results reasonably fit the in-situ measures of soil moisture, soil temperature, soil water potential and soil heat flux in the vadose zone of tailings impoundment. Moreover, they provide information for energy and water balance determinations.

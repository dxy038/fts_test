In this paper, we extend our newly developed tool of fuzzy criterion dynamic programming to the multidimensional case. A prototypical application problem is the so called open inventory network which is most appropriate for modeling stochastic multi-location in ventory systems and multi-reservoir operations. The objective is to maximize the expected fuzzy criterion function of the product of fuzzy criterion sets. We present an illustrative example of the resultant model.

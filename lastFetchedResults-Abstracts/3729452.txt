Integrated renewable energy systems (IRES) which utilize different manifestations of solar energy to satisfy various energy needs are well suited for the remote rural areas of developing countries. By employing a linear programming approach, this paper develops a methodology for the design of IRES. The method is quite general and it minimizes an objective function of total annual cost, subject to a set of energy and power constraints. A numerical example is included to illustrate the design procedure.

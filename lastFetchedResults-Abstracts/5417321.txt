The slope estimation method II (SEM II), which enables one to determine strictly whether or not the thermally stimulated current (TSC) curve is ideal from moment to moment, has been derived from the concept of the `fundamental elementÂ´. As this method utilizes the differentiated quantities as the fundamental element, it shows very sensitively the flatness characteristic in the single carrier trap case, and it also shows the rapid fall-down characteristic in the critical situation, whereby the contribution from two carrier traps is detected. The thermal-cleaning technique is usually limited in its ability to make the objective clean, and it cannot basically separate unknown targets. The SEM II has clear standards. These standards enable one to detect the correct number of concealed carrier traps from the partial TSC curves. By utilizing the SEM II, multiple TSC curves having multiple carrier traps could be accurately separated and the single TSC curves could be individually established

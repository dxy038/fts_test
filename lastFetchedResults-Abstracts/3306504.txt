This paper focuses on resource allocation in relay-enhanced multicell networks with universal frequency reuse and the coexistence of different transmission modes, with the objective of maximizing the overall system throughput, subject to interference and noise impairments, and individual power constraints at both base stations and relay stations. To address the prohibitively high computational complexity in solving the optimization problem, an interference-aware resource allocation (IRA) algorithm is proposed. In IRA, a scheduling algorithm is performed locally for each cell at first, and followed by an energy efficient power control algorithm to jointly optimize the power allocation for all the adjacent cells to mitigate the intercell interference. Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the system performance in terms of network throughput and energy efficiency.

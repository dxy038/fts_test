Objective:
To investigate whether lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) and/or apolipoprotein (a) (apo(a)) may be markers for clinical features of 37 patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) and to compare with 37 age- and sex-matched controls.
Methods:
Apo(a) and Lp(a) concentrations were determined by ELISA and immunonephelometry, respectively.
Results:
Only elevated apo(a) concentrations were significant predictor for cerebrovascular insults (OR = 14.399, p = 0.005, 95% CI: 2.224–93.230).
Conclusion:
Considering the fact that PAPS patients with cerebrovascular insults had recurrence of cerebrovascular episodes, measurement of apo(a) concentrations will help in the follow-up of those patients and thus in the prediction of future episodes. This finding should be further investigated in a larger study in order to provide adequate therapeutic intervention.

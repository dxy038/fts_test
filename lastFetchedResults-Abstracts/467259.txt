Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess residents' perceptions of the impact of a new fellowship on their educational experience. Study Design: A voluntary questionnaire was administered to residents in obstetrics and gynecology that assessed how they felt fellowships in female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery had an impact on their education. The initial questionnaire was given within 1 month of the beginning a new 3-year fellowship and then annually for 3 years. Results: The mean response rate was 32%. In the initial questionnaire, the fellowships were perceived as detracting from the educational experience. Thereafter, there was a positive increase in the perceived impact of fellowships that was sustained for 3 years. Residents also reported higher self-assessments of the quality of their education during this period. Residents' surgical volume did not change with the introduction of the fellowship. Conclusion: Although at the outset residents anticipated the addition of a fellowship to have a negative impact on their educational experience, they consistently reported a positive impact after the fellowship was instituted.

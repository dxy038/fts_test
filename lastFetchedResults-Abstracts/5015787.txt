The need for improvement of the operation of infrastructures, which can be represented as complex socio-technical system, has created a demand on investigating optimization methods applicable in this area. This paper briefly presents main classes of optimization models and stresses the importance of hierarchical optimization. The example of the dynamic road pricing aimed at improving the road capacity illustrates how a bi-level optimization problem can be formulated. The upper level describes the overall road performance for the chosen toll levels and the lower level present the user-specific objective function with route and departure time selection

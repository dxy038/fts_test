This technical note studies quantized output feedback control of discrete-time linear systems using a finite-level quantizer. The main objective is to find a quantization strategy which is easily implementable and achieves asymptotic stabilization. Based on a known logarithmic quantization scheme, we introduce a simple dynamic scaling method for the quantizer. A suboptimal approach for the optimization of the number of quantization levels and the design of a corresponding quantized dynamic output feedback controller is given. The robustness of the dynamic quantization scheme with respect to input disturbances is also examined.

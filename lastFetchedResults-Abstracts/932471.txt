The objective of the study was to analyze consumer knowledge about safe handling practices to prevent microbiological contamination in restaurants, verifying its relationship with the socio-demographic variables. Three hundred and fifty adults were interviewed in the city of Campinas, Brazil, using a previously validated knowledge measurement instrument. Socio-demographic information was also collected. Basic descriptive statistics and the means comparison test (t-student and ANOVA) were applied to the data collected using the 18.0 PASW Statistics software. The mean score awarded to the consumers for their knowledge was 4.3 Â± 1.5 (scores from 0 to 10). A comparison of the means showed no significant differences in knowledge between the genders (p = 0.388), age ranges (p = 0.102), income levels (p = 0.087) or with the frequency of eating meals away from home (p = 0.930). Subjects with a higher educational level (p = 0.001) and graduated in the area of health (p < 0.001) had significantly more knowledge than individuals with a low educational level and not graduated in health, respectively. The results reinforced the importance of carrying out educational programs for consumers concerning safe handling practices in restaurants.

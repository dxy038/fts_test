Embroidered tag antennas can be used in on-body applications, such as access control, human monitoring, and sensor tag antennas. The objective of this letter is to investigate the performance of dipole-type tag antennas sewed with different thread densities and with two different sewing patterns. This letter shows that the performance of sewed dipole-type tag antennas improves if the sewing pattern consists of sewed lines along the direction of current flow in the antenna. The sewed simple dipole, which consists of sewed lines along the length of the dipole, achieved up to 7.5 m read range in free space, which is comparable to the performance of the corresponding copper dipole.

Jurisprudence and politics or the jurisprudence of politics is as long as divine religions especially Islam (History), but the relationship between jurisprudence and politics, especially from the viewpoint of contemporary religious scholars, is vague (problem), of course, this issue has been discussed a lot but insufficiently (Background); as a result, we face this question now: What are the readings of contemporary religious scholars (Morteza Ansari, Ayatollah Naeini and Imam Khomeini (RA)) of the issue of jurisprudence of politics (Question). It seems that, on the one hand, they have presented a reading adapted from religion, and on the other hand, according to the situation and to the extent of their understanding, they have presented different relations between jurisprudence and politics (hypothesis). The present research is about the understanding of contemporary religious scholars of the issue of jurisprudence of politics (Objective); in order to reach this goal, interpretive method was used (Methodology). Investigations of this research showed that Morteza Ansari, by considering absolute wilayah for the Infallible Imams (A.S), introduced establishing the principle of absolute wilayah for the duly competent religious scholars; Naeini, by considering genetic (al-Takwini) and legislative (al-Tashriâ€˜i) wilayah for religious scholars, regards legislative wilayah for them. Imam Khomeini (RA) considers absolute wilayah for Infallible Imams and Wali al-Faqih; a wilayah that manifests the responsibility of religious scholars in public affairs and on the other hand, regards the position of judgment and politics as equal and stipulates that the duly competent religious scholar must be just (Finding).

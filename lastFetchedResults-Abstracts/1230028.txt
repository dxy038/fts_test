The objective of this paper is to investigate the perforation capability of projectiles against stiffened plates and to determine how many stiffened plates can be perforated by projectiles. Some important experimental results on the perforation of stiffened plates, of a variety of configurations, by truncated oval-nosed projectiles at normal impact are introduced. A four-stage analytical model is formulated for the dynamic perforation of stiffened plates by rigid projectiles. By adopting an energy method, the model can be used to predict accurately the residual velocity of the projectiles. Numerical simulations have been performed for projectiles against single and layered plates adopted in the experiments. The perforation process is explored and deformation and failure modes are obtained. Good agreement is obtained between the numerical simulations, theoretical predictions and experimental results.

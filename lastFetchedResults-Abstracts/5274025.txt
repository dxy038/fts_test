A bidirectional overflow digital correction algorithm with a single bit redundancy used in the pipeline A/D converters is presented in this paper. The upper redundance codes and the lower redundance codes are introduced in this digital correction algorithm to correct the comparator offset so that the underflow and overflow of the input signal can be identified by the corrected output. The digital correction algorithm is used in a 16-bit 40 MS/s A/D converter in 0.35 &#194;&#191;m CMOS process. The tested results showed that the DNL is +0.76/-0.67 LSB and that INL is +2.7/-2.1 LSB without trimming.

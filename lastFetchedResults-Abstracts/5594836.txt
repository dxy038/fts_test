In this paper we define the jointly optimum topology for the duplex transmission (uplink/downlink) in multihop cellular networks which is aware of the intercell interference and a protocol that reconfigures the optimum topology based on the observation of the temporal traffic in the network. In addition we also consider the application of network coding in cellular networks to combine the uplink and downlink transmissions and incorporate it into the optimum bidirectional relaying with intercell interference awareness resulting in a comprehensive solution for 4G common air interface.

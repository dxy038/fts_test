Background
The Hispanic population is increasing and heterogeneous (Hispanic refers to persons of Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino descent). The objective was to examine immunization rates among Hispanic ancestry for the 4:3:1:3:3 series (≥4 doses diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, and pertussis vaccine; ≥3 doses poliovirus vaccine; ≥1 doses measles-containing vaccine; ≥3 doses Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine; and ≥3 doses hepatitis B vaccine).
Methods

The National Immunization Survey measures immunization coverage among 19- to 35-month-old U.S. children. Coverage was compared from combined 2001–2003 data among Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites using t -tests, and among Hispanic ancestry using a chi-square test. Hispanics were categorized as Mexican, Mexican American, Central American, South American, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Spanish Caribbean (primarily Dominican Republic), other, and multiple ancestry.
Results

Children of Hispanic ancestry increased from 21% in 1999 to 25% in 2003. These Hispanic children were less well immunized than non-Hispanic whites (77.0%, ±2.1% [95% confidence interval] compared to 82.5%, ±1.1% (95% CI) > in 2003). Immunization coverage did not vary significantly among Hispanics of varying ancestries (p=0.26); however, there was substantial geographic variability. In some areas, immunization coverage among Hispanics was significantly higher than non-Hispanic whites.
Conclusions

Hispanic children were less well immunized than non-Hispanic whites; however, coverage varied notably by geographic area. Although a chi-square test found no significant differences in coverage among Hispanic ancestries, the range of coverage, 79.2%, ±5.1% for Cuban Americans to 72.1%, ±2.4% for Mexican descent, may suggest a need for improved and more localized monitoring among Hispanic communities.

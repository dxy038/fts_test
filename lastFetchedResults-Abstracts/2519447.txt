In this research, an ice thermal energy storage (ITES) and a phase change material (PCM) systems are contrasted while coupled to an air-conditioning system as a full cooling load storage system. The systems are modeled and assessed from exergy, economic and environmental point of views. A multi-objective optimization algorithms, based on genetic algorithm, is put on to achieve the optimal decision parameters which go to the optimal objective function amounts including exergy efficiency and total cost rate. The optimum point from Pareto frontier is obtained using TOPSIS decision making method. Finally, the systems are compared with the conventional system from electricity consumption, CO2 emission value and payback period aspects. The results indicate that the electricity consumption decrements relative to the conventional system are 4.59% and 7.58% for ITES and PCM systems respectively as well as the annual CO2 production of PCM and ITES systems is 27.2% and 17.8% lower than the conventional system respectively.

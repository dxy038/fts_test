Based on the classical age replacement model, a new maintenance interval optimization model with uncertain parameters is established. The model is a nonlinear programming problem. The objective function is to minimize the maximum cost rate increased relative to the possible minimum cost rate. To treat the `min max´ operator, an equivalent function is introduced, and a proof and algorithm complexity are also put forward. The Newton interaction method is used to compute the numerical solution. Two numerical examples are given in the last section to demonstrate the algorithm effectiveness. Only the finite combinations of parameters can be evaluating by this method. If the feasible region of parameter is continuous, this method can be also used by splitting the continuous values of parameters into finite discrete values.

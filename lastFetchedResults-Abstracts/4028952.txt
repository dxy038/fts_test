This paper presents a novel switched Z-source isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter. The converter employs two unique switched impedance networks to couple the main circuit and the power source and load. Compared with the traditional isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter, the proposed converter has a wider regulation range of voltage. In addition, due to the fully symmetrical circuit configuration, there is neither a high-voltage side nor a low-voltage side in the circuit structure, and the sources connected to the dc side of each H-bridge can be both voltage sources and current sources. At the same time, the converter can bear shoot-through phenomenon in H-bridges, so it has high reliability. The topology configuration and operating principle of this converter are analyzed, and a unique phase-shifting shoot-through bivariate coordinated control strategy is designed and implemented. Both simulation and experimental results verify the analytical results.

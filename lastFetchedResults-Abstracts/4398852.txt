An evaluation indicator system of distribution network configuration schemes in different operation states is established, including the technical indicators, the calculation of indicator weight and the evaluation model. Multi-level evaluation indicators of distribution network configuration scheme filtered by correlation analysis are put forward considering different operation states. In terms of the importance of each optimization indicator on different operation states, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is employed to determine the weight of each indicator in different operation states. Comprehensive fuzzy evaluation method adopted to evaluate the satisfaction of various indicators, a satisfactory evaluation model of distribution network configuration schemes is proposed, which takes the maximum satisfactory weighted sum of all indicators in one operation state as the objective function. Taking IEEE 33-bus system as an example, simulation results show that the evaluation indicator system mentioned in this paper can pertinently optimize the operation of distribution network in different operation states, and provide reasonable suggestions to adjust the grid structure in different operation states according to the evaluation results of network configuration schemes.

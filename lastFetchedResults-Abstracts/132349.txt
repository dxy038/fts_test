In a cross-sectional retrospective study, management of patients with febrile seizure admitted to pediatric ward of Hazrat Rasoul Hospital was evaluated over 1.5 years (Dec. 2002 and Jun. 2004). The objective of this study was to determine whether practice parameters recommended by American Academy of Pediatrics(AAP) have been applied to the management of patients with febrile seizure. The files of 83 patients aged between 6 months and 5 years were reviewed. There were 16(19.2%) patients with complex febrile seizure and 67(80.7%) with simple febrile seizure. Complete blood count(CBC), blood glucose, serum calcium and serum electrolytes were performed for all patients. Lumbar puncture was done in 850/0, electroencephalography(EEG) in 33% and CT-scan in 22% of patients. The average length of stay was 3 days. The present study showed that the use of unnecessary investigations such as laboratory & radiologic tests is common, causes significant expense and has little diagnostic value. As a result, investigation should be performed only where there is specific indication regarding patient's condition and medical history based on practice guidelines suggested by AAP.

The purpose of this paper is to study the objective auscultation of Traditional Chinese Medicine utilizing the wavelet analysis theory and two novel parameters. Digital auscultation information, which are the voice samples in this paper were analyzed using wavelet analysis. Two parameters including the energy ratio and max power ratio were proposed as the feature parameters. The used voice samples including: qi-deficiency, yin-deficiency, and health subjects are decomposed into ten layers of wavelet decomposition coefficients. Based on these coefficients, the parameters corresponding to the ranges of the frequency were obtained for every sample. Then the parameters with significant differences among different kinds of signals were studied in order to find the feature information contained in the three kinds of auscultation signals.

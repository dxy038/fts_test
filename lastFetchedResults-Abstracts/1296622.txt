Statement of Problem: Nowadays, those living in cities are faced with many challenges since old and traditional neighborhoods do not suit new situations and recently-developed neighborhoods are at odds with human criteria. All of these problems are due to residential environments of these neighborhoods. In Tehran and in the last decades, the rapid growth of urbanization has led to the formation of a great number of neighborhoods whose irreconcilability with human as their users has become one of the most important issues. A case in point is the town of Naft situated in Eastern-North of 5th region in Tehran which has lost its genuine structure owing to the recent developments. Having a network of chess-like pattern, Naft town has experienced horizontal and vertical growth as well as increase in space value. For this reason, its local structure and outstanding elements have disappeared. This article evaluates the perceptional quality of environment based on the level of satisfaction of residents with the built environment and its physical quality to measure the kind of the relation between subjectivity and objectivity of local environment in the Naft township of Tehran.                                                                                                                                                        Methods and Materials: Methodology used in this study includes the combined method of measuring subjective and objective criteria and their comparison. Subjective quality criteria of the environment are derived from hierarchical multiple model of residential quality and objective quality measurement criteria of the environment have been formed in direct proportion to it. The unit of community under study is families living in residential sections and participants of the study are residents of Naft township. To set the samples of the questionnaires, multi-staged clustering method was used. Regarding the number of samples under study, deviation reliability is taken as 95 percent according to the characteristics of homogeneity of population and statistical calculations. Mental criteria are evaluated by survey study. The information gathered in questionnaires was analyzed in SPSS environment in terms of multi-variable regulation and the following steps. In empirical dimension, the study would be carried on using place-making tools in Arc GIS in form of geographical information layer. The spatial maps resulted out of this would provide a better understanding of the behavior of quality criterion.                                                                                                                                           Conclusion: Results indicate that in the majority of sub-criteria, interaction between individual, environment and level of satisfaction depends on the assets and physical condition of environment. Also, based on independent T-test, there is a meaningful relation between perceived quality and objective quality of environment which, in turn, reveals the difference between physical characteristics of environment and the way people perceive it. Based on the high level of objective quality of environment, it can be concluded that the level of residentâ€™s expectations is beyond the physical condition of the environment. Besides, the difference in the measured levels would make the criteria more vigorous than before. According to the results of the research, reduction of environmental pollution, provision of more access to the local public service and infrastructures such as public cultural and entertaining spaces along with public transportation service can highly influence the environmental quality in Naft town.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a sternocleidomastoeid (SCM) electrode array on the vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) and the most optimal recording site for clinical use. Methods: Fifteen normal adults (10 men and 5 women, aged 18 to 38 years) were tested. We placed electrodes at four different locations over the SCM muscle: the upper part of the SCM muscle at the level of mandibular angle, the middle part of the muscle, and immediately above sternal and clavicular origins of the SCM muscle. Sound evoked myogenic potentials in response to monoauraly delivered short tone-bursts (500 Hz at 95 dBnHL, rise/fall TIME=1 ms and PLATEAU=2 ms) were recorded with surface electrodes over the isometrically contracting SCM muscle. Results: On the clavicle, the upper and middle parts of SCM from all subjects, air-conducted short tone burst evoked biphasic responses (p13–n23). VEMPs recorded at the upper part of the muscle showed the largest amplitude, followed by that at the middle part. However, the latency of the first peaks (p13–n23) was not constant in the upper part. Recording from the middle part of SCM muscle were more consistent. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the middle part of the SCM muscle is the optimal location for recording vestibular evoked myogenic potential.

We also investigated the influence of Fe deficiency on rhizosphere pH, bioconcentration factor (BCF) and translocation factor (TF) in plants. After the seedlings had grown for five weeks, the seedlings were exposed for 4 days at at the concentrations of Cd 0 mg/L (control), 0.1 mg/L and 1 mg/L. The results showed that Fe deficiency induced Cd uptake, biomass decrease and solution pH decrease in hydroponic culture by plants. Fe-deficient plants BCF and TF were higher compared to Fe sufficient ones.

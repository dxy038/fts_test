This paper presents an optimized design of stand-alone multi sources hybrid power system includes sources like, wind farm, photovoltaic array, diesel generator and battery bank based on an evolutionary algorithm. In this work, the battery bank has been used to cover the emergency loads energy. For this approach, economic aspects such as interest rate, inflation, capital recovery factor, sinking found factor have been expressed for each power sources, and then an objective function with aim to minimizing of all system costs, has been clarified. A genetic algorithm approach is employed to obtain the best cost value of hybrid power system construction. Simulation results show this method calculates the electrification costs (capital cost, replacement costs, operation and maintenance cost and fuel cost) over a period of 20 years for two different cases

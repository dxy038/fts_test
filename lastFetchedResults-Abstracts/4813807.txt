Interruptible loads (ILs) of customers as system resources have been focused in the optimal operation and planning of power systems. This paper presents an integrated resource maintenance scheduling (RMS) framework incorporating generating units as well as interruptible loads. Unlike the conventional approaches, which only consider generating units for maintenance scheduling, we have considered the impacts of ILs into the maintenance scheduling for generating units. The objective functions, levelizing the operating reserve during a period, with several constraints have been formulated and the discrete sensitivity of each generator or interruptible load has been developed in an analytical manner. Also, the optimal solution (or a pseudo-optimal solution) with the curse of dimensionality problem has been obtained through a variant technique of the conventional priority list search mechanism. To illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the suggested algorithm, numerical tests have been performed to a sample system.

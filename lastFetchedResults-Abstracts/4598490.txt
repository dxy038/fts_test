In this paper, we present a feasible control approach for a general class of systems with finite control set. The objective of the controller is to direct the system towards a desired set-point state and then maintain the system within a known neighborhood of this state. The feasibility of the online control policy is formulated as a joint containability and attraction problem. A novel computational procedure based on nonlinear programming is presented to compute a containable region, in which each trajectory from inside cannot move out under a single-step-lookahead control policy. The proposed control approach and the developed feasibility technique are demonstrated on a two tank system example

The paper presents the results of a mathematical simulation of pulverized coal reburning in a corner-fired furnace, which was developed by using a CFD model, in order to study the impact of different work parameters (reburning zone length, reburning nozzles height, reburning zone stoichiometry, reburning fuel percent and coal particle size) on the NO<sub>x</sub> emissions reduction, as well as on loss-on-ignition. The objective is to determine the minimum NO<sub>x</sub> level attainable while maintaining marketable fly ash production (i.e., fly ash having less than 4% unburned carbon content).

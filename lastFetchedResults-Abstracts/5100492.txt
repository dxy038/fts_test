The scheduling problem of emergency materials after disaster is discussed. Considering more numerous and urgency of the needs of emergency materials, minimum disaster loss is set as objective function. Fuzzy set methods is used to select the maximum satisfaction path in fuzzy network. Scheduling model of emergency materials in uncertainty travel time conditions is established, and experimental calculation is conducted to verify its solution approach.

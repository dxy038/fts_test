For hybrid electric vehicles, the batteries and the drive dc link may be at different voltages. The batteries are at low voltage to obtain higher volumetric efficiencies, and the dc link is at higher voltage to have higher efficiency on the motor side. Therefore, a power interface between the batteries and the driveÂ´s dc link is essential. This power interface should handle power flow from battery to motor, motor to battery, external genset to battery, and grid to battery. This paper proposes a multi-power-port topology which is capable of handling multiple power sources and still maintains simplicity and features like obtaining high gain, wide load variations, lower output-current ripple, and capability of parallel-battery energy due to the modular structure. The scheme incorporates a transformer winding technique which drastically reduces the leakage inductance of the coupled inductor. The development and testing of a bidirectional flyback dc-dc converter for hybrid electric vehicle is described in this paper. Simple hysteresis voltage control is used for dc-link voltage regulation. The experimental results are presented to show the working of the proposed converter.

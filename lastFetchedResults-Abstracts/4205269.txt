This paper presents rules based functional control approach for bidirectional DC-DC converter with hybrid energy storage system. The proposed converter interface one unidirectional input power port and three bi-directional ports for storage elements in a unified structure. Battery act as the primary source and super capacitor act as a secondary source for transient load management. Non isolated bi-directional DC-DC converter with soft switching capabilities, which usually operates at a zero voltage switching (ZVS). The paper is focused on a comprehensive modulation strategy utilizing 27 rules based fuzzy logic control that satisfies the requirement of the PV system to achieve MPPT and output voltage regulation. The circuit analysis and design consideration are proposed by MATLAB modeling, simulation result has verified by closed loop design and power flow ability is achieved independently, the proposed converter reduces the component cost of losses for to harvest from the renewable energy.

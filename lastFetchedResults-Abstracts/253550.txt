The objective of the present study was to evaluate how
disease resistance in Yali pear fruit (Pyrus bretschneideri
Rehd.) was affected by the infiltration of
acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) after harvest. The disease
incidence and lesion area in/on the fruit inoculated
with Penicillium expansum significantly (P < 0.05)
decreased by the infiltration with 0.5 mm ASM, and
the duration of protection conferred by ASM lasted
over 15 days. ASM did not directly inhibit the mycelial
growth of P. expansum in vitro. However, ASM treatment
significantly enhanced activities of the main
defence enzymes including peroxidase, phenylalanine
ammonia-lyase and chitinase, and activities of antioxidant
enzymes including superoxide dismutase and
catalase in the fruit during the infection. Two kinds of
second metabolites, total phenolic compounds and
flavonoids, and two productions of lipid peroxidation,
H2O2 and malondialdehyde, were also involved in
the resistance and significantly accumulated in ASMtreated
fruit in the infection. The inhibitory effect of
ASM on the disease may be related to its ability to
enhance defence responses in the fruit. The application
of ASM in inducing resistance in fruit possesses promising
in control of postharvest diseases alternative to
fungicides

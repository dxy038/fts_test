Fairness provisioning in IEEE 802.11s EDCA based Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) is a very challenging task due to relayed traffic and traffic load variation among mesh routers. Because of bursty traffic in general purpose community wireless mesh networks, proportional fairness is more suited than maxâ€“min fairness, where mesh routers and clients should get channel access proportional to their traffic load. However, proportional fairness is hard to achieve by solving optimization function because of non-linearity and non-concave property of the objective function. In this paper, a probabilistic approach is proposed to provide proportional fairness without solving global non-linear and non-concave optimization. Every mesh node use a load estimation strategy to estimate total traffic load that it needs to forward. The required channel share of a mesh node should be proportional to its traffic load, whereas, the total normalized channel share for all the contending mesh nodes should be kept less than unity to satisfy the clique constraint. The network architecture and contention property in WMN are explored to deduce the required channel share of mesh nodes. A probabilistic approach is used to tune the contention window based on the difference between actual channel share and required channel share, so that the node with more traffic load gets more channel share. A discrete time Markov Chain based modeling is used to deduce the overall network throughput for the proposed scheme. Simulation result shows that the proposed scheme works better than the standard IEEE 802.11s based EDCA MAC in terms of fairness and throughput.

We propose an idea for reconfiguring the contents of Web pages based on users´ spatio-temporal information (time and location) and their access histories. The major objective of the proposed mechanism is to realize the reflection of a Web page author´s intention about his Web data. The active rules of active database systems are closely related to our use of Web reconfiguration for changing the view of a page. We regard: a user´s request for reading a page, combined with his situation (location, date, schedule and etc.) as an event; and an access history of each user and/or an aggregation of accesses as a condition of our page personalization rule. Also, the behavior of the server is regarded as an action. A page personalization rule for Web page reconfiguration is described in a declarative manner, which the author can define easily as its metadata

This paper presents a simulation study of an architecture of distributed cooperative controllers operating over a wide-area system, which employs consensus algorithms to attain a common objective among control areas, with limited information exchange. A 4-area case study for load frequency control (LFC) is used to illustrate the implementation of the distributed architecture and of a second order consensus algorithm. Topological analysis is employed to determine the minimum information exchange. Results demonstrate that the control scheme is feasible and allows to scale small-area and medium-area control schemes to wide-area control with minimum information exchange.

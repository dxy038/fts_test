The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation has the extensive application both in theory and practice, how to reasonably quantify the weights of different evaluation indexes in the fuzzy system is the key problem of it. In this text , a new method namely supper vector machine fuzzy comprehensive evaluation(SVM-FCEM),which can be to calculate the weight of the elements by the method of SVM structuring classification, is established, based on introducing the theory of SVM in briefly. the application shows that this method is stable, and the calculation result is objective.

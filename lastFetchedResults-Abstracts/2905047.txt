This paper presents a hydro-PV-wind-battery-diesel based hybrid power system to show the economic viability of an off-grid isolated renewable energy system for remote area. Global warming problem, due to man-made greenhouse gases (GHGs), appear to be a major concern of the world. Current power generation causes 25.9% of global carbon emissions; due to the fast depletion of fossils fuels, direct and indirect GHGs emission from thermal power plants renewable energy (RE) resources are emerging as a realistic means to solve the global warming problem. The main objective of the present study is to determine the optimum size of the hybrid power system able to fulfill the requirements of 166 kWh/day primary load with 21kW peak load for 100 households for a remote area. In this study we have considered a village in the remote area CoxÂ´s bazar, Bangladesh. There is a good potential for wind and solar energy and also some potential for hydro energy. Battery and diesel generator is considered to increase the reliability of the system. The proposed hybrid model is able to fulfill the load demand of the village under investigation with cost of energy (COE) 0.188$/KWh with operating cost 7,761$/yr., which is economical than the diesel and battery only system. The analysis also indicates that about 66% of the total energy is coming from the renewable energy sources, which reduces the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to 35,743 kg/yr., compared with the diesel and battery only system. The energy modeling software for renewable energy based hybrid energy systems, HOMER, is used to carry out the analysis.

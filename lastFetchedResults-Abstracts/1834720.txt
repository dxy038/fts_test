The objective of this study is to characterize the tribological properties of plasma and HVOF sprayed WC12 Co and Cr3C2 25(Ni20Cr) coatings. The coefficient of friction and scuffing resistance of coatings were found using the tests of ball-on-disc and Falex routines. The chemical composition of coatings was characterized using energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) performed on the cross-sections of the coatings. The surface of deposits after measuring of friction coefficient was observed using scanning electron microscope (SEM). It was found out that the following properties of the coatings influence the scuffing process: (i) hardness; (ii) friction coefficient; (iii) method of spraying; and (iv) coatings' morphology. The WC12Co coating sprayed using HVOF method showed the best scuffing resistance and the most homogeneous structure.

This paper presents a new method for power decoupling control of single phase AC/DC converters using three switch poles to achieve unity power factor operation at AC side and power decoupling function at DC side. The method proposed compensate the pulsating power at twice the grid frequency by absorbing low frequency ripple current to a DC decoupling capacitor through the third switch pole operation for bidirectional power flow. This approach can eliminate the need of large filter capacitor in DC side which is required to suppress the low frequency ripples. This paper will explain the principles of operations of the proposed method, and experimental results will also be presented for validation.

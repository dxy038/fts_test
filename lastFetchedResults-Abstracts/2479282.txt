Background and Objective: Pollution caused by organic matter and nutrients in the water resources due to the discharge of industrial wastewater and the use of chemical fertilizers, of the most dangerous of threats to human health and the environment. Human and animal with the consumption are of vegetables irrigated with wastewater contaminated food and are suffering irreparable damage River water for drinking and farming villages provide sycamore Bojnurd. various sewage into the river are due to nearby communities appear to necessary Awareness and understanding of water quality.
Materials and Methods: The present study was a descriptive cross sectional and investigated trend of organic matter and nutrients in a of Chenaran river. For this purpose, samples collected were at 3 months twice a month of 6 stations and the removal of organics and nutrients by measuring COD and BOD5, nitrate, nitrite and total phosphorus were performed and the results were analyzed with statistical analysis.
Results: In the first month of sampling for organic matter highest mean, respectively, of Station No. 6 and 3 and for nitrate, nitrite and phosphate in station No4. In the second month, the highest mean value for organic matter, respectively to station for nitrate, nitrite and total Phosphateat Station No. 5. Finally, in the last month, the highest mean value for organic matter, respectively of station 3 for nitrate, nitrite and phosphate at station number 5.
Conclusion: River water was contaminated at some stations is higher than the existing standard with Measurement of physical, chemical and environmental standards at the desired station, the environmental effects of pollution in the river is visible.

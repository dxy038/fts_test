A novel material updating scheme, which does not require intermediate states of a material used, is presented for source distribution optimization problems. A mutation factor to determine a degree of topological change in the next design stage on the basis of a current layout accelerates the convergence of an objective function. Easy implementation and fast convergence of the scheme are verified using two MRI design problems where current and permanent magnet distributions have been optimized, respectively.

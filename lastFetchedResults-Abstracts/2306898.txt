Back ground and Objective: Microbial dental plaque is the main factor of periodontal disease. Antimicrobial effects of magnolia bark have been studied in vitro and also by using sugar-free chewing gum. The aim of this study was to evaluation antimicrobial effect of a mouthwash made from magnolia bark on the reduction of dental plaque using a periodontal parameter called O'leary plaque index.

Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial study, initially a hydroalcoholic extract of Magnolia grandiflora bark was obtained. With regards to the MIC of the Magnolia extract for Streptococcus mutans and Stereptoccocus sanguis, a 0.3% mouthwash was obtained from the extract. Twenty volunteers entered the study to use this mouthwash and were classified into category of poor and good health based on their plaque percent index. O'Leary index parameter was calculated in four stages. A placebo mouthwash was used as a control in this study. The findings were analyzed statistically using unpaired and paired t-tests.

Results and Conclusion: In each round of magnolia mouthwash administration, percentage of O'Leary index statistically showed a significant difference between the phase of mouthwash consuming and the resting phase. Also, the plaque percent index showed a significant difference between the magnolia mouthwash group and the placebo one (p < 0.005) and the mouthwash was more effective.

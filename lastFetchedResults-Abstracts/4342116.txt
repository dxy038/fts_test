Synthesis of smoother robust control for nonlinear uncertain dynamical systems is considered. The existing saturation-type robust controller guarantees asymptotic stability or stability of uniform ultimate boundedness. It is shown that, mainly due to the part of uncertainties that is bounded by a constant, the controller may potentially have a very large rate of change in order to achieve a small ultimate bound for the state. This study, on its gain or the property of its partial derivative, reveals the need for designing smoother nonlinear robust controller along two directions. First, in a recursive design of robust control, fictitious robust control must be designed to be as smooth as possible so that the actual robust control will not have too large of a magnitude for implementation purposes. Second, if the uncertainties are known to have bounded rate of change, it is both practically and theoretically important to design a robust controller which rate of change is limited by that of the uncertainties. The objective of this paper is to design smoother robust controls by providing results on those two topics

Wireless sensor networking is a rapidly merging research area. There are many areas where Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications are very important such as military, healthcare, agricultural and transportation. In WSN applications, power consumption is foremost crucial. Therefore reducing power consumption is a focal concern when developing WSN applications. Majority of power in WSN environment is used for communication purpose. As such the facility to acquire data based on location only from sensor node at required location would save power consumption. However this type of data acquisition has not been possible due to the unavailability of spatial queries. The acquisitional queries should be enhanced with the location aspect and moreover each sensor node should also be made aware of its location. This will enable user to specify queries based on the location and only the corresponding nodes respond by acquiring data. Thus main objective of this research is to come up with this enhancement. We have purposed spatial query syntaxes which have similar features as in Relational database spatial queries and main target of that approach is to increase the user friendliness. Other than that sensor nodes in the sensor network are capable to identify its location based on the GPS value. We evaluate these issues in the context of TikiriDB, a distributed, shared WSN, query processor for smart sensor devices, and show how acquisitional data based on location can provide significant reductions in power consumption on our sensor devices.

Conventional electric power stations are large-scaled, centralized and located far away from their load centers. This leads to increased line losses, poor reliability of supply, higher cost of electricity, increased environmental and security issues. Distributed generation may be a better option which utilizes small-scale power generating units closed to load center. If a distributed generator is incorporated into an existing distribution system, it may lead to line loss reduction. The objective of this research work is to analyze and evaluate reduction in line loss when a distributed generator is incorporated into a radial distribution feeder having a load connected at one end and a conventional power source at the other end. The line loss reduction analysis is carried out for various power outputs, various power factors and for various locations of integration of the distributed power generator into the radial feeder. The results clearly reveal that the distributed generator integration may lead to significant line loss reduction and supply optimization. Future research recommendations and managerial implications are provided to improve line efficiency.

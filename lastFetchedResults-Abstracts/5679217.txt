Ad hoc networks have been proved to be suitable for disaster scenarios since any infrastructure need to be deployed in order to establish a wireless network. Routing protocols play an important role in the performance of mobile ad hoc networks. Routing protocols are responsible for deciding how the information is going to move through the network. Although one paramount parameter of ad hoc networks is the mobility of nodes, little effort has been made to evaluate the performance of mobile ad hoc networks under mobility models which model the movements of rescue teams during evacuating operations. The objective of this paper is to evaluate real case disaster scenarios in terms of performance using several well-known routing protocols metrics.

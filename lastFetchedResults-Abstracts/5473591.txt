This paper presents the optimum design and bidirectional motion control of slotless double-side permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) system using the control parameters estimation and discrete system modeling. Here, the optimum design and control boundary are restricted by the base range defined as a maximum permissible operating range of PMLSM system in relation with a required mechanical performance and an optimal electrical input. Thus, the design parameters represented as control parameters are applied for the optimum design in effort to achieve the base range. The design parameters of PMLSM are calculated by two-dimensional field analysis through magnetic vector potential with space harmonics of PM mover magnetization and stator winding current. From these, the optimum design for the base thrust is performed by thrust estimation according to variation of PM size and coil turns. And, the electrical dynamic equation with motor parameters and base speed is completed by determination of a DC link voltage for providing the accurate input voltages from space vector modulation. In order to evaluate the required speed and thrust of the manufactured PMLSM system, this paper used the speed-field orient control (FOC) with PI regulation and speed compensation composed of control values represented as control parameters in base range. Here, the dynamic system modeling and experiment using Z-transformation and digital signal processor (DSP) are performed for bidirectional motion control in restricted distance of linear machines

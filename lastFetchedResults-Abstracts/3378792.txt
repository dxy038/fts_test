A system for simultaneously measuring the 3-D shape and color properties of objects is described. Range data are obtained by triangulation over large volumes of the scene, whereas color components are separated by means of a white laser. Details are given concerning the modeling and the calibration of the system for bidirectional reflectance-distribution functions measurements. A reflection model is used to interpret the data collected with the system in terms of the underlying physical properties of the target. These properties are the diffuse reflectance of the body material, the Fresnel reflectance of the air media interface, and the slope surface roughness of the interface. Experimental results are presented for the extraction of these parameters. By allowing the subtraction of highlights from color images and the compensation for surface orientation, spectral reflectance modeling can help to understand 3-D scenes. A practical example is given where a color and range image is processed to yield uniform regions according to material pigmentation

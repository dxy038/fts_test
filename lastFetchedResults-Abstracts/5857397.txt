The equivalent network parameters of the E-plane metallic diaphragm mounted in waveguide are analyzed based on variation principle in this paper. The complete design formulas and parameter optimization objective functions of the E-Plane metallic diaphragm filter are presented. The Powell optimization and HFSS modeling are adopted in the filter design. The filter has very good performance on insertion loss and square ratio. Relevant test results are recommended.

Objective Most internally displaced persons
(IDPs) live in low-income countries experiencing a
war; their psychosocial health has not been well addressed.
We carried out a comprehensive assessment of
traumatic experiences, distress symptomatology, and
factors independently associated with distress among
IDPs in Nepal. Methods A cross-sectional survey was
conducted among 290 IDPs in Nepal during June–July
2003. We used the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25
(HSCL-25) to assess depression and anxiety symptoms,
and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist
—Civilian Version (PCL-C) to assess PTSD symptoms.
All these instruments were validated against local corresponding
syndromes and diagnoses of Composite
International Diagnostic Interviews (CIDIs) as well.
Results Almost everyone reported trauma and 53.4%
had PTSD symptomatology. The rates of anxiety and
depression symptomatology were 80.7 and 80.3%,
respectively. Factors independently associated with anxiety
symptomatology were illiteracy and feeling miserable
on arrival at a new place. Female gender, age 41–
50, and feeling miserable on arrival at a new place were
associated with depression symptomatology. On the
other hand, experiencing greater than three traumatic
events and feeling miserable on arrival at a new place
were associated with PTSD symptomatology, whereas
evacuation after a weeklong preparation and lower caste
appeared as protective factors. Conclusions High rates of
psychological distress and associated factors were identified
among highly traumatized IDPs in Nepal, thereby
underlining the need for collective assistance, not only
for refugees, but also for IDPs. Risk and protective factors
that we have identified can thus be utilized for any
kind of psychosocial interventions among these IDPs.

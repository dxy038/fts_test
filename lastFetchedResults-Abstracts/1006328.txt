This paper presents a new optimization method for the primary surface recuperator (PSR) from the standpoints of heat-transfer performance, exchanger weight and pressure loss. The influencing factors on PSR structure and flow and heat-transfer performance were discussed to determine the independent design variables. A multi-objective optimization design model was established and the specific expressions of each objective were deduced. The result of optimization example shows that the subjective factors can be avoided in choosing corrugated foil geometrical sizes and the best design of optimum performance can be obtained under optimization design analysis method. Optimization analysis is of great use to obtain advanced recuperating equipment and distributed turbine generator system of high economical benefit.

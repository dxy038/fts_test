Increasing the demand for electric vehicles, makes the manufactures to concentrate on the research of new energy storage devices, electro motors, and power electronic devices. The main subject in designing an electric motorcycle with four-phase AFPM and its full wave converter is to select suitable energy storage system and add on turbo-acceleration mechanism. Choosing the suitable energy storage system based on battery cost, mass, life-cycle, efficiency and safety can play important role in better operation of electric motorcycle and efficiency improvement. Using combination of battery and ultra-capacitor as the suitable energy storage system can handle the daily driving needs of an electric motorcycle with sufficient cost and improved electric driving range.
The Sodium-nickel chloride batteries are the best for electric motorcycle. They have low cost, and their specific energy is high. The main objective of this paper is to add on turbo-acceleration mechanism along with using the combination of ultra-capacitor and sodium-nickel chloride battery to improve the energy efficiency, cost, and electric driving range up to 19%, also to supply access power for additional acceleration in an electric motorcycle that is equipped with four-phase AFPM to have easy recovery of regenerative braking energy and low torque ripple. In order to evaluate the energy efficiency improvement and cost reduction, some simulations are done on an electric motorcycle.

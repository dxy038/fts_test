Background and Objective: Sexual problems in women are highly prevalent and frequently are associated with personal distress and impaired quality of life. The aim of the study was the validation of a translated and culturally adapted Iranian version of the FSFI - the IV-FSFI (Iranian Version of the Female Sexual Function Index).
Subjects and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 448 women (19 to 54 yr), after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria were eligible for this study. The instrument was translated into Persian, back-translated, and pilot tested to ascertain cultural sensitivity. Construct validity was evaluated by explanatory and confirmatory factor analysis and internal consistency was estimated with Cronbachâ€™s alpha and the average inter-item correlation. In addition, the test-retest reliability of the measure was determined at a 4-week interval (n=362). Discriminant validity was assessed with between-groups analysis of variance
Results:The overall test-retest reliability coefficients were high for each domain of the IV-FSFI (r ranging from 0.73 to 0.86) and the internal consistencies within the acceptable range (?from 0.72 to 0.90). Principal component analysis with varimax rotation revealed a best fitting five-factor structure similar to the original FSFI. CFA confirmed the underlying domain structure, supporting the factorial validity of the IV-FSFI.
Conclusion: In conclusion, the newly developed IV-FSFI has demonstrated to be a reliable and valid instrument with good psychometric properties that allows a quick and accurate preliminary screening of women with unknown sexual health status in clinics and others medical settings.

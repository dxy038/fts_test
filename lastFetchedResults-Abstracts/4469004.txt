The paper proposes a formulation for profit-based optimal generation scheduling by a microgrid (&#956;grid). Current methods normally assume either islanded operation, or utility-grid connected &#956;grid but lacking in market participation elements. The paper addresses this gap whereby the formulated objective function allows for autonomous decision-making to determine the hour by hour optimal dispatch of generators subject to system constraints including market parameters. The distributed generations in the modelled &#956;grid consist of wind turbines, microturbines and photovoltaic arrays while the system inputs are based on tropical conditions. A case study on the difference between grid-connected and islanded operation is presented. The results demonstrate the efficiency of using genetic algorithm to solve the optimization problem.

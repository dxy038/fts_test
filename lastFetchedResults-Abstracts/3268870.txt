The Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management (FREEDM) System smoothly integrate and manage a variety of controllable loads, DRER (distributed renewable energy resource) and DESD (distributed energy storage device) through the revolutionary solid state transformer (SST). The distributed grid intelligence integrated with the SST facilitates the optimal power dispatch for a residential distribution system. This paper presents a mathematical formulation to determine the optimal power dispatch strategy in order to minimize the operational cost as well as the emission pollution. In this paper, a multi-objective immune particle swarm optimization (MIPSO) based computational intelligence approach is adopted to find the Pareto solution. Several numerical simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed power dispatch strategy in a residential distribution system. More analysis indicates that the fitting degree between load profile and output of renewable energy generators (such as PV cells) is an identifier, which would be applied as a reference to make power exchange schedule between micro grid and utility grid.

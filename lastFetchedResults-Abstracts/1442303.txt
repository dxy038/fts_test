There has long been debate over the relative importance for consumer acceptability of androstenone and skatole. The objective of this study was to investigate consumer reaction to pig meat of varying levels of androstenone and skatole in seven member states of the European Union. Over 4000 entire male pigs (and 233 gilts as a control) were produced in six European countries, and a sub-sample of 420 were selected to represent a range of androstenone and skatole levels. Loin samples from these pigs were distributed to the seven participating countries. Samples were prepared and cooked according to standardised procedures in each of the countries and presented to pork consumers. Each consumer rated samples from five pigs for liking of flavour and liking of odour. Although there were significant differences between country panels in their liking of meat from entire males generally, there was a greater degree of dislike as both androstenone and skatole increased. This reaction was stronger for skatole than androstenone and consumers reacted more negatively in terms of odour than flavour.

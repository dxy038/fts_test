Multi-threshold image segmentation have achieved good results, but multi-threshold searching can be very time consuming, in order to improve the efficiency of multi-threshold searching, in this paper, the Firefly Algorithm is applied to solve multi-threshold searching. With maximum entropy as the optimization objective function, more information of images can be reserved, then using the Firefly AlgorithmÂ´s heuristic searching, the optimal thresholds of image segmentation can be found. Experimental results show that compared to Genetic Algorithm, our proposed Firefly Algorithm has a higher convergence speed and produces a better segmentation effect when applied to image segmentation.

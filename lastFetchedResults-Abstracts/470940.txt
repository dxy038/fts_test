Objective
The objective of the study was to measure associations between bowel symptoms and prolapse.
Study design
Baseline data were analyzed from 322 women in the Colpopexy And Urinary Reduction Efforts trial of sacrocolpopexy with or without Burch colposuspension. Women completed the Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory and Colorectal-Anal Impact Questionnaire and underwent Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification. Associations between symptoms and questionnaire scores and Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification measures were assessed.
Results
Mean age was 61 Â± 10 years. Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification stages were II (14%), III (67%), and IV (19%). Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory symptoms did not increase with prolapse stage. Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory obstructive subscale scores were higher in stage II women (median 29 [interquartile range 8,92] versus 17 [0,33] and 25 [0,38] for stages III and IV, respectively; adjusted P = .01). The few statistically significant correlations between symptoms and vaginal descent were negative and weak (less than 0.2).
Conclusion
Bowel symptoms and questionnaire scores do not increase with prolapse stage in women presenting for sacrocolpopexy.

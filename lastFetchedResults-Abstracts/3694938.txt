This article focuses on the reduction in light output as the lamp ages and the qualities needed for safe lighting. Good lighting design is further challenged when the area is a hazardous area. Because a luminaire is considered an ignition source, it is essential to consider proper temperature and, at the same time, maintain sufficient lighting in hazardous areas. New protection methods and new technologies afford designers new choices and flexibility. The objective of good lighting design for hazardous locations is to sustain longer lumen levels and improve the performance of the lighting system. This article will cite new protection methods and light source technologies and their effect on lighting layouts and illumination levels.

In this study, we transform an optimization problem into a game problem by multiple decision makers. This transformation is called gamification of the optimization problem. Then, we discuss correspondence of the dynamics to search the rational solution of the game problem with the multi-point type optimization method to search the optimal solution of the original problem. Specifically, we propose a condition to compose objective functions of multiple decision makers who interfere with each other from the objective function of the original problem so that equivalence of the Nash equilibrium solution of the game problem to the optimal solution of the original problem is guaranteed. Then, correspondence of the gradient dynamics to solve the game problem with the multi-point type optimization method is discussed. We also show some numerical examples in order to explain the gamification of the optimization problem.

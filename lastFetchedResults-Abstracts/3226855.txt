Augmented Reality (AR) marker helps pattern recognition and generates virtual objects, but it also hinders the aesthetics of overall design. The objective of this paper is to integrate AR and the image-switching function of dot matrix hologram, which makes the marker invisible under a meaningful cover image from the normal observation angle. The AR marker can be detected from a specific angle. To design the dot matrix hologram, color index image and gray scale image are used to output the grating spots with different pitches and orientations on the photoresist, which lets the dot matrix hologram have the image switching function. The result shows that the invisible marker on the hologram can be detected and the AR effect can be triggered. This proposed technique has a lot of potential value-added applications in the future. It not only expands 2D display to 3D virtual object presentation for adding amusements, but also strengthens the productÂ´s anti-counterfeiting feature and brand protection.

Improper land use management has inverse impacts on available resources. To reduce ‎these environmental and economic effects of soil erosion, there is a need for proper ‎watershed plans. Land use optimization is of the solutions for achieving sustainable ‎development and reducing the loose of resources. The main objective of this research was ‎determining the optimal level of land use to increase the income of residents and reducing ‎the effect of erosion in the Sana Dam Watershed. To apply an optimal pattern of land ‎used for minimizing soil erosion and maximizing land income by a multi-objective ‎programming model, optimal scenarios were chosen proportion to the shape of objective ‎functions and constraints. For this purpose a linear programming model was used for three ‎different scenarios of a) present land use conditions b) present land use condition with ‎some applied land use management and c) standard land use conditions according to ‎principles and scientific criteria. The results showed that present land use is not in optimal ‎level and should be changed. Also, results demonstrated that the amount of soil erosion ‎could be decreased by 5.3, 31.7 and 43.4 percent and the amount of net income could be ‎increased by 47.73, 242.57 and 242.57 percent by land use optimization in present land ‎use conditions, present land use condition with some applied land use management and ‎standard land use conditions, respectively.‎

The objective of this research is to demonstrate the ability to create through-wafer interconnects (TWIs) on wafers with active devices. TWIs have previously been demonstrated on blank Si wafers. The application of TWIs in an industrial setting requires no damage or yield loss to the existing devices during additional processing steps. The test vehicle chosen is a simple pMOS test chip, which includes different structures such as transistors and invertors. The processing steps and sequence required to integrate TWIs into wafers with active devices is demonstrated.

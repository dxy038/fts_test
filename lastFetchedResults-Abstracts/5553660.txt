This paper presents an enhanced 2D wavelet based gray scale still image compression scheme and its performance analysis and evaluation over other system. The 2D image compression and reconstruction methods based on the Haar wavelet are developed with some enhanced features. Some of the principal factors used for the evaluation of the new adaptive system include the compression ratio, the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), the number of wavelet decomposition, different thresholding techniques etc. The perception based subjective (mean opinion score (MOS)) and objective (picture quality scale (PQS)) evaluation methods are also applied and their effectiveness is evaluated. The extent to which the quality of the image is degraded by wavelet compression and decompression methods is analysed. The arguments of the usefulness of wavelet transformation for image compression over todayÂ´s method are presented based on the experimental results obtained.

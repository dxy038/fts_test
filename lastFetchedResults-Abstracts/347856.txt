Objective: The digit representations in area 3b were studied to examine whether there is training-dependent reorganization in string players.
Methods: Somatosensory evoked magnetic fields were recorded following electrical stimulation of digits 1 (D1), 2 (D2) and 5 (D5) of both hands in 8 string players and of the left hand in 12 control subjects. The N20m and P30m responses, and high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) were separated by 3–300 Hz and 300–900 Hz bandpass filtering.
Results: The dipole locations on the coronal plane and strengths of D1, D2 and D5, and D1-D5 cortical distance estimated at the peak of N20m or P30m did not differ between left and right hand in string players or between left hand in string players and controls. On the other hand, the dipole locations of D2 estimated from N20m and P30m and of D1 from N20m were significantly anterior, the D2-D5 distance from P30m longer, and the number of HFO peaks larger for D5 in string players than controls.
Conclusions/Significance: With strong mutual competition among the fingering digits, the scale of reorganization should be much smaller as compared with the competition-free denervation-induced reorganizations. Taken together, the training-dependent reorganization of somatosensory cortex in string players is manifest not only in the enlarged cortical representation but also in the enhanced HFOs presumably representing activity of the fast-spiking interneurons

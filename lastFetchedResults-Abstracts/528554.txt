In this study the optimal cropping pattern for Piranshahr- one of western Azarbaijanâ€™s cities- was determined using Multi-objective Fuzzy Fractional Programming with the aim of moving toward sustainable agriculture.  The cross section data of 2007-2008 were used for our analysis. Data were gathered through filling out 600 questionnaires from 60 villages of Piranshahr city by using two-stage random sampling method. The results showed that the optimal cropping pattern using the Multi-objective Fuzzy Fractional Programming to achieve sustainability is different with the current cropping pattern. Moreover, the results of the stability indices (ratio of gross income to the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides) showed the significance of this goal was built for sustainability. Sustainability indices determined for chemical pesticides fungicides, herbicides, insecticide, nitrogen, phosphate and fertilizer.  Results indicate that elimination or minimization of chemical pesticides and fungicides is more important than other inputs.

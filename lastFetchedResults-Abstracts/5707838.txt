The authors have recently presented a new modeling approach for electrical signals in power systems. A significant advantage lies in the possibility to define quantities typically considered in sinusoidal steady-state conditions also during the transients. This paper presents a power flow control strategy, based on the aforesaid approach, for a PWM inverter able to support bidirectional power flow and so to operate as efficient interface between a DC power source (for example a photovoltaic source) and the power distribution grid.

In order for the UK to successfully meet its renewable generation targets and carbon emissions reductions, identifying and utilising an effective means of energy storage is a key developmental step. One such means of energy storage is Electrical Thermal Storage (ETS). Incorporating smart ETS devices at a residential level to act as a responsive demand could greatly benefit the network. This paper presents a methodology to optimise the size and location of ETS devices in distribution networks by using a multiple objective optimisation technique.

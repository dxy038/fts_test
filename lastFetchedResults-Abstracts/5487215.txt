The widespread availability of wirelessly connected portable computers, smartphones and other mobile devices, and the pervasive presence of computer services in our everyday environment, has brought the prediction of Mark Weiser of future ubiquitous computer systems closer to reality. Some of these - ever-present, anywhere, anytime - ubiquitous computer services mean easier and pleasant lifestyles for many people, but the generalized availability of some classes of these softwares and computer services, known as virtual disguisers and Virtual Robots, can pose new ethical problems in a world of explosive growth of social networking sites. The objective of the present article is to investigate some of these problems, from an interdisciplinary philosophical perspective. Special emphasis shall be given to the potential impact on human conduct caused by disguisers and Virtual Robots.

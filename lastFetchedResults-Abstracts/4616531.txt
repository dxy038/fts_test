The effects of common and basic geometry structures (corridors, corners and floors) in typical office buildings on 1.8 GHz indoor radio propagation were measured. The objective of the study is to provide information about path-loss characteristics for the cell layout of indoor personal communication services. Based on experimental data, measured propagation losses and developed propagation models are presented

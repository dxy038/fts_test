Background: Prevalence of mandibular wisdom teeth impaction is high (20% - 30%) which sometimes is accompanied by some complications. Because of fear, anxiety and post-operation complications (swelling, pain and movement limitation) the patients avoid surgery. Corticosteroids have important role in decreasing the complications.
Objective: To determine corticosteroids (prednisolone pill) effects on decreasing pain and movement limitation after surgical removal of the impacted wisdom teeth of mandible. Methods: 16 patients (2 women, 14 men) with symmetric impacted wisdom teeth of mandible were selected. In one side, the surgery was done using Prednisolone 50 mg 12 hours before and after surgery and in the other side, using multivitamin 50 mg as placebo under the same conditions and then considering pain and movement limitation (trismus) the findings were compared and analyzed statistically.
Findings: Results indicated that prednisolone in this dose obviously decreases trismus and pain after surgery. Decrease in trismus on the first day was 43.7% and pain reduction was seen on 1st , 3rd , 7th days after surgery using prednisolane. The most effect of prednisolone on decreasing of trismus was on the first day after surgery. In both sides, a direct and significant correlation existed between time of surgery and pain intensity.
Conclusion: Using prednisolone decreases pain and trismus evidently and in general the patients were more satisfied with corticosteroid therapy.

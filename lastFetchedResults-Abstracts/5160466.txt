A new PFC-family of Efficient Wide Range Converters named EWiRaC was recently introduced. EWiRaC has a major advantage in terms of efficiency at low-line and handles challenges like inrush current limiting as an integrated part of the conversion scheme. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the performance of an isolated EWiRaC (I-EWiRaC) in a single-stage PFC configuration.

Establishing a company-wide software reliability management (SRM) program is a well known challenge. Corporate support is imperative to sustain progress in this direction. It is a greater challenge to create a reliability management program that is integrated into the overall development/support process, optimizing both of these inherently parallel activities. This paper describes the authorsÂ´ experience at Motorola Codex by outlining most of the activities of the SRM program. There are many reasons why the SRM program should be examined as a whole, rather than as separate components, such as testing or objective definition. The optimization of the complete program is unthinkable, for example, if people who select models do not clearly realize where the data for the models is coming from. This paper suggests a global view, which is the best for defining a logical order of SRM-related activities and fitting them into a maturity paradigm

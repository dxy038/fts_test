The primary objective of this study is to provide a broad overview of existence problems in Afghanistan distribution networks, by means of direct and indirect observation to understand sufficiently where an optimal theory of solution fit into the problem to be able to formulate and evaluate a criterion for optimization and solution. There are proposed the main three general attributes to be optimized in Afghanistan´s power distribution systems, namely; power losses, reliability and stability, and regular maintenance. Through identification of the existence problems, obvious feasible suggestions are hinted to meet the present essential requirements of Afghanistan´s distributions networks and in addition, this study can be count a gateway for further researches for whom they are interest in this theme. Finally, it can be a subtle hint to electricity provider companies in Afghanistan to prioritize the problem´s solution, to have a secure stable and reliable power system.

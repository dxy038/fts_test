Introduction: Numerous studies have evaluated health information systems in Iran, but most studies have not followed a standard
format for reporting their findings. The objective of this study was to evaluate the compliance of health information systems’
evaluations published in Persian journals with the Statement on Reporting of Evaluation Studies in Health Informatics (STARE-HI).
Methods: This was a review study in which papers reporting on evaluation of health information systems were assessed in terms
of 51 principles of the STARE-HI using a checklist. These papers were retrieved from the Persian databases of Magiran,
IranMedex, and SID using appropriate keywords. Data were classified and reported based on 13 main sections of the STARE-HI.
Results: From the 727 retrieved papers, 36 were relevant to the study objectives. All paper had an introduction section, but none
of the paper had the authors’ contribution and conflict of interests sections. The mean compliance of articles with the STARE-HI
was 71.4%, with the lowest being 52.94% and the highest being 82.35%.
Conclusion: The writing style and structure of studies evaluating health information systems require improvements . The quality
of study reports can be improved through reporting essential information in articles and using corresponding guidelines in the
design of authors’ instruction sections of journals. Improving the reporting format of papers can result in better and higher rate of
application of study results and increased citation of articles.

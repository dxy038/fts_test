Background and Purpose: The primary objective of this study was to explore the use of information resources by a sample of physical therapists. Methods: A qualitatively designed study using structured individual interviews, examination of professional libraries, and identification of information resources was initiated in three sites (Southern California, Arizona, and Georgia). Participants included forty physical therapists with between five and twenty years of experience. Results: The Internet and continuing education activities appeared to be the primary information sources for the physical therapists surveyed. The personal professional libraries of participants were limited in scope and contained titles copyrighted more than ten years ago. Access to peer-reviewed journals in the sample was limited primarily to those received as a benefit of professional association membership. Discussion and Conclusions: Participants did not maintain current print professional information resources. The majority of books in the personal and workplace professional libraries held copyrights dating from the time of the participants' enrollment in an entry-level physical therapy program. Medical librarians may play an important role in shifting physical therapy towards evidence-based practice by collaborating in professional development for this group. Physical therapy educators and professional leaders should support current public collections of physical therapy-related information resources to encourage the movement towards an evidence-based practice model in physical therapy.

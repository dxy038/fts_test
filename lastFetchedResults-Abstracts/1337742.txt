Methods to reduce the effects of acute stress could benefit the equine industry; therefore, the objective of this experiment was to determine whether aromatherapy would hasten the recovery time in acute-stressed horses. A total of seven horses were used in this experiment, using a crossover design where each horse received each treatment 7 days apart. The heart rates (HRs) and respiratory rates (RRs) were recorded for each horse at rest in stalls; then an air horn was blown twice for 15 seconds. The horses were allowed 60 seconds to calm, and then the stressed HRs and RRs were recorded. Control-treated horses were then exposed to humidified air, whereas aromatherapy-treated horses were exposed to humidified air with a 20% mixture of 100% pure lavender essential oil for 15 minutes. Following the 15-minute control or aromatherapy treatment, the recovery HRs and RRs were recorded (15 minutes). There were no statistical differences (P > .05) between the control and aromatherapy treatment for resting HR 33.7 ± 3.6 versus 34.0 ± 3.1 beats per minute (bpm), or change to increased HR in response to the air horn. However, the change in HR, after treatment, was significantly greater (P < .02) after aromatherapy (−9.25 ± 3.4 bpm) compared with the control treatment (0.29 ± 1.5 bpm). The RR did not differ (P > .05) between the control or aromatherapy treatment groups for the resting RR or change in RR. These results demonstrate that lavender aromatherapy can significantly decrease HR after an acute stress response and signal a shift from the sympathetic nervous control from the parasympathetic system.

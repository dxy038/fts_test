Wireless a sensor network, which typically consist of large number of sensor nodes, is deployed in environmental fields for sensing and actuating applications. The protocols in WSNs play an important role in energy savings and the performance of WSNs could be improved by designing suitable MAC protocols. Energy efficiency is one of the important research themes while designing wireless sensor network nodes as WSNs are battery powered. MAC protocols are also used to minimize latency and maximize throughput in wireless sensor networks. Observably there are many MAC protocols available nowadays for WSNs but the actual objective is minimizing the energy consumption so that the lifetime is maximized. This paper is aimed at to summarize the key requirements for MAC protocol design and we have proposed a new protocol: Energy Efficient Election protocol (EEE-MAC) for WSNs. Our protocol is based on cluster based election algorithm and it can be implemented with any existing protocols. We have compared our proposed protocol with the existing contention-based S-MAC and T-MAC protocols. The simulation results show that our protocol has achieved better energy saving than the other three protocols.

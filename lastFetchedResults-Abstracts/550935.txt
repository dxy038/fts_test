Questioning the 'Meaning of Life' is one of the most important issues that has been asked during the history. But how to question and answer to it is more curiously concerned in the modern time. In answering to the question 'what is the meaning of life?' there have been proposed various ideas. In this article, we explain the John Cottingham's idea on this issue.
He has a religious perspective to the problem. First, he explained that life has objective meaning-irrespective of human will and so we must find it. So he argues that the only way of finding life meaningful is to believe in God and to have a religious view to universe. And that the only way to make us feel life is not absurd and meaningless is to be religious and faithful, despite all evils and failures which we face in life. He also explained the barriers of meaningfulness and the reasons of feeling meaningless. Finally, he argues that the only solution is inner change and changing our views to universe

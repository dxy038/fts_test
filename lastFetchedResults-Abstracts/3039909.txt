This paper presents a new designing approach for the Web site based on the affordance theory. To compare new designing with conventional approach and to evaluate these, we prepared several different types of Web sites and evaluate two types of approaches. One is objective evaluation by the AHP questionnaire, and the other is subjective evaluation by viewpoint trajectory analysis based on eye-mark recording.

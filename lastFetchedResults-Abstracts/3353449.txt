This paper proposes a data transmission strategy in bidirectional De Bruijn networks where network coding is deployed. We consider a uniform demand scenario, i.e., all nodes require the entire data set and the data are uniformly distributed over the networks. We propose energy efficient algorithms for network coding based encoding and decoding processes. The proposed strategy can reduce the number of transmissions compared to the conventional data transmission strategy (i.e., store and forward). While the network efficiency of the proposed strategy is degraded as the network dimension increases, we show that the efficiency converges into a lower bound as the network dimension increases. These are confirmed by the simulation results.

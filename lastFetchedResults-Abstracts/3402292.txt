A multiservice fiber-optic subscriber system using wavelength division multiplexing technology has been developed by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation to provide both 64 kbits/s and broad-band communication services on a single multimode fiber. The subscriber network is formed in a star topology to facilitate bidirectional connection. The system was put in service in March, 1985, as part of the information network system (INS) model system. This paper describes the configuration and characteristics of the video distribution system of this fiber-optic subscriber system. The distribution system uses analog baseband video transmission at a 0.89&#956;m wavelength. The video channel selection is made by an FDM video tuner installed in a central office. The overall performance successfully met design objectives.

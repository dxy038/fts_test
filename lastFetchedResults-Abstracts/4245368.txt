Recently, multi-agent systems have been discussed to realize a large size of distributed autonomous system. This paper proposes an intelligent control method for formation behaviors of multi-robot. First of all, we discuss the current state of researches on formation behaviors in multi-robot. Next, we propose a multi-objective behavior coordination to realize formation behavior based on the integration of the intelligent control from the local viewpoint of individual intelligence and the spring model from the global viewpoint of collective intelligence. Next, we propose a self-adaptation method in complicated environments. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness of the proposed method through computer simulation results.

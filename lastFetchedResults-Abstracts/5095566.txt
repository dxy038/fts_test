One of the biggest changes happening to the distribution system is the increased penetration levels of distributed generation (DG). The growing trend of installing DGs within distribution networks has benefits such as increased reliability of supply, reduced losses, improved voltage profile, and etc; however, integrating large number of DGs into existing distribution networks is a challenging issue. Indeed, DGs, in large numbers, could reverse the direction of the typical radial power flow; which in turn transforms a radial network to a multisupply grid with bidirectional power flows. Therefore, the existing protection schemes designed based on the radial configuration will no longer be appropriate.in this paper we simulation of protection functions for connecting distributed generation resources to distribution networks considering vector group of interface transformers.

Objective
Goal of the present study was to compare the amplitude and topography of EEG alpha activity between congenitally blind and sighted adults both in a primarily sensory and a primarily cognitive task.
Methods
Congenitally blind and blindfolded sighted adults performed a somatosensory perception task (experiment 1), which required to discriminate tactile stimuli at different fingers, and a mental imagery task (experiment 2), in which a previously haptically encoded map had to be mentally scanned. The EEG was recorded with 61 electrodes and was analyzed with the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT).
Results
Results showed a significant reduction of alpha power in the blind compared to the sighted controls over parieto-occipital recording sites in both tasks.
Conclusions
It is speculated that brain structures, which have been associated with the generation of posterior alpha rhythms in sighted adults, including the geniculo-cortical pathway, depend on visual input and might either be reorganized or atrophied following blindness from birth.
Significance
The present study demonstrates that oscillatory activity of the brain might serve as a marker of cortical reorganization

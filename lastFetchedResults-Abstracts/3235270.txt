Semantic Interoperability is one of the most important open challenges in the Knowledge Management field. In this work, we propose a framework for making easier information exchanging operations among heterogeneous information sources, over the Cloud. Exploiting the Semantic Web technologies, the framework has the objective of allowing semantic interoperability among distributed software agents preserving not only semantics of transmitted messages, but also the subjectivity of agentÂ´s world vision in the communication process. The proposed system, in fact, will help users in the digital documents exchanging activities by extracting the related relevant information and coding their informative contents in a shape capable of preserving the original semantics, also in the case of communications agents using different or incompatible vocabularies. The framework is a an evolution of semantic interoperable methodologies towards cloud computer technologies, thus guaranteeing several advantages in terms of usability, scalability and fault tolerance. In particular, we implemented a prototype that provides interoperability functionalities in the E-Health domain, managing information coming from heterogeneous sources.

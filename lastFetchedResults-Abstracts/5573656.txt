The objective of this work is to study and design a portable non invasive prototype which allows us to supervise the mastication frequency and pressure for specific meals, performing an analysis of sounds and pressures generated by facial muscles when they are chewing. These variables have a direct influence on people nutritious and dietary habits; also, a quickly eating makes people ingest a lot of food instead he needs generating overweight on him. On the other hand, there is no so much study for upheaval of temporal-mandible joints (TMJ) in Peru, keeping as reference that unilateral mastication is one of the principal causes on myofacial pains but, as obesity, there are no studies in Peru about how to prevent these pathologies. In consequence, we propose the development of this prototype which, additional to supervise variables such as mastication frequency and pressure, will allow to the patient an self-correction of his habits.

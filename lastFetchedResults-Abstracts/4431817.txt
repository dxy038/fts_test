Managing the bandwidth resource for an adaptable-bit-rate video service (in a MAN environment) provisioned with DQDB (distributed-queue dual-bus) access networks is the main objective of this work. Use is made of the bandwidth balancing (BWB) scheme to perform dynamic bandwidth allocation in addition to improving the fairness of the DQDB protocol. The steady-state average throughput measured at each station is directly proportional to its BWB modular value. Thus, the BWB modular value it the only control parameter required; no other overhead is necessary. The channel utilization can be nearly 100% when stations are overloaded. The transition of bandwidth reallocation makes the adaptable-bit-rate video codecs more feasible. Simulation examples are presented, and the relevant analytical formulae are derived

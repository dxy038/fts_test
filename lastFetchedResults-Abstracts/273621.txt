The rate-type constitutive relations of rate-independent metals with isotropic or kinematic hardening at finite elastic–
plastic deformations were presented through a phenomenological approach. This approach includes the decomposition
of finite deformation into elastic and plastic parts, which is different from both the elastic–plastic additive
decomposition of deformation rate and Lee s elastic–plastic multiplicative decomposition of deformation gradient.
The objectivity of the constitutive relations was dealt with in integrating the constitutive equations. A new objective
derivative of back stress was proposed for kinematic hardening. In addition, the loading criteria were discussed. Finally,
the stress for simple shear elastic–plastic deformation was worked out.

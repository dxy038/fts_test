This paper investigates the generation and use of multiple recognition results to improve the performance of an offline handwritten text line recognition system. Multiple recognition results are created by specific integration of a language model in the hidden Markov model based recognition system. The ROVER algorithm is applied to combine the multiple results. Experiments conducted on the IAM database show that the proposed system is able to produce statistically significant improvements in the recognition rate compared to the original system.

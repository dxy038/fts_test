This paper reviews key attributes of neural processing essential to intelligent multimedia processing (IMP). The objective is to show why neural networks (NNs) are a core technology for the following multimedia functionalities: (1) efficient representations for audio/visual information, (2) detection and classification techniques, (3) fusion of multimodal signals, and (4) multimodal conversion and synchronization. It also demonstrates how the adaptive NN technology presents a unified solution to a broad spectrum of multimedia applications. As substantiating evidence, representative examples where NNs are successfully applied to IMP applications are highlighted. The examples cover a broad range, including image visualization, tracking of moving objects, image/video segmentation, texture classification, face-object detection/recognition, audio classification, multimodal recognition, and multimodal lip reading

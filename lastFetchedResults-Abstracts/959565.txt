The effects of laser surface melting (LSM) on microstructure of magnesium alloy containing Al8.57%, Zn 0.68%, Mn0.15%,
Ce0.52% were investigated. In the present work, a pulsed Nd:YAG laser was used to melt and rapidly solidify the surface of the
magnesium alloy with the objective of changing microstructure and improving the corrosion resistance. The results indicate that
laser-melted layer contains the finer dendrites and behaviors good resistance corrosion compared with the untreated layer.
Furthermore, the absorption coefficient of the magnesium alloy has been estimated according to the numeral simulation of the
thermal conditions. The formation process of fine microstructure in melted layers was investigated based on the experimental
observation and the theoretical analysis. Some simulation results such as the re-solidification velocities are obtained. The phase
constitutions of the melted layers determined by X-ray diffraction were b-Mg17Al12 and a-Mg as well as some phases
unidentified

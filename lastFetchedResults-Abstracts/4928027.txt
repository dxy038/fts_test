H.264/AVC is a new international video coding standard that provides higher coding efficiency with respect to previous standards at the expense of a higher computational complexity. The complexity is even higher when H.264/AVC is used in applications with high bandwidth and high quality like high definition (HD) video decoding. In this paper, we analyze the computational requirements of H.264 decoder with a special emphasis in HD video and we compare it with previous standards and lower resolutions. The analysis was done with a SIMD optimized decoder using hardware performance monitoring. The main objective is to identify the application bottlenecks and to suggest the necessary support in the architecture for processing HD video efficiently. We have found that H.264/AVC decoding of HD video perform many more operations per frame than MPEG-4 and MPEG-2, has new kernels with more demanding memory access patterns and has a lot data dependent branches that are difficult to predict. In order to improve the H.264/AVC decoding process at HD it is necessary to explore a better support in media instructions, specialized prefetching techniques and possibly, the use of some kind of multiprocessor architecture.

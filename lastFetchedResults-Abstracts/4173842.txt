This article describes the Mobile Ad Hoc Networking Interoperability and Cooperation (MANIAC) Challenge, a competition in MANETs. The primary objective of the competition was to assess the trade-offs between network- wide connectivity and resource utilization in a MANET comprising autonomous self-interested nodes. The competition attracted participants from academic institutions in the United States, Europe, and Africa. The data collected provide a better understanding of link stability, route effectiveness, cooperation, and competition in an autonomously deployed MANET.

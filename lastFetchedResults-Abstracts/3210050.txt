In view of the problem of two-Echelon stock between Depot and bases by the system methods, put forward to use the least shortage as the objective function, the total prices not greater than the total support cost as the constraint condition, established the two-Echelon stock optimization model of the lifeless Recoverable parts. Solved it with the marginal analysis method, analyzed the application effect of the model by an example. The results prove that the model has higher practicability.

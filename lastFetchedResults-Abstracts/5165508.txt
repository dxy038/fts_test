Few years back, not much importance was given to the effect of the product on the environment in the process planning stage. Till recently the environmental issues related with the manufacturing process were taken up seriously by both the general public and the government agencies which led to the need for environmental conscious manufacturing. This paper deals with the systematic determination of methods involved in the manufacturing of parts with one of the objective of minimizing environmental impacts. The focus of this study is to develop a multi objective non linear programming model for environmental supportive process planning while minimizing factors such as machining cost, machining time and environmental impact. An interactive front end tool is developed for optimum parameter selection and the results are discussed.

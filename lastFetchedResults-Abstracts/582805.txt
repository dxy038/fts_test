Theist philosophers have always tried to come up with an argument for the existence of God without depending on philosophical premises, or requiring reference to creatures. For the first time, Ibn Sina introduced a quasi-demonstrative argument, reasoning from the mode of existence for the existence of God as the necessary existence, and called it “Proof of the Righteous”. Mulla Sadra criticized it for depending on the concept of existence, and called it a “pseudo-righteous” one.
The authors of this article review some of the philosophers’ support for Ibn Sina, and then argue, from intuitive and near-existential arguments, that Ibn Sina kills two birds with one stone; i.e. suggests a rational argument, and intuitively gets into the objective reality of existence.

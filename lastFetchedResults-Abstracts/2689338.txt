This paper presents a new extendable single-stage multi-input dc-dc/ac boost converter. The proposed structure comprises of two bidirectional ports in the converterÂ´s central part to interface output load and battery storage, and several unidirectional input ports to get powers from different input dc sources. In fact, the proposed topology consists of two sets of parallel dc-dc boost converters, which are actively controlled to produce two independent output voltage components. Choosing two pure dc or two dc-biased sinusoidal values as the converter reference voltages, situations of the converter operating in two dc-dc and dc-ac modes are provided, respectively. The proposed converter utilizes minimum number of power switches and is able to step up the low-level input dc voltages into a high-level output dc or ac voltage without needing any output filter. The converter control system includes several current regulator loops for input dc sources and two voltage regulator loops for generating the desired output voltage components, resulting in autonomously charging/discharging the battery to balance the power flow. Due to the converter inherent multi-input multioutput control system, the small signal model of the converter is extracted and then the pole-placement control strategy via integral state feedback is applied for achieving the converter control laws. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed converter and its control performance are verified by simulation and experimental results.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of bacterial additives on chemical characteristics and ruminal degradability of Alfalfa silage. In this experiment the treatments consisted of: 1-untreated alfalfa silage (control), 2-treated with Ecosyl (EC), 3- Lacticil Maize (LM), and 4- a combination of both additives, EC and LM, at half level of treatments 2 and 3. Silos were opened up on day 40 the following ensiling. Silages quality were assessed. Degradibility parameters were estimated through tests carried out on 3 fistulated Holstein dry cows. EC treatment exhibited the lowest Dry Matter (DM) among treatments (P  < 0.05). Lacticil maize decreased pH in both treatments 2 and 3 while LM bore the lowest pH in comparison with the other treatments. (P  < 0.05). Treatment 3 and 4 bore higher degradability and “ a ” fraction than treatments 1 and 2 at zero time of incubation (P  < 0.05). LM decreased the” a”,”a+b”fraction and effective degradibility of cell wall as compared with the other treatments (P  < 0.05) while the highest '”a” fraction was recorded for EC (P  < 0.05). Treatment 4 had the highest cell wall degradability at 72 hours of ruminal incubation (P  < 0.05). Ecosyl increased protein degradability at 12, 48 and 72 hours of ruminal incubation. The results finally indicated that Lacticil Maize can be utilized in alfalfa silage as a suitable additive because it reduces the pH and increases “a” fraction of dry matter in the aforementioned silage

The detection of stealth point targets challenges the design of conventional radars using sinusoidal carriers since the objective of stealth technology is to reduce the radar cross section (RCS) of targets to a level where the radar receiver cannot detect the target. While there are a number of techniques employing different technologies to reduce the RCS of targets, shaping and coating the target with absorbing material are the most useful ones. The analysis and design of nonsinusoidal radar signals is based on modeling stealth point targets by a two-layer structure consisting of a metal surface covered with a coat of absorbing material. The design is presented for two classes of signals: uncoded signals and pulse compression signals using Barker codes. The relationship between target response, absorbing material time delay, time variation of transmitted pulses and coding features are determined and analyzed. While sliding correlators are used for detection and selection of various target responses, their output autocorrelation functions are determined analytically in terms of transmitted signal autocorrelation functions. Thumbtack range-velocity resolution functions are obtained for transmitted signal characters with a single pulse and characters with coded waveforms, for different pulse duration. It is shown that the range resolution can be improved by the proper choice of the transmitted signal duration relative to absorbing material time delay. Thumbtack range-velocity resolution functions similar to those of conventional point targets can also be realized

In this paper, by introducing the concept of risk critical value of random variable, the risk critical value model based on objective benefit for random assignment problem are proposed. On the basis of characteristic of model, give the concrete implementation strategy and approach based on genetic algorithm (denoted by GA<sub>RAP</sub>, for short), by combining numerical calculation method of probability and evolutionary computation; and consider its convergence using Markov chain theory, and analyze its performance through an example. All these indicate that this model is of strong practicability and good interpretability, and GA<sub>RAP</sub> is of higher computation efficiency and good convergence, can be widely used in decision process.

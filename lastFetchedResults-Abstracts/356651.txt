At the dawn of the next millennium, the optimal management of acute myocardial infarction will have been defined by multiple clinical trials of acute reperfusion strategies, in conjunction with adjunctive pharmacotherapy. Reperfusion therapy with thrombolytic agents or primary angioplasty is the standard of care for many patients examined with ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block within approximately 12 hours of symptoms. The superiority of fibrin-specific agents over streptokinase has been established, as have the advantages of primary angioplasty in selected institutions with the requisite expertise and logistical capabilities. The key to successful reperfusion lies more in the efficiency of delivery than in the choice of modality. Reocclusion remains the “Achilles’ heel” of reperfusion therapy, as does the presence of reperfusion injury microvascular dysfunction and the “no-reflow” phenomenon. These entities are major targets for further investigation in the next 5 years. The wealth of adjunctive pharmacologic agents currently available presents a challenge to the optimal treatment of myocardial infarction. A major objective is to define the magnitude of the incremental benefits and risks of using the available and new drugs, both alone and in combination. Moreover, community-wide studies indicate a marked underutilization of therapies that are available and are of proven effectiveness. The key to optimal management, as we enter the new millennium, lies in the search for new therapies in concert with the most effective use of those agents already at our disposal.

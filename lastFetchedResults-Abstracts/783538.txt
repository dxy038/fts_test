Objective To examine the prevalence
rate, impairment, comorbidity, course of illness and
determinants of eight specific phobia variants: animals
(animal subtype); heights, water, storms (natural
environment subtype); flying, enclosed spaces, being
alone (situational subtype); and blood/injury (blood/
injury subtype). Method Data were obtained from the
Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence
Study, a prospective study in the Dutch general
population aged 18â€“65 (N = 7,076). Results The most
prevalent condition was specific phobia with a fear of
heights (4.9%). On all parameters except duration,
specific phobia with a fear of being alone emerged as
the most severe condition. Phobias with fear of enclosed
spaces and phobias with fear of blood showed a
slightly greater likelihood of impairment, comorbidity
and personality problems than phobias with fear of
animals, heights, water or storms. Conclusion The
situational and blood/injury phobia subtypes appear
to be a more significant index for impairments and
for comorbid psychiatric disorders than the animal
and natural environment phobia subtypes.

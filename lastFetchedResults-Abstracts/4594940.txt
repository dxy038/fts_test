Two methods are proposed for designing transformation matrices in array processing and spectral analysis: the stochastic method and the p-norm based method. The authors had previously presented the stochastic method for spatial smoothing, but they did not explicitly formulate the problem using the concept of stochastic transformation. The stochastic method can also be used in other applications if the signal statistics are known or can be estimated. The stochastic method enjoys the advantage of being able to utilize a priori signal statistics. The p-norm based method chooses the vector p-norm as the objective function for optimization, and it provides options to satisfy different designing specifications

Three NH<inf>3</inf>optically pumped laser systems were chosen for study wherein one pair of energy levels was the ground state <img src="/images/tex/2866.gif" alt="ga \\leftrightarrow gs"/> transition in the 18-26 GHz range, where tunable microwave sources are available for gain/absorption probes. The objective was to experimentally evaluate the validity and accuracy of a density matrix calculation, using typical approximations, in providing a complete description for double and triple resonant (first, third, and fifth order) gain/ absorption spectra. It was demonstrated that gain/absorption peak frequencies could be calculated to better than 10 MHz, absolute gain/absorptions to within a factor of 2 to 3, and <img src="/images/tex/49.gif" alt="M"/> -split linewidths for counterpropagating pumps to &#177;2 MHz. At pump intensities above 100 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>, most of the <img src="/images/tex/49.gif" alt="M"/> -split gain/absorption peaks could be well resolved.

In this paper, we propose the Expanded Borel Cayley Graphs Topology Construction (EBTC) algorithm to formulate an efficient communication topology for WSNs. The EBTC is an integrated method of Neighbor Discovery and Topology Control to produce a communication topology with collision avoidance and energy saving. The EBTC consists of two phases: Phase I) where nodes collect node IDs of their logical neighbor candidates (Neighbor Discovery) and Phase II) where nodes establish bidirectional links with the most qualified logical neighbor candidate(s) (Topology Control). Nodes under EBTC algorithm save energy and avoid collision during topology construction by following a selective and deterministic node wake-up schedule which is designed based on Ex-BCG connection characteristics. From simulation, the EBTC generates an efficient communication topology with more than 98% reachability while consuming less energy than other topology control algorithms. We also found that it has short average path length and small, constrained logical node degree when compared to other topology control algorithms.

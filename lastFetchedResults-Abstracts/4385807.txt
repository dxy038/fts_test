The problem of controlling a string of vehicles moving in one dimension is considered so that they all follow a lead vehicle with constant spacing between successive vehicles. Due to practical design and implementation, the negative effect of the tracking lag parameter is taken into account. A hierarchical platoon controller design framework is established comprising a feedback linearization controller at the first layer and a decentralized bidirectional control controller at the second layer. The stability criterion is examined by using a partial differential equation approximation in the limit of the number of vehicles subjected to unequal asymmetry in position and velocity feedback. For disturbance attenuation, string stability analysis is also examined. At the end of the paper, simulations are given to show the efficiency of the proposed results.

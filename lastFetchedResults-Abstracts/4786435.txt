In this paper we consider the determination of allocation functions as a part of the design of massively parallel processor arrays for algorithms which can be represented as systems of uniform recurrence equations. The objective is to find allocation functions minimizing the necessary chip area for a hardware implementation of the processor array. We propose an algorithm approximately minimizing the number of processors under consideration of the necessary chip area needed to implement the processors of the processor array. The arising optimization problems can be solved using integer linear programming

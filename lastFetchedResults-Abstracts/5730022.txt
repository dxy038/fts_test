This paper describes a multi-point Bidirectional Contactless Charging System (BCCS) in a charging station suitable for electric vehicle and plug-in-hybrid vehicle applications. Battery modules of different ratings, together with their charging interface is connected to their respective charging points through high frequency coreless coils are described. Such type of multilevel configuration is easy to modularize and extend and allows different kinds of batteries to work together. Modeling, design and control aspects of multi-point BCCS system are addressed in detail. A multi-point BCCS system is designed and simulated for a maximum power handling capacity of 200kW and analyzed for vehicle-to-grid and grid-to-vehicle operations.

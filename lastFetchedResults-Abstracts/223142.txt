Case studies in engineering ethics were integrated
into a first course in electrical and computer engineering at
Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), Worcester, MA, with the
primary objective of increasing students’ awareness of ethical
issues in the workplace. During a three-hour “laboratory” period,
students read and discussed three short case studies in engineering
ethics, focusing on understanding the differing viewpoints of
individuals within a case and identifying multiple courses of action
for resolving the issue. The effects of the laboratory were assessed
via student focus groups and surveys. All focus group participants
agreed that their awareness of ethical issues in engineering was
enhanced by the laboratory. In contrast, the survey results were
equivocal, showing improvement in the students’ awareness of
ethical issues; however, the particular questions found to differ
statistically preintervention versus postintervention were not
consistent between course offerings.

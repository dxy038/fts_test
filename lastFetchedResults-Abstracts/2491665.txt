Background: Physical exercise and herbal treatment with antioxidant property induce a favorable effect on glucose metabolism in diabetic patients.
Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of resistance training combined with green tea extract consumption on blood glucose and lipid profile in diabetic rats. 
Methods: Forty male Wistar diabetic rats aged 5 months and weights 290 Â± 20 were divided into 4 groups named as: resistance training, resistance training + green tea, green tea and control. The resistance training and resistance training + green tea groups engaged in exercise for 5 weeks with three times per week moving up the ladder with weight hanging their tail. Green tea extract 
(100 mg/kg) was gavaged once a day for 5 weeks. Forty eight hours after the last training session and green tea gavages, the fasting blood samples was collected for determination of blood glucose, cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C and triglyceride levels.
Results: Fasting blood glucose level significantly decreased in all three groups compared with control group, where as triglyceride, cholesterol and LDL-C level significantly decrease in resistance training + green tea group compared to control group. 
Conclusion: Green tea extract and resistance training improve hyperglycemia and in combination improve lipid profile in diabetic rats.

This paper presents design and performance evaluation of an intelligent adaptive antenna system for LTE networks. The design is based on a resource optimization problem, which adjusts the antenna gains of LTE eNodeBs in a geographic area. By adaptively changing the cellular coverage patterns of eNodeBs, our proposed design maximizes the network coverage and capacity while minimizing the total transmission power and inter-cell interference. The resource optimization problem is multi-objective and is very difficult to solve optimally, if possible. First, the solution of the problem is obtained using Genetic Algorithm. Then a faster converging Particle Swarm Optimization approach is proposed. System level simulations for LTE are conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed schemes. Numerical results show significant performance improvement in terms of coverage, system throughput, and power minimization with respect to the existing fixed antenna gain schemes in LTE.

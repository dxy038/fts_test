This paper presents a physical placement algorithm, for Dynamically Reconfigurable Arrays (DRA), based on a multi-objective, multi-threaded GA implementation. The algorithm deals with the spatial and temporal nature of the configurations used in DRAs, in an attempt to find a suitable layout for a wide range of applications, since general applicability is a key criteria for DRAs. The results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the routability and total wire-length of the mapped configuration sets, with results ranging from 21% to 55% for various quality metrics.

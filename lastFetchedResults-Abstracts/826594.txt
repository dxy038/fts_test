Background: Oxidative stress mechanisms are involved in the embryotoxicity. The objective of this study was to assess hepatotoxicity of bisphenol-A (BPA) in chicken embryos.
Materials and Methods: Fertile eggs were randomly divided into 4 groups; three experimental and one control groups, (N=15, for each group). Embryos were administered 50, 100 and 200 PPM BPA, and incubated for 48 h at 37Â°C with a relative humidity of 63%. The experiment was terminated on day 20 of incubation. Then, the embryos were decapitated and livers of embryos were collected for biochemical analysis. The total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), carotenoid and total protein levels were measured by spectrophotometer.
Results: The result of the present study indicated that the levels of total antioxidant in the livers of embryos exposed to 200 PPM BPA were higher than control and other groups, as well as the levels of MDA compared to control group (p < 0.05). The levels of GSH, total carotenoids and total protein were higher in all groups exposed to BPA than control group (p < 0.05). In addition, protein concentration in 200 PPM group was higher than of other groups (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: So far, BPA may lead to induce toxic response of oxidative system in liver throughout embryonic period.

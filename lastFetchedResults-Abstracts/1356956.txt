Background and Objectives: Uterine smooth muscle tumors are the most common human
neoplasm. They are divided clinically as benign and malignant but there is another group of lesions
which is difficult to place in these two categories, so-called smooth muscle tumors of uncertain
malignant potential (STUMP) and differentiation of these tumors on the basis of H&E staining is
impossible. The goal of this study was finding of distinguishing objective biomarkers and a survey
of proliferation markers comparing these three groups of tumors.
Materials & Methods: Twenty one cases in each group of above mentioned tumors were
selected randomly (63 cases in total ) from Pathobiology laboratories and studied by using
immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for Ki-67 expression and special Argyrophilic Nucleolar
Organizing Regions (AgNOR) staining method.
Results : Ki-67 was expressed in 63.15% of leiomyosarcomas (LMS), 4.76% of STUMPs and
0% of leiomyoma group. Ki-67 expression between LMS and STUMP, and also between LMS and
leiomyoma were significantly different(P < 0.0001).Mean AgNOR dots were 2.55± 0.03 , 2.55, 0.66,4.04,
and 8.12±0.13 in leiomyoma, STUMP and leiomyosarcoma,respectively. Significant differences
between the three groups were observed (P < 0.0001).
Conclusion: AgNOR and Ki-67(MIB1) proliferation markers expression between LMS and
STUMP were significantly different. Due to difficulty in differentiation LMS from STUMP, finding
objective biomarkers is useful and practical. For this purpose, the present study recommend, Ki-67
and AgNOR staining which is a reliable, simple and rapid method.

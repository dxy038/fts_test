This paper investigates the adaptive synchronization between two nonlinearly delay-coupled complex networks with the bidirectional actions and nonidentical topological structures. Based on LaSalleâ€™s invariance principle, some criteria for the synchronization between two coupled complex networks are achieved via adaptive control. To validate the proposed methods, the unified chaotic system as the nodes of the networks are analyzed in detail, and numerical simulations are given to illustrate the theoretical results.

According to the characteristics of pervasive computing, a suitable service model based on recommendation trust for pervasive computing is presented in this paper. In this model, the concept of recommendation credibility, credibility of service content and indirect credibility are introduced to overcome the problem of pervasive computing in the choice of service provider blindly. Recommendation credibility can prevent the cheating behavior of collusive recommendation. Credibility of service content can evaluate service providers more objective and prevent the cheating behavior of service providers. Indirect credibility can evaluate the recommendation side more comprehensive because it is decided by recommendation credibility and recommendation similarity. The proposed model has the advantage of fitting for dynamic trust characteristics of pervasive computing, preventing the failure behavior of single point and choosing more suitable service provider for service applicants.

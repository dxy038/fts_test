The objective of this study was to develop a stage model for identifying and measuring the values and benefits of a mobile business service. The model should be suitable to be used in situations where the mobile business service is in the planning phase and no exact measurements of the impacts can be made. The goal is to give more accurate information to the decision maker about the values and benefits and also the targets of impact of the planned service. The developed stage model is illustrated with a case company providing home help services for elderly and disabled. The illustrative case study shows how our model provided a systematic approach into identification of the values and benefits and helped in the setting of the objectives and metrics.

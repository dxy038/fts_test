The basic objective of this paper is to present the relevant methodological and practical aspects of two efficient procedures for initialization of steady-state security analyses of electric power interconnection. The first procedure gives the load-flow solution for known initial generators scheduling and the second one gives the load-flow solution in conditions of bilateral or multilateral exchange programs realization. Those procedures are fully consistent with the specially developed procedure for steady-state security analysis, which is based on successive solutions of load-flow in characteristic post-dynamic quasi-stationary states, occurring after the considered disturbances. The efficiency of proposed procedures is demonstrated on the example of real electric power interconnection in the Balkan area.

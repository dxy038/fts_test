The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of diet supplementation with olive leaves or α-tocopheryl acetate on lipid and protein oxidation of raw and cooked n− 3 enriched-pork during refrigerated storage. Enrichment of pork with α-linolenic acid through diet supplementation with linseed oil enhanced (p ≤ 0.05) lipid oxidation in both raw and cooked chops but had no effect (p &gt; 0.05) on protein oxidation during refrigerated storage while decreasing (p ≤ 0.05) the sensory attributes of cooked pork. Diet supplementation with olive leaves or α-tocopheryl acetate had no effect (p &gt; 0.05) on the fatty acid composition of pork but decreased (p ≤ 0.05) lipid oxidation while exerting no effect (p &gt; 0.05) on protein oxidation in both raw and cooked α-linolenic acid-enriched chops stored and chilled for 9 days. Moreover, olive leaves and α-tocopheryl acetate supplemented at 10 g/kg and 200 mg/kg diet, respectively, exerted (p ≤ 0.05) a beneficial effect on the sensory attributes of cooked α-linolenic acid-enriched pork chops.

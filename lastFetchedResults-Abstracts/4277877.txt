Lots of uncertainties exist during risk evaluation. This paper takes advantage of the evidence theory during processing uncertainties to solve the problems in risk evaluation. By modeling the hierarchy index system of the risk objective, calculating the value of evaluation indicators and fusing the uncertain information, this paper illuminates the common steps showing how to use the evidence theory to value the risk. This paper offers a new and more reasonable method to deal with the uncertainty in risk evaluation.

In this paper we propose an effective de-ringing method for DCT compressed images and videos. This method performs a subband decomposition provided by a translation invariant wavelet and processes only the high level subbands by means of a local adaptive equalization around the edges of the image. This makes the procedure suitable for both texture and flat areas, and moreover for different compression ratios. The benefits of the algorithm are then shown with objective, based on PSNR and SSIM metrics, and subjective evaluations.

Today, the compliance of device-based therapy for extended periods lies often below 50 percent [1]. Furthermore every second household is equipped with both a powerful computer and a flat-screen TV ([3], [4]). This project is motivated by the idea to connect these facts. For an increased motivation to use the daily hours of media consumption simultaneously for rehabilitation, a data animation is combined with a browser window or media player. With the COMES&#174;<sup>1</sup> interface, a therapist has additionally the possibility to interact with the user and animation. Moreover a usability test has been made, to examine the acceptance of both patients and therapists for a media supported rehabilitation. The objective of this project is to reduce the motivational threshold of a daily training and thus increase the compliance in long term rehabilitation.

Nowadays,  automakers  have  invested  in  new  technologies  in  order  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  their 
products.  Giant  automakers  have  taken  an  important  step  toward  achieving  this  objective  by  designing 
continuously variable transmission systems (CVT) to continuously adapt the power of the engine with the 
external load according to the optimum efficiency curve of engine and reducing fuel consumption; beside, 
making  smooth  start  up  and  removing  the  shock  caused  by  changing  the  gear  ratio  and  making  more 
pleasurable  driving.  Considering  the  specifications  of  one  of  Iranian  automaker  products  (the  Saipa  Pride 
131),  a  CVT  with  a  metal  pushing  belt  and  variable  pulleys  have  been  designed  to  replace  its  current 
manual transmission system. The  necessary parts and components for the  CVT have  been determined and 
considering the necessary constraints, its mechanism and components have been designed.

The human body depends on heat transfer from the skin for thermoregulation. Infrared imaging is the most efficient technique for the study of skin temperature distribution. Real time thermal imaging is achieved with modern detectors, usually a cadmium mercury telluride detector cooled by liquid nitrogen. By standardising the examination conditions, and calibrating the thermal imager, accurate two dimensional measurements of temperature patterns can be made. Many studies have been performed which show the anticipated normal pattern of temperature shown in a thermal image. In specific diseases, characteristic changes can be measured from target anatomical sites. In this way, objective non-invasive investigations can be of diagnostic value. The technique is especially useful for the monitoring of treatment, whether surgical, physical or pharmacologic

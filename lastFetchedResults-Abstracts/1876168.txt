Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in a nurse-managed smoking cessation program. Design: A cohort design nested within the WINS randomized clinical trial was used with follow-up at 2, 7, 21, 28, and 90 days. Setting: The study took place in 10 hospitals in the San Francisco Bay Area. Subjects: Participants included 142 women hospitalized with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Outcome Measure: The outcome measure was the use of NRT after having been assessed as eligible for its use. Intervention: NRT was used as an adjunct in the behavioral intervention protocol. NRT was recommended during the hospital intervention and during the 90-day outpatient phase. Results: Of 142 women in the intervention group, 127 met the criteria for NRT use. During the 5 follow-up assessments, the reported NRT use ranged from 9% to 22%. Conclusion: A low NRT use rate among women with CVD is evident. The results suggest that future research about NRT myths pertaining to women is needed. Nurses can help patients dispel these myths and prevent smoking relapse in women with CVD.

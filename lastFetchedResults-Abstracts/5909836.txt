The characteristic behavior of the loads of oil pumps is analyzed. An approach for low-voltage side reactive power compensators of oil field distribution networks is put forward. Based on the supplied loads of transformers, the index of maximum reduction of active power losses is taken as the objective function. The total number and the total capacity of capacitors which will be devoted by user are considered as the restricted conditions. The index of the highest benefit-investment-ratio is also used as the objective function. The load varying is also considered in the proposed method. Three cases are detailed, such as knowing total capacity of capacitors, knowing the total number of capacitors and knowing the investment. The feasibility of the proposed method is showed by the results of an example.

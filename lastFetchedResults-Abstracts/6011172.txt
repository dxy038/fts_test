In High level Synthesis design methodology, the evaluation and selection of the optimal architecture for the system is done through a process called Design Space Exploration (DSE). This paper presents a novel framework for fast DSE using fuzzy search technique for optimizing modular computing architecture for the current generation of multi objective VLSI designs. The proposed method is able to radically reduce the number of architectural variants to be analyzed during design space exploration while simultaneously maintaining the precision required during the exploration process. Significant improvement in speedup during DSE is obtained for different benchmarks, compared to a DSE method with binary search mechanism.

Objective
ign a protocol for the determination of the flexural modulus of elasticity of wire with high accuracy and precision.
s
ever bending was used at long span and low loads, using a laser displacement sensor. Various wires were tested for proof-of-concept: stainless steel, Elgiloy, Wiptam and a gold alloy, with primary attention being paid to the source and magnitude of errors.
s
duli of elasticity were determined with a median relative error of âˆ¼0.15%, with a worst case of 0.56%, taking into account all measurement errors. The precision was such as to permit distinctions between the values for the wires of different thermomechanical history.
icance
termination of the elastic modulus of wires may be made with good precision using cantilever bending providing attention is given to all sources of error. These results represent the most reliable measures of modulus of elasticity of orthodontic archwires to date.

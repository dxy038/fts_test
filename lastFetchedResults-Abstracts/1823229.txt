Objective
ly, several genes have been reported with mutations or variants that underlie a number of syndromic and non-syndromic forms of oligodontia including MSX1, PAX9, AXIN2, EDA and WNT10A. This study aimed to identify the causal mutations in a consanguineous Pakistan family with oligodontia and microdontia.

sequencing was performed in two of affected members of the Pakistan family.
s
ome sequencing data revealed that the affected individuals were homozygous with a novel mutation in exon 8 of the SMOC2 gene, c.681T&gt;A (p.C227X).
sions
s the second report describing SMOC2 mutations with oligodontia and microdontia underlining the key role for this signalling molecule in tooth development.

Background and Objective: Insulin resistance is one of the key components of metabolic syndrome and a major risk factor for diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases, especially among obese people.  The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of L-carnitine supplementation either with or without moderate aerobic training on insulin resistance and anthropometric indices in obese women.
Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial, 44 obese women (BMI?30 kg/m2) were randomly assigned into 4 groups (n=11 each) as follows: 1, L-carnitine supplementation (2 g/day) (group CAR); 2, aerobic training + placebo (group EXR+PLA); 3, L-carnitine supplementation + aerobic training (group CAR+EXR); and 4, placebo alone (group PLA).  The intervention periods were eight-week long, and the subjects of aerobic training groups went through 3 training sessions a week.  The weight, waist and hip circumferences, waist to hip ratios, body mass indeces, daily dietary intakes and serum fasting free L-carnitine levels, glucose and insulin levels, and HOMA-IR were measured before and after the interventions.
Results: Significant decreases in the waist and hip circumferences were observed in the EXR+PLA and CAR+EXR groups.  The serum glucose fasting levels, as well as insulin and HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance) values decreased significantly in the CAR, EXR+PLA, and CAR+EXR groups.  
Conclusion: The results indicate beneficial effect of aerobic training on insulin resistance and anthropometric measurements including waist and hip circumferences in comparison with L-carnitine alone supplementation.  L-carnitine decreased the insulin resistance and was more effective along with aerobic training for improvement of insulin resistance.  The aerobic training could be considered as an effective way of weight loss and insulin resistance improvement.

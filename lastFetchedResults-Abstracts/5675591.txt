This paper presents the search for and resulting effects of resilience weak spots in a commercial Local Interconnect Network (LIN) transceiver. Industrial reliability simulations based on aging of devices have been used to locate these weak spots. The objective is to improve the resilience of the circuit during its design and validation phase after determination of the weak spots. In the case of our target chip, this complete cycle was successfully completed. Finally a new simulation principle is being proposed in order to automate the search for weak spots to speed-up and strengthen this search. It enables at an early design stage to take appropriate counter measures to improve resilience.

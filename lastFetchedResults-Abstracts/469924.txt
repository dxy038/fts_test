Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine if a perisurgical smoking cessation program reduces smoking-related postoperative complications in urogynecologic surgery.
Study design
A review of patients that underwent pelvic reconstructive surgery from 1998 to 2003 was performed. All smokers underwent a perisurgical smoking cessation program of their choice for at least 1 month before surgery, and continued for 1 month after surgery. Complications unrelated to smoking (cystotomy, enterotomy, urethral obstruction, etc) were excluded in the smoking-potentiated complications. Problems considered to be potentiated by smoking were: wound, pulmonary, cardiac, and febrile morbidity.
Results
Eight hundred eighty-seven patients were included. There were 233 smoker cessation patients (SC) and 654 nonsmokers (NS). The total number of complications in the SC group was 61 (61/233, 26%) compared with 172 (172/654, 29%) in the NS group: (chi-square, P = .97). When looking at smoking-potentiated complications only, there were 34 (34/61, 56%) patients in the SC group and 90 (90/172, 52%) in the NS group (chi-square, P = .75).
Conclusion
There are no differences in smoking-potentiated complications between nonsmoking patients and patients who undergo a perisurgical smoking cessation program.

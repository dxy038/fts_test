A new soft-switched bidirectional dc-dc converter with coupled inductors is proposed in the paper. The proposed converter can operate with soft-switching, fixed switching frequency, and the switch stresses of a conventional PWM converter with coupled inductor regardless of the direction of power flow. These features are due to a very simple auxiliary active clamp circuit that is operational regardless of the direction of power flow. In the paper, the converterÂ´s operation is explained. Experimental results obtained from a prototype, which confirm the feasibility of the proposed converter, are also presented.

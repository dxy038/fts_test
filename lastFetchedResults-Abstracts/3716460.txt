In this paper the design and construction of a number of alternative adaptive filter implementations using an integrated charge-coupled device programmable transversal filter are described. Particular emphasis is placed on the analysis of errors in the system structure from both the theoretical and experimental standpoint. The principal objective was to demonstrate that an adaptive Filter having a high performance specification may be very simply implemented using CCD technology despite large error bounds in the constituent components. To this end a full theoretical treatment of the filter performance taking account of the significant error sources is presented; and experimental results are also included showing the high quality of performance actually obtained using the prototype systems. Limitations and advantages of all-analog and analog-digital hybrid realizations are identified and their specific areas of application are discussed.

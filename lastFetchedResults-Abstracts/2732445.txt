TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement (TanDEM-X) is an innovative spaceborne bistatic SAR system comprising the twin satellites TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X (TSX and TDX, respectively). The primary objective of the mission is the generation of a worldwide, timely, and consistent digital elevation model (DEM) in a bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) configuration with unprecedented accuracy. For TanDEM-X and for future spaceborne SAR missions, an increasing volume of onboard data is going to be demanded. This is due to the employment of large bandwidths, high pulse repetition frequencies, and multiple polarizations, which implies inevitably hard requirements in terms of onboard memory and downlink capacity. In this scenario, SAR raw data quantization represents an essential aspect. The data rate employed for the digitization of the recorded radar signal affects both the amount of data to be stored and transmitted to the ground and the quality of the resulting SAR products. In this paper, the impact of quantization on TanDEM-X monostatic and interferometric data is evaluated. Key quantities in estimating interferometric and SAR performance, such as coherence and phase errors, are investigated in detail. Based on the obtained results, an optimization of the resource-allocation strategy for the global DEM acquisition of TanDEM-X is discussed.

This paper presents a cost effective edge-resonant soft-switching PWM high frequency inverter with minimum circuit components. This inverter can achieve wider soft commutation, simpler circuit configuration, smaller volumetric size, lower cost and wider power regulation range, higher-efficiency as compared to single ended quasi-resonant ZVS-PFM and active voltage clamped quasi-resonant ZVS-PWM inverters. The operation principle of the proposed inverter is described on the basis of the simulation and experimental results. The operating performances of this unique proposed high frequency inverter based on ZVS and ZCS arms-related soft commutation principle is evaluated and discussed in steady state as compared to the previous inverters. The extended bidirectional circuit topology of quasi-resonant PWM high frequency inverter with minimum circuit components is demonstrated, which operate as the direct frequency changer

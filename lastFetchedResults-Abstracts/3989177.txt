The electromagnetic (EM) launcher is an important part of the active EM armor with which the electric energy provided by the high pulsed-power supply is transformed into the kinetic energy of the interception projectile. The launching velocity of the interception projectile is affected by the structural parameters of the EM launcher. It is necessary to optimize the structural design and choose the preferable parameters of the EM launcher in order to get a higher launch velocity. In this paper, the equivalent circuit equation and electromechanical model of the EM launcher are given, and a systemic dynamic simulation model is built. Taking the launch velocity of the projectile as the objective function, the uniform design method and regression analysis are used to build the significant regression equation which presents the relation between the structural parameters and launch velocity of the projectile. The optimal structural parameters of the EM launcher are obtained with a grid-optimized algorithm.

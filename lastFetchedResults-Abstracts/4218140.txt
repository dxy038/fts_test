Take the fruit harvest robot experimental platform as background to research on the strategy of advancing harvest efficiency. Sample continuous and real-time fruit image by image processing, preprocess to detect the objective fruit, and then create an image coordinate system. Calculate oscillation frequency of the objective fruit with curve fitting of sample value. At the same time, get the depth of the objective fruit with visual and calculate the movement time of the Direct-acing joint to achieve the control of the end effector. The research will reduce the locating time, advance harvest efficiency of the harvest robot when spherical fruits like apple are oscillating.

Camera placement has huge impact on the performance of large scale surveillance. The quality of the coverage and cost of the camera network make the problem multi-objective. The problem becomes even more difficult when realistic conditions like obstacles, preference coverage and resolution are considered. In this work we propose a framework for optimal camera placement, giving simultaneous consideration to different qualitative aspects using multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). We improve our camera-coverage model by including the realistic parameters such as frontal coverage and the optimal range of view of a camera. We develop a novel camera coverage calculation algorithm which ensures that the proposed set-up is applicable to surveillance tasks such as face recognition and object tracking. Developed algorithm has been tested on realistic floor plans and optimal lay-outs have been reported.

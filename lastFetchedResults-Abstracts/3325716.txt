Governing bodies such as OSHA in the US and OH&amp;S in Canada firmly place on the shoulders of the employer the responsibility of workplace safety. Job hazard assessments are a critical component in the job planning process. These regulatory agencies have a simple statement when dealing with the electrical hazard. &#8220;Turn it off.&#8221; Although this is the ultimate means of protection it is too often not followed. Common activities such as testing, troubleshooting, setup and commissioning preclude that mandate. Leaving circuits in an energized state could result in an electrical incident and injury. Any injury is unacceptable so what is an employer to do when electrical tasks must be done in an energized state? NFPA 70E begins with the same &#8220;de-energize the system&#8221; mandate but continues with an entire section detailing steps to follow when you donÂ´t. (1) Employees must be trained to identify hazards, assess risks and recognize signs of impending failure in the job preparation procedures if their safety is to be ensured. One thing seems certain. When left up to employee decision alone, skilled and qualified workers tend to default to what is convenient or comfortable or what they have always done and this may likely not be the recognized safest best practice. This is extremely important in the construction industry where employees continually move from the relative safety of a deenergized installation to the dangerous arena of energized setup, commissioning or maintenance. Electrical safety programs must contain detailed policies where working around energized systems is encountered. Where this is not possible objective and measurable matrixes must be established guiding the worker to make the appropriate decisions in the field. This paper will examine the additional processes and training required for employees to conduct the electrical task risk assessments intended by their employer and the procedural tools that may be required.

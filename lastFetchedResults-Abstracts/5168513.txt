This article describes a sensory mapping algorithm based on the simultaneous application of data mining on two sets of data, corresponding to two processes governing customersÂ´ preferences: The sensory process, which governs the acceptance of a product as a function of hedonic variables, and the analytical process, which relate the sensory responses to objective analytical properties of the product; data mining is carried out by the means of structural equation modeling, and the final algorithm allows the prediction of purchase intent of a new product given its sensory attributes and analytical composition.

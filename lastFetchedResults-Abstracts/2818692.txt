Measurement of blood volumetric changes in human body by photoplethysmographic sensors is used in present study. Objective is to measured different parameters that are heart rate, respiratory rate, BP. PPG signal is acquired by PPG sensor, microcontroller and RS 232. The acquired PPG signal is displayed in MATLAB. Frequency domain analysis of PPG signal shows a two peaks first at around 0.25 to 0.35 Hz and second at around 1 to 1.5 Hz. FFT at 1Hz relates to 60 BPM and FFT at 0.25 Hz relates to 15 respiratory cycles per minute. For BP Measurement, the pulse height of PPG is proportional to the difference between the systolic and the diastolic pressure in the arteries. The standard blood pressure monitoring instrument is used to calculate correlation coefficient. The arterial blood pressure is calculated based on these coefficients. PPG signal is used to detect blood pressure pulsations in a finger and achieved an accuracy of (0.8 &#177; 7) mmHg and (0.9 &#177; 6) mmHg for systolic and diastolic pressure, respectively. The developed PPG based method can be used as a noninvasive alternative to the conventional occluding-cuff approaches for long-term and continuous monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate.

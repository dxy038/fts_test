The objective of this paper is to detect the healing effect of asphalt mastic and porous asphalt concrete caused by induction heating. It was found that the broken mastic beams could be healed many times by induction heating. Moreover, the stiffness of porous asphalt concrete recovered more and faster when induction heating was applied to the samples. It was also found that fatigue life of porous asphalt concrete was significantly extended by induction heating. Based on these findings, it was concluded that the self healing rate of asphalt mastic and porous asphalt concrete can be increased by induction heating.

Although many methods exist for intensity modulated radiotherapy
(IMRT) fluence map optimization for crisp data, based on clinical practice,
some of the involved parameters are fuzzy. In this paper, the best fluence maps
for an IMRT procedure were identifed as a solution of an optimization problem
with a quadratic objective function, where the prescribed target dose vector
was fuzzy. First, a defuzzying procedure was introduced to change the fuzzy
model of the problem into an equivalent non-fuzzy one. Since the solution
set was nonconvex, the optimal solution was then obtained by performing a
projection operation in applying the gradient method. Numerical simulations
for two typical clinical cases (for prostate and head-and-neck cancers, each for
two patients) are given.

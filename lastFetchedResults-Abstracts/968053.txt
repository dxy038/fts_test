The fabrication of three-dimensional microstructures by two-photon polymerisation has been widely reported as a viable route to the development of photonic crystals, rotors, bridges and other complex artefacts requiring nanoscale resolution. Conventionally, single point serial writing is used to write the structures but recently multipoint beam delivery using beam division optics has been reported as a method of introducing parallel processing. In this paper we present an alternative and novel approach using an axicon lens to give profiled beam delivery. This enables complete three-dimensional annular structure fabrication without the use of scanning stages. In addition, the concept of axicon delivery is developed further to investigate three-dimensional structure as a function of axicon geometry.

A Ti:sapphire laser, with wavelength 795 nm, 80 MHz repetition rate, 100 fs pulse duration and an average power of 700 mW, was used to initiate two-photon polymerisation. The axicon was used, in combination with a 100× microscope objective, to form representative three-dimensional structures based on the annular cell with varying diameter. The structures were written in a Zr-loaded resin prepared on a glass substrate using dip coating deposition of a Zr/PMMA hybrid prepared by the sol–gel method. Annuli with diameters up to 50 μm were characterised in terms of topography and surface roughness using SEM and Zygo interferometer. The writing technique was also extended to fabrication of stacked structures.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of patellar taping on knee joint proprioception in two groups. This research was based on repeated measurement of quasi-experimental design and non-probability sampling. Active and passive angle reproduction and threshold were performed to detect passive movement on isokinetic dynamometer. After taping, evaluation of tests was repeated and it was found that taping could affect passive angle reproduction in 20-degree angle. Further studies are needed to investigate the effect of patellar taping on proprioception status of PFPS subjects.

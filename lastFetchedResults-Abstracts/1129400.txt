One of the most important theories in the fields of metaethics and semantic analysis of ethical obligation is ‘Allamah Tabataba’i’s theory of mentally-posited things. A number of different and, sometimes, contradictory interpretations have been provided for this theory. This paper investigates two important readings and interpretations of this theory. According to the first one, the content of ethical musts is metaphorical and mentally-posited obligation, so that the ethical agent makes his contingent relation and ethical act as an obligatory relation for some purposes. According to the second interpretation, mentally-posited things, in ‘Allamah’s views, are the same philosophical secondary intelligibles. Thus ethical mentally-posited musts are not, in fact, metaphorical and mentally-posited in the particular sense of the word. Rather, they are some genetic obligations with their origins of objective abstraction in the outside. The first interpretation is mainly discussed in two of his books, Usul falsafah and Rasa’il sab‘ah, and the second interpretation is discussed in some scattered writings in al-Mizan and Risalah al-wilayah.
In this paper and at the level of judgment and evaluation, the writers find the first interpretation, which is attributed to ‘Allamah, stronger and more justified. In terms of their correspondence or lack of correspondence with reality and internal coherence, the writers believe that ‘Allamah Tabataba’i’s theory of mentally-posited things lacks solid proof, is inconsistent with human intuitions, is self-contradictory, and lacks exclusivity. Eventually, it seems that his theory concerning the semantic analysis of ethical obligation is not only incomplete but also incorrect.

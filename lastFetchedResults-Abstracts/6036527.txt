On the basis of analyzing the structure characteristic and working condition, revolving floating crane overall was divided into several sub-systems. By controlling global dominant parameters, sub-systems of floating crane are optimized, which is led by optimization of global dominant parameters to achieve the overall structure of the optimal floating crane. And the overall objective function and constraint function of overall optimization is established, also the objective function and constraint function of boom sub-system is listed. At last, the optimization flow chart is present. This optimization method can made floating crane overall optimization design carry out under the low-dimensional array, so that optimization would be more effective and reasonable.

Since the summer of 2006, the legislation governing the installation of Renewable Energy Sources electric energy production facilities in Greece has been updated by the law 3468/2006. The aim of the current study is to present a synopsis of the recently introduced statute with emphasis on the main changes imported. The objective of the law 3468/2006 is to provide favorable conditions for the infiltration of RES investors into the electric energy market, leading to benefit of the consumers and also to decreasing CO2 emissions, providing a more favorable framework for compliance to the frames of the Kyoto Protocol. The authors wish to thank Dr. George Mariatos and Mr. George Spyrou for providing support for the work reported in this paper. The research for this study was financed by the European Union (75%) and the Greek Government (25%). [PENED 2003, code number 03ED158].

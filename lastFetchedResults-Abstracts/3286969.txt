This work has as objective to maximize the efficiency of the DC/DC boost converter, used to track the maximum power of a PV system implemented by three panels, connected in series, with a total power of 600 W. The maximization is based on the selection of the magnetic material and of the operating point (&#916;i @ f<sub>s</sub>) that results in the best weighted average efficiency. Losses in the capacitors, semiconductors and magnetic devices are considered. Experimental results are presented to validate the simulated results obtained, as well as results of the efficiency of the boost converter. There different points will be presented to prove that operating point selected is the best among them.

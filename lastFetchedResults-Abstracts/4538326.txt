An investigation on the properties of Frequency Selective Surfaces (FSSs) with fractal patch elements is presented. Particularly, the main objective of this work is to design a high angular stability FSS band reject filter using a simple fractal element shape based on Minkowski fractal curves. The chosen FSS geometry is composed of a periodic array of conducting patches on a dielectric layer. Simulation and design are performed using Ansoft Designer commercial software for several wave incidence angles. Prototypes are built and measured to validate the study. Good agreement is observed between simulated and measured results.

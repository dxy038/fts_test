The study of emotional over-involvement
(EOI) has focused primarily on its relationship
with patients’ course of illness. We know little about
the predictors and possible consequences of EOI for
caregivers. Based on past research, we tested the
hypotheses that EOI is associated with worse physical
and psychological health among caregivers and
examined whether caregiver burden and social support
may mediate this relationship. Method In a
sample of 37 Mexican American caregivers and their
ill relatives recruited from two outpatient clinics, we
examined the relationships between EOI, caregiver
burden, caregivers’ level of social support, and caregivers’
health. Additionally, we examined whether
caregiver burden and social support may mediate the
relationship between EOI and caregivers’ health.
Cross-sectional analysis indicates that at baseline EOI
was not associated with caregiver burden or social
support, but was related to worse current health.
Longitudinal analysis, however, indicates that EOI at
baseline was associated with greater burden, less
instrumental support, and worse health among caregivers
at follow-up. Moreover, objective burden
and instrumental support mediated the relationship
between EOI and several health outcomes. Consequently,
EOI may be a marker of poor current health
status and predicts worse future health among
Mexican–American caregiving relatives of individuals
with schizophrenia. Moreover, changes in burden and
social support associated with EOI appear to mediate
the relationship between EOI and several health outcomes
among caregivers. These findings suggest that
it might be important for family interventions to not
only address the functioning of individuals with
schizophrenia but also their caregiving relatives

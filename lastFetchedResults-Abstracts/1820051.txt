Objective
tudy investigated the effect of six lab-produced saliva substitutes based on carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) differing in octacalciumphosphate saturations (OCP-s) on mineralisation of bovine dentin in vitro.

 specimens were prepared (n = 234); prior to and after demineralisation (37 °C; pH 5.0; 7 d), one-third of each specimen surface was covered with nail varnish (control of sound dentin). Subsequently, specimens (n = 13) were exposed to either one of the six CMC-based solutions (OCP-s: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8) at pH 6.5 or to Glandosane for 5 and 10 weeks (37 °C). Two aqueous solutions (OCP-s: 0 and 1) served as controls. After storage, thin sections were prepared and mineral loss was calculated by transversal microradiography.
s
both storage periods specimens immersed in Glandosane revealed a significantly increased mineral loss compared to all other solutions (p &lt; 0.05; Bonferroni post hoc test). Control solution with OCP-s = 1 induced a significant remineralisation (p &lt; 0.05; adjusted paired t-test). Only after 5 weeks exposure to the CMC-based solution with an OCP-s = 2 a significant remineralisation compared to baseline (p &lt; 0.05) as well as a significantly increased mineral gain of the surface area compared to higher saturated solutions (p &lt; 0.05; Bonferroni post hoc test) could be observed.
sions
ems to hamper dentin remineralisation, although after 5 weeks a mineral gain could be induced with slightly supersaturated CMC-solutions with respect to OCP.

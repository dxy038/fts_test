From 2760 fibrillation-defibrillation episodes in 100 kg calves, the effectiveness of reversing ventricular fibrillation of 30 s duration with symmetrical one-cycle bidirectional rectangular-wave shocks was determined. Pulse widths of 0.5-64 ms, pulse amplitudes of 35,50,70,100, and 140 A, and delivered pulse energies in the 93-1567 J range were employed in a primary study involving 39 animals. Families of curves relating percent successful defibrillation and the time intervals required for the return ofventricular activity and of normal sinus rhythm in the postdefibrillation electrocardiograms to the parameters of the delivered shocks were derived. In an eight-calf supplementary study involving 91-110 kg animals, the effectiveness of 50 A, 10 ms bidirectional rectangular wave shocks and 70 A, 6 ms unidirectional rectangular wave shocks were stringently compared by interlacing fibrillation-defibrillation episodes involving 120 bidirectional and 120 unidirectional shocks. When combined with previously published data for unidirectional wave shocks in 100 kg calves, our data suggest that pulse amplitude and pulse width specifications are considerably broader for successful bidirectional rectangular wave shocks than for unidirectional rectangular wave shocks, and that appreciably higher first-shock successful defibrillation (96-99 percent) can be achieved with bidirectional waveforms

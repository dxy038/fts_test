A course on Electronic Instrumentation has recently been developed at the University of Nebraska, which specifically emphasizes design aspects. The objective of the course is to expose senior undergraduate and graduate students to electronic as well as nonelectronic concepts concerned with instrumentation design and development. Topics covered include basic analog and digital circuits, filters and oscillators, linear and switching power supplies, low-noise techniques, signal processing, phase-locked loops (PLLs), transducers, grounding and shielding, thermal analysis, vibration analysis, electronic packaging, wiring and cabling, and engineering ergonomics. The course is intended to enable students to succeed as entry-level engineers in industry.

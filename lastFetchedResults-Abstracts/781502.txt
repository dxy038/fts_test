The objective of this study was to determine the long-term effect of alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) administration during early
neonatal life on skeletal development and function, with emphasis on bone exposed to regular stress and used to serve for systemic
changes monitoring, the rib. Shropshire ram lambs were randomly assigned to two weight-matched groups at birth. During the first
14 days of life AKG was administered orally to the experimental group (n = 12) at the dosage of 0.1 g/kg body weight per day,
while the control group (n = 11) received an equal dose of the vehicle. Lambs were slaughtered at 146 days of life and five left
and right ribs (fourth to eighth) were removed for analysis. The influence of AKG on skeletal system development was evaluated
in relation to both geometrical and mechanical properties, as well as quantitative computed tomography (QCT). No significant
differences between the groups were recorded in terms of: (1) growth rate, (2) body weight at days 14, 28 and 130 of age or (3)
final body weight. The weight and length of ribs were, however, significantly increased in the lambs given AKG for the first 14 days
of neonatal life by 8.2% and 3.2%, respectively (P < 0.01). Furthermore, AKG administration induced significantly higher bone
mineral density of the cortical bone by 7.1% (P < 0.01) and improved the mechanical endurance of ribs in terms of the moments
of maximum elastic strength and ultimate strength by 10% and 8%, respectively (P < 0.05). It could be concluded that AKG has a
long-term effect on skeletal development when given early in neonatal life, and that changes in rib properties serve to improve chest
mechanics and functioning in young animals. Moreover, neonatal administration of AKG may be considered as an effective factor
enhancing proper development and function of the skeleton during growth and later life.

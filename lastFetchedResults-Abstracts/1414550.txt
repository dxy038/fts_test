Molecular monolayers can be modified so that they mimic cell membranes. Two types of those biomimetic membranes were used in order to immobilize EF0F1-H+-ATPase on a gold electrode. The work was motivated by the objective to measure the adenosin-triphosphate (ATP) concentrations by taking advantage of the ATPase activity. It was shown that one of the two forms of monolayers acted as a biosensor as the ATP concentration was directly proportional to the measured reduction current of the protons transported across the membrane by the ATPase.

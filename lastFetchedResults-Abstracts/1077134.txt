The current study pilots a low-intensity behavioral intervention for parents and high school students with ADHD that promotes parent-teen collaboration at home and in session (Supporting Teens’ Academic Needs Daily-Group; STAND-G). Twenty-three high school students with ADHD and their parents were randomly assigned to receive an 8-week behavioral treatment beginning in October, January, or March. Weekly data were collected from students’ online grade books for 37 weeks of the school year to monitor changes in academic functioning through baseline, posttreatment, and follow-up phases. Students who had not yet received the treatment served as a control group for students who completed treatment. Qualitative and quantitative ratings of satisfaction, improvement, and parent implementation of home-based behavioral strategies were collected. Results indicated parent and teen satisfaction with STAND-G, parent compliance with intervention strategies, and a range of parent-rated therapeutic benefits (i.e., organization and time-management skills, academic conscientiousness, parent-teen communication, adolescent autonomy). Findings for the objective grade book data were mixed, with Group 2 (January), but not Group 1 (October), displaying identifiable acute improvements relative to control students. However, both groups evaluated at follow-up displayed meaningful improvements in the percentage of work turned in up to 2 months out of treatment. With these results in mind, we discuss the importance of tailoring interventions to the lives of high school students with ADHD and the future of treatment development and delivery for this often underserved population.

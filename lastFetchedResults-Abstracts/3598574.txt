Algorithms for full 3D robotic visual tracking of moving targets whose motion is 3D and consists of translational and rotational component are presented. The objective of the system is to track selected features on moving objects and to place their projections on the image plane at desired positions by appropriate camera motion. The most important characteristics of the proposed algorithms are the use of a single camera mounted on the end-effector of a robotic manipulator (eye-in-hand configuration), and the fact that these algorithms do not require accurate knowledge of the relative distance of the target object from the camera frame. The detection of motion is based on a cross-correlation technique known as sum-of squares differences (SSD) algorithm. The camera model used introduces a number of parameters that are estimated online, further reducing the algorithmsÂ´ reliance on precise calibration of the system. An adaptive control algorithm compensates for modeling errors, tracking errors, and unavoidable computations delays which result from time-consuming image processing

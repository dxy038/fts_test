The objective of this study was to prepare apigenin-loaded polymeric micelles to improve the solubility of apigenin in water. The polymeric micelles composed of Pluronic P123 and Solutol HS 15 were prepared by a thin-film dispersion method and the formulation was optimized with a central composite design (CCD). The obtained micelles were spherical under transmission electron microscope (TEM) with an average diameter of 16.9 nm, the entrapment efficiency and drug loading was 96.36% and 1.32%, respectively. The in vitro drug release study showed nearly 84% of apigenin was released from micelles within 36 h, showing the sustained release property. Cell toxicity assay indicated that the cytotoxicity of apigenin-loaded polymeric micelles against HepG2 and MCF-7 cancer cell in vitro was remarkably higher than that of the free drug. All the results provided the evidence for the great potential of polymeric micelles as nanocarrier for apigenin as a poorly water soluble drug.

Background and Aims
believed that oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. Several strategies have been developed with the objective of minimizing diabetic complications. Among these, inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV), which act by blocking degradation of incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide hormone (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), have been the focus of many studies. It is known that, among the effects of incretins, we highlight its insulinotropic and cytoprotective effects on pancreatic β-cells. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible protective effects of treatment with vildagliptin, a DPP-IV inhibitor, in β-cells in an experimental model of type 1 diabetes induced by streptozotocin (STZ).
s
ere treated for 4 weeks with vildagliptin at concentrations of 5 and 10 mg/kg. In order to observe the pancreatic damage and the possible protective effects of vildagliptin treatment, we measured stress markers TBARS and protein carbonyl, antioxidant enzymes SOD and catalase, and analyzed pancreatic histology.
s
eatment was effective in modulating stress in pancreatic tissue, both by reducing levels of stress markers as well as by increasing activity of SOD and catalase. After analyzing the pancreatic histology, we found that vildagliptin was also able to preserve islets and pancreatic β-cells, especially at the concentration of 5 mg/kg.
sion
our results suggest that vildagliptin ameliorates oxidative stress and pancreatic beta cell destruction in type 1 diabetic rats. However, to evaluate the real potential of this medication in type 1 diabetes, further studies are needed.

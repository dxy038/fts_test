We consider flow control in the downlink direction for a microcellular CDMA system carrying integrated packet level-data and voice services with the objective of providing maximum traffic capacity without service degradation due to overload. We present in this paper a flow control technique that regulates admitted calls based on the prediction of the total transmitted power requirements over the next packet transmission interval. The number of packets permitted to transmit is a function of the probability of exceeding the maximum power value. This probability is estimated from the autocovariance function of the transmitted power under maximally loaded traffic conditions. Outage is avoided by matching the number of simultaneously transmitted packets to the available transmitted power budget

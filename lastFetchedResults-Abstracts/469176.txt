Objective
This study was undertaken to evaluate the levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) in the precursors lesions and in the invasive cervical carcinoma and to quantify the immune reactive expression of MMP-2, using MMP-2 immunohistochemistry, in intraepithelial cervical neoplasias and in the invading cervical carcinoma.
Study design
We evaluated 60 samples of cervical tissues using immunohistochemistry for MMP-2 in 5 distinct groups. The groups were divided in control, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I (CIN I), CIN II, CIN III, and cervical invading carcinoma.
Results
MMP-2 expression was found gradually increased according to the degree of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical carcinoma. (Control<CIN I<CIN II<CIN III<Carcinoma)
Conclusion
Our results suggest that the expression of MMP-2 can distinguish CIN I, II, and III grades and the invading carcinoma.

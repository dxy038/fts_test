The objective was to determine the impact of increasing levels of Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; C20:5n3) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6n3) on beef palatability. Two commercial supplements of EPA and DHA were added to 85% lean ground beef patties (176.2 Â± 3.76 g) with different levels (0, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 1% as-is). Olive oil was added so that all patties contained 1% added lipid. A control treatment was also prepared with no supplement or olive oil. Sensory evaluation and fatty acid analysis was conducted. Ground beef flavor decreased linearly (P &lt; 0.001) with increasing levels of EPA and DHA. Off-aroma and off-flavor increased linearly and then plateaued with increasing levels of EPA (P &lt; 0.0001). In conclusion, EPA had a greater negative impact on beef palatability than DHA. Also, the panelists were more sensitive to EPA in off-flavor perception than off-aroma.

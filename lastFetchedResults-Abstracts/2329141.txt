Background and objective: Oxidation process, essential for the survival of living beings is to produce energy for biological processes. It is important to note that there is a balance between oxidizing agents and antioxidants to protect the body's physiological condition. Reserves antioxidant play effective role in reducing the disorders increased production of free radicals. This research evaluates the antioxidant activity and total phenols of extracts of aerial parts of saxicoline madder plant Rubia florida.
Materials and Methods: After preparing and collecting madder saxicoline and drying them in the shade, were dried in air and dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts was prepared by Masrasyvn. In this study, to evaluate the antioxidant DiPhenyl Pykryl Hydrazyl (DPPH) test was used. Hydroxy toluene (BHT) and vitamin C were used as positive control to compare. Then, to measure antioxidant compounds total phenols and flavonoid test was used.
Result: Extraction efficiency of the highest to the lowest methanol  >  dichloromethane  >  ethyl acetate was obtained. The best antioxidant activity in higher concentrations of the extracts was obtained and among solvents, methanol extract led and highest phenol and flavonoid compounds for methanol was obtained.
Conclusions: As regards phenols and flavonoids are highest in the methanol extract therefore, impute the effect of antioxidant extract to its phenols and flavonoids that further studies are needed to isolation and purification of this planetâ€™s phenolic and flavonoids compounds.

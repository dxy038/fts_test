The solutions of Maxwell´s equations are presented in terms of RLC circuits by Maxwellian circuits (MC) (Mei, 2003), so as to provide insights to circuit engineers, and to reproduce quick solutions of Maxwell´s equations within a band of frequencies. The MEI (measured equation of invariance) (Mei et al., 1994) is a method, used to terminate the finite difference/element meshes close to the target boundaries. It is based on the postulate that a local differential relation, similar to that of Sommerfeld´s radiation condition, exists close to the target boundary. Later development of the MEI method has successfully brought the termination boundary on to the target boundary so that the FD/FE meshes are no longer needed, and MEI becomes a computational method by itself, nevertheless it still requires the normal derivatives of the surface fields in the applications. And, that the postulate of the existence of local relations of the radiation condition type is still required. The theory of Maxwellian circuits (Mei, 2003) provides the proof that a differential equation of the current on a wire antenna, equivalent to the integral equation, exists and is unique. In order to find the differential equation, however, we need two solutions of the integral equation of different boundary conditions. So, Maxwellian circuits are not computational methods, in that it requires the solutions of the integral equations in the process of obtaining the equivalent circuits. The objective of this research is to apply MEI to MC, so that the Maxwellian circuit elements can be obtained without the MoM solutions of the integral equation. Because of the existence and uniqueness theorems of the MC, this combination eliminates the need of the postulates of the MEI method and also advanced the MC to become a computation method.

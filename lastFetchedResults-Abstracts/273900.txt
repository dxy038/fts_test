Especially in microsystem design, maintaining the minimum thickness of each structural member at a certain scale is
often as important as achieving the maximum system performance. Several successful methods to suppress one-point
hinges or checkerboards in topology optimization have been developed, but an efficient method to control the minimum
thickness at a desire scale remains to be developed. The objective of this investigation is to develop a wavelet-based
minimum thickness controlling method applicable to topology optimization and to show the effectiveness of the proposed
method in MEMS design. The idea behind the thickness controlling method is to extend the wavelet shrinkage
method developed for one-point hinge control to any scale-level minimum thickness control. The major difficulties in
implementing this idea are the development of an efficient algorithm to detect all undesirable patterns of different scales
and the hierarchical application of the wavelet shrinkage method over multiple scales. Some techniques to overcome
these difficulties are developed and applied to some MEMS design problems.

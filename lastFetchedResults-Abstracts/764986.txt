Treatment of toxic nitrogen-containing compounds is one of the major applications of the Wet Air Oxidation (WAO) processes. The objective of this study is determining the efficiency of wet air oxidation process to remove ammonia from leachate in Esfahan Composing            factory. Aqueous wastes containing organic pollutants can be efficiently treated by wet air oxidation, i.e. oxidation by molecular oxygen in the liquid phase, under high temperature (100–300°C)        and pressure (up to 10 bars).The results indicate that removal efficiency of NH3 at         temperature 300° C and retention time 30 min 54.6 percent and the efficiency of nitrate produced 58.9 %, after 30 min reaction at 300 °C, 10 bars. In these conditions, the highest removal efficiency of ammonia and highest Amount of nitrate are produced. The average of NO3 production                in this process is 32.5-58.9%. With further increasing temperature decomposition of organic material taken will be produced more ammonium. Also with increasing temperature and decreased retention time, ammonia oxidation to nitrate increased and nitrate are more produced.The WAO was           an effective pre-treatment method for industrial wastewater and leachate with high amount            of ammonia levels.

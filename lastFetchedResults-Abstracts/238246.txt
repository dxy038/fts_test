An optimal operating mode for a sequencing batch reactor was determined via a model-based optimization. Synthetic wastewater
containing mainly organic matter (as glucose) and nitrogen (as ammonium chloride) was treated without any addition of an external
carbon source to accomplish denitrification step. A simplified model was used to describe process dynamics, comprised of six ordinary
differential equations and an empirical correlation for oxygen consumption rate. Batch cycle time was the chosen objective function to be
minimized for a fixed volume of waste to be treated. Furthermore, as SBR operation is divided in two major phases â€“ aerobic and anoxic,
to achieve total pollutants removal within minimum time, these phases can be repeatedly alternated. To ensure availability of organic
matter necessary for denitrification, these two phases were combined with feed steps. Different feed strategies were tested using one,
two or three feed steps. A successive quadratic programming algorithm was used, and maximum values for final COD, nitrate and
ammonium concentrations, as well as maximum feed pump flow rate were some the process constraints. One step feed strategy was indicated
by the optimization leading to a batch cycle time of 5 h.

The National Forest Inventory of Finland (NFI) exploits satellite image data (Landsat TM) and digital elevation data in addition to ground measurements. The main purpose is to have estimates for essentially smaller areas (e.g. for some 1000 hectares) than what is possible with ground measurements only. The main objective of the study is to test the applicability of SAR images of ERS-1 together with other information sources, e.g. HUTSCAT, in estimating forest resources in large areas, and, if possible, to develop an operative forest inventory system which utilizes SAR-data

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to test the ability of an antiserum to vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor to inhibit postoperative adhesion formation in a murine model. STUDY DESIGN: After a standardized peritoneal injury, 28 Balb/c mice were randomized and treated intraperitoneally with either vascular permeability factor antiserum (n = 14) or preimmune serum (n = 14) at the time of abdominal closure. Mice were killed on postoperative day 14, and the development of intraabdominal adhesions was determined. Adhesion scoring was based on an overall assessment of the extent, location, and type of adhesions present. Statistical analyses were performed with the Mann-Whitney and Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: The mice treated with the vascular permeability factor antiserum had significantly lower adhesion scores than did the control group (mean ± SD 1.5 ± 0.9, median 1.0, vs control 2.5 ± 0.7, median 3.0). When the groups were analyzed for the presence of grade 2 or 3 adhesions, the group treated with vascular permeability factor antiserum had a significantly lower incidence of advanced adhesions (38%, vs control 92%). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the intraperitoneal administration of a neutralizing antiserum to vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor limits postoperative adhesion formation. These observations, to the best of our knowledge, are the first to suggest a role for vascular permeability factor in the pathogenesis of adhesion formation. (AM J OBSTET GYNECOL 1996;174:1502-6.)

The objective of this work was to analysis spatial distribution of rainfall erosivity in the Xiliugou basin, which is the Ten-watershed(in middle reaches of the Yellow River). A simplified rainfall erosivity model was established to apply to the long term daily rainfall series, distributed over the Xiliugou basins, yielding time series of annual and monthly rainfall erosivity for the period 1969-2010. Results indicated that the spatial distribution of average rainfall erosivity and concentration ratio maximum half-month rainfall erosivity in the Xiliugou basin(Ten-watershed in the middle of Yellow River) turn decrease trend from North to South direction in spatial variation of latitude, distribution of inter-annual half-month rainfall erosivity changed more uniform, distribution curve is more wide from North to South smooth slow. The results will provide some advice for the soil erosivity assessment, agriculture and land planning in the Ten-watershed of the Yellow River regions.

For the past two years we have been implementing a program for the establishment of scientific time and frequency metrology in Brazil. The main objective of this program is to construct an atomic fountain and use it as a primary standard. As a first step toward this goal, we have constructed a /sup 133/Cs beam optically pumped conventional clock. In this paper we describe the system and the results of its evaluation. The possible limitations of our short-term stability are discussed.

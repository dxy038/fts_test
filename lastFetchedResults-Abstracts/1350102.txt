Background: Fetal color Doppler is important for evaluation of hypoxia in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) fetus. Objective: In this study we compare fetal and maternal color Doppler with blood gas analysis to detect fetal acidosis. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study we evaluated 100 hospitalized patients with IUGR for comparison of color Doppler results with arterial blood gas analysis. Results of Doppler sonography of fetus middle cerebral arteries, umbilical and uterine artery and umbilical artery ABG were studied in these neonates. Results: Mean maternal age was 28±7 years, mean gestational age was 31.79±2.59 weeks and mean growth restriction was 3±2 weeks. Resistance increasing was observed in right uterine arteries of 37 mothers. It was normal in 60 mothers. Resistance increasing was observed in left uterine arteries of 36 mothers and nuch was seen in four cases. PCO2, PO2, and pH mean were 48.41±9.50 mmHg, 26.00±12.34 mmHg, and 7.28±0.10 in the neonates respectively. Conclusion: In this study abnormal color Doppler in IUGR fetuses have no significant correlation with umbilical cord blood gas

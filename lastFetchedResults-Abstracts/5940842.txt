In this paper, we present the designed and implemented experimentation system giving on to make more complex investigations in database problems area. The objective of experiments is to evaluate methods and algorithms for improving efficiency of database systems. We concentrate on software and hardware altering methods, including indexing, joining tables, manipulations relevant to a data buffer, library and a dictionary, using RAID arrays and hard drive issues. Some results of investigations are presented and discussed.

The world today is continuously striving towards carbon neutral clean energy technology. Hence, renewable energy sources like wind power system is increasingly receiving the attention of mankind. Energy production is now no more the sole criterion to be considered when installing new megawatt (MW) range of turbines. Rather some important design parameters like structural rigidity, cost effectiveness, life cycle impact, and, above all, reduced mass come into the scenario from new installation point of view. Accordingly, these issues are followed up in this article from wind turbine design perspective. The study, at the outset, aims to establish blade and tower material selection indices on the basis of inherent structural constraints and potential design objectives. Next, it highlights entire blade and tower material selection aspects for small and large scale horizontal axis wind turbines, both for onshore and offshore application. Finally, it distinguishes advanced blade and tower materials in agreement with multiple constraint, compound objective based design optimization procedure. Findings from the study can be deployed to harness massive scale wind energy from structurally more promising, economically more competitive and environmentally more clean and green turbines.

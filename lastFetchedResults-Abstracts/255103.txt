During the last six years, National Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad has
established a semi-permanent seismological network of 5–8 broadband seismographs and 10–20
accelerographs in the Kachchh seismic zone, Gujarat with a prime objective to monitor the continued
aftershock activity of the 2001Mw 7.7 Bhuj mainshock. The reliable and accurate broadband data for the 8
October Mw 7.6 2005 Kashmir earthquake and its aftershocks from this network as well as Hyderabad
Geoscope station enabled us to estimate the group velocity dispersion characteristics and one-dimensional
regional shear velocity structure of the Peninsular India. Firstly, we measure Rayleigh-and Love-wave
group velocity dispersion curves in the period range of 8 to 35 sec and invert these curves to estimate the
crustal and upper mantle structure below the western part of Peninsular India. Our best model suggests a
two-layered crust: The upper crust is 13.8 km thick with a shear velocity (Vs) of 3.2 km/s; the
corresponding values for the lower crust are 24.9 km and 3.7 km/sec. The shear velocity for the upper
mantle is found to be 4.65 km/sec. Based on this structure, we perform a moment tensor (MT) inversion of
the bandpass (0.05–0.02 Hz) filtered seismograms of the Kashmir earthquake. The best fit is obtained for a
source located at a depth of 30 km, with a seismic moment, Mo, of 1.6 · 1027 dyne-cm, and a focal
mechanism with strike 19.5 , dip 42 , and rake 167 . The long-period magnitude (MA   Mw) of this
earthquake is estimated to be 7.31. An analysis of well-developed sPn and sSn regional crustal phases from
the bandpassed (0.02–0.25 Hz) seismograms of this earthquake at four stations in Kachchh suggests a focal
depth of 30.8 km.

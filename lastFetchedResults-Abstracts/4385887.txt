The 12th Specialist Meeting on Microwave Radiometry and Remote Sensing of the Environment (MicroRad 2012) was held at Villa Mondragone, University of Rome "Tor Vergata," near Frascati, Italy, on March 5-9, 2012. The objective of MicroRad 2012 was to provide an open forum to report and discuss recent advances in the field of microwave radiometry, particularly with application to remote sensing of the environment. The meeting was highly successful, with more than 120 attendees representing 20 countries. There were 76 oral presentations and more than 40 posters. From the papers presented at MicroRad 2012 and others submitted specifically for this special issue, 12 were selected for inclusion in the special issue. The papers were carefully peer reviewed with the usual standards of the IEEE TGRS. As is evident from the table of contents, these papers span a broad range of microwave radiometry and remote sensing applications and reflect the interest in MicroRad and the vitality of research in this area.

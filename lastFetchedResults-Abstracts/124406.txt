Background: Nausea and vomiting are considered as two common clinical complications following anesthesia and surgery. The occurrence of such complications causes the patient to be kept in recovery room and hospital for longer periods of time and also leads to electrolyte disturbances, dehydration and hemorrhage from the site of sutures.
Objective: To compare the incidence of post tubal ligation vomiting in patients following the application of two different anesthetic techniques (mask and combination of cuffed pharyngeal tube and esophageal obtorator tube).
Methods: This was a single blind, randomized clinical trial in which 122 cases as candidates for tubal ligation were studied at Qazvin Kosar hospital in 2001-2002. The subjects, all with ASA class I, were randomly divided into two groups as A and B. The anesthetic drug for induction and maintenance was similar in two groups. Ventilation of patients was carried out using masks in group A and a combination of cuffed pharyngeal tube (Tashayod tube) and a tracheal tube inserted into esophagus in group 13.
Findings: There was no statically significant difference between the incidence of vomiting among both groups with values of 23.3% and 14.5% for groups A and B, respectively When parameters such as mean age, weight and the duration of surgery were compared in two study groups, no significant difference was found, statistically.
Conclusion: The incidence of post tubal ligation vomiting in study groups following the application of two different anesthetic techniques was similar.

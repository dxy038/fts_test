Conclusion &#9632; Manual DIMA architecture design suffers from size of architectures &#9632; Current DIMA design automations handles only single design issues &#9632; Device type optimization accomplishes selection, sizing, and mapping in parallel &#9632; Multi-objective binary programming for Pareto optimal mappings on max-architecture &#9632; A reference architecture with 4 aircraft systems has been optimized &#9786; Benefit increases for automation level &#9786; Insight into relations between architecture and objectives &#9632; But&#8230; &#9786; Calculation time rises strongly with the automation level, number of objectives and architecture size &#9632; Smart cooperation of engineer and automation is proposed Outlook &#9632; What about network&#9632;

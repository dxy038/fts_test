Based on the intelligent lighting control system required for the image processing tasks, in view of the Interior illuminance distribution uniform objective of the gray-scale difference of the status quo, using image processing techniques to intelligent lighting control system, proposed for the method to evaluate an average illumination for detection, coordinate mapping method of determine the studentsÂ´ positions, using fuzzy look-up table method. In view of the lack of traditional fixed threshold segmentation algorithm and traditional genetic segmentation algorithm, this paper proposes to establish dynamic multi-threshold template segment algorithm. Experiment proved, image segmentation algorithm proposed by this paper is more reliable, better real-timeness, Stronger applicable, so it has a good practical value.

The authors studied the Doppler-broadened 11.76-&#956;m <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>3</sub> emission line optically pumped in a ring resonator by a CW CO<sub>2</sub> laser operating on the 10<e1>R</e1>(42) line. Behavior related to the optical pumping of gas Doppler-broadened lines is found and shown to be very dependent on the laser parameters. For instance, the laser emission can occur in one direction or two directions simultaneously. A local gain model based on the interaction of two laser fields with a three-level molecular system is used to clarify the emission characteristics of this laser. Basically, the two-photon or Raman process and the Rabi splitting generate a gain anisotropy and an anomalous dispersion curve. The effects lead to a different optical path for the two directions of propagation and, consequently, a simultaneous bidirectional emission with unequal emission frequency

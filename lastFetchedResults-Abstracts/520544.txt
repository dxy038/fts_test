Since esophagus cancer is among the most fatal cancers all over the world and our country has the most frequent number of patients, identification of squamous cell carcinoma associated proteins would be essential. Finding molecular markers for recognition of the disease could be beneficial for efficient and early treatment of the disease. As protein expression in cancerous cells is different from normal ones, identification of protein expression pattern could be helpful for recognition of the disease. Proteomics is a novel method for recognition of protein collection in a specific tissue. In this method 2D gel electrophoresis is performed to separate all proteins, and then spot analysis will be done through mass spectrometry and bioinformatics software would help in the recognition of proteins. In comparison to normal tissue in cancerous cells, we would have up-regulation, down-regulation, appearance or disappearance of a specific protein. So, protein extraction was performed from healthy and cancerous mucosal tissue of esophagus and all peptides were separated through 2D gel electrophoresis. After spot analysis, proteins with different expression were identified with mass spectrometry and bioinformatics. In comparison to normal tissue, 14 proteins were found to over expressed or have no expression in tumors. The main objective of this study is that proteomics is an ideal method to find the molecular basis of squamous cell carcinoma in esophageal cancer.

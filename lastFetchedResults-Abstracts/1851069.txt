SummaryObjectives
marize the current evidence for clinical, anti-tumour, and survival benefits from zoledronic acid in patients with genitourinary cancers.
s
s were identified through MEDLINE searches, review of bibliographies of relevant articles, and review of abstracts from scientific meetings.
s
patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer or renal cell carcinoma, zoledronic acid significantly delayed the onset and reduced the incidence of skeletal complications compared with placebo. Zoledronic acid is also the only bisphosphonate that has demonstrated a trend toward improved survival and delayed progression of bone lesions in patients with urologic malignancies. Furthermore, zoledronic acid reduced the incidence of pathologic fracture, a skeletal-related event known to be associated with reduced survival. Bisphosphonates have also demonstrated significant palliative benefits, and preclinical evidence indicates that bisphosphonates may have direct anti-tumour effects.
sions
onic acid is the only bisphosphonate that has demonstrated statistically significant, long-term clinical benefits through the prevention and delay of skeletal-related events in patients with metastatic prostate cancer or renal cell carcinoma.

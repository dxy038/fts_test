When confronted with a control problem for a complicated physical process, a control engineer generally follows a relatively systematic design procedure. In this paper we design an on-line controller which is able to modify and adapt the rule base of the system with just only qualitative knowledge about the plant to be controlled. In our example, the system is an helicopter, and the objective is to control the altitude of the helicopter, when the mass of the system change, or other parameters defining the helicopter has been modified.

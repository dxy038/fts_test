In this paper, two important objectives of power systems - cost of generation and system transmission losses have been considered. The multiobjective economic load dispatch (MELD) problem is formulated using constraint method. Genetic Algorithm has been used to generate the noninferior set for IEEE 5, 14 and 30 bus systems in 2D space. Target Point (TP) or the best compromise solution has been achieved by Maximization of Minimum Relative Attainments method. This method assumes that all the objectives are being minimized and seeks the solution which maximizes the minimum relative attainment by any objective of its ideal reference value relative to its worst feasible value. The TP obtained by this method has been compared with that obtained by Ideal Distance Minimization method and Surrogate Worth Tradeoff technique. It is observed that the proposed method gives encouraging results for IEEE 5 and 14 bus systems whereas Ideal Distance Minimization method is the best for IEEE 30 bus system.

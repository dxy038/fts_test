This paper reports on the design, development, and test of a compact battery-powered wireless electrocorticography (ECoG) system. The system benefits from a new design for capacitive links that allows for bidirectional data exchange between the implant unit and the external world. A stainless steel package is designed and machined to contain a rigid 8-channel microelectrode array (MEA), a main electronic board, two batteries, and a board realizing the internal side of the capacitive link. In vitro operation of the system for the recording of prerecorded ECoG data, along with its wireless bidirectional data exchange via the proposed 4-contact capacitive link was demonstrated.

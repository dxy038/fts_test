Controller parametrization is crucial for control of systems with actuator failures. Certain conditions on the controlled system are needed for a parametrization suitable for meeting a given control objective. For actuator failure compensation, it is desirable to use less restrictive conditions which mean that larger classes of systems can be candled with a fixed or adaptive compensation controller. In this paper, a minimal necessary and sufficient condition for stable plant-model output matching is derived, with analytical proof, for two actuator failure models: failures with fixed or variant values. An adaptive control scheme is developed for systems with unknown dynamics parameters and actuator failure parameters including failure values, times and patterns

A description is given of a 32*32-bit signed digit multiplier implemented with multiple-valued, bidirectional, current-mode circuits and based on two-microcomputer complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. The multiplier can perform 32-bit twoÂ´s-complement multiplication with three-stage SD full adders using a binary-tree addition scheme The effective multiplier size in the chip and the power dissipation are almost half that of the corresponding binary CMOS multiplier. The multiply time is comparable to that of the fastest binary multiplier. These results establish the effectiveness of the technology for future very large scale integration.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

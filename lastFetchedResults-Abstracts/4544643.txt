In this paper we propose an architecture of a CWUSB System to reduce the system latency in order to achieve high throughput. The performance of CWUSB devices depends more on practical implementation issues, mostly system latency, rather than the theoretical parameters. This suggests that the primary design objective should be the minimization of system latency. WiMedia Alliance and Universal Serial Bus Implementers Forum (USB-IF) are making every effort to open a market for Certified Wireless USB (CWUSB), a new wireless version of a widely known computer interface. Although WUSB is based on WiMedia Ultra Wideband (UWB) technology, which promises a maximum physical data rate of 480 Mbps, yet unfortunately, all WUSB products are known to fall short of expectations on their performance. This paper presents a solution to this issue. The performance of the proposed architecture has been compared to that of the reference architecture. We have also measured the throughputs for some applications using the proposed architecture. The results clearly show a marked improvement in the throughput.

Although contemporary literature treats efficiency and effectiveness extensively, virtually no objective understanding of both is found in architectural facilities space planning and design. It is imperative that both concepts are definitively explained as they apply to these disciplines. Hence, the contemporary views of both concepts are reviewed and attempts made to interpret them within more amenable contexts. The objectives are (1) to objectively elucidate the factual differences between efficiency and effectiveness; and (2) to contribute to their better understanding in architectural facilities space planning and design. Diagrammatic and mathematical means are engaged to demonstrate efficiency and effectiveness in these fields.

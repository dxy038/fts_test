Background: Accurate measurement of the exercise tolerance of cardiac patients prior to, and upon completion of a cardiac rehabilitation program using an objective measure is important. The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of an endurance and resistance exercise training program on physical capacity, blood pressure, heart rate and myocardial oxygen consumption in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.
Materials and Methods: In this case- control study, 31 patients (21 men and 10 women, mean age 54.45±7.8) who were participating in the recovery phase II cardiac rehabilitation program and 15 patients (9 men and 6 women mean age 55.35±5.7) were assigned to the control group. Exercise program consisted of endurance and resistance exercise with duration of 60 min/session and frequency of 3 sessions/ week for 2 months and dietitian and psychiatric counseling.
 Results: After rehabilitation, the case group demonstrated significant improvements in exercise test time, maximum systolic blood pressure, maximum heart rate and rate pressure product (p <  0.001). On the other hands, the case group demonstrated significant decreasing in rest heart rate, rest systolic blood pressure (p <  0.001). There were no changes in any variables for control group.
Conclusion: Cardiac rehabilitation program is effective in promoting an early improvement in exercise capacity, RPP, HRR in patients undergoing CABG. Moreover, it induces significant decreasing in rest systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

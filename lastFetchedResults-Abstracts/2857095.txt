This study proposes a new Multi-Stage Fuzzy Stabilizer (MSFS) in order to damp low-frequency oscillations in multi-machine power systems. The proposed MSFS is tuned by Modified Honey-Bee Mating Optimization (MHBMO) method which improves the local and global exploration of the standard HBMO method by changing the queenÂ´s speed reduction coefficient with a new parameter adjustment process. The objective functions are defined as time-domain and eigenvalue-based functions which are optimized by the MHBMO method. The obtained results on New England 10-machine 39-bus test system show the good performance of the suggested MHBMO-tuned MSFS.

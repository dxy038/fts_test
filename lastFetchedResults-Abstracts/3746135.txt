The paper deals with the robust fault detection problem for a class of discrete-time linear Markovian jump systems with an unknown input. By using a general observer-based fault detection filter as residual generator, the robust fault detection filter design is formulated as an H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-filtering problem, in which the filter matrices are dependent on the system mode, i.e. the residual generator is a Markovian jump linear system as well. The main objective is to make the error between residual and fault (or, more generally, weighted fault) as small as possible. A sufficient condition to solve this problem is established in terms of the feasibility of certain linear matrix inequalities (LMI), which can be solved with the aid of Matlab LMI Toolbox. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

IEEE Standard 317-1976; "Electric Penetration Assemblies in containment structures for Nuclear. Power Generating Stations", Revision 2 of the Standard first published in 1971 represents a significant step forward in the standardization of electric penetration assembly design, qualification, and application. This paper explains some of the whys and wherefores of electric penetrations; reviews the current Standard; and provides an insight into the ongoing work, and problems, of Subcommittee SC-1.1 in arriving at its ultimate objective of providing a true working standard.

An extension of the scope of the chemoenzymatic strategy for the synthesis of stereochemically pure pyranose deoxy sugar esters of different carboxylic acids has been achieved. The objective of the work was to extend the strategy to the synthesis of furanose deoxy sugar derivatives and additionally, to N-Boc-protected amino acid esters. With all used carboxylic acids (deoxycholic acid, Î±-methoxyphenylacetic acid, N-Boc-l-phenylalanine and N-Boc-l-tyrosine) the lipase-catalyzed stereoselective acetylation of furanose or pyranose hemiacetal moiety as a key step afforded one desired stereochemically pure acetylated hemiacetal deoxy sugar ester in high de.

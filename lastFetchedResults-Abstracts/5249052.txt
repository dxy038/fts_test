As one way of collaboration, many manufacturing enterprises are outsourcing production tasks to their partners to cope with varied market demand or keep core competition. In this paper, we present a three-layered collaborative production planning model in supply chain environment according to the characteristics of the production planning. The proposed model has a dominant enterprise and multi collaborative enterprises, and the object of the model is to develop a collaborative outsourcing manufacturing chain through bidirectional selection among dominant enterprise and collaborative enterprises. Each layer of the model is described in detail and the production tasks assigned process of resource plan coordination layer of this model is simulated with numerical experiments.

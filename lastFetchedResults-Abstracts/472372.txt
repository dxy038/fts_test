The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine the relationship between hyperandrogenemia and blood pressure in women with menstrual irregularities seen at an endocrinology clinic. Women with serum testosterone levels (T) ≥ 30 ng/dL were more likely to have general obesity (odds ratio [OR] = 6.8, 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 2.2–27.2) and central obesity (OR = 14.5, 95% CI = 6.1–38.7) than euandrogenemic women. Hyperandrogenemic women (HA) had an OR of 2.4 (95% CI = 1.0–6.2) for elevated SBP and an OR of 2.7 (95% CI = 0.8–8.8) for elevated DBP, independent of age and ovulatory status. Obese HA had an OR of 4.7 (95% CI = 2.3–10.4) for elevated SBP and an OR of 2.9 (95% CI = 1.9–9.9) for elevated DBP. In conclusion, T is associated with an increased risk for obesity and central adiposity. T predicts BP elevation independent of age and ovulatory status. There was a synergistic relationship between obesity and androgens in their affect on BP.

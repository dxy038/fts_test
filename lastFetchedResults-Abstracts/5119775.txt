Conical spiral antennas were first developed by Dyson (1959, 1965) using empirical results. No analytical/numerical analysis has been performed to date for the full model with expanding arm width. The only numerical analysis has been by the method of moments (MoM) for the thin-wire conical spiral antenna which is not truly frequency independent. The objective of this paper is to analyze this antenna using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. A parametric study is used to improve upon the available design base. Various design parameters of the conical spiral antenna are provided as a function of the antenna geometry to supplement DysonÂ´s experimental results.

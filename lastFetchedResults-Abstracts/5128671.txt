Callus culture of Elaeagnus angustifolia was established with the objective to produce proanthocyanidins. The effects of different conditions on the callus growth and the production of proanthocyanidins were researched. The leaf tissue part of Elaeagnus angustifolia was optimum explant of callus induction. The best callus growth and the highest proanthocyanidins production was obtained under the culture on MS basal medium containing 4.50 mumol-L<sup>-1</sup> 2, 4-D and 2.20 mumol-L<sup>-1</sup> BA. The optimum time of subculture was 20-25 d. The content of proanthocyanidins in callus was up to 56.25 mg-g<sup>-1</sup> DW. Callus bud differentiation exhibited a negative correlation with proanthocyanins accumulation, UV-B radiation had remarkable promoting effects on the accumulation of proanthocyanidins in the callus of Elaeagnus angustifolia.

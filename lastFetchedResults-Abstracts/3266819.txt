This paper proposes an optimal PMU placement (OPP) model to make power system observable for normal operation condition as well as controlled islanding scenario. The optimization objective of proposed model is to minimize the number of installed PMUs and then maximize the measurement redundancy. To take advantage of the power network topology, the effect of zero-injection bus is incorporated into the model. Furthermore, additional observability constraints for single PMU or line loss are also derived. At last, test results on IEEE 118-bus system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

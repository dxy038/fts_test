Many control system designs are challenging for two reasons in particular. Firstly, there are multiple performance requirements to be satisfied; secondly, the systems are made up of subsystems that may interact. Conventional engineering process follows a bottom-up approach, where the subsystem controllers are designed independently, and then assembled. Unaccounted for interactions are then handled by ad-hoc troubleshooting methods, which may compromise the original design specifications. In this paper, we present a new method for multiple-objective controller design of systems with undesirable one-way coupling. By choosing a block triangular controller structure to match that of the plant, the subsystems can be designed separately. Having designed these, an additional controller is designed to limit the effects of coupling between the subsystems.

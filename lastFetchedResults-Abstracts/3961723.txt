Describes the AMICE project itself, its development environment, overall CIM-OSA content results and status of the work. Being an ESPRIT project with 20 European industrial and research partners, the development work is carried out in a Europe-wide co-operative and distributed mode of operation. An open architecture for CIM is a much needed, but certainly ambitious, undertaking. Nevertheless, the work has resulted in an enterprise modelling concept for identifying and describing enterprise structure and enterprise-wide information needs, as well as the definition of an integrating infrastructure which enables operation in heterogeneous manufacturing and information technology environments. The development work is continuing with the next objective to release a first version of CIM-OSA (CIM-OSA Release 1) supporting enterprise wide information integration, including guidelines for migration of current applications in manufacturing enterprises

The paper deals with the reactive power control in a MV distribution system in presence of Dispersed Generation (DG). The control variables are the reactive powers of DG units and capacitors, and the tap position of the on-load tap changer of the HV/MV transformer. Single-objective and multi-objective optimization problems are formulated and solved in order to achieve the optimal control, even containing the impact of the waveform distortions. Numerical applications performed on a 109-bus test distribution system give evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.

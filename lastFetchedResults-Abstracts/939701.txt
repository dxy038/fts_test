Improperly disposed of dredged sediments contaminated with metals may induce long-term leaching and an increase of
metal concentrations in ground waters and vegetal cover plants. The objective of the study was to quantify the sediment-to-plant
transfer of Cu, Pb, Hg and Zn with a particular focus on the pathway of Hg and to determine whether the establishment of
vegetal cover modifies the metal availability. A pot experiment with rape (Brassica napus), cabbage (Brassica oleraccea) and
red fescue (Festuca rubra) was set up using a sediment first spiked with the radioisotope 203Hg.
Zinc concentrations (197–543 mg kg 1 DM) in leaves were higher than Cu concentration (197–543 mg kg 1 DM), Pb
concentration (2.3–2.6 mg kg 1 DM) and Hg concentration (0.9–1.7 mg kg 1 DM). Leaves-to-sediment ratios decreased as
follows: ZnNCuNHgNPb. According to Ti measurements, metal contamination by dry deposition was less than 1%. Mercury
concentration in plant leaves was higher than European and French thresholds. Foliar absorption of volatile Hg was a major
pathway for Hg contamination with a root absorption of Hg higher in rape than in cabbage and red fescue.
Growth of each species increased Cu solubility. Zinc solubility was increased only in the presence of rape. The highest
increase of Cu solubility was observed for red fescue whereas this species largely decreased Zn solubility. Dissolved organic
carbon (DOC) measurements suggested that Cu solubilisation could result from organic matter or release of natural plant
exudates. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) measures suggested that the high Zn solubility in the presence of rape could
originate from a generation of acidity in rape rhizosphere and a subsequent dissolution of calcium carbonates.
Consequently, emission of volatile Hg from contaminated dredged sediments and also the potential increase of metal
solubility by a vegetal cover of grass when used in phytostabilisation must be taken into account by decision makers

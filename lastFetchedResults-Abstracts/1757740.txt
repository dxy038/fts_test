AbstractBackground and objective
ity may be associated with greater systemic inflammation. However, contradictory evidence exists. Certain individuals or dimensions of hostility may be more susceptible to these effects. Main and interactive effects of hostility with sex and/or age were evaluated on markers of inflammation, independently of traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease.
s
althy men (81) and women (118), aged 20–64 years (M = 41 ± 11 years) were recruited. Hostility was assessed using the Cook–Medley Hostility Inventory (CMHo) and ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of quarrelsome behavior and angry affect in daily living. Blood samples were drawn to measure inflammatory activity (Il-6, TNF-α, hsCRP, Il-8, Il-10, Il-18, MCP-1) and lipid oxidation (Myeloperoxidase; MPO). Correlations and hierarchical regression analyses were performed controlling for pertinent behavioral, psychological, medical, and socio-demographic factors.
s
icant univariate associations emerged between CMHo and Il-6, TNF-α, MCP-1 (p &lt; .05). Hierarchical regressions showed interactions of hostility with sex (Il-6, TNF-α; p &lt; .05) and age (hsCRP, Il-6, TNF-α; p &lt; .05). For example, in simple slope analyses, hostility was positively related to TNF-α in women (b = 0.009, p = 0.006) but not men. Greater hostility was also related to greater Il-6 levels among younger women (b = . 027, p = 0.000).
sion
ity, particularly cynical hostility, may be detrimental to (younger) women. The TNF-α, Il-6, CRP triad appears vulnerable to psychological and behavioral factors, and may be one mechanism by which cynical hostility (CMHo) contributes to increased cardiovascular risk in women. Prospective research is needed to verify this.

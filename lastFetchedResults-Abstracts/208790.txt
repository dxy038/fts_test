moderate and severe on the basis of a verbal multidimensional scoring system. Subjects were
randomly assigned into three groups: The first group (N=36) received placebo, the second
group (N=36) received the essence of Zataria multiflora 1% and the third group (N=36)
received the essence of Zataria multiflora 2%. The trial medicines were administered as soon
as pain feeling (25 drops q 4h orally). Subjects evaluated for 3 cycles. Intensity of pain was

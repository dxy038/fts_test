The main objective of designing this robot is simply to facilitate the farmers in the future for agriculture purposes. In the present scenario, there are many recent developments in the field of robotics and agriculture on a large scale. In this paper we are using both the technologies. The methodology used in this paper is DTMF (Dual Tone Multi-Frequency). Our robot is controlled by a cell phone, through this we can make our machine communicate on a large scale over a large distance. This will help the farmer to control his agricultural works from a far distance without going in the field with an easy control. This robot has a number of advantages as well as important features such as automatic avoiding obstacles in its way, automatics metal detection in its way. It can sense soil moisture according to which the machine will irrigate the field. It can also sow seeds in the field, remove the compost from the field as well as can control the pests with spraying facility as per the commands given by the farmer. As a result, This machine can also be used to reach the places where farmers make harder efforts for farming such as hill areas, mountains etc. where land is not plane. This is how we can use this robot in different fields as well as for research purpose by further manipulation in programming it can be modified accordingly.

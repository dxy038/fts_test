We consider a generalization of the classical MAX-CUT problem where two objective functions are simultaneously considered. We derive some theorems on the existence and the non-existence of feasible cuts that are at the same time near optimal for both criteria. Furthermore, two approximation algorithms with performance guarantee are presented. The first one is deterministic while the second one is randomized. A generalization of these results is given for the bi-criteria MAX-k-CUT problem.

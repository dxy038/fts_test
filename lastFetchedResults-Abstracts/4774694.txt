The performance improvement of radiation diagnosis devices makes it possible to get detailed medical images. The objective of this research is to develop a computer aided diagnosis system that uses advanced information of images for various kinds of internal organs and diseases. In order to make the computer aided diagnosis system do the work, as it must presume position of internal organs, the spine is used as a landmark of positional presumption. The position of each spine is recognized from the CT data, and the lungs area is extracted based on the result. We think it possible for the computer aided diagnosis system to inform radiologists about abnormality regions when the image data processing algorithm about several organs is integrated with positional presumption of organs in the future

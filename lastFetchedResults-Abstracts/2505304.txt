<p style="text-align: justify;">Primary tuberculosis of the breast is a rare disease. It usually occurs in female of reproductive age. Any form of tuberculosis mastitis may present with feature of malignancy. Diagnosis is mainly based on identification of tubercle bacilli. We report a 42-year-old woman with primary tuberculosis abscess of the breast, who underwent surgical resection. Fine needle biopsy failed to achieve specific diagnosis before surgical operation. She responded to anti-TB therapy postoperatively. In endemic area, tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of breast tumors.</p>

<p><strong>Objective: </strong>The determinants of satisfaction of life (SWL) are poorly described among Iranian employed ‎nurses. This study aimed to assess the effect of various factors including age, gender, marital ‎status, depression, anxiety and stress on SWL among Iranian nurses.‎<br /><strong>Method:</strong> Employed nurses in three teaching hospitals were invited to participate in this study. Ninety-four ‎nurses (65 women and 29 men) participated in this study. Depression, anxiety, stress scale ‎‎ (DASS-21) was used to measure the related variables. Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) was ‎used to assess SWL. Multivariate analysis was utilized to examine the relationship between ‎multiple variables. <br /><strong>Results:</strong> A noticeable proportion of Iranian employed nurses were either dissatisfied or extremely ‎dissatisfied with life (45%). Severe depression was related to lower scores of SWLS (P: 0.001, r ‎‎= -0.32). The similar outcomes were detected between anxiety and stress scales, and SWLS (P: ‎‎0.023, r = -0.23 and P: 0.008, r = -0.27 for anxiety and stress, respectively). Although females ‎were more vulnerable to depression (P: 0.010) and stress (P: 0.013), the overall effect of gender ‎on SWL was insignificant (0.41). Satisfactions with financial power and work environment were ‎associated with higher scores of SWLS (P: 0.030 and 0.042, respectively). Marital status was not ‎related to severity of depression, anxiety, stress and SWLS (P: 0.39, 0.38, 0.80, and 0.61, ‎respectively). ‎<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study revealed that poor satisfaction with financial status and work environment, ‎depression, anxiety and stress are the major determinants of satisfaction with life among Iranian ‎employed nurses.‎</p>

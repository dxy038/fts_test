The objective of this work is to improve the properties of NRâ€“SBR type rubber that is frequently used in automotive tyres, using nanoclays additions. Low weight (1 wt.%, 2 wt.% and 3 wt.%) percentages of nanoclays were filled in rubber matrix using either a laboratory type Banbury mixer or a two roll mixer. The structural characterization that was carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the curing characteristics of nanocomposites shows that the formation of an exfoliated structure is dependable on curing time and clay concentration. The structural effect of nanocomposites on tensile, hardness, tear strength and thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) is examined and the outcome of these results is discussed in this paper.

The objective of this work was to study the effect of temperature abuses on the colour and vitamin C content of a new frozen vegetable, watercress (Nasturtium officinale R. Br.).

The vitamin C content, expressed as ascorbic (AA) and dehydroascorbic (DHAA) acids, and colour, expressed in the Hunter Lab parameters, were evaluated along a plan of temperature abuses, based on a real situation for a four month frozen storage period. A comparison between the hue angle and AA experimental data and prediction models, using kinetic parameters determined under isothermal conditions, was also run.

The colour showed some variation, namely on the parameters L, a, TCD (Total Colour Difference) and hue angle. Although, during the temperature abuses, some fluctuation was observed, no vitamin C degradation or major colour changes occurred. A zero-order and a first-order prediction models fitted well the experimental data for the hue angle and AA behaviour with temperature abuses, respectively. In general, the frozen watercress colour and vitamin C content were not impaired by the imposed temperature abuses. This work will help to predict and understand the sensory and nutritional quality changes of frozen watercress that might occur during frozen storage and distribution in the cold chain under the used conditions.

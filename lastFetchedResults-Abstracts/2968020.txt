The objective of this survey paper is to review the main methodologies used in the development of models and in the design of controllers for irrigation canal systems. These systems are characterized by time delays, nonlinear features, strong unknown perturbations, and interactions among subsystems. Although a large part of these developments are still at the research stage, more and more of these techniques have successful field implementations

At present, electronic control is an important direction in the field of diesel research. According to the present application status, we dissertation select the electronic unit pump with the timing-control mode as the objective system. In the system the relationships between the temporal quantities and the angle are analyzed with angle to time conversion based on the momentary transient speed, which is estimated using adjacent cycle recursion and self-adapting parameter methods. The unit-pump need more strictly in the performance on the real-time, so we use double CPU structure in the system. We test the system on the electronic unit pump test bench. The results show that the system runs steadily. The system can satisfy the electronic fuel injection system, and lay the foundation for development of the whole locomotive.

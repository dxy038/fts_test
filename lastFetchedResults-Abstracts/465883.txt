Objective: Esophageal atresia may be diagnosed prenatally by ultrasonographic visualization of the blind-ending esophagus during fetal swallowing, which is referred to as the pouch sign. Our purpose was to determine whether this sign can be used to predict outcomes of affected fetuses. Study Design: Four cases of esophageal atresia diagnosed in our center during the past 2 years were analyzed, in conjunction with 3 cases from published series. Ultrasonographic features of the pouch sign were categorized according to localization. Results: In the neck pouch group (n = 3) 1 fetus died in utero and 1 died before a corrective operation could be undertaken. In the only fetus of this group to survive a staged repair was necessary because of a long atretic gap. Conversely, 3 of the 4 fetuses with a mediastinal pouch survived after a successful corrective operation, and primary repair was possible in all cases. Conclusions: The base of the proximal blind-ending esophagus can be clearly localized by means of ultrasonography. Our data suggest that a neck pouch may be associated with an adverse outcome. This information may be useful in counseling parents when esophageal atresia is diagnosed prenatally. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;182:978-81.)

This paper emphasizes on the small-signal behavior and stability analysis of bidirectional DC to DC converter. The bidirectional current capability of the switch eliminates the discontinuous conduction mode which leads to a simple analytic description of the switching converter. The small-signal model is considered to design the control parameters. The transient, stability analyses and closed loop regulation have been studied extensively. The closed loop model has also been developed and simulated using Matlab/Simulink environment. The closed loop performances of the converter are evaluated for wide range of load conditions.

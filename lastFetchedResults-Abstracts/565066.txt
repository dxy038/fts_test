This paper proposed to apply fuzzy sets and approximate reasonings to evaluate the weapons system. The objective of the study is to determine the ranking of the weapons system in a subjective environment. The proposed model based on fuzzy sets has initiated the idea of membership set score value evaluation of each criterion alternative. This enables the inclusion of requirements which are incomplete and imprecise. The approximate reasonings of the method allows the decision maker to make the best choice in accordance to human thinking and reasoning processes. The proposed model is based on fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making that consists of fuzzy rules. The use of fuzzy rules, which are extracted directly from input data in making evaluation, contributes to a better decision in selecting the best choice and is less dependent on the domain of expert. The dataset from previous research was used to validate the fuzzy evaluation model. Results from numerical examples are comparable to other fuzzy evaluation approaches. Copyright Â© 2005

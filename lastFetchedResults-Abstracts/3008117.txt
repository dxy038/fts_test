This paper is divided into four sections. The first section discusses Flexible Assembly Cell (FAC) programming requirements. Sections 2 and 3 present an approach to FAC modelling and programming. The intended objective is to build a programming and decisional environment which allows construction of assembly applications, and to endow the on-line system with decision-making capabilities. The last section describes the current state of an actual system which is a first approach to meeting the discussed requirements.

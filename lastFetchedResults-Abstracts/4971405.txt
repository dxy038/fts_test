In the paper, a new approach for the design of 2D linear-phase FIR notch filters is proposed. This approach is based on the equiripple error criterion. The notch filter design problem is transformed into an equivalent constrained optimization problem. The filter coefficients vector is defined and a suitable objective function is introduced. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. A comparison with the least-squared design is also included.

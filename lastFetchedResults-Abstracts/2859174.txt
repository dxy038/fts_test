The model composition provides support to build systems based on a set of less complex sub-models. This operation allows managing complexity while supporting the modularity and reusability tasks. Due to the increase number of the involving models, their composition becomes a tedious task. For that, the need for maintaining traceability information is raised to help managing the composition operation. We propose in this work a graph-based model transformations approach, which aims to keep track of the model composition operation. Our objective is to capture traces in an automatic and reusable manner. Finally, a composition scenario is given to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal.

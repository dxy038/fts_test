The conception of oriented-process tolerance allocation has been presented to improve the limitation of traditional tolerance research. Oriented-process tolerance allocation means that product can be gained at the minimum cost by allocating the optimization tolerance of process parameters. Based on error transmit model, the relations of tolerance and error and process degradation model, the relation between process parameters and product quality has been obtained. Then, the objective optimization function and procedure have been acquired. Finally, the manufacturing process of car redirector has been illustrated.

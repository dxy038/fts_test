In the area of KarnaveShirinKalat, water leakage for agriculture and drinking purposes has created crisis conditions for this district. This problem has resulted in vast migration of the villagers to adjacent towns. Karnavesubterranean canals  is the main source of water for agriculture and livestock. In the past, these subterranean canals had a high discharge rate and was the main source for agriculture and domestic water. However, in recent years it has a very low discharge rate. This study showed that agronomists and shepherds of the area have an annual watershortage of about 126000 cubic meters. Thus, the main objective of this study isto investigate the possibility of harvesting waterby constructing underground dams in the KarnaveShirine area. The result of technical (including geology, groundwater and engineering geology) and socio-economic studies showed that in the KarnaveShirin area there is a narrow valley that is a suitable place for constructing an underground dam. Thus, at least 95000 cubic meters of water with a high quality can be harvested in alluvial deposits for agricultural and livestock usage. In this manner, by harvesting subsurface water, the annual net total income of agronomists and shepherds in this area has increased about 850 Million Rials.

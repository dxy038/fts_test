In this paper, a multi-modular linear switched reluctance actuator (LSRA) is proposed in the active suspension application for its robust structure and fast dynamic response. In order to meet the requirements by active suspension system, a design optimization method, which aims to improve the average force, reduce the force ripple and increase the force density, is described in details. Based on the preliminary design of LSRA, the stator pole width and translator pole width are selected as the optimization variables. Constraints on both pole widths are then discussed by considering the feasible triangle of LSRA and suspension volume limitation. Furthermore, the effects of both pole widths on average force, force ripple and force density are analyzed. Optimization results under various weight factor combinations are obtained and demonstrated by comparing the value of optimization objective function.

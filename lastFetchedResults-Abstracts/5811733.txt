The Technical University of Berlin has the objective to develop such components, which are not available yet. The first device under development is the so called "micro wheel", which is designed to be used in pico satellites, allowing a precise 3-axis attitude stabilization. The verification of these wheels in space will be done by BEESAT, the first pico satellite of TU Berlin. The main objective of BeeSat is the on orbit verification of newly developed micro wheels for pico satellite applications. These wheels, with the size of a one Euro coin in diameter, supported by DLR (FKZ 50JR0552) and developed in cooperation with Astro-und Feinwerktechnik, will drastically improve the actuation capabilities of pico satellites.

Optimal efficiency control of synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) is very important in the sense of energy saving and conservation of natural environment because the efficiency of the SynRM is generally lower than that of other types of AC motors. This paper is proposed a novel efficiency optimization control of SynRM considering iron loss using multi adaptive fuzzy learning controller (AFLC). The optimal current ratio between torque current and exciting current is analytically derived to drive SynRM at maximum efficiency. This paper is proposed an efficiency optimization control for the SynRM which minimizes the copper and iron losses. There exists a variety of combinations of and d-axis current which provide a specific motor torque. The objective of the efficiency optimization control is to seek a combination of and -axis current components, which provides minimum losses at a certain operating point in steady state. The control performance of the proposed controller is evaluated by analysis for various operating conditions. Analysis results are presented to show the validity of the proposed algorithm.

Presence of the distributed generation (DG) in electric systems can represent a significant impact on the operational characteristics of distribution networks. The optimal placement and sizing of generation units on the distribution network has been continuously studied in order to achieve different aims. In this paper our aim would be optimal distributed generation allocation for voltage profile improvement, loss and Total harmonic Distortion (THD) reduction in distribution network. Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) was used as the solving tool, which referring two determined aim; the problem is defined and objective function is introduced according to losses, security and THD indices. The applied fast harmonic load flow method is based on the equivalent current injection that uses the bus-injection to branch-current (BIBC) and branch-current to bus-voltage (BCBV) matrices which were developed based on the topological structure of the distribution systems. This method is executed on 12 bus harmonic unbalanced distribution system and show robustness of this method in optimal and fast placement of DG, efficiency for improvement of voltage profile, reduction of power losses, and THD.

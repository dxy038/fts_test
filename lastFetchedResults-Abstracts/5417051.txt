AC-to-DC converters based on one-cycle control (OCC) exhibit instability in current control when operating in the inverting mode. A modified OCC based controller has been presented in literature which overcomes the above-mentioned limitation. But, it needs to sense instantaneous phase voltages to generate fictitious current components. In an effort to dispense with the voltage sensors of the modified OCC based bidirectional converter, a new voltage sensorless one cycle controlled bidirectional ac to dc converter is proposed in this paper which utilizes instantaneous power and phase voltage estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated through detailed simulation studies.

The use of new multifunctional material systems with integrated actuators and sensors combined with new control concepts has paved the way for active structures which can adapt their properties due to changing objective functions such as their geometry, stiffness or external loads. In the paper, the requirements and a new actuation system for changing the geometry of the airfoil of a fixed wing aircraft with shape memory alloys are discussed. This new actuation system is a system with distributed actuators which lead to new questions for the placement of sensors and suitable control concepts. Some results of experimental tests are presented. They provide a first feasibility proof of the concept and encourage further work.

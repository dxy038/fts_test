Objective The aim of this study was to
compare psychosocial adaptation in adolescent (first
generation) migrants, double-citizens (mainly second
generation with one migrant parent), and native
Swiss, and to compare migrants from various European
regions. Method Data from a community survey
were based on 1,239 participants (mean age 13.8,
SD = 1.6 years) with 996 natives, 55 double-citizens,
and 188 migrants. The adolescents completed
the youth self-report measuring emotional and
behavioural problems, and various questionnaires
addressing life events, personality variables, perceived
parental behaviour (PPB), family functioning, school
environment, and social network. Results Adolescent
migrants had significantly higher scores for internalizing
and externalizing problems. There was a pattern
of various unfavourable psychosocial features
including life events, coping, self-related cognitions,
and PPB that was more common among adolescent
migrants than natives. Double-citizens were similar to
natives in all domains. Young adolescents from South
and South-East Europe differed from natives in terms
of more unfavourable psychosocial features. Migrant
status was best predicted by adverse psychosocial
features rather than emotional and behavioural
problems. Conclusion There is some indication that
certain migrant adolescents are at risk of psychosocial
mal-adaptation. Obviously, ethnic origin is an
important moderator

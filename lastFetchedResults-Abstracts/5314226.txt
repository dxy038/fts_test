Fluvial transport is getting a strong position as a good way of transport in certain Europeans countries as Belgium, Holland, France, etc. Therefore, fluvial ports are very interested in getting better structures and operational methods in order to improve their service to companies. In these days, of increasing fluvial traffic, a fast berthing time would be crucial in terms of a good service quality. Berthing time consists on the time to load and unload a ship. In this process, a minimum of container relocation movements would be needed to achieve this objective. This study aims to design a real time tool to store containers in the storage yard with the minimum expected relocation movements.

An important objective of tactical ad hoc networks is to deliver threat information from sensors to shooters efficiently and quickly. The information sent to a particular shooter should contain warnings about threats that are within some distance and/or within some time of the shooterÂ´s current location. In this paper we develop a novel multicast model that distributes this form of threat information in a message efficient manner. We present results from detailed simulations that demonstrate the efficiency of our protocol and discuss the scalability of this model to larger networks

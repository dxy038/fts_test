In this case study the introduction of computer-aided design (CAD) in an engineering company was analyzed. The process of change as well as repercussions of the new technology on work organization and communication patterns within the company were studied. The designers has received the new technology favorably and were even impatient about the pace of change. As the development of the system was limited to a small group close to the design management, the introduction had less than desirable effects on the work situation of the designers and on the cooperation with other functions that was envisaged in the planned CAD/CAM step. The study confirms that CAD, as such, will have little effect on a bureaucratic organization unless such a change is included as an explicit objective. For a full utilization of any new technology a joint forum for outlining a strategy is needed

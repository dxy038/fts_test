This paper provides an overview of the intra coding techniques in the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard being developed by the Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC). The intra coding framework of HEVC follows that of traditional hybrid codecs and is built on spatial sample prediction followed by transform coding and postprocessing steps. Novel features contributing to the increased compression efficiency include a quadtree-based variable block size coding structure, block-size agnostic angular and planar prediction, adaptive pre- and postfiltering, and prediction direction-based transform coefficient scanning. This paper discusses the design principles applied during the development of the new intra coding methods and analyzes the compression performance of the individual tools. Computational complexity of the introduced intra prediction algorithms is analyzed both by deriving operational cycle counts and benchmarking an optimized implementation. Using objective metrics, the bitrate reduction provided by the HEVC intra coding over the H.264/advanced video coding reference is reported to be 22% on average and up to 36%. Significant subjective picture quality improvements are also reported when comparing the resulting pictures at fixed bitrate.

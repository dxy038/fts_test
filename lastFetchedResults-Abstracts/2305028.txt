Cadmium (Cd) is one of the heavy metals that impose oxidative stress in plants. Application of plant growth regulators, such as salicylic acid (SA) has been suggested as an option for mitigation of toxic effects of Cd on plant growth. The objective of this study was to investigate the interaction of Cd and SA on leaf antioxidant enzyme activity, soluble proteins and malondialdehyde of safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L. cv. Soffe). This pot experiment was carried out as factorial based on CRD with four replications in 2012 in Yasouj University. The treatments included four levels of cadmium nitrate (0, 25, 50 and 100 mg kg-1 soil) and three levels of foliar application of SA (0, 0.5 and 1 mM). Results showed that increasing Cd levels significantly decreased protein contents, but increased catalase, proxidase, polyphenol oxidase and superoxide dismutase activity and malondyaldehyd content significantly. Salicylic acid application inversed the measured enzyme activity trend progressively. SA mitigated the detrimental effects of Cd and improved the physiological response of safflower under Cd stress.

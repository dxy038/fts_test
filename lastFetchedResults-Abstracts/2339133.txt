Objective
Seizures are the most common pediatric neurologic problem. Research of the
association between iron deficiency and seizures has shown conflicting results.
This study evaluates iron status of children with a first seizure attack (febrile
seizure (FS) or first unprovoked afebrile seizure (FUS) and healthy control
group.
Materials & Methods
In a cross sectional case control study, iron status of 6–60 month year old
admitted children with first seizure to Shahid Sadoughi Hospital from August
2011–December 2012 were evaluated and compared with healthy control
children that were referred to primary health care center of Azadshar, Yazd, Iran.
Results
150 children were compared in three equal (FS, afebrile seizure, and control)
groups.
Hemoglobin levels in FUS (11.39 ± 1.07 g/dl) and FS (11.46 ± 1.18 g/dl) were
lower than the control group (11.9 ± 0.89 g/dl) group.
Serum iron levels in FS (38.52 ± 11.38 ?g/dL) and FUS (42.68 ± 14.76 ?g/dL)
were lower than the control group (54.32 ± 13.46 ?g/dL).
Serum ferritin level in FUS (46.21 ± 27.63 ng/mL) and FS (48.91 ± 22.96 ng/
mL) was lower than the control group (75.13 ± 35.57 ng/mL).
Iron deficiency (48% in FS, 44% in FUS and 28% in control group) and iron
deficiency anemia (26% in FUS, 22% in FS, and 10% in healthy children) was
more frequent in children with seizures.
Conclusion
Iron status should be evaluated in children with a first attack of febrile or afebrile
seizures.

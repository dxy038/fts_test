This paper presents the results of the propagation measurements performed in the centre of Athens for the complete characterisation of channel behaviour. The objective of the measurement campaign is to derive a prediction model for the path loss estimation for a microcell environment. For all types of measurements the variation of signal strength with distance was recorded for comparison with models extracted using ray tracing techniques. Some preliminary results were obtained and integrated using additional rays option for accurate path loss estimation. The paper also describes the conclusions of the comparison between theoretical and experimental results

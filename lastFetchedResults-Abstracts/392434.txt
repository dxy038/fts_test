Objective: To describe a new treatment modality of hypopharyngeal cancer consisting of total laryngectomy plus partial pharyngectomy (TLPP) conserving the posterior wall of the pharynx vertically for voice restoration. Methods: Review of hospital charts, TLPP was undertaken in 15 of 54 patients. Surgical modalities of reconstruction subsequent to TLPP were indicated on the basis of the width of posterior pharyngeal wall conserved during surgery. Posterior pharyngeal walls of width 3 cm or larger were sutured in primary closure. If the width of posterior wall was less than 3 cm, a free forearm flap or free jejunal flap was patched to the wall. Tracheo-esophageal shunt with a voice prosthesis was performed 3 weeks after surgery. Results: The Kaplanâ€“Meier method indicated no difference in survival rate between patients with TLPP (46.4%) and the remaining patients (47.4%). Nine of 15 patients with TLPP (two patients with primary closure, three with free forearm flap, and four with free jejunal flap) were examined for voice restoration and fluoroscopy of the neopharynx. Eight of the nine patients, in whom more than 2 cm of the posterior pharyngeal wall had been conserved, demonstrated a good speech rating, maximum phonation time and neoglottic formation by the posterior pharyngeal wall. Conclusion: The combination of conservation of the posterior pharyngeal wall, patch graft and a voice prosthesis is a useful method that offers sufficient quality of phonation without deterioration of survival rate for patients with hypopharyngeal cancer.

It is important to make the inter-city passenger train operation plan and ticket price, for both transport enterprise and passenger. At present, the researches relating to both are also carried out solely. And only is considered the benefit of rail transport enterprise in the decision-making process. Aiming at this problem, the characteristics of inter-city railway passenger transportation is analyzed and the conclusion is drawn that the main factors affecting passenger flow are inter-city passenger operation plan and ticket price in the future. That how to maximize the profit of both rail transport enterprise and utility value of inter-city rail transportation is regarded as optimization objective. A multi-objective model is build through which the inter-city passenger train operation plan and ticket price is determined.

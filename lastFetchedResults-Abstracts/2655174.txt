Introduction: Seizure is one of the complications of stroke that occurs early and late after stroke. If it leads to brain hypoxia, it aggrevates the patient’s condition. Determination of its frequency and risk factors helps predict its occurance and respective precaution in stroke patients
Objective: Determination of the frequency and risk factors of post-stroke seizure.
Materials and Methods: This comparitive cross-sectional study was carried out on 1256 stroke patients’ hospitalizedin neurology ward in Poursina hospital in Rasht. Data were collected using designed questionnaire from files of patiens or by telephone interview with patints, families or if nessecary by calling them to be visited in neurology clinic of Guilan University of Medical Sciences. Data were analyzed by independent-T and Qi square tests and logistic regression model in SPSS software version 21. p < 0.05 was considered as the significance level.
Results: Among the studied patients, 46 patients (3.29%) with mean age of 62.8±11 yearshad seizure. 69.6% and 30.4% of patients had early and late siezures, respectively. Cerebral embolism (p=0.032), history of stroke (p=0.008) and family history of stroke (p= 0.016) were determined as three predictors associated with post stroke seizure.
Conclusion: The prevalence of post-stroke seizure is relatively low. Cerebral embolism, history of CVA and family history of CVA are as the predictors of post stroke seizure.

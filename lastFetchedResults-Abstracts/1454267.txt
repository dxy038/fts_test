This paper deals with the optimization of TMD systems to suppress multi-resonant dynamic structural response of high-speed railway bridges. Unlike the previous methods, the presented method chooses the objective function based on the H2 norm along with the constraints on all the peaks which are at the same heights over the frequency ranges of interest. Therefore, the parameters of TMDs can be optimized directly and simultaneously on different modes contributing significantly to the multi-resonant peaks in order to make the TMDs more effective and robust. Besides, the TMD systems with the diversity of average frequencies are also taken into account in this paper.

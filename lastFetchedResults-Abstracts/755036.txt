We consider second-order linear time-invariant systems. The objective of this paper is to present a new method for constructing a reduced system by preserving the second-order structure of the original system. This new model reduction method uses a variant of the well-known balanced truncation technique applied to second-order gramians. We also compare it with another existing technique.

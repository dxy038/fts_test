<strong>Objective:</strong> Nowadays, it is well known that the attentiondeficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is not confined to children and adolescents. Recent data showed that a considerable portion of the general adult population may be affected by ADHD. On the other hand, the impact of ADHD on driving performance, a major area of adult life, has gained enthusiasm. More recent studies revealed an association between adult ADHD and undesirable driving problems. This study was performed to determine the association between presence of adult ADHD and traffic injuries.<br /><strong>Methods:</strong> In this case-control study, in a 13 month period, 140 subjects (70 drivers/riders injured in traffic accidents ,and 70 age- and sexmatched non traumatic controls) were selected to participate in the study and were placed in two groups . Subjects with psychiatric comorbidities were excluded. The Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS) selfreport (screening version) was used for screening adult ADHD in both groups. Finally, the occurrence of this cond tion was compared between the case and control groups .<br /><strong>Results:</strong> Sixty- nine males and one female were recruited in each group with a mean age of 29.31±9.32 (18-61) years in the case and 29.03±9.07 (range: 18-60) years in the control groups (P &gt; 0.05). Previous history of traffic accident was significantly higher in the case group (15.7% vs. 4.3%, P=0.024). The mean driving time in a day was also significantly higher in the case group. In the case group, the scores of CAARS (the ADHD index, ADHD symptoms total, inattentive subscale and hyperactive/impulsive subscale) were positive (higher than 70) in 4.3, 10, 7.1 and 10 percent of patients respectively. Among the controls, the corresponding proportions were 4.3, 14.3, 8.6 and 8.6 percent respectively. The two groups were comparable for the mentioned rates.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The results of this study revealed no significant association between ADHD and traffic injuries in Tabriz- Iran.

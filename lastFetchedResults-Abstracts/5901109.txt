There are many problems in security and defense that require a robust optimization technique, including those that involve the release of a chemical or biological contaminant. This paper discusses using a genetic algorithm for addressing such problems. An example is given how a mixed integer genetic algorithm can be used in conjunction with field sensor data to invert for source information and all necessary meteorological data. A new mixed integer genetic algorithm is described that is a state-of-the-art tool capable of optimizing a wide range of objective functions. Such an algorithm is useful for optimizing atmospheric stability, wind speed, wind direction, and source location. We demonstrate that the algorithm is successful at reconstructing these source and meteorological parameters.

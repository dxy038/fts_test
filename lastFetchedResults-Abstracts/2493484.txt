The subject of index and creating indices has special importance in the human sciences. On one hand, policy-making, planning and communities’ movement towards defined objective require some indices and on the other hand, the degree of the success of societies is measured by these very indices. But, can the indices provided by the United Nations and International Monetary Fund (IMF) meet all human needs of all communities? If the answer is negative, this question will arise: “what things are required for the creation of indices in Islamic communities in the realm of social relations and interactions?” Using an analytical-interpretative method, the present paper seeks to answer this basic question, and considering the distinction between the indices of Islamic society and that of other societies, and investigating the functions of the relations in Islamic society, this paper presents seven necessities for offering an index in the field of the social relations in Islamic society and refers to some epistemological principles of this kind of creation of indices.  The research result shows that the relations in Islamic society clearly differ from those of non-Islamic societies regarding the areas of relations and the aim and consistency of relations.

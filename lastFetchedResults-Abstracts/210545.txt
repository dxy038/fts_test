Background: Outbreaks of human parasmc diseases associated with the consumption of raw
vegetables, often occur in developing and developed countries.
Objective: To evaluate parasitic contamination of edible vegetables in Qazvin.
Methods: This was a descriptive analytical study in which 150 samples of different vegetables
including leek, parsley, lettuce, coriander, radish, spring onion, tarragon, basil, mint, and cress:
collected from several greengroceries in Qazvin during 12 months between 2006-2007 were
examined. Samples were evaluated for presence of metazoan and protozoan parasitic
contaminations. The vegetable samples were washed with water and tested microscopically after
performance of sedimentation method.
Findings: Fifty three out of 150 samples (35.3%) were found to have parasitic contamination.
Among those 45 (30%) and 8 (5.3%) were revealed to be metazoa and protozoa, respectively.
Metazoan contaminations were detected by observation of helminthes' eggs 13 (8.6%) and
rhabditoid larva 32 (21.4%) in vegetables. The highest rate of contamination was detected in leek
(60%), and the lowest in coriander and radish (20%). Regarding the parasitic infestation, rhabditoid
larva with 21.4% and Hymenolepis nana ova with 0.7% were shown to have the highest and lowest
rates, respectively.
Conclusion: Based on our results, edible vegetables in Qazvin are the potential sources of several
parasitic infections in human

The United States has become increasingly dependent on foreign sources of energy [1]. The objective of this project is to evaluate plans to reduce this dependency by utilizing corn ethanol and soybean biodiesel in the transportation sector to replace the largest feasible quantity of petroleum fuel while remaining cost-effective and environmentally sound. Simulations covering the production of these fuels and their impacts on external systems are utilized to determine effective feasible production plans. Feasibility is determined by considering carbon dioxide emissions, strain on the food market for said crops, and the amount of biofuels produced. The feasible alternatives are compared using a multi-attribute utility function. The scope of this project is limited to the next 10 years when the technologies for more viable options are expected to mature.

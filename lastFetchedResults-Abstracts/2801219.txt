A novel two-way image quality assessment method is proposed for free-hand strain imaging. In elasticity imaging, tissue with different stiffness exhibit varying contrast in the strain images and detectability of a lesion is measured using elastographic contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR<sub>e</sub>). Representing quality of strain images quantitatively is vital for improving imaging techniques and also for clinical diagnosis. It avoids the subjective approach of interpreting strain images. Conventionally, contrast between stiff lesion and surrounding soft tissue is measured using contrast-to-noise ratio and strain image with the highest CNR<sub>e</sub> amplitude is considered an optimal strain image. However experimental results have suggested that merely CNR<sub>e</sub> metric is often misleading and does not always represent the true elastic modulus contrast as the correlation coefficient falls below an acceptable levels and accuracy is compromised. Therefore in this study, the objective is to propose a comprehensive strain image quality assessment method which is reliable for clinical examinations and research.

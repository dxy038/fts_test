Over the last years, the two-level three-phase voltage source converters (VSCs) have received an increasing attention as an alternative to conventional thyristor converters. This is due to the universality of this topology having the full capability to operate as conventional voltage source inverters driving a three-phase AC machine as well as a grid-tied converter ensuring a bidirectional power flow between the grid and an active load. This manuscript provides a review of various industrial applications based on this topology including the power circuit and the operation principle. It includes also a list of valuable references making the paper very helpful for the emerging researchers in the power electronics field.

In this paper, a scheduling algorithm suitable for weighted fair queuing scheduling has been studied. With the objective to find the best point of QoS between using network band and cell delay, a new scheduling algorithm based on GPS has been used. The new algorithm is characterized by using SHVC and SCFQ algorithm coordinately. As demonstrated by the simulated results, it is not only guarantees the delay of high-priority cell but also utilizes the broad band network more effectively. The new algorithm is feasible and effective, and better scheduling performance has been achieved.

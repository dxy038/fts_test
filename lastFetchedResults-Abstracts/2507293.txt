Objective: Studies reported conflicting results’ regarding the status of depression and glycemic control in patients with type II diabetes(T2DM), therefore, this study was performed to determine the relationship between depression and glycemic control in T2DM patients.
Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 150 T2DM patients referred to Yazd diabetes research center, 2014. Data were collected by using Beck Depression Inventory. Data collected were analyzed by SPSS-21 with using descriptive statistics and analytical testing at ?=0.05. 
Results Mean and standard deviation (SD) of age, disease duration and HbA1c levels respectively were; 58.18±9.63 years, 10.83±6.01 years and 8.52±1.59 mg/dl. About 97 patients (64.7%) were women, 88 (58.7%) had hypertension, 57 (38%) hyperlipidemia, 28 (18.7%) good glycemic control. There was no significant relationship between depression status and HbA1c control, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, insulin type and disease duration. Patients with moderate depression status and women had significant relationship with macrovascular complications. 
Conclusion: Despite the lack of significant relationship between depression status and HbA1c control and given the significant relationship between moderate depression status and HbA1c control with macrovascular complications, it seems are needed more extensive studies.

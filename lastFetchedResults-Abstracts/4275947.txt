The core reaction of DNA computing is the specific hybridization, which may results in incorrect or undesirable computations. Therefore, so far much works have focused on designing the DNA sequences to make the molecular computation more reliable. In this paper, we formulate the DNA sequence design as a multi-objective optimization problem and solve it by Genetic Algorithm (GA)/Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which integrate GA with the characteristic of convergence and PSO with the characteristic of rapidly converging. Furthermore, a computer simulation is conducted and seven better DNA sequences are obtained to prove the efficiency of our method given here.

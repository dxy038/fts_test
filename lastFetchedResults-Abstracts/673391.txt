Introduction: Diabetes in long term is associated with learning and memory deficits. Given the  Anti-diabetic and antioxidant activities of Tribulus terrestris (TT).
Objective: to evaluate the effect of oral administration of Tribulus terrestris on learning and memory in diabetic rats. 
Materials and Methods: Thirty two Wistar rats were divided into control, TT-treated control, diabetic, and TT-treated diabetic groups. To evaluate their learning and memory, initial (IL) and step-through latencies (STL) were determined at the end of study using passive avoidance test and alternation behavior percentage was obtained using Y maze. Level of malondialdehyde in hippocampal homogenate was also measured at the end of the study.
Results: STL significantly decreased in diabetic group (p < 0.01) and TT-treated diabetic group showed a significantly higher STL (p < 0.01), compared to the diabetic counterparts. Alternation percentage was significantly lower in the diabetic group relative to the controls (p < 0.01) and treated diabetic group did show a significant difference in comparison with the diabetic group (p < 0.05). Diabetic rats also exhibited a significant increase in tissue level of malondialdehyde (p < 0.01) and TT treatment significantly reduced MDA level (p < 0.01) in the diabetic group.
Conclusion: TT treatment could enhance the capability of consolidation and recall in diabetic animals and could also improve spatial memory in them, partly via attenuation of lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus.

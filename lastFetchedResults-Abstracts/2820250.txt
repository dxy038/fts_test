The paper addresses user scheduling schemes for the multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) transmission with the objective of sum rate maximization (SRM) and the weighted counterpart in a single cell scenario. We propose a low complex product of independent projection displacements (PIPD) scheduling scheme, which performs the user selection for the MU-MIMO system with significantly lower complexity in comparison with the existing successive projections (SP) based designs. The PIPD scheme uses series of independent vector projections to evaluate the decision metrics. In addition, we also propose a heuristic algorithm of weighted scheduling, addressing the weighted sum rate maximization (WSRM) objective, which can be used with any scheduling algorithm. The performance of the weighted scheduling schemes are studied with the objective of minimizing the queues.

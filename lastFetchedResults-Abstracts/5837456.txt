This paper presents the design and stability analysis of a steering controller. The objective of the controller is to steer a ground vehicle along a reference line located in the middle of the lane to be followed. An adaptive steering controller for ground vehicles through a closed loop control strategy is proposed. To design the maneuver controller, fuzzy logic is used to imitate human driversÂ´ behavior. Based on the widely used dynamic vehicle model, the stability of the designed controller is proved. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the adaptability of the proposed control strategy for different lane curvature inputs.

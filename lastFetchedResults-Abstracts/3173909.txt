It takes substantial efforts just to remain competitive today. As obsolescence is always a problem, the capacity to change not only technologies, products and services, and processes but also routines, structures, and skills is considered a factor for success. However, despite the many years of research on change and the manifest importance of learning to cope with it, the failure rate of organizational change initiatives is alarmingly high. The objective of this study is to discover how organizational project management (OPM) contributes to major transformation within an organization. The exploratory nature of this study on OPM and change lent itself naturally to a qualitative methodological approach. The analysis shows that OPM contributed less to strengthening the change enablers than to supporting the steps and overcoming obstacles. Project portfolio management was a vehicle of change, both as an end and as a change in itself: a response to a turbulent environment.

The design, simulation and practical implementation for a bidirectional 1.25 Gbit/s indoor optical wireless communications system has been presented. It is a part of the European community funded hOME Gigabit Access project (OMEGA). The line-of-sight (LOS) system uses angle-diversity transceivers enabling discrete beam steering. Each transceiver uses three transmitting and receiving elements giving an overall field of view of ~25 &#215; 8&#176; and a transmission range of 3 m. Measurement shows that the system can operate at a bit error rate below 10<sup>-9</sup> without channel coding and the handover between cells is &lt;;400&lt;;ns. Detail of a demonstrator of high-definition (HD) video embedded in gigabit ethernet stream using this system is also reported.

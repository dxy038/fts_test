Summary form only given. Miniature discharges and their potential use for local area materials processing including etching, surface activation, and plasma-assisted CVD are investigated in this study. The objective of this study is to do materials etching steps on localized areas by applying a small discharge to only the region being processed. A miniature microwave plasma discharge applicator design based on microstripline technology is applied to create a miniature stream of plasma species. The diameter of the plasma stream considered in this study ranges from 1 millimeter down to 10Â´s microns. The miniature microwave plasma discharge is created using 2.45 GHz microwave energy inside a 1 mm inner diameter (i.d.) tube with a micromachined silicon aperture on the end. Through this aperture the plasma stream for materials processing is formed. The microwave plasma source used in this investigation has a microstripline coupling structure with the discharge created inside a 1 mm i.d. quartz tube. The microwave energy couples to the discharge via the stripline. The stripline has a characteristic impedance of 50 ohms and is connected to a 2.45 GHz microwave power supply operating at 1 watt to 100 watts. The discharge tube is orientated perpendicular to the stripline conductor. The characteristics of the discharge have been measured with electron densities in the range of 10<sup>12</sup> to over 10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> depending on the pressure, power and feed gas composition. Two etching processes are investigated in this study: an argon/SF<sub>6</sub> feed gas mixture is used to create a plasma stream with radicals for silicon etching, and an argon/O<sub>2</sub> feed gas mixture is used for diamond etching and polymer surface treatment. A CAD-guided automated path generation system is developed to assist manufacturing micro-structures/patterns automatically using the micro plasma applicator. Based on the CAD model of a microstructure/pattern and the model of t- e microwave of plasma source, a path of the plasma applicator can be automatically generated. It is fed to the control system of an xyz positioning stage to generate relative motion between the substrate and the plasma applicator

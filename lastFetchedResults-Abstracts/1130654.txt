Abstract
Background: Selling unpasteurized fruit juices is common in Iran. Since health standards are not met in preparation and distribution of these products, food infections may increase. The objective of this study was to assess microbial contamination of handmade fruit juices in Gorgan, Iran.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the first half of 2009. Overall, 100 carrot and cantaloupe juice samples were collected randomly from all traditional fruit juice shops in Gorgan. The samples were then transferred to food laboratory under sterile conditions. They were examined subsequently for Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae. The results were analyzed with SPSS.
Findings: The contamination levels of carrot juice samples with Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli were 29% and 17%, respectively. The contamination levels of cantaloupe juice samples with Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli were 12% and 7%, respectively. From all 100 samples, about 33% (42% of carrot juice samples and 24% of cantaloupe juice samples) were not usable.
Conclusion: The main sources of microbial contamination in handmade fruit juice production and distribution centers were lack of proper fruit disinfection and inappropriate washing of containers. Therefore, the workers of such shops need to be educated.

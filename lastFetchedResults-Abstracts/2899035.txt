Wireless Sensor Networks are dynamic in nature and the sensor nodes are self-organized. Due to the characteristics of the WSN and its nodes, knowing the location of the nodes is an important factor to be considered to improve the security in WSN. In this paper the location of a node [P] can be obtained using the Nearest Neighbor Reference Method [NNRM] and the reference node is the answer for the query [Q]. In the proposed approach the distance based nearest neighbor query is introduced. There are two kinds of neighbor nodes are used, where first one is the single neighbor node, and the second one is the successive neighbor nodes. The existing approaches used many location finding algorithms which have targeted various design objectives, but the main objective of this paper is to estimate the location of a node using NNR method which reduces the time considerably. The simulation result shows better results than the existing approaches.

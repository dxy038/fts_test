GML schemas are metadata files, which define the structure, content and restriction of GML instances. GML parsing establishes a good basis for future GML data studies and applications such as storage, compression, query, index and share etc. The engine for GML grammar validation is an important component of GML parser, which includes validity verification and consistency verification. The objective of validity verification is to ensure GML data to be well-formed. In this paper, the functional structure of the GML schema-based parser is discussed, and an algorithm for GML data validity verification is developed and implemented. Experimental results show that the algorithm is effective and efficient.

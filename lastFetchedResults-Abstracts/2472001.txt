The main objective of this study is to develop a new photometric correction that is suitable for global Chang’ E-1 (CE-1) Interference Imaging Spectrometer (IIM) data. We considered two improvements in the accuracy of the photometric correction: (1) classifying the whole Moon’s surface into four classes (very bright rays, mature highlands, low FeO basalts, and high FeO basalts) based on the FeO contents; (2) decoupling the combined effects of the solar photometry and the detector responsivity along the cross-track. The results showed that our decoupling method could correct the non-uniformity of detector response but retain the cross-track photometry. Based on these in-flight calibrated data, spectrally continuous photometric functions of the four classes were obtained. By eliminating the contamination from highlands ejecta and low FeO basalts, the opposition surge of the high FeO maria was evident for the first time. The amplitude and width of the opposition surge presents wavelength dependence, which suggests that shadow hiding is the mechanism responsible for the opposition surge. A global lunar reflectance map whose boundaries between adjacent orbits are invisible was generated using the new four-type photometric functions. The quality of the global mosaic and the consistency of the reflectance spectra of the same area obtained in different orbits indicate the effectiveness of our photometric correction method. Although our method was specifically applied to the IIM data, the photometric correction method and the parameter values derived in this study is expected to be suitable for other optical instruments.

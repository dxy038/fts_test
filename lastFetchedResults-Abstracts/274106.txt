The objective of this paper is to describe a simple dynamic crack propagation experiment which reproduces two phenomena:
mixed-mode propagation and crack stop and restart. This experiment is explained and interpreted using X-FEM
simulations. We show that a simple fracture theory which consists in using a dynamic crack initiation toughness, a crack
orientation along the maximum principal stress and a simple equation for the calculation of the crack speed is sufficient to
explain what is observed experimentally

This paper studies the consequences of having solid state starters with long term ramps in a real pumping case. The harmonic resonances due to the necessary reactive power compensation capacitors and the short circuit impedance is analyzed. Electromagnetic Compatibility standards are checked in order to explain the frequent failure of the starters. One time proposed the disconnection of the capacitors during the ramps, reactive compensation is redesigned with the objective to have a 0.92 power factor in the pump installations.

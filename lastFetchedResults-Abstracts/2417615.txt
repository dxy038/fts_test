Abstract: The renowned Sunni theologian and commentator, Fakhr Razi, is a capable writer who has written many books about analyzing the theologian discussions. This reason is one of the causes of difficulty in understanding his final viewpoint in some problems and in some issues, his viewpoint seems to be unstable and vague among which one can refer to the issue of “knowing objective innocents”. For Razi, like many other Muslim theologians, presence of the innocents is necessary for keeping Sharia safe from change and deviation. In the book “Al - Mataleb Al - Aliyeh” about prophecy, he sees Shias’ viewpoint on infallibility of the Imams as the explicit right and this is in contradiction with his viewpoint in his other works. In addition to analyzing duality of his viewpoint about “knowing objective innocents”, the claims of some other scholars about Fakhr’s works and thoughts regarding the mentioned problem have been criticized. It is obvious that the principle of existence of innocent imams after Prophet Mohammad is known to be necessary for him and its evidence in some cases has been introduced as “union” and in some others as “perfect persons” and he considers the Shiite Imams such as Imam Mahdi as examples of perfect and innocent individuals.

Editors’ note: The goal of the Evidence-Based Emergency Medicine (EBEM) series is to teach the process of translating research into clinical practice. In this issue, we introduce a new component of the series titled “Updates, Feedback, and Links.” Because biomedical research is constantly and rapidly changing, we will provide “Updates” to previously addressed clinical questions. And because there is more than one way to skin a cat (if you will forgive the expression), we hope to provide a forum for “Feedback” regarding evidence-based medicine (EBM) as applied to the specialty of emergency medicine. Our objective in the feedback segments is to engage you, the reader, in the issues and dilemmas that arise from a systematic attempt to integrate evidence into clinical decisionmaking. We welcome comments, suggestions, and criticisms by E-mail or post from readers and users of the EBEM series. These comments and questions may address specific EBEM installments, EBM in general, and the application of EBM skills in clinical practice. In responding to such queries, we will draw on the expanding range of individuals and expertise currently surrounding the EBEM feature, including a team of librarians who regularly review the search strategies of EBEM installments. Finally, in the section called “Links,” we may recommend paper-based resources and Web sites that may be used to facilitate the translation of research into clinical practice.

The process flow of general automotive assembly and the production characteristic were analyzed in order to improve assembly efficiency. The minimal production set was introduced to the mixed model motor scheduling problem. The objective function of minimizing of total over and idle time based on the moving time windows of closed station and the keeping a constant rate of part in JIT environment were built. The optimization algorithms of sequencing were analyzed. The AGV scheduling problem of the mixed model assembly line was analyzed by queuing analysis and optimization techniques. The virtual simulation object, simulation model and control logic of the transmission group for general automotive assembly process were build on the base of the em-power software plat of digital factory according to the assembly process. The production evaluation was developed and the results were feasible.

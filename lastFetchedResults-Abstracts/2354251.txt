Objective: Nanotechnology focuses on materials having at least one dimension of less
than 100 nanometers. Nanomaterials such as Nanosilver (NS) have unique physical and
chemical properties such as size, shape, surface charge. NS particles are thought to induce
neuronal degeneration and necrosis in the brain. It has been reported that NS particles
generate free radicals and oxidative stress which alters gene expression and induces
apoptosis. This study was designed to evaluate whether the detrimental effect of NS particles
is through the activation of Procaspase-3 during fetal neural development.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, thirty Wistar female rats at day one of
pregnancy were semi-randomly distributed into three groups of ten. Group 1, the control
group, had no treatment. From day 1 to the end of pregnancy, groups 2 and 3 received 1
and 10 ppm NS respectively via drinking water. Newborn rats were sacrificed immediately
after birth and their brains were dissected and kept frozen. Total RNA, extracted from brain
homogenates, was reverse transcribed to cDNA. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) analysis was undertaken to estimate the expression level of Procaspase-3.
Results: Developmental exposure to NS induced neurotoxicity and apoptosis. This correlated
with a significant increase in Procaspase-3 expression level especially at 10 ppm NS.
Conclusion: The pro-apoptotic activity of NS in cells is likely to due to the dysregulation
of Procaspase-3.

In a parallel-series network the required <e1>n</e1> components are to be selected from the available <e1>m</e1>(&#10878;<e1>n</e1>) components and assigned to the <e1>n</e1> positions in the network with the objective of maximizing the reliability of the system. Any component can be assigned to any of the <e1>n</e1> positions, but the reliability of a component is affected by the position to which it is assigned. Obtaining an exact solution to this problem is highly complex. Therefore, a heuristic method that requires solving <e1>k</e1>(<e1>k</e1>+1)/2 classical assignment problems, where <e1>k </e1> is the number of pathsets in the network, is developed. The results of an extensive computational experiment show that the heuristic method obtains exact solutions in a vast majority of cases, and when it fails to give an exact solution, the deviation from the exact solution is small in most cases

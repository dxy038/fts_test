With the improvement in technology of thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display (TFT-LCD), the resolution requirement of display becomes higher and higher. Super-resolution algorithms are used to enlarge original low-resolution (LR) images to meet the visual quality of the high-resolution (HR) display. In this research, an efficient super resolution algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm consists of two steps. First, the Lanczos interpolation is used for LR images to get the preliminary HR images. For solving the over-smoothing problems generally caused by interpolation, it needs to add texture information to refine the preliminary HR images. Subsequently, a refinement process based on simple linear regression and the self-similarity between a pair of LR and HR images is performed to provide proper information of textures. In the experimental results, the proposed algorithm not only performs well in the objective measurement such as PSNR, but also in visual qualities.

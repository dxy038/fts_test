The Birmingham Box Managed Motorway (BBMM) Phases 1 and 2 schemes were introduced on sections of the M6, M42 and M40 motorways near Birmingham, UK. The primary objective of the schemes was to improve traffic conditions and journey time reliability during periods of congestion through the use of intelligent transport systems and by making best use of existing road space. BBMM Phase 2 was also the first site to introduce `through junction runningÂ´ on a full-time basis in the UK. Traffic data analysis was undertaken to understand the impact of managed motorway operations on this section of road. The results demonstrate that the introduction of the schemes has improved traffic conditions at these sites with additional benefits being observed on the M42 Managed Motorway (M42-MM) section.

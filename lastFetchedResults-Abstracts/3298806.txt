The economic environmental load dispatch problem in power networks aims at producing electricity at the lowest financial and environmental costs. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time dynamic data driven adaptive multi-scale simulation framework (RT-DDDAMS) for efficient real-time dispatching of electricity. The framework includes 1) a discovery procedure where the network is split into sub-networks and prospective fidelities are identified, 2) an RT-DDDAMS platform involving algorithms for state estimation, fidelity selection, and multi-objective optimization alongside with a system simulation; and 3) databases for storing sub-network topologies, fidelities, and selective measurements. The best compromise load dispatch obtained from this framework is then sent to the considered power network for deployment. The proposed framework is illustrated and validated via a modified IEEE-30 bus test system. The experiments reveal that the proposed framework significantly reduces the computational resource usages needed for the reliable power dispatch without compromising the quality of the solutions.

This paper explores the possibility of sensing emotional states of neutral or anger from pidgin utterances using Support vector machine (SVM). The objective of the paper is to show that in speech interactive computer games, a new language called Game pidgin language (GPL) can not only generate real time spoken response from the non-player-character but also capture and express emotions.

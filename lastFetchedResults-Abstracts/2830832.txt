Renewable energy and storage technologies had a meaningful growth in the past decades. The use of multilevel topologies within these technologies is being preferable chosen due to better features over the conventional full bridge inverters when the applications involve high power processing. Moreover, digital control algorithms make possible power electronics converters to be operated in different manners without changing their structure. This paper presents a Bidirectional Multilevel Shunt Compensator (BMSC) able to perform different and simultaneous tasks. There are eight possible modes of operation that a decision-taker may demand to the BMSC. The control algorithm is based on the Conservative Power Theory (CPT). Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the BMSC.

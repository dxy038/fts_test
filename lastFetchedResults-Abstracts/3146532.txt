Information technology has been developing fast and of late, many have tried to tie education in with it. The advent of technology provides exposure and encourages everyone to seek information via technology such as multimedia. Therefore, a language instructor would need a full complement of supplemental resources to assist preparation for class, conducting lectures, assessing studentsÂ´ performance and others in order to teach effectively. One of the new developments in language teaching pedagogy is to employ interactive multimedia supplementary instructional tools. The FAST MANDANRIN.2 CD-ROM serves as an interactive multimedia supplementary instructional tool and is self-produced by the researchers. The objective is to supplement conventional teaching and learning method of the Elementary Mandarin-learning program in Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM). Besides, it is offered as a self-paced learning instruction for the students in view of the limitation of contact hours for third language classes in the university. It was clear from the results of the research that interactive multimedia has the capacity to illuminate and enhance the teaching and learning process of Elementary Mandarin.

The Athens Automation and Control Experiment is a hardware/software-oriented research and development project [1]. The basic purpose of the experiment is to automate the distribution system and to develop and test control strategies that improve the efficiency and controllability of the power system. The hardware system will be installed on the Athens Utilities Board distribution system in Athens, Tennessee. The experiments are being designed to develop and test load control, volt/var control, and distribution automation functions [2]. Since this project is sponsored by the Electric Energy Systems Division of the U. S. Department of Energy and by the Electric Power Research Institute, the transference of experimental results to the electric utility industry is a primary objective.

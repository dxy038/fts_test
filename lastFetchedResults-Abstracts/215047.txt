Nonenzymatic glycation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) is a reaction of glucose and other reducing sugars with apolipoprotein B100 (apo-B100) lysine residues. In diabetes, this reaction is greatly accelerated and is important in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. The objective of this study was to investigate in vitro effects of ?-tocopherol, ascorbic acid and lycopene on LDL glycation.
LDL was isolated from EDTA-plasma by ultracentrifugation using a single step discontinuous gradient. LDL and glucose were incubated without and with different concentrations of lycopene, ascorbic acid and ?-tocopherol. LDL glycation were estimated by sodium periodate assay.
Based on this study results, ?-tocopherol, ascorbic acid and lycopene decrease LDL glycation in a dose dependent manner. The electrophoretic mobility of glycated LDL decreased in presence these nutrients.
These effects may be due to antioxidant properties of these nutrients and may have a role in ameliorating atherosclerotic risk of patients with diabetes mellitus.

State estimator application is the core advanced application in the Energy Management system (EMS) that provides major inputs to other network applications that are executed to determine power system security in the real-time. Those applications include transient and voltage stability analysis that are also responsible for calculation and download of the remedial action schemes arming patterns to the field in the real-time. For this reason, state estimator performance and quality of results are highly important to BC Hydro real-time operations. State estimator relies on the quality of status and analog real-time telemetry and is also strongly dependent on the availability of measurements to provide observability and redundancy. In practical world, real-time measurements are seldom available at all locations and in sufficient quantity to ensure observability of the entire transmission network. In order to overcome the lack of real-time telemetry state estimators traditionally rely on utilization of pseudo measurements to complement real-time measurement set and provide necessary observability for state estimator to solve. The objective of this paper is to discuss the approaches that BC Hydro has adopted for application of pseudo measurements as well as methods used to increase quality of pseudo telemetry.

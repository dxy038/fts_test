Objective: To investigate the presence of Helicobacter pylori in sinonasal mucosa of
patients with chronic sinusitis
Design: A prospective case-control study
Materials and methods: Mucosal specimens were collected from the mid-third middle
meatus and lateral side of mid-cornea. H. pylori has been investigated using PCR after DNA
extraction and urease test.
Results: H. pylori was not found in any of the sample taken from both groups (case and
control patients).
Conclusion: This is the first reported study to investigate the presence of H. pylori in
sinonasal mucosa in Iran. In this study, H. pylori was not determined in these sites, although
its possible presence could not be excluded. Thus, further investigation on more patients and
application of sensitive diagnostic techniques are recommended.

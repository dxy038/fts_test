This work presents an analysis of microstrip antennas with circular patches on uniaxial anisotropic substrates. The objective is to evaluate the effect of the substrate anisotropy on the antenna parameters. The analysis is performed in the Hankel transform domain by using Hertz vector potentials and Galerkin method. Numerical results are presented for the resonant frequency and radiation pattern.

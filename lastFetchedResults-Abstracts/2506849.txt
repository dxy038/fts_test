Objective (s): Heart failure is a severe chronic disease and has a negative impact on the quality of life (QoL).  The aim of this study was to assess quality of life and its related factors in patients with heart failure using an specfic measure..
Methods: A cross-sectional study of 210 patients with heart failure was conducted using convenience sampling methods. The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLHF) and socioeconomic questionnaires were used to collect data. The data analysis was performed using descriptive statistical tests, Pearson correlation coefficient, independent t-test, and regression analysis.
Results: The mean age of patients was 57.90±13.54. Higher and lower scores were observed for the treatment satisfaction with mean and standard deviation of 66.34±17.32, and angina stability with mean and standard deviation of 38.92±24.02. The results of multiple liner regression showed that there was significant difference between quality of life and NYHA class (B =0.13; p=0.04).
Conclusion: The finding indicated that quality of life was low in patients with Heart Failure. Higher NYHA class was independent predictors of poor QoL in patients hospitalized with heart failure. It seems necessary to put more focus on nursing care to enhance and improve quality of life for these patients.

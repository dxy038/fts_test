The basic idea presented in this paper is to use interference aware routing with predicted interference. Noise values are measured over a long time and within a wide area in order to find recurring patterns. Routing parameters are adjusted according to these patterns. The objective is to improve the general network performance without permanently transmitting status information. In contrast to this, a predefined schedule derived from predicted interference is deployed once and updated only from time to time, thus reducing the overhead for network control. In this paper we introduce the new idea in general and investigate pattern recognition within the noise values for its suitability.

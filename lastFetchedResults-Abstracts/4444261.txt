Summary form only given. The optical guidance of cold atoms by the hollow laser beam (HLB) with blue detuning has been well understood experimentally and theoretically (Xinye Xu et al, 2000). Based on this clear understanding and the development of an efficient atomic guiding, we have performed the experiment of optically guided atomic fountain by using a blue-detuned cylindrical HLB. An HLB was generated from a micron-sized hollow optical fiber and collimated by the objective lens and propagates downwards to the center of a magneto-optical trap (MOT). We have demonstrated tenfold enhancement of the atom-funneling efficiency for the HLB-guided atomic fountain, which may lead to improved performance of atom optical experiments based on the atomic fountain such as the Rb atomic clock.

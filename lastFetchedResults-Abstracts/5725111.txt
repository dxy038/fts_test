Complex networks from domains like Biology or Sociology are present in many e-Science data sets. Dealing with networks can often form a workflow bottleneck as several related algorithms are computationally hard. One example is detecting characteristic patterns or "network motifs" - a problem involving subgraph mining and graph isomorphism. This paper provides a review and runtime comparison of current motif detection algorithms in the field. We present the strategies and the corresponding algorithms in pseudo-code yielding a framework for comparison. We categorize the algorithms outlining the main differences and advantages of each strategy. We finally implement all strategies in a common platform to allow a fair and objective efficiency comparison using a set of benchmark networks. We hope to inform the choice of strategy and critically discuss future improvements in motif detection.

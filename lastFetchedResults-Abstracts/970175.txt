Objective
The surface of biomaterials plays a critical role in determining bioactivity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cell adhesion and proliferation of ADSCs on the surface of biomaterial which is modified with fibronectin or collagen.
Materials and methods

Adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) were obtained from SD rats, expanded in culture, and seeded onto scaffold surface-modified with fibronectin or collagen. To characterize cellular attachment, cells were incubated on scaffold for 1 and 2 h and then counted the cells attached onto the scaffold. The MTT assay was chosen to evaluate the proliferation at days 1, 4, 7 and 14. After 7 d of culture, scanning electron microscope was chosen to observe cell morphology and attachment of ADSCs on the scaffolds.
Results

Attachment at 1 and 2 h of cells on scaffold modified with fibronectin was significantly greater than in control, but not with collagen. The MTT assay revealed that ADSCs proliferation tendency was nearly parallel to that in control. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that ADSCs in experiment expanded thoroughly and excreted much extracellular materials.
Conclusions

Surface modification with fibronectin or collagen can enhance the attachment of cultured ADSCs on the scaffold, but it had not evident effect to proliferation.

Automotive companies have turned their concentration towards the fuel cell powered hybrid vehicle research, since it offers reduced emission and also saves our nature. The fuel economy is also considerably improved due to the plenty of source availability. The core technology behind such development of fuel cell for automotive applications is the &#8220;Power electronics&#8221;. The Power electronics influence in developing greener and safer vehicle transportation system is much more. This paper presents the efficient DC/DC boost converter topology used to interface fuel cells to the motor controllers in Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles (FCHEVÂ´s).The main aim of this paper is to present a simple and practical boost converter topology with a coordinated control that can regulate the output voltage and the input current simultaneously. Design of digital controllers based on frequency response method is analyzed. And for choosing the PID gains the trial and error approach has been followed keeping the controller requirements as objective. The performance of proposed power conditioning system is evaluated in simulation results. MATLAB is used as tool for evaluating the boost converter dynamics and controller performance estimation. DSP processor can be used to implement the controller.

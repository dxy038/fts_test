Study objective: Emergency department records are an important source of injury surveillance data. However, documentation regarding intentional assault has not been studied and may be suboptimal. The purpose of this study was to analyze physician documentation of assailant, site, and object used in intentional assault. Methods: The ED log of an urban Level I trauma center was retrospectively reviewed to identify eligible patients presenting consecutively in November 1996. All acutely injured patients not involved in a motorized vehicle crash were identified. Results:  From the ED log, 1,483 patients were identified as possible study subjects; 1,457 (98%) charts were located and reviewed and 971 (67%) met inclusion criteria. Of these, 288 (30%) cases resulted from intentional assault. In 67% of patients, there was no documentation of the identity of the assailant. For 13% of cases, there was no documentation regarding the object or force used in the assault. In 79% of cases there was no documentation regarding the site of assault. For 24 cases (8%), the assailant was documented as an intimate partner or ex-partner. Police involvement in these cases was documented 54% of the time, despite the fact that this state mandates police reports for cases of acute partner violence. Social service involvement and shelter referrals were documented in less than one fourth of domestic violence cases. Conclusion:  Although the ED commonly treats patients who have been assaulted, basic surveillance data are often omitted from the chart. Structured charting may provide more complete data collection.[Houry D, Feldhaus KM, Nyquist SR, Abbott J, Pons PT: Emergency department documentation in cases of intentional assault.

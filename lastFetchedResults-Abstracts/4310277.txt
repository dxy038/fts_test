Today, due to many reasons, such as the inherent heterogeneity, the diversity, and the continuous evolving of actual computational supports, writing efficient parallel applications on such systems represents a great challenge. One way to answer this problem is to optimize communications of such applications. Our objective within this work is to design a realistic model able to accurately predict the cost of communication operations on execution environments characterized by both heterogeneity and hierarchical structure. We principally aim to guarantee a good quality of prediction with a neglected additional overhead. The proposed model was applied on point-to-point and collective communication operations and showed by achieving experiments on a hierarchical cluster-based system with heterogeneous resources that the predicted performances are close to measured ones.

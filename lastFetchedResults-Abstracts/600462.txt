Objective: Diabetes mellitus and chemotherapy use are well-known factors that can affect suc¬cess after microvascular repair. Although many studies have investigated each factor individual¬ly, no study exists on their combined effect. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of preoperative vinblastine, a vinca alkaloid, on the healing of microvascular anastomosis in dia¬betic and non-diabetic rats. Methods: In this study, 144 Sprague Dawley rats were assigned randomly and equally into experimental or control groups. The experimental group consisted of 72 rats which were made diabetic by alloxan injections. Diabetes was confirmed by glycosuria (>2%) and elevated plas¬ma glucose (>300 mg/100 ml) after three days of alloxan injections. The experimental group then received a single dose of intraperitoneal vinblastine. After applying the medication, the two main groups were divided into three subgroups. For each group, we performed end-to-end femoral artery anastomosis on Day 7, 14, and 21, respectively. We further divided each subgroup equal¬ly into three smaller groups to test patency and took biopsies at Day 7, 14 and 21, respectively. Histopathologic evaluation was carried out. Results: The comparison of patency tests and pathologic examination indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Conclusion: The negative effects of diabetes and the administration of vinblastine did not sig-nificantly influence anastomosis healing.

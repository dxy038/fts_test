Electronic Fetal Monitoring in the form of cardiotocography is routinely used for fetal assessment both during pregnancy and delivery. However its interpretation requires a high level of expertise and even then the assessment is somewhat subjective as it has been proven by the high inter and intra-observer variability. Therefore the scientific community seeks for more objective methods for its interpretation. Along this path, presented work proposes a classification approach, which is based on a latent class analysis method that attempts to produce more objective labeling of the training cases, a step which is vital in a classification problem. The method is combined with a simple logistic regression approach under two different schemes: a standard multi-class classification formulation and an ordinal classification one. The results are promising suggesting that more effort should be put in this proposed approach.

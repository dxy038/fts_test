The paper presents the results of a study of some methods for acquiring data about the complex disposition of a patient´s blood circulation system. This applies, in particular, to long-time (24 - 48 hours) blood pressure measurements, without using inflatable cuffs, and to determining the degree of arterial elasticity degradation. The possibilities are described of blood vessel imaging in the near infrared (NIR) and the long wave infrared (LWIR, thermal radiation) spectra, 2D ultrasound imaging, together with a photoplethysmographic curve analysis. Finding a new non-invasive diagnostic method that increases patients´ comfort is the final objective of the project being solved.

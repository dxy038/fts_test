Accurate identification of ectopic beats is important in frequency HRV analysis. It may be done by classification of QRS planar loop morphology. The objective of this research was to compare results of QRS morphology analysis in different spatial planes: frontal, horizontal, and preferential. The preferential plane of a QRS loop was found with modified SPART method. Fourier descriptors of plane loop were used for classification of QRS loops morphology analysis. The study was performed using ICAR System and Multilead CSE Database. Identification of optimal spatial orientation of QRS loop using SPART method was accurate in all analyzed beats. Statistical indices showed low values for the QRS classification in the frontal plane XY. The results estimated for XZ and UV planes were comparable. Our results confirm usefulness of ICAR System with implemented SPART method for automatic rhythm analysis

Background: Vitamin D plays an important role in regulating the immune system and recent studies have suggested a relation between serum vitamin D levels and autoimmune diseases including Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). 
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of serum vitamin D level and severity of RA. 
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 153 patients with RA who were not taking vitamin D supplementation referred to Booali Sina Hospital in Qazvin, during 2012. Disease and pain severity were assessed by the disease activity score 28 (DAS28) and the Visual Analogues Scale (VAS), respectively. Serum levels of vitamin D and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) were determined for all the participants. Data were analyzed using independent T-test, Chi-square test and Pearson correlation coefficient.  
Findings: Vitamin D deficiency was found in 105 (68.6%) patients. According to DAS28 scores, 86 (56.2%), 33 (21.5%) and 34 (22.2%) patients were categorized as low, moderate and high disease activity, respectively. A significant negative correlation was found between serum vitamin D levels and disease severity according to DAS28. Similarly, a significant negative correlation was found between pain intensity according to VAS scores and serum ESR levels. 
Conclusion: With regards to the results, vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among patients with RA. Furthermore, there is a negative correlation between vitamin D and the disease severity.

The main objective of this paper is to investigate the advancement of the FACTS, both in the technology development and applications. The paper will survey different FACTS devices available, review and compare their different applications in power systems. It will investigate the ability of FACTS to improve power transfer and voltage control will be reviewed in light of different types of compensation, series, shunt at midpoints, single or multi-function etc. FACTS definite impacts on a utility network with anticipated advantages and disadvantages will be explored.

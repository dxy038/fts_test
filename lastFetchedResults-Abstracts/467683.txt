OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted (1) to determine in vitro placental villous cytotrophoblast secretion of prostacyclin, prostaglandin E2, and endothelin-1, (2) to examine the effect of serum from normal and preeclamptic women on secretion of these vasoactive substances, and (3) to determine whether responses to these sera by cytotrophoblasts from preeclamptic pregnancies are different from those of normal pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN: Cytotrophoblasts isolated from human placentas collected at cesarean section from normal and preeclamptic women were incubated for 20 hours in 20% (vol/vol) sera from preeclamptic or gestational age–matched normal pregnant women. Levels of prostacyclin (measured as 6-keto-prostaglandin F1α), prostaglandin E2, and endothelin-1 were measured in cytotrophoblast supernatants. RESULTS: In normal pregnancy sera preeclamptic cytotrophoblasts secreted significantly lower amounts of prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2 but higher amounts of endothelin-1 than did normal cytotrophoblasts. In preeclamptic sera the abnormality of prostacyclin secretion by preeclamptic cytotrophoblasts was partially corrected, but there was no effect on prostaglandin E2 or endothelin-1 secretion. Preeclamptic sera had no effect on secretion by normal cytotrophoblasts. CONCLUSIONS: The differences between normal and preeclamptic cytotrophoblasts in prostacyclin, PGE2, and endothelin-1 secretion and in response to preeclamptic serum suggest altered arachidonic acid metabolism in preeclampsia.(Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;177:1491-5.)

Objective: To determine if cues help young children discriminate among thoughts, feelings and behaviours.

Participants: Ninety-six children aged 4–7 years from three schools in Norwich, UK.

Design: Within each age band (4, 5, 6, 7), children were randomised to the cue or the no cue condition on a stratified basis ensuring that equal numbers of boys and girls from each school were in each of the eight cells (cue condition×age). Cues were glove puppets and post boxes. The effect of IQ was controlled.

Measures: A discrimination task, in which children were asked to identify a thought, a feeling and a behaviour from each of six brief stories, and a brief IQ assessment were administered to children individually.

Results: There was a significant effect of age and cue condition on performance; older children and those who were presented with the cue performed better. There were no gender differences and no interaction between cue condition and age.

Conclusion: Many young children discriminated among thoughts, feelings and behaviours suggesting that they may be able to engage in this aspect of cognitive behaviour therapy. Simple cues (puppets and posting boxes) improved children’s performance and these may be useful therapeutic tools with young children.

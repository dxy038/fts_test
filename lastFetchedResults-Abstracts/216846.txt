This paper examines the interaction between openness, growth,
and development using a panel of ten developing East Asian
countries (China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao and Vietnam) and fiveyear
averages for the period, 1975-2005. Its primary objective is to
determine whether there is a direct link between the level of
development and openness, while controlling for the indirect effect
of openness through its impact on economic growth. Using a twoequation
simultaneous-equations model of development and growth
and an alternative measure of openness, our findings suggest that
openness has a positive influence on both economic growth and
human development. We also find that while economic growth
makes a positive contribution to development, the converse is not
true in that the more developed a nation the slower its growth rate.

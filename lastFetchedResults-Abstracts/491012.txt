The significance of Mulla Sadra's philosophical viewpoint is that the material
world, specifically materiality, is considered as man's ground of creation and
process of evolution towards pure spirituality. Since the entire world on the basis of
substantial motion doctrine possesses a gradual movement from materiality to
complete incorporeity, man's soul too possesses such substantial motion. Thus the
assumptions of the paper are as follows: Firstly, substantial motion is a gradual,
perpetual motion permeating the entire cosmos with its substances and accidents.
Secondly, man's soul is corporeal in origination and spiritual in perpetuation, for
according to Mulla Sadra's doctrine man in the outset of creation is a corporeal
existent and does not have a soul. The soul can go through the stages of perfection
and achieve abstraction from materiality only in the case of living an earthly life.
This paper seeks to elaborate whatness and nature of evolution in matter and body as
well as its transformation into complete abstraction which is the objective of
creation, and which encompasses man too.

A comparison between PWM and quasiresonant power cells is made in steady state involving maxima values of components and switch power losses. In order to restrict the investigation area, only buck derived power cells have been selected (ZCS uni. and bidirectional, ZVS, ZVS-PWM and bidirectional PWM). Theoretical parametrical study and evaluation with Micro-Cap are detailed. PWM structures with RF switches seem to be more adequate for the 10 MHz range converters

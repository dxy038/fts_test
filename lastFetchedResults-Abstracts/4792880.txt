Developments in the field of microelectronics and control has resulted in vector control of induction motor. The induction motors are used in many adjustable speed applications. In order to understand and analyze the vector control of induction motors, the dynamic model of the machine is necessary along with the steady state analysis and design of the induction motors. It is the objective to explain the various forms in a concise way to understand clearly. In addition, the fundamental dynamic performance of the machine in the synchronous frame is developed along with the principles of closed loop vector control is discussed in general terms and simulation has been carried out on a laboratory model.

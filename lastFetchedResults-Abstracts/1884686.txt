Ten children with tuberculosis of the elbow treated over a 21-year period from 1979 to 1999 were reviewed retrospectively. At presentation, they had pain and swelling of the joint mainly due to synovitis, and the median symptom duration was 10 weeks. All had a decreased range of movement. All were treated with 9 months of antituberculous chemotherapy without synovectomy. The radiologic stage at presentation, rather than duration of symptoms, predicted outcome. Of the 9 patients with stage 1 or 2 disease (synovitis), 8 had an excellent or good outcome. One stage 2 patient had a posterior dislocation of the radial head and had a fair outcome. The one stage 3 (arthritic) patient had a poor outcome.

Background: Iran is one of the countries with the highest rate of deaths due to accidents in the world. Motorcyclists are one of the most vulnerable groups in Iran that 42% of road accidents are attributed to them. The objective of this study was to determine the factors affecting the use of helmets among motorcyclists in Shiraz, Iran.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 400 randomly selected motorcyclists between 15 to 60 years old in Shiraz, Iran. The level of significance was set at P  <  0.05.
Findings: Only 11.2% of the participants reported that they always use their helmet. Most of the participants (62.5%) declared that they do not use helmet mostly because it is not comfortable. There was a significant relation between using helmet with jobs and education (P  <  0.05).
Conclusion: Using motorcycle helmet was low in the studied population. To increase the prevalence of helmet use, it is necessary to focus not only on police enforcement but also initiatives to make helmets more convenient

Objective
This study aimed to report our experience with regard to imaging of mass casualty incidents (MCIs).
Subjects and methods
Following a bomb attack, 150 casualties were referred to our hospital. Radiographs and nonenhanced CT scans were performed in 28 individuals.
Results
Major injuries were seen in 12 individuals, which were limited only to the brain (n=2), facial bones (n=2), and extremities and soft tissues (n=8).
Conclusion
In MCIs, imaging should be fast, in order to help identify major injuries that need immediate management and to help in the triage of injured individuals.

The article addresses the subject of routing in heterogeneous communication network consisting of national elements built in different technologies. Included analyses are related to TACOMS Post 2000 international project, the objective of which is to develop new standards of interoperability of communication networks. Routing in heterogeneous networks is one of the main standardization problems, especially in terms of connection oriented services. The first part of the article presents proposition of new standard related to CO routing in heterogeneous communication network, which is equipped with QoS enhancements but bases on standardized routing protocol. There has been also described the conception of validation of proposed solution using OPNET simulation tool as well as simulation model used to validate operation of mentioned routing protocol. Analysis of results obtained during performed simulation experiments is the main part of the article. Special attention was paid to the number of non user information transferred by the modeled routing protocol as well as network convergence time measured in various situations. The basis for drawing conclusions was the analysis comparing results achieved during test of standard routing protocol with tests of routing protocol with QoS enhancements. The article is summarized by conclusions from performed researches.

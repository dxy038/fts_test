Background and Objective: Identifying the details of the injurious effects of alcohol seems to be decisive in nowadays with growing abuse of the substance. This study mainly aimed to assess the adverse effects of ethanol on the recalling of information in the Wistar rats. 
Materials and Methods: Male Wistar rats (Pasteur Institute of Iran) were evaluated using the novelty seeking behavior based on the place conditioning task. The animals in the conditioning phase were confined in only one side of the equipment. They (n=8 per group) were intraperitoneally injected ethanol at high (1-8 g/kg) or low (0.1-0.8 g/kg) concentrations prior to the testing. The control group solely received saline solution (1 ml/kg, i.p.) in the testing day. The liver samples of the experimental animals were examined to provide the setback systemic injury evidence for the ethanol.
Results: Based on the findings, the ethanol treated rats did not remember the previous data and showed more interest to the novel side (p < 0.05). The liver samples of the experimental animals illustrated no unpleasant feature at the low concentrations of ethanol with the exception of the pyknotic nuclei for the higher concentrations three days after drug injection. 
Conclusion: Recalling of the facts need permanent comparisons between the receiving reminiscences from environ with the information which already exist in the memory boxes. This study may show the prompt troubling influence of ethanol on the memory retrieval along with the long-lasting systemic hazard of the biggest gland.

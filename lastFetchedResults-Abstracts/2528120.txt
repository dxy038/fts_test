Inroduction and Objective: Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is a complex activity which is needed for embryogenesis and other physiological processes. However, in many pathological conditions such as solid tumor progression, the disease appears to be associated with persistent upregulated angiogenesis. In this research, the effect of Berberis vulgaris leaf aqueous extract on angiogenesis in chick chorioallantoic membrane was examined.Material and Methods:50 Ross fertilized eggs were randomly divided in 5 groups as following: control, shamexposed and experimental groups  treated with Berberis vulgaris leaf aqueous extract at different concentration. On day 2 a window was opened on eggs and on the day 8 a gelatin sponge was placed on chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) which was soaked with 10 microliters of PBS in shamexposed group and in experimental groups with 10 microliters of the extract at concentrations of 100, 200 and 500 mg/ml were treated. On dayÂ  12 CAM in all cases were photographed. The number and length of vessels were measured by using Image J software, the data were analyzed by t and ANOVA (pResults: The comparison of average number in experimental groups with control group showed a significant decrease in experimental groups 2 and 3. The comparison of average length in experimental groups with control group showed a significant decrease in all cases.Conclusion:According to the results of this study Berberis vulgaris leaf aqueous extract can have an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis in CAM which was seen as a decrease of vessels number and length in treated area.

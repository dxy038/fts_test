Performance of multicell systems is inevitably limited by interference and available resources. Although intercell interference can be mitigated by base station (BS) coordination, the demand on inter-BS information exchange and computational complexity grows rapidly with the number of cells, subcarriers and users. On the other hand, some of the existing coordination beamforming methods need computation of pseudo-inverse or generalised eigenvector of a matrix, which are practically difficult to implement in a real system. To handle these issues, the authors propose a novel linear beamforming across a set of coordinated cells only with limiting backhaul signalling. Resource allocation (i.e. precoding and power control) is formulated as an optimisation problem with objective function of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios in order to maximise the instantaneous weighted sum-rate subject to power constraints. Although the primal problem is non-convex and difficult to be optimally solved, an iterative algorithm is presented based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition. To have a practical solution with low computational complexity and signalling overhead, they present CB-REFIM (coordination beamforming-reference based interference management) and show the recently proposed reference based interference management algorithm (REFIM) can be interpreted as a special case of CB-REFIM. They evaluate CB-REFIM through extensive simulation and observe that the proposed strategies achieve close-to-optimal performance.

The study objective was to explore the attitudes and beliefs of women at high risk of developing breast cancer who accepted or declined bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (BPM). This qualitative study employed semi-structured interviews of 60 women who opted for BPM and 20 women who declined. Interviews took place in the women's own homes. Qualitative analysis led to the generation of a number of categories that provided conceptualisation of the women's primary experiences. These categories included: anxiety; surgery; sexual impact; information; gene testing; reconstruction and support. The study revealed that there is a clear need for information to be written specifically for this patient group and that emotional support for high-risk women offered BPM should be provided.

Introduction & Objective: Neonatal jaundice is observed in the first week of birth among 60% of mature and 80% of immature neonates. This epidemic puts a lot of cost on the society. Today, phototherapy is used for the treatment of neonatal jaundice. Reducing the treatment period decreases the hospitalization costs. The Purpose of this study was to determine the effect of Zizphus Jujba extract and phototherapy on reducing both Bilirubin concentration and also the hospitalization period of neonatal jaundice patients.

Materials & Methods: This was a clinical-trial study which was conducted at Imam Sajjad Hospital of Yasuj in 2009. 121 of the hospitalized neonates were chosen and divided into 2 groups: case group (63 neonates) and control group (58 neonates). 1 cc of the Zizphus Jujba extract per each kilogram of body weight was orally given three times a day to the case group. Also phototherapy was used in the case group. Phototherapy was the only treatment used for the control group. The Bilirubin concentration of the hospitalized patients was measured two times a day in the hospitalization period. The collected data was analyzed by the SPSS software using t-test.

Results: The mean and standard deviation of the Bilirubin concentration in the control group before the intervention were 20.9±2.3 milligrams per 100 and after intervention was 12.27±1.23 milligrams per 100 while in the case group before intervention was 22.3±0.05 and after intervention was 12.27±1.01 milligrams per hundred. A significant difference was seen between the case and control group before and after intervention (p=0.001. Moreover, a meaningful reduction of the hospitalized days and a meaningful increase of excrement and urine in the case group were observed.

Conclusion: This study revealed that administration of Zizphus Jujba extract with increasing amount of excrement and urine of the neonates can lead to Bilirubin discharge and can be effective on curing neonatal jaundice.

The efficient processing of distributed database queries is of great importance in a distributed database management system. The algorithm-S described in this research is very efficient and low in complexity. The algorithm assumes uniformly distributed data within the attributes of a relation and data independence across attributes. Natural data reductions which occur in nonjoining attributes with iow data multiplicity are recognized. The method can give far more efficient solutions than methods which ignore these reductions. The processing strategies generated exhibit low response time as well as low total transmission time regardless of the cost objective employed.

In this paper, the control of Circulating Fluidized Bed(CFB) combustion system is studied. It is typically a nonlinear, large time delay and coupling system, and is difficult to establish accurate mathematical model, therefore, using conventional control method to solve this control problem becomes very difficult. Since the anti-rejection controller(ADRC) has simple structure, easy to industrial field applications, does not rely on accurate model of plant, it has broad application prospects. In this paper, a decoupling controller is designed for a domestic 75t/h CFB. Multi-Objective optimization algorithm(Non-dominated sorting Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm) is designed for this controller and ITAE, response time as well as maximum of control are selected to be optimized. Comparison between Partially Decentralized Control(PDC) and ADRC shows the ADRC controller has the advantage of simple structure, anti-channel coupling ability, and meanwhile similar controller effect can be obtained.

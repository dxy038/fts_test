This paper summarizes the applications and the state of the art of objective music structure analysis. Two principal types of methods, namely &#194;&#191;state&#194;&#191; and &#194;&#191;sequence&#194;&#191; approaches are reviewed after applications are presented. Two kinds of objective features, static and dynamic, and their related techniques are compared. The static features include Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), chroma, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-based chroma, Constant Q Transform (CQT), Constant Q Logarithmic Power Spectrum etc. Similarity measures, including Euclidean, cosine, Kullback-Leibler (KL) and Structure-based Distance are summarized. Evaluation measures, including F-measure, cluster purity value, value based on conditional entropies, edit distance are described. Concluding remarks and future directions are pointed out on the basis of this review.

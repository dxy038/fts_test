In this paper, the influence of impact and incendiary effect on the microstructure changes and crack development in non-homogenous add-on armour is studied. The main objective was to determine the parameters that may cause the yielding of the material, leading to a possible decrease in multi-hit resistance. For that purpose, patented wire fence and perforated plates made from two types of high strength steel, Hardox 450 and 50CrV4 tempered at 170 Â°C were tested. Various techniques were applied: high speed video camera was used, visual macroanalysis, light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. It was found that incendiary effect, being of a brief nature, does not have any influence on microstructure of the add-on armour. However, impact greatly influences crack development and propagation, which occurs in 50CrV4 steel, the material with lower ductility, diminishing its multi-hit resistance. In accordance with obtained results, non-homogenous add-on armour behaviour models were devised, describing the influence of material ductility and geometry on fracture mode, stresses and deformability.

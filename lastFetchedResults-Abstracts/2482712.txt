Objective: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that transcriptionally
or post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression through degradation of
their mRNA targets and/or translational suppression. However, there are a few reports
on miRNA-mediated expression regulation of long ncRNAs (lncRNAs). We have previously
reported a significant upregulation of the lncRNA SOX2OT and its intronic coding
gene, SOX2, in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissue samples. In
this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of induced overexpression of miR-211 on
SOX2OT and SOX2 expression in vitro.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we performed both bioinformatic
and experimental analyses to examine whether these transcripts are regulated by
miRNAs. From the list of potential candidate miRNAs, miR-211 was found to have
complementary sequences to SOX2OT and SOX2 transcripts. To validate our finding
experimentally, we transfected the NT-2 pluripotent cell line (an embryonal carcinoma
stem cell) with an expression vector overexpressing miR-211. The expression changes
of miR-211, SOX2OT, and SOX2 were then quantified by a real-time polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach.
Results: Compared with mock-transfected cells, overexpression of miR-211 caused a
significant down-regulation of both genes (P < 0.05). Furthermore, flow-cytometry analysis
revealed a significant elevation in sub-G1 cell population following ectopic expression of
miR-211 in NT-2 cells.
Conclusion: We report here, for the first time, the down-regulation of SOX2OT and
SOX2 genes by an miRNA. Considering the vital role of SOX2OT and SOX2 genes in
pluripotency and tumorigenesis, our data suggest an important and inhibitory role for
miR-211 in the aforementioned processes.

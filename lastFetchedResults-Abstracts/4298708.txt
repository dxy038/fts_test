The Internet does not offer a priori definition and maintenance of quality of service to applications. Efforts to change this reality are being deployed by IETF, with IntServ and Diffserv. However, traffic behavior is still not well known. Consequently, each management mechanism has its advantages and disadvantages, and its applicability may depend on service behaviors. The objective of this article is to present simulated behavior of distinct network services submitted to different traffic management mechanisms. We also empirically evaluate mechanismsÂ´ behaviors when traffic conditions change. Traffic behavior is varied in terms of charge and nature. Finally, we map traffic conditions with best-fit mechanisms and configurations.

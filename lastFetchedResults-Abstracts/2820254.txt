Cognitive radio is one of the most promising techniques of wireless communications, due to its many applications. Cognitive networks have the capability to congregate different cognitive users via cooperative spectrum sensing. Examples of cognitive networks can be found in important and different applications, such as digital television and wireless sensor networks. The objective of this paper is to analyze how signal processing techniques are used to provide reliable performance in such networks. Applications of signal processing in cognitive networks are presented and detailed.

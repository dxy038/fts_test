Selection and evaluation of green production (GP) strategies is a critical but difficult process affected by dynamic and uncertain conditions. The problem is multi-objective and involves inter-dependent decisions. This research proposed, according to the characteristics identified, different models to improve analysis and facilitate the decision-making process. Analytic models helped identify the structure and solution of the problem. Simulation models, on the other hand, were developed to capture realistic production flow and decision logic under dynamic and uncertain conditions. Interfacing simulation with a search procedure enables the optimization of solutions. The design of models emphasized robust structures that adequately represent the process flow and decision logic of typical GP applications, and capture the essential trade-offs contributed by the interaction of different decision factors or cost drivers during the implementation. Experiments were designed and carried out via simulation to verify and validate proposed concepts, including an analysis of response surface method (RSM) that was performed to illustrate the experimental search for optimal solutions based on simulation replications.

Objective
This work analyzed the renal function and structure in offspring rats that were submitted to maternal protein-calorie restriction during prenatal or lactation periods.
Study design
Kidneys from adult offspring were studied. Animals from mothers that were submitted to food restriction were separated in 3 groups: control, prenatal restriction, and lactation restriction. Blood pressure, microalbuminuria, and glomerular filtration rate were determined. Kidney cortical remodeling was analyzed with stereology; volume-weighted glomerular volume and the number of glomeruli were estimated.
Results
Adult prenatal restriction offspring showed enhanced microalbuminuria, decreased glomerular filtration rate, and hypertension; their kidneys showed a smaller number of hypertrophied glomeruli than control and lactation restriction animals.
Conclusion
Maternal prenatal protein-calorie restriction in rats causes kidney disease in adult offspring, which is characterized by hypertension and renal dysfunction and suggests secondary kidney remodeling because of an impairment of glomerulogenesis.

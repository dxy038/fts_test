This paper analyses current standards and proposals for e-learning system architecture. Its main objective is to contribute an original proposal for a functional architecture and service architecture for building standard-driven distributed and interoperable learning systems. The functional architecture defines components that make up an e-learning system and the objects that must be moved among these components. We implement the service model with Web Services technology to provide a standard means of communication among different Learning management systems and different content authoring tools. This paper focuses on how to integrate Web Services on the e-learning application domain. We use J2EE as our technical infrastructure to build our components and integrate with Web service.

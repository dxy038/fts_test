The authors describe the basis, main features, and benefits of an automated system for tracking and reporting radioactive air particulate samples. The system was developed due to a recognized need for improving the quality and integrity of air sample data related to personnel and environmental protection. The data capture, storage, and retrieval of air sample data are described. The automation aspect of the associated database and data input eliminates a large potential for human error. The system utilizes personal computers, handheld computers, a commercial personal-computer database package, commercial programming languages, and complete documentation to satisfy the systemÂ´s automation objective

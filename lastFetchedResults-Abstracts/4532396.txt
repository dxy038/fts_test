The objective of this work is to investigate the role of the vector in the dynamics of antisense effects. Polymer/DNA complexs between cationic, branched polymer, polyethylenimine (PEI) at a range of molecular weights and oligonucleotides (ODNs), with varying backbone chemistries, were studied using a variety of physico-chemical and cellular assays. The extent and time scale of antisense effects were found to depend strongly on both the polymer molecular weight as well as the ODN chemistry. The optimum molecular weight of PEI for maximum ODN delivery depends strongly on the ODN chemistry.

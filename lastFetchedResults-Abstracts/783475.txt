Objective This study assessed public
perceptions and attitudes towards and causal beliefs
about mental health problems in Singapore – a multiracial
country in South-East Asia. Method A nationwide
survey using a structured questionnaire was
conducted on those aged between 15 and 69 years.
Results The overall response rate was 68.1% with a total
of 2,632 respondents. About 38.3% (95% CI, 36.4–40.2)
believed that people with mental health problems were
dangerous and 49.6% (95% CI, 47.7–51.5) felt that the
public should be protected from them. A negative
attitude towards mental health problems correlated
with greater age and less education. The Chinese were
more likely to want to hide their illness should they
become mentally unwell while the Malays seemed to
have a more tolerant attitude (P = 0.032). Conclusion
Public awareness and anti-stigma campaigns should
focus on those commonly held misconceptions and
target specific populations.

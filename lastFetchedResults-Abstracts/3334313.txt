The ionizing radiation is used in the nuclear medicine field during the execution of diagnosis exams. The continuous exposure of humans to the radiation may cause organs and tissues damage, being its severity dependent of the quantity of the radiation and the exposure time. The main objective of this work is to design a virtual environment to carry out the simulation of the several stages for the preparation of radioactive products based on the use of a robotic arm. In this work, the V-REP robotic simulation tool was used for the specification and development of the manipulation processes, without the need to consider the real manipulator, being timely and costly efficient. During this study, the preparation process of the dosages in the diagnostic exams was analyzed, being posteriorly translated into mechanical processes for a better perception. The materials and equipment needed were designed as virtual 3D models and posteriorly imported into the V-REP simulation platform in order to be distributed and programmed to achieve a closer approximation to reality.

The objective of this paper is to realize a robust controller for an electro-mechanical fin servo system of a missile. In this paper, we design the robust controller using an H/sub /spl infin// optimization method and a disturbance observer, in order to improve the overall performance of the fin servo system. The H/sub /spl infin// controller is designed using the mixed sensitivity H/sub /spl infin// control method, based on the 2-Riccati state-space approach of Glover and Doyle. The newly proposed disturbance observer is applied to the fin servo system and it consists of three elements: a time delay estimation algorithm part, an anti-filtering compensator (AFC) part and a low pass filter (LPF) part. The effectiveness of this control scheme is verified through simulations and experiments.

In a world where outsourcing is fast becoming one of the largest revenue-generating business, information technology (IT) organizations in developed countries have come to recognize that in order to survive and to grow, they need to demonstrate to their clients that they are among the best. If not, they run the chance of becoming the next outsourcing statistic. Likewise, IT organizations in developing countries that provide outsourcing services also need to demonstrate to their clients in North America and Europe that they are among the best in the world, in order to benefit from outsourcing opportunities. This paper describes a method used to measure the expected quality of products and services developed by IT organizations. The approach described herein is based on a sample of 40 comprehensive appraisals conducted in South America, Europe and North America, and shows that an IT organization should focus on improving and deploying processes that prevent the potential problems to which it is exposed from occurring, and degenerating into crises. Process maturity is meaningless without having this objective in mind

This paper presents a study on steering power balance with a certain hydrostatic drive tracked vehicle as the objective. The influence of sideslip curve to the steering power is examined on the basis of analyzing the steering power of hydrostatic drive tracked vehicle. The variation relationship between speed and power on steering condition with no sideslip is obtained. It is indicated that the engine power can make vehicle steer with no sideslip with the speed ranging 0~70 km/h. The steering simulation is conducted by using Simulink of Matlab. The results indicate that the maximum driving wheel power is achieved in the low-speed in-situ steering and high-speed large radius modified steering, which is less than net power 122 kW in the drive system. System power matches well. Limited to the system pressure, the relative steering ratio is more than minimum relative steering ratio with no sideslip when the speed is more than 24 km/h, namely no sideslip occurring on the same condition.

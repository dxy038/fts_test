This paper presents an analysis of a Reception, Staging and Onward Movement hub (RSOM-hub) concept to support Canadian Forces Major Air Disaster (MAJAID) operations in the North and provides insights into the optimal RSOM-hub locations. RSOM-hubs are permanent or temporary staging bases for cross-loading between strategic and tactical lift during military deployment and sustainment operations. In this study, performance measures were formulated to assess the effectiveness and the responsiveness of different RSOM-hub options to support MAJAID deployments. A simulation-based optimization model was also developed to determine the optimal number and locations of hubs in the North. The model was considered in a multi-objective framework and solution trade-offs were determined through an exhaustive search methodology. An illustrative scenario was used to simulate deployment lift to various MAJAID locations in the North and assess the performance of different RSOM-hub options. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the impact of different operational parameters on hub performance and optimal locations. The study indicated that the optimal number of RSOM-hubs for MAJAID operations in the North would be two, corresponding to Iqaluit and Yellowknife.

The objective of this paper is to compare the dynamic response of bridge-vehicle coupled vibration between scale-model test and numerical analysis. In order to study the vibration response of a simple supported bridge subjected to a moving vehicle, three methods are introduced. Firstly, the equations of motion for bridge and vehicle are established respectively, an iteration solution method is presented to analyse the coupled vibration response of vehicle-bridge system based on the same displacement and coupling force at the interface. Nextly, the visualization approach to simulate the dynamic response of vehicle-bridge coupled vibration is put forward, through building 3-D FE models of vehicle and bridge using LS-DYNA. Lastly, based on the similitude law of bridge-vehicle interaction system, the simple girder bridge model test that the scale factor of geometry is 10.0 , the static and dynamic response of model bridge are studied subjected to a moving vehicle . Comparative results between the testing of model bridge and numerical analysis of practical bridge conforms the feasibility of model text equipment and the validity of the text results. At the same time, the results also show efficiency and stabilization of the numerical simulation.

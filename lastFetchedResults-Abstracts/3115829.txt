Appraises on customerpsilas cooperation system result often needs to observe many operating indexes. In fact, the most difficult point of customerpsilas cooperation result computation and the appraisal is the multi-objective of customerpsilas cooperation system. Regarding the kind of multivariable space point, itpsilas very difficult to compare its fit and unfit quality directly. Therefore, this paper, based on AHP method, tries to resolve the key issues of the effective calculation and evaluation process between customerpsilas cooperation with the composite fuzzy evaluation of fuzzy measures and fuzzy integral theory.

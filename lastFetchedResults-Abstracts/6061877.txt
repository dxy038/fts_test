The project objective is the creation of a new method of drug quality control and the express analysis of molecular mechanisms of drugs in vitro on the basis of dielectrometry in the region of free water relaxation. The methodology of the analysis was created on the basis of integration of the dielectrometry method in the region of free water relaxation, X-ray analysis and traditional biochemical technologies. It was tried out on bioobjects with different levels of organization, from macromolecules to cells. The studying by this method of the nearest hydrate environment of macromolecules with the help of the X-ray analysis has allowed the authors to construct the model of the hydrate environment. It was shown that the hydrate environment is a replica of the macromolecule structure and follows conformation modifications while its reorganization. This approach includes researches of biopolymer hydration, conformational modifications and reorientation of the biopolymer-water system under the structure functional reorganization of macromolecule and supramolecular organization

The ability of an organization to perform some critical military tasks in a timely manner may depend on the availability of a sufficient number of appropriate vehicles. Therefore, the decision of which is the best military fleet-mix for a given set of requirements should take into consideration, in addition to cost, the ability of the fleet to perform tasks when some of its vehicles are unavailable. In this paper, a measure of the flexibility of military air mobility fleets is presented that evaluates their ability to perform tasks in a timely manner taking into account the possibility that some aircraft in the fleet may be unavailable at any given time. This measure computes the number of aircraft that must be unavailable in order to render a fleet incapable of performing each task in a timely manner. The utility of the flexibility measure is demonstrated by using it as an objective in a multiobjective optimization framework to compute nondominated fleets with respect to cost and flexibility. An artificial data set that is representative of real military air mobility data is used to illustrate how the new flexibility measure may be used to aid decision makers with their fleet mix problems.

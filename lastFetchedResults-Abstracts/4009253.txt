Recent development in small renewable/clean generation technologies such as wind turbines, photovoltaic, fuel cells, microturbines and so on has drawn distribution utilities´ attention to possible changes in the distribution system infrastructure and policy by deploying distributed generation (DG) in distribution systems. In this study, a methodology has been proposed for optimally allocating wind-based DG units in the distribution system so as to minimise annual energy loss. The methodology is based on generating a probabilistic generation´load model that combines all possible operating conditions of the wind-based DG units and load levels with their probabilities, hence accommodating this model in a deterministic planning problem. The planning problem is formulated as mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP), with an objective function for the system´s annual energy losses minimise. The constraints include voltage limits at different buses (slack and load buses) of the system, feeder capacity, discrete size of the DG units, maximum investment on each bus, and maximum penetration limit of DG units. This proposed technique is applied to a typical rural distribution system and compared to the traditional planning technique (constant output power of DG units and constant peak load profile).

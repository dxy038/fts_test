The real time services are being deployed over the Internet. Interdomain QoS advertising and routing, based on BGP, are important to enable end-to-end QoS guarantees in the Internet. The objective of this article is to discuss and propose an algorithm based on BGP parameters to provide QoS interdomain routing and to prove its positive impact on the QoS parameters as IP packet loss, packet end-to-end delay of UDP applications, link throughput and response time of many applications. This algorithm will improve the QoS parameters by reducing the IP packet loss in case of UDP congestion.

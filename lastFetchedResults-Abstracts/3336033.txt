It is well known that geometry is of significance to the performance of multistatic radars. In multistatic passive radars the receiver placement is especially critical since the transmitters of opportunity are beyond control of radar designer. Instead of considering a single objective, we suggest to implement the receiver placement by using multiobjective optimization in this paper. Specifically, three objectives with clear physical meaning are constructed. Then optimal operating points are explored through Pareto optimization. The receiver placement approach is demonstrated via a numerical example.

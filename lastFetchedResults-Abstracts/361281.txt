Study objective: To determine the rate of interobserver reliability of the Canadian Emergency Department Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS). Methods:  Ten physicians and 10 nurses were randomly selected to review and assign a triage level on 50 ED case summaries containing presenting complaint, mode of arrival, vital signs, and a verbatim triage note. The rate of agreement within and between groups of raters was determined using κ statistics. One-way, 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and combined ANOVA were used to quantify reliability coefficients for intraclass and interclass correlations. Results:  The overall chance-corrected agreement κ for all observers was .80 (95% confidence interval [CI] .79 to .81), and the probability of agreement between 2 random observers on a random case was .539. For nurses alone, κ=.84 (95% CI .83 to .85, P =.598), and for doctors alone, κ=.83 (95% CI .81 to .85, P  =.566). The 1-way, 2-way ANOVA and combined ANOVA showed that the reliability coefficients (84%) for both nurses and physicians were similar to the κ values. A combined ANOVA showed there was a .2-point difference with physicians assigning a higher triage level. Conclusion:  The high rate of interobserver agreement has important implications for case mix comparisons and suggests that this scale is understood and interpreted in a similar fashion by nurses and physicians.

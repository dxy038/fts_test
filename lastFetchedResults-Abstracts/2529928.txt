  Objective: The plantar sensory impairments has an impact on the balance . Textured insoles are being used to improve foot sensation and balance. The majority of the literature has only focused on the intervention applied to the plantar surface; no adequate attention paid toward other area of the foot such as dorsum surface. This study was to compare the effect of textured insoles on ankle proprioception and balance.   Materials & methods: 16 females, 14 males with the history of falling during the last year were recruited in this study. They were randomly tested in four different conditions : textured insole, textured collar and tongue, placebo insole, and no insole. Ankle joint position sense and balance tests including “forward reach test” and “timed up and go” were carried out by all participants. All data were recorded and analyzed using “repeated measure ANOVA”.   Results: Participants did the ankle joint position sense with smaller errors while using textured insole (P<0.01). The recorded time showed a significant reduction when textured insole used over the dorsal surface and around the ankle, in timed up and go test (P<0.01).   Conclusion: It has been postulated that using the textured insole in different instep area of a shoe could improve the somatosensory sensation, functional balance and proprioception.

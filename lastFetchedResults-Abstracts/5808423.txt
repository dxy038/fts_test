Because of the complementarity of process planning and scheduling and the multi objectives requirement from the real-world production, the research of this paper focuses on the multi-objective collaborative process planning and scheduling problem. In this paper, a game theory based genetic algorithm has been proposed to solve this problem. The game theory is used to deal with the multi objectives. And a genetic algorithm is used to identify optimal solutions efficiently from the vast search space. The experimental results show that the developed approach has achieved satisfactory improvement.

A subjective quality test for the comparison of object-based (modeled, animated) and pixel-based video material has been carried out and the results are summarized in this paper. Tests showed that well known objective quality measures produce arguable results in this test constellation and therefore subjective quality assessment is the only way to reliably judge these test cases. The results show, that observers are very confident with the judgment of video material and can very well distinguish between different quality levels. For 10 out of 12 test cases, the observers could not distinguish the object-based from the original video material.

To optimize a sensor (and a mission), the existing knowledge about the scientific problem and about the available technology should be used. That is the objective of the optimization concept used here. The optimization concept is based on an error function which compares assumed values with the estimated values of the parameters provided by the experiment. The error on the consideration is a function of some instrument (and mission) parameters which can be optimally chosen by minimizing the error function taking into account the technological (and cost) limitations. For this approach a numerical simulation tool has been developed that allows computer experiments with specific sensor configurations for design and optimization of optoelectronic sensors for specific (well known) applications. Such a concept is important for the development of dedicated sensors for well defined remote sensing tasks to obtain the optimal solution of the problem.

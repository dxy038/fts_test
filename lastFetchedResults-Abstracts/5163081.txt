It is no doubt that design risk management(DRM) plays an important role in safety, quality, schedule and cost of the large-scale construction project, with complex and special surroundings and control objects, more efficient and quantitative methods are urgently required to analyze and predict the focus of DRM which need to be controlled. Simplifying and processing these complex parameters in DRM as a particular source, complying them with the basic assumptions of entropy theory, the entropy method which synthetically considering subjective and objective weight would help to identify risk factors and risk events in the practical construction project and provide a more powerful technical support for a scientific decision-making and management from the perspective of information theory.

This inquiry is an applied-base objective, a correlation-base nature/methodology. The statistical population entails the employees of the preceding organizations; the number of them added up to 1403 individuals in 2015. The sample includes 302 subjects based upon Kerjcie & Morgan table (1970) which appointed in proportionate stratified random sampling regarding each department portion and the connected personnel. The data gathering tools have been two standard questionnaires. To test the hypotheses, first, the probe measurement models evaluated and estimated in Amos Graphic Software via confirmatory factor analysis. Then, they fitted via structural equation modeling. Also, the investigation models studied and assessed through six indices (Chi Square; Normalized Chi Square; Incremental Fitness; Comparative Fitness; Tucker- Lewis; and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation). The findings show that organizational culture and two components (task oriented/support oriented) do not have significant effect on trust making. But, the component success oriented has significant and inverse effect on trust making.

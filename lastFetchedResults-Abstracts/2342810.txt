Increasing industrial requirements on the precision of edge geometry lead to the investigation of burr formation, particularly in finishing operations such as grinding. The objective of the presented research is to understand the mechanisms of burr formation in grinding. Following a description of previous research and existing approaches to understand burr formation in grinding, experimental investigations in flat surface grinding of tempered steel are described. Based on the previous studies and the experimental results, a descriptive model of burr formation in grinding is proposed.

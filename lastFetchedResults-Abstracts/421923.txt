Objectives
The objective of this prospective study was to determine the differences in the prognostic significance of an exercise test (ET) that indicates a low risk of events (low-risk exercise test [LRET]) between patients with unstable angina (UA) and those with chronic stable angina (CSA).
Background

It is not known whether the prognostic significance of an LRET is influenced by the disease; that is the reason for performing exercise testing.
Methods

All patients not presenting with high-risk criteria were submitted to a prognostic ET. The ET was performed by patients with CSA and patients with primary UA stabilized with medical therapy. Medical therapy was planned for all patients. A combined end point was defined as cardiac death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction or hospital admission for UA. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the independent predictors of events.
Results

Low-risk criteria were fulfilled by 105 patients with UA and 86 patients with CSA. The mean follow-up time was 347 Â± 229 days. The event rate was higher in the UA group than in the CSA group (28% vs. 9%, P = 0.001). The CSA group showed worse ET results. Performance of ET by patients with UA was the principal predictor of events (odds ratio 4.2, P = 0.0005).
Conclusions

Among patients who underwent an LRET, those with UA had a rate of events significantly higher than that of patients with CSA, despite the worse results of ET in patients with CSA.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Regarding the role of lice in the transmission of different diseases, and also as an important agent of determining the hygiene level in the society. This study was performed to assess the prevalence of pediculosis in primary school students of Babol in 2003-2004.
METHODS: In this study, from 15500 primary school students in Babol, 2300 ones (girl and boy) were assessed. Cluster sampling was done in girl and boy school. Data was collected by questionnaire containing personal and family characteristics.
FINDINGS: Findings showed that 51 students (%2.2) were infected to pediculosis (head lice or nit) and only in two samples live head lice were found. Prevalence of infestation was significantly higher in girls (%3.48) than boys (%0.96) (p<0.000). Prevalence of pediculosis in students had a significant correlation with fathers' education (p<0.005) and number of children in family (p=0.018),
CONCLUSION: The results showed that the prevalence of pediculosis in students of Babol was almost low. Since the father's educational level of students who were infested to pediculosis was lower than other educational level of other students' fathers, so it is recommended that necessary actions be taken to promote public knowledge in order to control and prevent pediculosis.

Background & aim: One of the goals of central venous catheter (CVC) insertion is monitoring of fluid therapy, but the catheter insertion can be associated with several complications. The objective of this study was to determine the role of radiology in central venous catheter complications.

Case presentation: 77-year-old woman, a known case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia due to deep vein thrombosis treated with warfarin  and due to peritonitis is undergoing emergency surgery.  After insertion of central venous catheters and receiving fresh frozen plasma to correct the clotting dysfunction, the candidate is transferred to the operating room. Once during Intraoperative and again immediately after entering the ICU were involved with ventricular arrhythmia.  Chest x-ray showed massive unilateral hydrothorax. 

Conclusion:   Most complications of central venous catheter is diagnosed on chest radiograph and appropriate treatment of these complications is tsaving. 

Key words: Central Venous Catheter, Hydrothorax, Radiography

Super high-speed and high-power electric machines are required for turbomolecular pumps and spindle drives. High rotational speed and high power drives can be achieved with bearingless motors. In the paper a novel switched reluctance bearingless motor (SRBM) with principles of traditional switched reluctance motors is proposed and its performance characteristics are analysed. Its main difference from other bearingless motors is its owning same single layer of winding structure of a common switched reluctance motor (SRM) and that multi-winding driving is implemented to generate the levitation force and torque. Considering coupling inductance and a developed magnetic flux equation expressing the flux distribution between stator and rotor poles, simulation model and dSPACE experimental model with disturbance force because of displacement have been created to investigate its performance characteristics. Further a novel SRM bidirectional converter topology is designed to improve its operation. Finally its performance characteristics are depicted for a test motor.

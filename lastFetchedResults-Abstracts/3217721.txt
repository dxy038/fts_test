Association rules mining is a process of finding patterns from a very large volumes of data. The Apriori algorithm is the best-known association rules mining algorithm, whose objective is to find all co-occurrence relationships between data items. In this paper, a methodology that combines the Apriori algorithm with a domain-specific ontology is proposed. This method is to effectively utilize domain ontologies to find multiple layer association rules.

Honeynets have been proven to be valuable research and teaching tool in the area of computer security and information assurance. At Towson University, since Fall 2002, an undergraduate track in computer security has been made available to the computer science majors. The main objective of the track is to build upon the core courses in the computer science program and to provide students with hands-on experience with security tools commonly used in industry. This paper explores educational use of honeynets in several courses required by this track.

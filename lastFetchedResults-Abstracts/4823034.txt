We introduce a fuzzy based engine for the scheduling problem. We assume that a human planner is unable to determine the weights for a multi-objective system but is able only to compare between pairs of objectives according to a limited vocabulary. We convert this vocabulary to fuzzy terminology and apply a fuzzy based optimum search for a solution to the scheduling problem. We demonstrate our approach using a real world scheduling system.

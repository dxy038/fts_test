The NSF/IEEE Center for Computer Applications in Electromagnetic Education (CAEME) was established in early 1990 as a result of a grant from the Undergraduate Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Division of the National Science Foundation. To help provide broad and international participation in its activities, the Center is managed by the executive office of IEEE. CAEMEÂ´s objective is to stimulate and accelerate the use of computers and software tools to help boost electrmagnetic education. It is shown in this paper that the Center has helped in propagating effective EM education by providing seed funds for software development projects, organizing workshops and special sessions, and through the publication of software books that contain diskettes of developed software. The Center also developed interactive video lessons and is almost self-supporting through corporate sponsorship.

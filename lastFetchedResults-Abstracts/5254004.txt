This paper considers the general model involving fuzzy appraisal system based on multiple weights. In evaluation problems, weight is the key factor that influences the final assessment results. Hence, how to find a more objective and realistic way to suit the different weigh system is an important topic. However, in tradition way, the vagueness of linguistic terms used by decision maker, such as important etc., is not considered when assessment of relative weight results. Therefore, In order to obtain more precise aggregate evaluation results, a general model of fuzzy appraisal system based on multiple weights is proposed, in which the linguistic terms are applied. Furthermore, both in the aspect of expertsÂ´ weight and evaluation structure, two-stage situation are considered simultaneously. In discussion section, it is shown that this general model is not only suit for the two-stage situation, but also for one-stage situation as well.

Two augmented switching cells are proposed from which four novel topologies can be derived: an augmented buck converter, and augmented boost converter, a novel switching power amplifier, and a novel switching controlled rectifier. The augmented buck and the augmented boost converters realize higher step-down and step-up ratios, respectively, under a given switch duty ratio by proper design of the turn ratios of the transformer and coupled inductor. The switching power amplifier achieves four-quadrant output by the use of two bidirectional current switches and a single power supply, while the inverse converter can be used as a switching controlled rectifier. The experimental verification of the power amplifier is presented.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

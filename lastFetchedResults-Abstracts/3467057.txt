A design study is being carried out for the European Science Foundation of an electron storage ring which will, if built, be an extremely intense dedicated source of x-radiation. The objective is to provide many ports from bending magnets, with a characteristic wavelength (&#194;&#191;c) of 1 &#195;&#133;; a few hard x-ray ports from wigglers, with &#194;&#191;c &lt; 1/4 &#195;&#133;, and six tunable undulators providing quasi-monochromatic radiation from 1 &#195;&#133; to 25 &#195;&#133;. A very high brightness is required. The paper describes a well-behaved magnet lattice giving a very low emittance coupled with appropriate beam parameters in different regions of the lattice. A preliminary outline of some of the other main features of the proposed storage ring is included.

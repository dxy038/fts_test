Polysilicon thin film transistors (TFT) are of great interest in the field of large area microelectronics, especially because of their application as active elements in flat panel displays. Different deposition techniques are in tough competition with the objective to obtain device-quality polysilicon thin films at low temperature. In this paper we present the preliminary results obtained with the fabrication of TFT deposited by hot-wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD). Some results concerned with the structural characterization of the material and electrical performance of the device are presented.

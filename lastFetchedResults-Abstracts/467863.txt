OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to improve the therapeutic index of radical hysterectomy by extending the resection of parametrial tissue without further impairing pelvic autonomic nerve functions. STUDY DESIGN: We studied the topographic anatomy of the parametrial tissue with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and by dissection of fresh human cadavers. We then performed a clinical feasibility study of the liposuction-assisted nerve-sparing extended radical hysterectomy. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the perispinous adipose tissue is retained after type III radical hysterectomy and is a frequent site of tumor recurrence. The perispinous adipose tissue contains the pelvic plexus, the pelvic splanchnic nerves, small blood vessels, and lymphatic tissue. We developed the liposuction-assisted nerve-sparing extended radical hysterectomy and applied it to seven consecutive patients with cervical or vaginal cancer. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging assured us that perispinous adipose tissue was cleared in all cases. A metastatic lymph node was found in the perispinous adipose tissue removed by liposuction from one patient. Suprapubic cystostomies could be removed after a median period of 12 days. CONCLUSION: The nerve-sparing removal of perispinous adipose tissue by liposuction is a feasible addition to wide en bloc parametrectomy in anatomically defined planes.

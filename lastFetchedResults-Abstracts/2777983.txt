Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is able to prolong the lifetime of energy constrained wireless networks. In this paper, we consider the relay beamforming design problem for SWIPT scheme in a non-regenerative two-way multi-antenna relay network. Our objective is to maximize the sum rate of two-way relay network under the transmit power constraint at relay and the energy harvesting (EH) constraint at EH receiver. For the non-convex EH-constrained relay beamforming optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm to find the global optimal solution based on semidefinite programming and rank-one decomposition theorem. To reduce computational complexity of global optimal solution, we transform the EH-constrained optimization problem to a difference of convex programming and propose a constrained concave convex procedure based iterative algorithm to find a local optimum. To further reduce the complexity, we propose a suboptimal solution based on the generalized eigenvectors method. When the case of multi-antenna sources is considered, we propose the alternating optimization based iterative algorithms. It is shown from simulations that considering the EH constraint, our proposed schemes outperform conventional relay beamforming schemes in the literature.

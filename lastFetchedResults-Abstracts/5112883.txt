Pelvic floor diseases cover pathologies of which physiopathology is not well understood. 2D sagittal MRI sequences used in the clinical assessment allow to visualize the dynamic behavior of the main organs involved (bladder, uterus-vagina and rectum). Clinicians use anatomical landmarks and measurements related to the pelvic organs in their pathology assessment. Usually, those tasks are performed manually which results in being both tedious and subject to operator dependency. A methodology is proposed to attempt a quantitative and objective characterization of the organ behaviors under abdominal strain condition. This approach automatically assesses the organ movements, through the estimation of characteristic angles (anorectal angle, uterovaginal angle, bladder inclination), and the tracking of anatomically significant points (anorectal angle vertex, uterovaginal angle vertex, bladder neck). From a multi-subject analysis, pathological organs have been distinguished from healthy ones, which shows the relevance of the computed features. In addition, a stability analysis has shown the soundness of the approach.

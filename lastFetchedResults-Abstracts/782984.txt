Objective The aim of this study was to examine
perceptions of the place of advance directives in
mental health care. Methods Postal survey of stakeholders
was carried out to assess their views on different
models of advance directives in mental health care.A total
of 473 responded. Results In all, 28% of psychiatrists
thought advance directives were needed compared to
89% of voluntary organisations and above two-thirds of
the other stakeholder groups. There were clear tensions
between patient ‘autonomy’ and ‘right to treatment’
which underpin many of the concerns raised.Autonomy
provided by advance directive can be contrasted with a
co-operative partnership approach to advance planning.
The legal status of advance directives is important
for some people in relation to treatment refusal. There
was general concern about the practical issues surrounding
their implementation. Conclusion There is a
wide range of views in all stakeholder groups about the
possible form advance directives should take.Although
there is a widespread desire to increase patient involvement
in treatment decisions, which advance directives
could possibly help to realise, they may also have unwanted
consequences for mental health services and individuals.

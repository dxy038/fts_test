OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether women with multiple sclerosis who deliver singleton infants are more likely to have pregnancy or delivery complications or to have infants with low birth weight, preterm gestation, or malformations than women without multiple sclerosis and to compare their need for rehospitalization during the 2 years after delivery. Study Design: This was a population-based cohort study that used Washington State linked birth certificate-hospital discharge records for singleton births from 1987 through 1996. Pregnancy course, birth outcomes, and need for rehospitalization within 2 years after delivery were compared for 198 women with multiple sclerosis and a comparison group of 1584 women. RESULTS: With the exception of maternal anemia, women with multiple sclerosis were no more likely to have pregnancy or delivery complications, nor were their infants more likely to be low birth weight or preterm or to have malformations. Affected women were, however, twice as likely to be rehospitalized during the 3 months after delivery. CONCLUSION: The increased risk of rehospitalization emphasizes a need for strong support systems and close monitoring during the 3 months after delivery. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;186:446-52.)

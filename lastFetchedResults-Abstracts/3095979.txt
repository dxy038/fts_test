An image database of echocardiograms, EVALECHOCARD, dedicated to regional wall motion scoring is presented. It is devoted to become a public reference database, in order to develop an objective comparison on the same data of different computer vision packages aiming at scoring the regional wall motion. The database construction is described, including the data acquisition, the expertsÂ´ annotation and the database constitution. Results on the composition of the database are presented. The choice of data acquired on in-hospital patients, suspected of various cardiac diseases, has provided a high rate of pathological segments (39%). Moreover, difficult cases, such as low echogenic patients, were not discarded from the database. Therefore, this information which is available for each segment can be used pertinently to measure the performances of the different algorithms.

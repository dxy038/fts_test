Background and Objective: salvia officinalis L. consists of, glycosides, flavonoids, and anthocyanins. Due to the increasing use of medicinal plants in treatment of diseases and their side effects on various organs, this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of salvia officinalis on biochemical blood parameters in male rats.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 24 male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups of 6 animals each. The control group received normal saline and treatment groups received 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg body weight of salvia extract for 14 days. Body weight was measured in days 0, 7, and 14. At the end of the experiment, serum levels of liver function enzymes such as AST and ALT, total proteins, albumin, creatinine, cholesterol and triglyceride were assessed. Results were analyzed using one- way ANOVA and Tukey test.
Results: According to the results, plasma concentrations of protein, albumin and creatinine showed a significant increase (P < 0.05) but, a significant decrease was observed in liver enzymes. No significant changes were observed in serum cholesterol, triglyceride levels and body weight in the control and salvia groups (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: The results indicated that Salvia Officinalis probably contains flavonoidic components with antioxidant effect leading to the increase in albumin and decrease in liver enzymes.

This slide presentation intends to answer the problems faced by the RF technology, by exercising visible light systems for mobile signal transmission in an indoor environment. It put forth the objective that with the adoption of frequency translation, in combination with simple communication entities, the proposed enterprise can be traversed in cellular application. A key characteristic contribution is the inception of radio on visible light communication system, bearing the potential to bestow connectivity to indoor cell phone users in RF restricted or poor signal connectivity areas.

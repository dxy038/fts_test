Objective: Short stature has different prevalence in different countries, which varies from 2% to 10 % and has multiple etiologic factors. Short stature can have a natural course or pathologic causes. Rapid diagnosis, accurate treatment (in curable causes) is important, and if treated, its complications can be inhibited. The aim of the present study was to identify of prevalence of short stature among first year primary school students in Ahwaz, and its relation with factors such as: economic status, family problems, short birth height and weight, and genetic causes.

Subjects and Methods: In this study 698 students in their first year primary school in Ahwaz were selected in cluster pattern, and their heights and weights were measured and an questionnaire was filled which included information on the number of family members, economic status, fathers job, history of short stature in parents and family members and height and weight at the birth time.

Results: In this study 344 (44.3 %) of cases were females and 354 cases were males (50.7%). Prevalence of short stature was 3.7 % equally in both sexes. Also there was a direct relation between short statures and low weight at birth, as well as with family problems (separated parents) and parents short height. However, there was no significant relationship between short stature and economic status, number of family member, and presence of mother-in-law. Conclusion: Our study revealed that there is a statically significant relationship between short stature and low weight at birth, positive history of short parents or other family members and separation of parents. But more studies on role of other etiologic factors are needed

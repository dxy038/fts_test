OBJECTIVE: Several lines of evidence suggest that expression of the WT1 transcription factor gene is necessary for normal development of the renal and male reproductive systems. Female patients with severe reproductive tract developmental defects were examined for WT1 gene mutations.
STUDY DESIGN: The WT1 gene was analyzed in 25 patients with congenital absence of the uterus and vagina for mutations. Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid prepared from blood leukocytes was subjected to Southern blot analysis and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
RESULTS: Common WT1 gene deoxyribonucleic acid sequence polymorphisms were found in both normal control subjects and patients with congenital absence of the uterus and vagina. No deoxyribonucleic sequence differences or mutations likely to cause congenital absence of the uterus and vagina were detected in the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The absence of WT1 gene mutations in patients with congenital absence of the uterus and vagina supports the hypothesis that WT1 expression is required only for later urogenital development, after the mesonephric and paramesonephric ducts have already formed.

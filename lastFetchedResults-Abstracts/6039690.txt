Nonlinear kernel Support Vector Machines achieve better generalizations, yet their training and evaluation speeds are prohibitively slow for real-time object detection tasks where the number of data points in training and the number of hypotheses to be tested in evaluation are in the order of millions. To accelerate the training and particularly testing of such nonlinear kernel machines, we map the input data onto a low-dimensional spectral (Fourier) feature space using a cosine transform, design a kernel that approximates the classification objective in a supervised setting, and apply a fast linear classifier instead of the conventional radial basis functions. We present a data driven hypotheses generation technique and a LogistBoost feature selection. Our experimental results demonstrate the computational improvements 20~100&#215; while maintaining a high classification accuracy in comparison to SVM linear and radial kernel basis function classifiers.

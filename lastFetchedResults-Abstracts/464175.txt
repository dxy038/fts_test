OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the effect of cervical application of 20% benzocaine on the pain associated with subsequent cervical injection of local anesthetic and tissue excision during the loop electrosurgical excision procedure of the cervix.
STUDY DESIGN: Fifty consecutive women scheduled for loop electrosurgical excision were randomized by use of computer-generated numbers to receive cervical application of either 20% benzocaine or placebo gel in a double-blinded fashion. A visual analog scale was used to measure the pain associated with both cervical injection of local anesthetic and tissue excision.
RESULTS: Lower mean pain scores were associated with the use of benzocaine gel for both anesthetic injection and tissue excision, but these scores did not reach statistical significance in either group.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative cervical application of 20% benzocaine does not appear to reduce the pain associated with either subsequent local anesthetic injection or tissue excision during the loop electrosurgical excision procedure of the cervix.

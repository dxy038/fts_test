The first aim of this study is to investigate the possibilities of integrating temporal information from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily time series and spatial information from high resolution satellite images by means of subpixel unmixing Our second objective is concentrated on the use of these images in order to carry out direct radiometric correction of high-resolution optical imagery of corresponding spectral wavelengths over the same area. Our results show that although the preprocessing of the MODIS surface reflectance time series diminished the noise, it was insufficient for carrying subpixel analysis. Therefore, we propose a method for the polygon-based representation of MODIS data for more accurate subpixel analysis. On the other hand, our radiometric rectification results with MODIS reference data yielded convincing results.

The main objective of this paper is to propose a new controller scheme for robot manipulators on Cartesian space with formal stability proof. To verify the performance of the proposed controller we compared its behavior with the Cartesian PD controller. In this paper we described an experimental Cartesian robot for research and development of robot control algorithms. This system allows the development and easy test of Cartesian control strategies on three degrees of freedom. The functionality of this system is explained via real-time experimental results of a new position control algorithm with global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system

The objective of the WAVEMOD project is to develop a probabilistic methodology for coastal site investigations. The methodology allows integration of complex or irregular phenomena through a combination of physical insight and statistical analysis of actual observations. A probabilistic approach to derive the design conditions for coastal engineering problems, development of stochastic models of waves and current parameters and integration of existing data with new measurements and mathematical models are the main topics of the project

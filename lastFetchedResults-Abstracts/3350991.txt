The integration of Renewable Energies (RE) into the existing energy supply system has proven to very challenging due to the fluctuating nature of RE ressources. However, the negative environmental impacts of power generation can be significantly reduced by limiting the share of fossil fuels used in energy production. As a result wind and photovoltaic capacity in the synchronous grid of continental Europe (UCTE) is increasing. Thus both the European Union and Germany have set ambitious goals for the future growth of RE. The objective of this paper is to show the impacts of RE generation on the dispatch of generation from conventional plants while taking into account must-run capacities of combined heat and power (CHP) plants in district heating grids. Furthermore, the presented results give an estimation for the decrease of rotating masses that are caused by the replacement of conventional plants by RE converters. Subsequently, counteractive measures such as energy storage in the district heating grid and wind inertia control will be discussed.

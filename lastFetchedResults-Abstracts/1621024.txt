The objective of this work was to understand the physico-chemical changes induced in a wheat starch model system as a result of microwave heating. Wheat starch dispersions in water, with final solids content of 33%, 40% or 50%, were heated in a microwave oven. Following heating the samples were stored at 25 Â°C for up to 120 h and analyzed periodically. Microwave heated gels were significantly different from conduction heated gels in all parameters measured. The differences in properties are a reflection of the differences in the heat and mass transfer of the different modes of heating. The lack of granule swelling and the resulting soft gel are two key observations. The results of this study suggest a different mechanism of starch gelatinization compared to conduction heating. The vibrational motion and the rapid increase in temperature also result in granule rupture and formation of film polymers coating the granule surface.

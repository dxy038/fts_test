Geometric programming is a methodology for solving algebraic nonlinear optimization
problems. It provides a powerful tool for solving nonlinear problems where nonlinear relations can be
well presented by an exponential or power function. This feature is especially advantageous in situations
where the optimal value of the objective function may be all that is of interest. In such cases, calculation
of the optimum design vectors can be omitted. The goal of this paper is to state the problem of Pressure
vessel design and after that ?nding a better optimized solution using geometric programme.

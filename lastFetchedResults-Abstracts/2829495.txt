In this work, we apply the PD-type iterative learning control method to address the traffic density control problem in a microscopic level freeway environment with ramp metering. Here the traffic density control problem is an output tracking problem with an appropriate tracking objective. In order to verify the effectiveness of proposed method, we perform comparison experiments on the microscopic traffic simulation platform Paramics, and PD-type iterative learning control exhibits an excellent control performance in the experiments.

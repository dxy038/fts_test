Objective
Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), characterized with decreased
compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) and absence of demyelinating
findings in electrophysiological studies, is a subtype of Guillain-Barre
Syndrome (GBS). A 4 yr-old male patient presented with ascending weakness,
dysarthria and dysphagia to ?stanbul Dr. Lütfi K?rdar Kartal Training and
Research Hospital Neurology outpatient for three days to in 2012. Dysphonia,
restricted eye movements, flaccid tetraplegia and areflexia were found in
neurological examination. There were motor conduction blocks in all peripheral
nerves in electrophysiological studies.According to these findings the patient
was diagnosed as Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy
(AIDP). Reduction of CMAP amplitudes in posterior tibial nerve, absence of
CMAPs in median, ulnar and peroneal nerves and loss of motor conduction
blocks were found in following electrophysiological studies. According to
these findings, patient was diagnosed as AMAN. Motor conduction blocks
may appear in early stage of AMAN and they disappear in later examinations.
That’s why electrophysiological studies must be repeated in patients with
GBS.

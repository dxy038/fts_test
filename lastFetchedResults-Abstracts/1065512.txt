Background and Objective: The teacher is the most important factor in achieving educational goals in any academic institution. Awareness of student opinions about the characteristics of a good teacher can help us to determine the principles of evaluation of teaching and learning activities. The present study was carried out to determine the characteristics of a good teacher from the viewpoint of students of Sanandaj University of Applied Sciences.
Materials and Methods: The present research was a cross-sectional study. Samples were all of students of Sanandaj University of Applied Sciences who had passed at least two semesters and were enrolled in the second semester of the academic year of 2013. Of those, 384 students were randomly selected. The data gathering tool was a questionnaire consisting of two parts: demographic questions and questions related to the characteristics of a good teacher. For data analysis spss version 16 was used.
Results: From the viewpoint of the students, mastery of the subject matter taught by the teacher, general knowledge about teaching of the lesson, trying to understand the lesson and answering students' questions and teaching experience of the teacher were most important. The least important characteristics of a good educator were paying attention to the students, holding quizzes and midterm exam, academic rank, compliance with educational regulations and dropping the  students who exceed absent-from-class limit. There was no statistically significant relationship between sex, course of study and the six areas of the characteristics of a good teacher (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: The results of the present study show that in the selection of the teachers, high academic abilities, familiarity with the methods of communication, and appropriate ways of dealing with students should be given greater weight.

Lipid metabolism disorder and oxidative stress play an important role on the development and progression of alcoholic liver disease (ALD), and mitochondria compartment is presumed as the main source and susceptible target of intracellular ROS. The objective of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoids possessing both antioxidant and hypolipidemic effect, on ethanol-induced dyslipidemia and oxidative damage focused on mitochondria. Chronic alcohol administration for adult male rats (4.0 g/kg for 90 days) resulted in the leakage of alanine and especially aspartate aminotransferases, and morphological malformation mainly evidenced by sustained lipid infiltration and degenerative changes on mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum, which was markedly alleviated by quercetin (100 mg/kg.bw.) pretreatment. Furthermore, quercetin prophylaxis evidently ameliorated ethanol-stimulated mitochondrial dysfunction manifested by decreased membrane potential and induced permeability transition though suppressing glutathione depletion, enzymatic inactivation of manganese superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, ROS over-generation, and lipid peroxidation in mitochondria. Quercetin, thus, may protect rat, especially hepatic mitochondria, from chronic ethanol toxicity through its hypolipidemic effect and antioxidative role, highlighting a promising preventive strategy for ALD by naturally occurring phytochemicals.

In an ad-hoc network, packet flow management is a major challenge due to rapid change of network structure. In heterogeneous queue monitoring scenario, some protocol dispatch packets according to their priority. As a result of these queue monitoring policies, packets that have lower priority leads to starvation even if they have travelled a long hop distance, hence the packet is dropped. Considering the above problem, the major objective is to develop a fair and active queue monitoring approach. In this paper, we present fair and reliable transmission control protocol (FRTCP) for ad hoc networks. The objective of this protocol is to provide fairness among the packets with different priority level. Simultaneously, the protocol addresses multiple flow transport events from different sources to sink nodes with minimum packet loss. The experimental result shows that the proposed protocol achieves high performance in terms of fairness and energy consumption in comparison to existing protocols.

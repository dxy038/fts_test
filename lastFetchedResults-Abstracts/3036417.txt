In this paper the influence of a contingency in the series compensation (SC) device allocation and size is evaluated. The SC placement and size are determined using an optimal power flow (OPF) program via the Benders cut technique to include the contingency influence. This problem is solved in two steps: (i) The SC size and placement are determined as an investment OPF subproblem. The SC cost and energy production cost are included in the objective function; (ii) The operation OPF subproblem is solved considering the specified line and generation outages. The Benders cut are generated according to the outage occurrence probability. In this case the objective function is the minimum load shedding and energy production cost. The OPF subproblems are solved using linear programming technique. The IEEE-14 bus and IEEE-118 bus test systems are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

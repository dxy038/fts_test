Bidirectional wireless communication between two multi-antenna terminals that operate in a full-duplex mode is considered. The effects of loopback self-interference and transmit-side noise due to radio front-end imperfections are analyzed in the asymptotic regime where the number of antennas at both terminals grows large. The study compares two transparent mitigation schemes by which conventional spatial multiplexing can operate without being aware of the self-interference issue: spatial-domain null-space projection and time-domain subtractive cancellation. Both schemes eliminate the information-bearing part of the self-interference perfectly, but due to transmitter imperfections, the cancellation approach suffers from residual self-interference. The receive-side null-space projection, on the other hand, suppresses also the transmit-side distortion, but at the cost of reduction in the degrees of freedom available for data reception. The results indicate that suppression becomes preferred when the level of transmit-side noise increases and the receiver does not have instantaneous knowledge about the spatial structure of the self-interference. Exhaustive Monte Carlo simulations also show that the asymptotic analytical results are useful for evaluating the performance of practical not-so-large systems.

In the present work the field synergy principle is applied to the optimization design of the shell-and-tube heat exchanger with segmental baffles. The field synergy number which is defined as the indicator of the synergy between the velocity field and the heat flow is taken as the objective function. The genetic algorithm is employed to solve the heat exchanger optimization problems with multiple design variables. The field synergy number maximization approach for heat exchanger optimization design is thus formulated. In comparison with the initial design, the optimal design leads to a significant cost cut on the one hand and an improvement of the heat exchanger performance on the other hand. The comparison with the traditional heat exchanger optimization design approach with the total cost as the objective function shows that the field synergy number maximization approach is more advantageous.

An agent-based control system that coordinates the battery charging of electric vehicles in distribution networks is presented. The objective of the control system is to charge the electric vehicles at times of low electricity prices within distribution network technical constraints. Search techniques and neural networks are used for the decision making of the agents. The ability of the control system to work successfully when the distribution network is operated within its loading limits and when the loading limits are violated is demonstrated through experimental validation .

This hardware/software (hw/sw) codesign language (CDL) is a small subset of ANSI/ISO Ada. It has existed since 1980 when VHDL was initiated and is contained in IEEE 1076 VHDL-1993 with only minor differences. The objective is to design core processors using available Ada compilers on any PC. It is used as hardware description language (HDL) using Boolean expressions or alternative gate-level implementations, and to program tests and utility tools as required

This paper presents transmission expansion planning of a practical multi-zone system by using the famous genetic algorithm (GA). The system, which consists of 19 buses, 7 zones and 3 voltage levels, is part of a transmission network in Thailand. The load forecast for each zone is given for 5 years. The objective of transmission expansion for this system is to find the routes, conductor types and voltage levels of the new set of transmission lines that yield the least cost while satisfying forecast load demand. The cost considering as an objective function for GA includes installation cost of transmission lines and the present worth of loss cost when the system is operated at the optimal power flow.

In order to implement knowledge management (Km) successfully in a firm, how the firm can perform well in selection & evaluation of an appropriate KM strategy is very important issue; it must be established and recognized on a right framework and some of organizational elements & criteria have to be taken into consideration. Traditionally, SWOT analytical model is used to evaluate and analyze elements and features important in development of the strategy and according to the importance of the elements analytic network process (ANP) was used. Unlike many traditional models of multi criteria decision making (MCDM) which are presumably based on independence, ANP method provides the possibility for recognition of the effective elements in development of the strategy selection pattern. As the ANP has this advantage, in this paper an effective framework was developed through integration of SWOT & ANP methods and performed in the organization. The results indicated that the best objective is to increase the leadership capabilities in the organization. Motivation system improvement, communications improvement with the employees, and specialization in one or more specific services are the leading KM strategy in the organization.

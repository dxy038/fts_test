Progress at the NASA Langley Research Center in the area of rapid multi-flexible-body maneuvering experiments is described in this paper. The experiments are designed to verify theoretical analyses using control theory for the control of flexible structures. The objective of the maneuvering experiments is to demonstrate slewing of flexible structures in multiple axes while simultaneously suppressing vibration to have acceptable motion at the end of the maneuver. The status of some research activities oriented primarily to the experimental methods for control of flexible structures is presented.

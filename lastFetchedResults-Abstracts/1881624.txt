Dampers can be implemented into structure in order to dissipate energy and decrease the damages. Damages are much better distributed in the damped frames.  In this paper, fluid viscous dampers (FVDs) will be used. There are many design procedures for this kind of dampers. In this study, Performance-Based Plastic Design (PBPD) method will be utilized to achieve the enhanced response of structures to earthquake. The required formulas are derived for the design process. In order to validate the proposed technique, four steel moment frames with and without viscous dampers will be designed. After a series of nonlinear dynamic analysis, the performance objective of the structure can be well verified.

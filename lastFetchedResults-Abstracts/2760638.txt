This study explorers the operating principles of the hybrid converter with ac side cascaded H-bridge cells and the H-bridge alternative arm modular multilevel converter, where the main objective is to compare their steady-state and transient performance. This comparison focuses on steady-state aspects such as active and reactive power control and semi-conductor losses and the transient performance of these converters during ac and dc network faults. To facilitate this comparison, detailed switch models of both high-voltage direct current (HVDC) converters are developed and simulated in Matlab-Simulink. The major outcomes are discussed and strengths and weakness associated with each converter are highlighted.

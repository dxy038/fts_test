In many papers on the application of nonlinear programming techniques to the solution of engineering problems, such as an induction-motor design, the sequential unconstrained minimisation technique is adopted. It is shown in the paper that a nonsequential approach will lead to the same end results with much less computational time. In addition it is shown that a considerable saving in computational time could be achieved in transformer design optimisation by considering the whole problem to consist of a single constraint such as the cost function, with the sum of all suitably weighted constraints on the design performances being brought under the objective function evaluation.

The objective of this contribution is to model ductile damage phenomena under consideration of large inelastic
strains, to couple the corresponding constitutive law with a multi-layer shell kinematics and to give  nally
an adequate  nite element formulation. An elastic{plastic constitutive law is formulated by using a spatial
hyperelasto-plastic formulation based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. To
include isotropic ductile damage the continuum damage model of Rousselier is modi ed so as to consider
large strains and additionally extended by various void nucleation and macro-crack criteria. In order to achieve
numerical e ciency, elastic strains are supposed to be su ciently small providing a numerical e ective
integration based on the backward Euler rule. Finite element formulation is enriched by means of the enhanced
strain concept. Thus the well-known de ciencies due to incompressible deformations and the inclusion of
transverse strains are avoided. Several examples are given to demonstrate the performance of the algorithms
developed concerning large inelastic strains of shells and ductile damage phenomena

Objective: The objective was to study the clinical impact of mild carbohydrate intolerance in pregnant women with risk factors for gestational diabetes mellitus. Study Design: This was a historical cohort study of 2904 pregnant women examined for gestational diabetes on the basis of risk factors. Information on oral glucose tolerance test results and clinical outcomes was collected from laboratory charts and medical records. Results: The following outcomes increased significantly with increasing glucose values during the oral glucose tolerance test: shoulder dystocia, macrosomia, emergency cesarean section, assisted delivery, hypertension, and induction of labor. However, when corrections were made for other risk factors, hypertension and induction of labor were only marginally associated with glucose levels. Conclusion: In a group of nondiabetic pregnant women with risk factors for gestational diabetes, there was a graded increase in the frequency of shoulder dystocia and other maternal-fetal complications with increasing glucose levels during an oral glucose tolerance test.

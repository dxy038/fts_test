The problem of portfolio optimization is a standard problem in financial world and it has received tremendous attentions. Portfolio optimization plays essential role in determining portfolio strategies for investors. Portfolio optimization is intrinsically a discrete optimization problem whose decision criteria are in conflict and the proposed study of this paper considers a portfolio optimization problem involving fuzzy random variables. To solve the proposed model, we first present the possibility and necessity-based model to reformulate the fuzzy random portfolio selection model into linear programming models and using the resulted linear programs, a multi-objective problem is constructed.  To solve the multi-objective problem we propose some methods to consider decision makersâ€™ optimistic and pessimistic views. A numerical example illustrates the whole idea on multiobjective fuzzy random portfolio optimization by possibility and necessity-based model.

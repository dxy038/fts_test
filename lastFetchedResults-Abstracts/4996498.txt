Distributed Energy Resources (DER) are recognized as one of the possible solutions for sustainable economic development. The optimal integration of DER is a multi-objective problem in which different technical and economical objectives must be achieved simultaneously, and where a compromise solution for different perspectives needs to be found. The stochastic nature of DER and demand increases the complexity of the problem. Advanced multi-objective planning methods with appropriate probabilistic models of DER are required. This paper presents a multi-objective analysis of the optimal integration of wind turbines. The analysis is based on the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2) and considers technical and economical planning objectives. The unpredictable nature of DER production and demand is evaluated by means of stochastic simulation. Practical aspects of the frameworkÂ´s implementation are discussed, including the formulation of probabilistic constraints. Results demonstrate that the multi-objective approach proposed produces valuable information for different stakeholders involved in DER planning and development.

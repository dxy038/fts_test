This paper describes the design, fabrication, and test results of the conversion of a General Motors Suburban into a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). A parallel drive train configuration is utilized with an internal combustion engine running on reformulated gasoline and two electric motors. The overall system is monitored and controlled by a real-time control system. One objective in the design was to minimize changes in the Suburban. design decisions, expected results and actual results are presented

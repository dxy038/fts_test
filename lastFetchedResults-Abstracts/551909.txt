The objective of adding reinforcing fillers such as natural fibers to plastics is to increase the strength compared with neat plastic and wood. In this research the effect of wood pulp fiber length (short, medium and long), aspect ratio and fiber content (27%, 37%, 47% and 0% (non- reinforced PP)) with 3% maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene on wood plastic composites (WPCs) has been studied. Results showed that increased fiber length or aspect ratio and fiber content increases mechanical properties (tensile strength, tensile modulus and MOE). Impact strength was inversely correlated with fiber content and fiber length, and that fiber content was more important factor than fiber length in this regard. The impact strength of composite of softwood pulps was much higher than wood floor composite plastic. The significant interaction between fiber length and fiber content, and lack of a specific trend in the treatments made assessment of the effect of fiber properties on MOR difficult.

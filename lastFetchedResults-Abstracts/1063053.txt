Agelasine F has previously been isolated from marine sponges (Agelas sp.) and has been associated with various bioactivities including inhibitory activity on Mycobacterium tuberculosis. No total synthesis of this natural product has been reported. ent-Agelasine F has now been synthesized for the first time, starting from (R)-pulegone. The synthesis is considerably more efficient than a previously reported route to rac-agelasine F. ent-Agelasine F is found to exhibit antimicrobial activity.

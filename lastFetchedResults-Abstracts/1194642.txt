Airflow and discharge air temperature can be varied to maintain room temperature setpoint according to heating load. Increasing discharge air temperature and the decreasing airflow can save energy, but it causes reduced air circulation as supply air temperature rises above the space temperature. On the other hand, increasing airflow can improve air circulation; however, it may waste energy. The objective of this study is to identify the correlation between the minimum airflow and discharge air temperature that will maintain room thermal comfort. Near-optimal room airflow and discharge air temperature were analyzed, and the impact of room airflow and discharge air temperature on thermal stratification was evaluated and potential energy savings was estimated. Its performance was conducted through field experiment.

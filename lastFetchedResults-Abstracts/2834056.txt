Email is a good servant but a bad master. Email as a useful tool for communication hides many potential threats. As well as it is fast and straightforward it can easily grow to a state when user must deal with hundreds of email every month, not being able to do other work. This state is often referred to as email overload. This paper follows on a research conducted at UHK in 2012 and extends it to its second phase. The results are used to analyze users´ requirements on electronic communication and to describe formally the process of dealing with email. Another objective is author´s own definition of email overload in terms of obtained and derived findings. A set of improvements is proposed for a new communication tool which shall be designed and shaped in the future work.

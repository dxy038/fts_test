The objective of this study is to assess the prognostic impact of preoperative dipyridamole thallium imaging and clinical variables on the long-term outcome of diabetic patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery. Complete follow-up was obtained in 101 consecutive patients with diabetes mellitus undergoing routine dipyridamole thallium scintigraphy before vascular surgery (mean 4.2 ± 3.2 years, range 1 month to 11 years). Low risk was defined by diabetes alone with a normal resting electrocardiogram. High risk was defined as a history of angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or resting electrocardiogram abnormalities. There were 71 deaths in 98 patients discharged alive from the hospital (median survival 4.4 years). Age, the presence of resting electrocardiogram abnormalities, and an abnormal thallium scan were independent predictors of late death. After adjusting for age &gt;70 years and thallium abnormalities, high-risk patients had a death rate 4.8 times (95% confidence interval 1.7 to 13.4, p &lt;0.002) greater than low-risk patients. The presence of &gt;2 reversible thallium defects was useful in further risk stratification of both low- and high-risk patients. Low-risk patients with &gt;2 reversible defects had a median survival of 4.0 years compared with 9.4 years in those with ≤2 reversible defects (p &lt;0.001). Similarly, high-risk patients with ≤2 reversible defects had an intermediate median survival rate of 4.7 years compared with 1.8 years in the group with &gt;2 reversible defects (p &lt;0.001). Therefore, advanced age and the presence of resting electrocardiographic or thallium abnormalities identifies a subset of diabetic patients with a poor long-term outcome after vascular surgery. Combined clinical and thallium variables may identify a population in whom intensive medical or surgical interventions may be warranted to reduce both perioperative and late cardiac events.

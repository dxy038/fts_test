Mental health care is a major public sector problem in the State of New York. We were asked by the Ways and Means Committee of the New York State Assembly to recommend a new fiscal structure with shared funding between the state and the counties to better achieve the objective of the state\Â´s mental health care program. A simulation model was developed for analysis and used to design new funding plans. The results of our analysis have been written into legislation introduced into the New York State Assembly. A detailed explanation of the model we developed and the analysis we performed will be appearing in the September - October, 1972 issue of the Journal of Operations Research under the title "Financing Mental Health Services in the State of New York" by Lawrence Bodin, T. Owen Carroll, Allen Lee and Sally Stout.

The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor is an activity by the US, Japan, the Russian Federation and the European Atomic Energy, to design a fusion engineering test reactor based on the tokamak concept. The main objective of ITER is to demonstrate the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion energy. A six year engineering design activity began is 1992. The paper provides a design overview and describes key components including the superconducting magnets and in-vessel. The ITER International Organization and the US Home Team Organization is described.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

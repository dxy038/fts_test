In this paper, a genetic algorithm is designed to solve the containerÂ´s location allocation problem (CLAP) in rear storage yard. The CLAP considers the number of reshuffles and the range of all bays, which is a two-objective optimization problem. In the model, we only take 20ft normal containers into account and ignore the weight of containers. The GA designed for CLAP can get the global optimum solution and the population is going to converge, which can provide the solution of the minimum number of reshuffles and the balance between bays.

In noncooperative decentralized decision making, the information available to the controllers has a far more significant role than in the case of a centralized, or even a decentralized, single objective control problem. In order to illustrate a significant aspect of the role of the information structure, this paper presents and discusses an example of a differential game in which a decision maker becomes worse off when more information is made available to him.

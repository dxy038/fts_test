The authors describe in a quantitative way the effect of specific parameters on the generation of harmonics by converter substations. The parameters investigated are the following: delay angle of the converter control system, converter control type, electric load, capacitor banks, and stiffness of the AC/DC interconnection. The parametric analysis has been conducted using a nonlinear method suitable for accurate harmonic analysis. An appropriate modification of the IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) has been used as the test power system. A DC transmission system including the converter substation, the DC transmission line, and the load is connected at different locations in the IEEE RTS system (one location at a time), and the effect of the parameters mentioned above on the harmonic distortion is illustrated

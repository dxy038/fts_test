Study Objective: Many articles report seat belt injuries to children. This study examines the effect of child versus adult age and seat belt use on outcome in severe motor vehicle crashes. Methods: A population-based data set of all motor vehicle crashes statewide was analyzed by using matched-pairs logistic regression. Subjects were participants in motor vehicle crashes in which at least one occupant was killed or hospitalized and at least one was a child (age <15 years). Only passengers in cars, vans, and the front of light trucks were considered. Unique matched pairs were formed of one adult and one child from the same vehicle. The main outcome measure was death or hospitalization. Covariates were seat belt use and front or back seat position. Results: Overall, 413 pairs were analyzed. Seat belt use in these severe crashes was low for children and adults (40% versus 45%). Children more often sat in the back seat (74% versus 31% for adults). Risk of death was similar (7% for children and 8% for adults), but the percentage killed or hospitalized differed (13% for children and 28% for adults; odds ratio [OR] 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8 to 3.7). After controlling for seat belt use and seat position, adults remained at a similarly increased risk compared with children (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.6 to 4.2). The back seat was much safer than the front seat (OR 5.5; 95% CI 3.7 to 8.1). An adult’s nonuse of restraints was strongly predictive of a child’s nonuse. Conclusion:  Seat belts were at least as protective for children as for adults, but only 40% of the children in these severe crashes were restrained. [Corneli HM, Cook LJ, Dean JM.

Fuzzy programming approach has wide application in many fields such as project management, multi-attribute decision making, and comprehensive evaluation. Its solving methods have attracted many attentions. In this paper we present a new approach, based on the genetic algorithm, for dealing with a programming problem with fuzzy-valued objective function and constraints. Firstly, we propose the concept of generalized equilibrium value of fuzzy number, and analyze the properties, further give the operation rules; secondly, we establish a generalized equilibrium value-based fuzzy programming method combined with genetic algorithm; finally, we analyze the characteristic of the above mentioned method through a nonlinear fuzzy programming problems.

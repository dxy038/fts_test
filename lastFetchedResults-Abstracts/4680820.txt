This paper simulates a brute force attack of the passwords on EPCglobalÂ´s UHF class-1 generation-2 passive RFID tags. The objective is to simulate a brute force attack on the password accounting for the length of the password, the number of bits to be transferred, the data link bit rate from the reader to tag, the data link bit rate from the tag to reader, and the required number of messages for the protocol between the reader and tag. According to the simulation, the average time to perform a brute force attack on the passwords is approximately thirty days.

A reliable and efficient computational algorithm for
restoring blurred and noisy images is proposed. The restoration
process is based on the minimal total variation principle
introduced by Rudin et al. For discrete images, the proposed
algorithm minimizes a piecewise linear I1 function (a measure of
total variation) subject to a single 2-norm inequality constraint
(a measure of data fit). The algorithm starts by finding a feasible
point for the inequality constraint using a (partial) conjugate
gradient method. This corresponds to a deblurring process. Noise
and other artifacts are removed by a subsequent total variation
minimization process. The use of the linear li objective function
for the total variation measurement leads to a simplier computational
algorithm. Both the steepest descent and an affine scaling
Newton method are considered to solve this constrained piecewise
linear I1 minimization problem.
The resulting algorithm, when viewed as an image restoration
and enhancement process, has the feature that it can be used in
an adaptivdinteractive manner in situations when knowledge of
the noise variance is either unavailable or unreliable. Numerical
examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed iterative image restoration and enhancement process.

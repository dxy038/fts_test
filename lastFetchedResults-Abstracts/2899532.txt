The major objective of this research is to ascertain the fact that just nanosizing the power electronic device will not increase its efficiency. Suitable and efficient nanosizing should be done in a application specific way to improve its dynamic efficiency. To serve as an example, the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been used for the study. This can be largely attributed to the fact that they have certain electrical properties which allow transport of ions at room temperature. It can also be noted that their conduction and valence bands are symmetric thereby providing an undue advantage for complementary applications. Their band structure is also direct, which effectively enables optical emission. Moreover CNTs are highly resistant to electromigration. Also itÂ´s a widely acknowledged fact that carbon is a material which has a negative temperature coefficient of resistance. An economically viable CNT step down chopper has been taken for analysis and the Efficiency simulations are done through MATLAB to verify the results.

A meshless Galerkin Pareto-optimal method is proposed for topology optimization of continuum structures in this paper. The compactly supported radial basis function (CSRBF) is used to create shape functions. The shape function is constructed by meshfree approximations based on a set of unstructured field nodes. Considering the Pareto-optimality theory, the initial single objective topology optimization problem is transformed into multi-objective problem. The optimum solution is traced via the Pareto-optimal frontier in a computationally effective manner. The optimal problem does not need to be solved directly. Finally, several examples are used to prove the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

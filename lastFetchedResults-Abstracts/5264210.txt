A non-local extremum seeking control approach for active braking control systems is proposed. The typical design objective in electronic Anti-lock Braking Systems is to regulate the wheel slip as close as possible to the peak of the friction curve in any road condition. Accordingly, this control problem naturally fits the extremum seeking framework, as the output-to-reference map exhibits a global maximum and the control purpose is to select the set-point value so as to keep the output as the extremum value. To fulfill the requirements for an extremum seeking control scheme a parametric stabilizing feedback control law is devised via Lyapunov-based methods. A discussion on parametersÂ´ tuning is provided, which highlights the trade-offs in designing an extremum seeking controller. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is assessed via simulations.

In this study, 12 healthy men aging 22.8 &#177; 2.2 years old were submitted to a protocol of isometric resistance to fatigue contemplating elbow flexion on three different angles: 45&#176;, 90&#176; and 135&#176;. The objective was to study electromyographic median frequency (MDF) in the following muscles: i) Biceps Brachialis Long Head (BBL), Brachioradialis (BRD), Flexor Digitorum Superficialis (FDS), Triceps Brachialis Long Head (TBL), and Extensor Digitorum (ED). It was verified that, for all muscles, including the muscles that act in opposition to the contraction, fatigue presence was verified by the decrease of MDF value.

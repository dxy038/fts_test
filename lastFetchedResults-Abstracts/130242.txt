Background & Objective: Vitamin K deficiency is one of the commonest causes of coagulopathy and bleeding in patients on prolonged antibiotic therapy. This study was conducted to evaluate the status of vitamin K deficiency in hospitalized children on prolonged antibiotic therapy and its role in reversing the coagulopathy.
Method: A prospective non-randomized, cross-sectional study was conducted on children on prolonged antibiotic therapy whose ages ranged from 3 months to 16 years old. These children were under treatment in the ward and pediatric I.C.U.
Results: In this study, 25 out of 81 children(30.86%) were hypoprothrombinemic. Children ranging from 3 months to 1 year old developed significant coagulopathy as compared to other age groups(33.33%). Coagulation abnormalities were also seen to be more in children with severe grades of malnutrition(50%), on a more prolonged(>10 days) course of antibiotic therapy(36.36%), on Beta-lactam+vancomycin combination therapy (40.54%), in children who were NPO(45.45%) and in children who were critically ill in the intensive care unit(I.C.U)(47.61%).
Conclusion: we suggest vitamin K prophylaxis in patients on prolonged antibiotic therapy(>10 days) especially the patients suffering from mentioned conditions to prevent mortality and morbidity.

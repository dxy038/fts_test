Background: In order to reach to quality increasing, environment conservation and society health, organic manures and biofertilizers application in medicinal plants production in sustainable agriculture is very important. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the Effects of Cattle Manure and Biofertilizer Application on Biological Yield, Seed Yield and Essential oil in Coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.). 
Methods: Research was carried out as factorial experiment by using two factors of cattle manure (5, 10, 15 and 20 ton/ha) and nitrogenic biofertilizer (inoculation with azotobacter, inoculation with azospirillum and inoculation together) in the base of randomized complete blocks design with twelve treatments and three replications at homand research station in Damavand of iran in 2010. These treatments with a control treatment (without fertilizer) were also evaluated. 
Results: Results showed that the highest biological yield (10946.1 kg/ha) with consumption of 20 ton/ha cattle manure, the maximum seed yield (1587.7 kg/ha) and essential oil yield (4.09 kg/ha) with consumption of 15 ton/ha cattle manure and the highest essential oil content in seed (%0.277) with application of 10 ton/ha cattle manure were obtained. Also, the maximum biological yield (10082.3 kg/ha) in inoculation together with azotobacter and azospirillum, and the highest seed yield (1517.8 kg/ha) with azospirillum inoculation were obtained. Positive and synergistic interactions were observed between factors on essential oil content and essential oil yield. Differences between treatments and control were significant, as seed yield in treatment of 20 ton/ha cattle manure application and inoculation with azospirillum, and essential oil content in seed in treatment of 10 ton/ha cattle manure application and inoculation with azotobacter were more than control. 
Conclusion: According to the results of this study, the maximum seed yield and essential oil yield with consumption of 15 ton/ha cattle manure and the highest essential oil content in seed with application of 10 ton/ha cattle manure and also the highest seed yield with azospirillum inoculation were obtained.

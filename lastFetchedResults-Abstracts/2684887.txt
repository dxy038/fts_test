This issue of the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics (JSTQE) is a special issue on Nanobiophotonics. Nanobiophotonics is an advanced field of modern science and biomedical nanotechnology. This new field continues to vastly expand with state-of-the-art developments across the entire spectrum of biomedical applications ranging from fundamental studies of light??nanobiomaterial interactions to clinical diagnostics and therapeutics. The objective of this JSTQE Issue on Nanobiophotonics is to highlight recent progress and trends in innovative nanobiophotonics technology development. The papers published in this issue cover a broad range of advanced nanobiophotonics areas summarized in the following sections: 1) plasmonics: plasmonic nanostructures; 2) nanowires, nanoparticles: optical manipulation of nanoparticles, biophotonic organic nanoparticles; 3) biochemical sensors: on-chip biochemical sensing; 4) bioimaging: nanoprobes enhanced bioimaging, multimodal bioimaging, advanced bioimaging approaches; 5) biosensing: plasmonic biosensing, quantum dot biosensing, advanced biosensing approaches; 6) nanobiophotonics: nanoprobes enhanced diagnostics and therapeutics, novel nanobiophotonics technology and devices.

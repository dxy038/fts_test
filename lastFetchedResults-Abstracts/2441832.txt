Neutronic, shielding and activation analyses have been performed for recent design variants of the Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) test blanket module (TBM) in ITER on the basis of 3D Monte Carlo calculations. The main objective has been to assess and optimise the nuclear performance of the HCPB test blanket modules in terms of the tritium generation, the nuclear heating and the radiation shielding and provide, among others, the data required for the engineering design of the test modules. The shielding efficiency of the TBM system was shown to be sufficient to allow access of work personnel to the port extension after a waiting time of 10 days after shut down as required by ITER. The activation analyses provided the afterheat and activation data for quality assured safety analyses assuming a representative irradiation scenario.

Decreased stride length is a highly relevant characteristic of the gait in patients with ParkinsonÂ´s disease (PD). In this paper, a novel wearable laser device for stride length regulation is presented. The device is mounted to one foot and can project a red laser light strip to the floor as a visual cue for the other foot. In the experiment twelve healthy volunteers walked a 20 m straight walkway wearing the system on both feet. As an objective result, the stride length regulation reached an accuracy of 96.1&#177;2.5 (94.0&#177;3.5) % for a pre-defined stride length &#955;<sub>def</sub>= 55 (65) cm. The subjective evaluation by the participants using a questionnaire revealed that the visual cue projected from the laser device was considered a stable signal that did not shake during walking. 6 of 12 participants felt that this device was not interfering with their gait, 3 of 12 judged this aspect neutrally, and 3 of 12 considered it somehow bothersome.

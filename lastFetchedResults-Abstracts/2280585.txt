The objective of this paper is to investigate an oil-tolerant foam system as a displacing agent to improve the efficiency of oil recovery. To achieve this objective, several foaming agents are examined based on foamâ€“oil interaction models and previous studies. By measuring the interfacial and surface tensions of surfactants, we investigate the implications of the value of spreading coefficient and the lamella number in a system of foaming agents. The foamability and foam stability of the preferred foaming agents were statically tested. At last, the oil tolerance of the foaming agent system in both static and core flow experiments was investigated.

s indicated that the oil tolerant foaming system performs best among the various surfactants tested. In static testing, both foamability and foam stability increase as concentrations of surfactant and salt increase. It was also observed that the polymer significantly increases the foam stability in the presence of oil. The oil droplets do not spread at the surface due to the properties of the oil-tolerant foam, so the foam can be stable in the presence of crude oil.

l tolerant foaming system exhibits much greater foaming volume and longer drainage-half time than ordinary foam, either in the presence or absence of oil. The mobility reduction factor for dynamic displacement of oil-tolerant foam is much higher than those of pure foam and polymer solutions in the presence of oil. Experiments with different remaining oil saturations reveal that when the residual oil saturation is about 40%, the oil-tolerant foam can achieve the highest oil recovery.

Generally, the aim of logistic transportation route choice is to reduce the transportation risks and its cost, increase customers´ satisfaction, shorten the transportation time. As the fragile productions endure the possibility of broken during the transportation, undermine its broken risks become a new aim. This article analyzes the road conditions which have effects on fragile productions´ transportation, and put forward some factors and expected aims which should be considered when deliver the fragile goods. Multi-objective 0-1 integer programming models which can make the transportation of fragile productions much safer, more economic and effective, are established and LINGO software is used in the model solution. The rationality of the model and the feasibility of the algorithm, which can easily find the optimum route which is suitable for fragile productions delivery, are proved by the analysis of the example. The conclusion of the paper can be used for reference as an effective way to logistic path planning for fragile goods.

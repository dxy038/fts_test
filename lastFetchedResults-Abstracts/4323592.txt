When more than two antennas are spaced in close proximity, there exists a coupling between them. However, due to practical and economical reasons, it is common to have multi-antennas installed on a mast, tower or rooftop of a building. This requirement therefore generates a coupling problem where one antenna, which is not desired, receives the voltage generated by a nearby antenna. In this paper, the effects of coupling as a function of separation distance, in the presence of conjugate match and 50 &#937; loads and different transmitting frequencies are investigated, In addition, the effect of support structure is also discussed. The objective is to recommend the most suitable configuration for practical installation

The objective of this work is to develop power control techniques to allow frequency reuse of non-spread carrier frequencies within an RF-mesh mobile topology. The HF automatic link establishment (ALE) system defined in MILSTD 188-141A is a procedure by which linking to a particular addressed radio can be done automatically in a group of congested HF channels. This is a distributed control algorithm used to gain access of a free channel from a set of frequencies. A compatible algorithm is developed that will reuse the busy channel whenever necessary. Note that in ALE protocol calls are only made to a channel if it is silent. Under a power management situation an initiating radio may be far away from a pair of radios using minimum (non-audible) power for linkage, it is necessary to use more information to decide on initiating a call on a channel even if the channel is silent. The protocol for frequency reuse is presented. The key relies on the network allocation vector and the point control function. Preliminary results are also presented

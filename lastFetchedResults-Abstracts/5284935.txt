This paper addresses the problem of multi-objective optimization of the hydropower generation versus irrigation releases applied to the Egyptian network. A linear programming-based multicriteria model is developed based on the described system constraints. Two objective functions are considered in the analysis. The first is to maximize the total sum of potential hydropower production of the whole system. The second is to minimize the total water release to the system, while satisfying the different demands imposed at various nodes. Using the generation technique for solution, the results have revealed several tradeoff curves of both hydropower and irrigation uses

Nowadays, higher education in our country shows the characteristics of popularization, internationalization and demand diversification. It is necessary to evaluate the competitiveness of universities and then nurture and enhance the competitiveness. In this article, the author constructs a model of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation based on membership transformation with the entropy-based data mining method. Through mining the data information of objective classification hidden in the membership of parameters and introducing the distinguishable weight, it better solves the interference problem of the redundant data. An example of the evaluation model for competitiveness of a university is presented, which indicates that the model is convenient and feasible and that the result of assessment is objective and reliable.

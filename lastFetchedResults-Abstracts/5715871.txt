An improved integration system of multiple utility boilers is proposed in this study. Short-term load demand forecasting and load dispatching for multiple boilers are the two function blocks, they are modeled with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MOP) respectively. In particular, the MOP is solved by a novel hybrid multi-objective optimization algorithm with a combination of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Extremal Optimization (EO) solutions, called &#8220;PSO-EO-MO&#8221;. Both the two function blocks have been developed to a integration system software based on real production data from a thermal power plant and have being running online on the spot with the procedure of production. The results illustrate the efficiency and applicability of the software and the software has got Software Copyright in 2010.

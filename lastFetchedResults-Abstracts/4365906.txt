It was recently shown (May 200) that the sub-band signals resulting from the analysis of an ARMA process by a decimating filter bank can be modeled by individual lower-rate ARMA processes. This paper discusses the validity of this modeling and the zero-pole mapping of the generator filters along the sub-bands. Based on these results, a sub-band version of a model-based technique for de-clicking of audio recordings is proposed. Simulation results are presented and validated by subjective as well as objective means

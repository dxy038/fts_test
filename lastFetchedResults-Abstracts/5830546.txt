We aim to infer 3D body pose directly from human silhouettes. Given a visual input (silhouette), the objective is to recover the intrinsic body configuration, recover the viewpoint, reconstruct the input and detect any spatial or temporal outliers. In order to recover intrinsic body configuration (pose) from the visual input (silhouette), we explicitly learn view-based representations of activity manifolds as well as learn mapping functions between such central representations and both the visual input space and the 3D body pose space. The body pose can be recovered in a closed form in two steps by projecting the visual input to the learned representations of the activity manifold, i.e., finding the point on the learned manifold representation corresponding to the visual input, followed by interpolating 3D pose.

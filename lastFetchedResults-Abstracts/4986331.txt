New approaches for the recycling of electronic waste have come into effect to reduce the environmental impact of electronic goods. The goal of CARE &#8220;VISION 2000&#8221; (CARE=A Comprehensive Approach for the Recycling of Electronics) is to increase the value of recycling by driving down costs, reducing the amount of electronic waste and hazardous material and thus the impact on the environment. Ultimately, the objective of CARE &#8220;VISION 2000&#8221; is to transform recycling into an industrial system. With a time frame of 5.5 years and at a total cost of approximately 40 million DM, this project involves major manufacturers in the industrial branches of consumer electronics, computing equipment, office automation and telecommunications equipment active in Europe together with European recycling, distribution and reverse logistics companies. To achieve comprehensive results, the project takes under its wings consideration of several issues. These are the marketing and economic considerations of recycling, logistics and take-back scenarios and the technical issues of disassembly, product identification and quality recertification. The final goal of CARE &#8220;VISION 2000&#8221; is to attain suitable results for high-level recycling and reuse and to transform these results into an international standard

<p align="left"><strong>Objective: </strong>This study aimed to determine prevalence and predisposing factors of personality disorders among infertile in comparison to fertile women.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods: </strong> By a descriptive- analytic study in Vali-e-asr Reproductive Health Research Center, 300 women entered the research.  Eysenck personality (EPQ) and structured researcher questionnaires were applied for all patients. Demographic characteristics and predisposing personality factors were recorded and personality symptoms were scaled. For data analysis, SPSS-11-5 software system, chi-square and T-test were used.  P-value &lt;0.05 was considered significant.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> Based on EPQ, personality instability was significantly more frequent in infertile women in comparison to fertile women (P&lt;0.001). Housewives are at higher risk of developing personality instability as compared to working women. This finding was also statistically significant (P&lt;0.001).<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Considering the high prevalence of personality disorders among infertile women, it seems that more serious attention is required from gynecologists, psychiatrists and psychologists for better treatment of these disorders. The use of psychotherapy, especially supportive methods, should be considered as part of the general therapeutic framework of infertility.</p>

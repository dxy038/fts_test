The objective of this paper is to discuss the general development of a Flexible Automatic Test System For Turbine Machinery (FATSFTM). In order to meet the test needs of a large and diverse community of turbine machinery, the automatic test system should have a contemporary windows interface, have graphical interaction and be easily configured to include the functions required by current and emerging test demands. The design and implementation of such a test system is approached from an object-oriented software engineering point-of-view for ease of extension, expansion and maintenance. Practical application has proved the validity and effect of the implemented automatic test system in helping turbine developers improve the performance of turbine machinery

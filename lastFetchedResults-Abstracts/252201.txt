The objective of this paper is to describe the local structure of lanthanide
fluoride melts of nuclear iInterest. An experimental approach combining NMR
and EXAFS spectroscopy, both sensitive to the microstructure of solid or liquid
materials, is preseInted. These techniques can be used to determine the
coordination number, the nature of neighbors, and then to identify the complex
formation. NMR and EXAFS spectroscopy have been applied to the
molten LaF3–LiF and LuF3–LiF systems. The influence of melt compositions
and temperature was studied.

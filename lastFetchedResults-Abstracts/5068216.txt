Information resource planning (IRP) is an integration of the process-driven and data-driven approaches for planning the implementation of information technology in support of business goals and objectives. Using a disciplined yet flexible approach, IRP develops a migration strategy for smooth transition from the business environment to the automated environment. The methodology results in: (i) a common understanding of the business and its goals, objective functions, and information requirements among staff, management, and the systems professional; (ii) an information architecture which provides a framework for the development of sound, flexible databases; (iii) a strategic information systems plan for implementing information technology as successful integrated solutions consistent with the organizational objectives; and (iv) a clean set of usable documentation for future development of the automated solutions. This approach was successfully applied in carrying out an IRP study for the Pesticides Management Branch within the Alberta Department of Environment. Although it was initially believed that the Branch required electronic mailing facilities to improve its internal communications, the study revealed that most communications resulted in the need for information at the operational level. Implementation of the BranchÂ´s proposed automated systems will facilitate access to that information

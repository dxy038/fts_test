The objective of this research is to develop shop floor control systems and performance measurement indicators suitable for plastic injection manufacturing in Thailand. This research collects primary data from several factories and uses a systematically designed questionnaire to interview both experts and practitioners in the field. The shop floor control system represented by IDEF0 technique is then developed. Furthermore, the performance indicators (PI) of the production operations that conform to the real operations occurring on the shop floor are created. The results from the research can be used as a guideline for entrepreneurs in order to produce continuously and fully utilize the production capacity. In addition, they could use the selected performance indicators to assess the efficiency of their organizations and could benchmark against other entrepreneurs in order to find the ways for productivity improvement.

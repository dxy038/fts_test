The objective of this paper is analysis of output voltage distortion of a PWM inverter with LC filter caused by device voltage drop. The goal of this study is to find out how to compensate the output voltage distortion of PWM inverter caused by device voltage drop to realize precise output voltage. The output voltage distortion is mainly caused by dead time and device voltage drop. There are a lot of studies about distortion is mainly caused by dead time. There are, however, only few studies about device voltage drop. especially considering LC filter effect. In this paper, the authors theoretically derived the output voltage distortion of PWM inverter with LC filter caused by device voltage drop in order to estimate the distortion caused by drop in advance. The distortion was analyzed from the view point of frequency analysis and total harmonic distortion (THD). These results may allow appropriate design of PWM inverter with output voltage compensation. Theoretical analysis was verified through simulations and experiments.

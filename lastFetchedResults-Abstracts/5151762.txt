The objective of the paper is to evaluate and compare proactive and reactive routing protocols designed for ad hoc networks and adapted to Wireless Mesh Networks. The analysis of protocol performance is based on the results of multistage simulations made for UDP traffic and TCP traffic, moreover, for both - a normal working network and the network with selfish node injected. We recommend using particular protocols in certain conditions.

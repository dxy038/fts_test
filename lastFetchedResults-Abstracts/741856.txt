Objective: To measure the prevalence of hypertension and age-specific blood pressure in urban populations from five Indian cities. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in six–twenty urban streets in different cities from five different corners of India, using similar methods of sample selection and criteria. There were 3212 randomly selected women from Moradabad (n=902), Trivandrum (n=760), Calcutta (n=365), Nagpur (n=405) and Bombay (n=780), aged 25–64 years, inclusive. Evaluation was by a physician and a dietitian, an administered questionnaire, a physical examination and using a sphygmomanometer. The diagnosis of hypertension was based on old World Health Organisation criteria and new World Health Organisation/International Society of Hypertension criteria. The prevalence of hypertension (>140/90 mm Hg) was significantly (P<0.01) high in Trivandrum, South India (30.7%), and Bombay, West India (28.0%), compared to Moradabad, which is in northern India (22.6%), Nagpur, in central India (24.2%), and Calcutta, in east India (19.1%). Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly higher in Trivandrum and Bombay compared to the other three cities. The overall prevalence of hypertension was 25.6% (n=823) and isolated diastolic hypertension was the most common form of hypertension (50.5%, n=1506) in the five Indian cities. According to old criteria, the overall prevalence of hypertension (>160/95 mm Hg) was 14.8% (n=481). Multivariate logistic regression analysis on pooled data from the five cities, after adjustment for age, showed that age (odds ratio 1.16), body mass index (1.68) and obesity were strongly associated with hypertension. A sedentary lifestyle and salt intake were weakly associated and alcohol intake was not a factor with these women.

The objective of this paper is to present a different approach in hydrothermal systems with individualized representation of hydroelectric power plants. This application is possible through modified objective function, considering costs and data of inflow from the first downstream hydroelectric power plant. By this way, the space coupling is considered in &#8220;featured outflow&#8221; and the optimization is done. The model proposed was tested in part of the Brazilian hydrothermal system. The results were compared with classical model of optimization. All the analyses were based on marginal costs of the system operation. To validate the results, the hydrothermal system was tested with average and historical inflows. The computational gain was considerable, since, in classical optimization, the computational time increases exponentially with the number of hydroelectric power plants but with the technique of &#8220;featured outflow&#8221; the computational time is only multiplied by the number of hydroelectric power plants.

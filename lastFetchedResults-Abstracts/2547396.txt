The current study set to extend a new VIKOR method as a compromise ranking approach to solve multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems through intuitionistic fuzzy analysis. Using compromise method in MCDM problems contributes to the selection of an alternative as close as possible to the positive ideal solution and far away from the negative ideal solution, concurrently. Using Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy sets (A-IFSs) may simultaneously express the degree of membership and non-membership to decision makers (DMs) to describe uncertain situations in decision-making problems. The proposed intuitionistic fuzzy VIKOR indicates the degree of satisfaction and dissatisfaction of each alternative with respect to each criterion and the relative importance of each criterion, respectively, by degrees of membership and non-membership. Thus, the ratings for the importance of criteria, DMs, and alternatives are in linguistic variables and expressed in intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Using IFS aggregation operators and with respect to subjective judgment and objective information, the most suitable alternative is indicated among potential alternatives. Moreover, practical examples illustrate the procedure of the proposed method.

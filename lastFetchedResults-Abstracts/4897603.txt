This paper presents deployment algorithms for multiple mobile robots with line-of-sight sensing and communication capabilities in a simple nonconvex polygonal environment. The objective of the proposed algorithms is to achieve full visibility of the environment. We solve the problem by constructing a novel data structure called the vertex-induced tree and designing schemes to deploy over the nodes of this tree by means of distributed algorithms. The agents are assumed to have access to a local memory and their operation is partially asynchronous

This paper presents a single phase photovoltaic inverter topology with battery backup for grid connected pv systems with a novel control scheme. The battery is used as a backup source in case solar power is absent. The power flow through the battery is controlled using a bidirectional converter so that the optimum use of the battery is ensured. The DC-DC converter controls the DC link voltage so as to enable the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) reference to be followed. The proposed configuration uses a single phase sine pwm inverter topology for converting DC voltage generated from solar photovoltaic/battery energy sources to AC voltage for connecting to the grid and feeding to the load. A novel SPWM technique along with a PI controller is used to keep the current injected into the grid sinusoidal. A phase locked loop (PLL) is used for phase and frequency match. Simulation study of the proposed system is carried out using MATLAB Simulink. Simulation results for different cases are provided in this paper.

Computers are increasing used within the classroom in many different ways. It is appropriate for a teacher to wonder how and how much the computer is actually used in the teacherÂ´s class. This work is an attempt to provide a mechanism by which an instructor can collect objective data on computer usage within the classroom. The process, similar to that used by Flanders interaction analysis for collecting data on teacher/student interactions in a classroom, is based on having an impartial observer record values at regular time intervals that indicate the type of computer usage in the last interval for the instructor and possibly several values for the type of student usage.

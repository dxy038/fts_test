BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Dentistry students are exposed to environmental stresses in addition to educational stresses. The continuous stress can lead to the complications such as physical, mental and emotional injuries. Strengthening the physical, mental and social resources can improve the performance and health of students against stress.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was done in academic year of 2013-2014 on dentistry students who entered the Dentistry Faculty of Babol from 2008. In this research, two questionnaires were concurrently used. The first questionnaire was DASS21 and the second one was derived from the research of Mashhad Dentistry Faculty to investigate the factors that generate the stress. Questionnaires were analyzed based on the variables of gender, age and entrance year.
FINDINGS: 217 students included 96 male (44.2%) and 121 female (55.8%) completed the questionnaires. 74.2% of students who were in fourth grade had abnormal stress.

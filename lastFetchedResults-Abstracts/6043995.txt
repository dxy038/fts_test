A hybrid electric vehicle is a combination of two power sources: one unidirectional power source based on an internal combustion engine (ICE), and the other bidirectional based on batteries or electric energy storage, plus electric machines (EM). Different ways of combination lead to different vehicle architectures. But these hybrid vehicles have the same basically energy flow paths. So from this point of view, one global energetic modeling using Energetic macroscopic representation (EMR) which can be applicable to ICE vehicles, a battery powered electric vehicles, series hybrid vehicles, parallel hybrid Vehicles and series-parallel hybrid vehicles has been established. This causal modeling focuses on the system function not only on the structure of system and presents a global energetic view.

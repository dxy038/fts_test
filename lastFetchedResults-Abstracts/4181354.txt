As the mechanical and electrical device adjusting the objective lens, driven by dual-axis forces, the lens actuator must provide a precise means of accurately following the disk displacement in the focusing and tracking directions in a digital DVD pickup head. To study the driving and interference forces and improve the driving sensitivity of the lens actuator, we put forward a new calculation method in this paper. Compared with the traditional finite element method, the new method can be conveniently used to obtain the most exact result on the dual-axis driving and interference forces, which cannot be easily dealt with using the finite element method. Important conclusions are given and a typical experiment verifies the validity of the-new method

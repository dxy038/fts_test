The objective of this paper is to propose a new approach for designing the passive filter system by using improved genetic algorithms (IGA). The new approach combined serial single-tuned filters with high-pass filter. The model can be used in two situations: (1) filter system just suppress harmonic current. (2) filter system suppress harmonic current and provide reactive power compensation at the same time. Through applying IGA to solve these kinds of complex discontinuous optimization problems, designer can quickly find appropriate parameter values to meet the desired power quality requirement, which minimize the total investment cost. A practical optimal algorithm based on IGA for selecting filter capacity values to achieve lowest investment of the filter system is obtained. Calculation results for a practical system show that the proposed method is valuable and powerful.

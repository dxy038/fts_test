Objectives
We investigated the effects of different CO2 tensions on oxygenation, pulmonary blood flow (Qp), cerebral blood flow, and systemic blood flow (Qs) after the bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis (BCPA).
Background

Hypoxemia refractory to management of a high pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) may complicate recovery from the BCPA.
Methods

After BCPA, CO2 was added to the inspired gas of mechanically ventilated patients. The Qp, Qs, PVRI, and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) were calculated from oxygen consumption, intravascular pressures, and oxygen saturations. Cerebral blood flow was estimated by near infrared spectroscopy and transcranial Doppler.
Results

In nine patients (median age 7.1, range 2 to 23 months), arterial oxygen tension increased significantly (p < 0.005) from 36 ± 6 mm Hg to 44 ± 6 to 50 ± 7 mm Hg at arterial carbon dioxide tensions (PaCO2) of 35, 45, and 55 mm Hg, respectively and decreased to 40 ± 8 mm Hg at PaCO2 40 mm Hg. At a PaCO2 of 55 and 45 compared with 35 mm Hg, Qp, cerebral blood flow, and Qs increased significantly, PVRI, Qp/Qs, and the ratio of Qp to inferior vena caval blood flow were unchanged, but SVRI decreased.
Conclusions

We have demonstrated that after the BCPA, systemic oxygenation, Qp, Qs, and cerebral blood flow increased and SVRI decreased at CO2 tensions of 45 and 55 mm Hg compared with 35 mm Hg. We suggest that hypoxemia after the BCPA is ameliorated by a higher PaCO2 and that low PaCO2 or alkalosis may be detrimental. Hypercarbic management strategies may allow earlier progression to the BCPA, which may contribute to reducing the interval morbidity in patients with a functional single ventricle.

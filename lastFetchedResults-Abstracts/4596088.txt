In this paper, coming up with the Vehicle ranging system based on dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) technology. The design through the transmit power of debugging the wireless module RFM12B,and the wireless communication distance can be controlled in a certain range. When the distance between two vehicles reaches the wireless communication distance. The vehicle in front can make sure the distance is too close. Receiver through the audio transformer sending the signal isolation transformer coupled input to the MT8870 the receiving end, in order to achieve distance objective, it guarantees vehicle safety, so it will help to increase transport efficiency and keep economic fast growth.

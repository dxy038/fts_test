Employee performance appraisal is a systematic and continuous assessment in order to identify necessary areas for growth and improvement of human resources. It is obvious that the performance appraisal methods in different organization levels should be different. These differences are because of job profile and objective in different organization levels. This research tries to find the best way to evaluate the performance of the employees in SAPCO. In addition, the employee performance appraisal methods were prioritized according to assessed person features, assessor features, assessment process, assessment tools and assessment outcomes. The performance appraisal actors in SAPCO were the statistical population in this paper. Scale and couple questionnaires and interviews were the data collecting tools. In order to analyze the data, we used ANP and Fuzzy Topsis. The results showed that MBO and Ranking are the appropriate performance appraisal methods in SAPCO.

The objective of the paper is to study the major reason behind Islamic Republic of Iran's rather uncompromisable atomic energy policy based on a constructionist perspective which proposes a new concept of security through emphasizing on identity and ideational factors. This is not just a kind of physical and material security, but ontological and identificational. To do so, the paper first studies Islamic Republic of Iran's atomic energy policy and its features, then introduces the concept of ontological security, and finally analyzes the uncompromising policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

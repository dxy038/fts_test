TodayÂ´s heterogeneous embedded systems combine components from different domains, such as software, analogue hardware and digital hardware. The design and implementation of these systems is still a complex and error-prone task clue to the different Models of Computations (MoCs), design languages and tools associated with each of the domains. Though making such systems adaptive is technologically feasible, most of the current design methodologies do not explicitely support adaptive architectures. This paper present the ANDRES project. The main objective of ANDRES is the development of a seamless design flow for adaptive heterogeneous embedded systems (AHES) based on the modelling language SystemC. Using domain-specific modelling extensions and libraries, ANDRES will provide means to efficiently use and exploit adaptivity in embedded system design. The design flow is completed by a methodology and tools for automatic hardware and software synthesis for adaptive architectures.

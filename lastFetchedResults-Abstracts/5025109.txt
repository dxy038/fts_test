The goal of this paper is two-fold: one is to introduce failure rate model in the presence of fault correction activity. The other objective is to formulate the optimization problems which software managers face and to propose simple and fast solution procedures to handle them. In this article software reliability growth model which considers fault correction is used. This paper addresses the problem of optimally allocating testing resources to various modules so that the software as a whole must not exceed defined budget. Simple and fast solution methodology is proposed to help managers to make best decisions. Using these algorithms, project managers can allocate limited testing resources easily and efficiently in the presence of fault correction activity

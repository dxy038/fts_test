Objective: To look into the treatment given to children with acute watery diarrhea by Trainee Medical Officers at the time of admission and to compare it with the standard treatment protocol as recommended by World Health Organization for the treatment of acute watery diarrhoea. Material and Methods: This was a retrospective study conducted in Department of Pediatric Postgraduate Medical Institute, Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar from June 15 to August 15, 2008. Treatment charts of children admitted with acute watery diarrhoea were studied for demographical findings, degree of dehydration and other clinical findings and treatment given at the time of admission. The data was statistically analyzed by SPSS version 10. Results: Eighty children were included in the study. The age range was from one month to five years with mean age of 25.5 months. The majority were in the range of 1 to 3 years with male to female ratio of 1.4:1. Majority (68.75%) had bowel movements more than 6 times/24 hours. Blood in the stool was present in only five cases (6.25%). Thirty-five (44%) and 12 (28%) were presented with some and severe dehydration respectively at the time of admission. Analysis of drug treatment (antibiotics, anti-protozoal, anti-emetics, stool hardeners, probiotics) showed that 65 (81.25%) children received appropriate treatment as per recommendations of World Heath Organization. All children were discharged uneventfully. Conclusion: Continuous training and supervision of the Trainee Medical Officers is required to implement standard treatment of acute watery diarrhoea according to laid down World Heath Organization guidelines. Such activities will help to reduce inappropriate use of drugs and wrong treatment for diarrhea.

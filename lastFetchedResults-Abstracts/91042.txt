In this paper, we propose a built-in self-diagnostic march-based algorithm that identifies faulty memory cells based on a recently introduced nontraditional fault model. It is developed based on the DiagRSMarch algorithm, which is a diagnostic algorithm to identify traditional faults for embedded memory arrays. A minimal set of additional operations is added to DiagRSMarch for identifying the nontraditional faults without affecting the diagnostic coverage of the traditional faults. The embedded memory arrays are accessed using a bidirectional serial interfacing architecture which minimizes the routing overhead introduced by the diagnosis hardware. Using the concepts of the bidirectional interfacing technique, parallel testing, and redundanttolerant operations, the diagnostic process can be accomplished efficiently at-speed with minimal hardware overhead.

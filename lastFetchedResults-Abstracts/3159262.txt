With the rapid development of highway, the pollution on the surrounding water environment becomes more and more serious. In order to make a objective and effective comprehensive assessment on highway operation´s impact on the surrounding water environment, we must set up an integrated quantitative analysis system of highway´s impact on water environment and establish a scientific quantitative analysis model. In view of the complexity of highway water environment, this paper establishes a series of quantitative analysis models for various water environment and an comprehensive analysis model.

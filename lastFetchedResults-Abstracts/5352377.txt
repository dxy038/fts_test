Tthe first objective of our research is to validate numerical methods that are capable of modeling complex physics, such as (i) spray sheet and jet formation; (ii) air entrainment and bubble generation; and (iii) strong free-surface turbulence interactions with large amplitude breaking waves. The second objective of our research is to provide design support for assessing the performance and signatures of next generation of naval vessels undergoing extreme loads and motions while operating at high speed. The core applications for this work are Numerical Flow Analysis (NFA) and Level Set Large Eddy Simulation (LS-LES), two Cartesian-grid methods based on the volume-of-fluid and level-set interface capturing methods, respectively. Both of these applications are applied to studies of steep breaking waves and complex ship flows to perform a systematic study of these problems. The numerical methods are continuously validated using experimental data.

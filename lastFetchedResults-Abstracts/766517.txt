Decreasing the circuit dimensions is driving the
need for low-k materials with a lower dielectric constant to
reduce RC delay, crosstalk, and power consumption. In case
of spin-on organosilicate low-k films, the incorporation of a
porogen is regarded as the only foreseeable route to decrease
dielectric constant of 2.2 or below by changing a
packing density. In this study, methyltrimethoxysilane
(MTMS)â€“bis(trimethoxysilyl)ethane (BTMSE) copolymers
that had superior mechanical properties than MSSQ (methyl-
silsesquioxane) were blended with amphiphilic block
copolymers used as sacrificial pore generators. While adding
up to 40 wt.% porogen into MTMS:BTMSE = 100:50
matrix, optical, electrical, and mechanical properties were
measured and the pore structure was also characterized by
positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). The
result confirmed that there existed a tradeoff in attaining the
low dielectric constant and desirable mechanical strength,
and no more pores than necessary to achieve the dielectric
objective should be incorporated. When the dielectric constant
was fixed to approximately 2.3 by controlling BTMSE
and porogen contents simultaneously, the thermo-mechanical
properties of the porous films were also investigated for
the comparison purpose. Under the same dielectric constant,
the concurrent increase in BTMSE and porogen contents led
to improvement in modulus measured by the nanoindentation
technique but deterioration of adhesion strength obtained
by the modified edge lift-off test.

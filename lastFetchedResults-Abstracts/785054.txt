The objective was to describe the extent to which nursing home patients had cognitive
impairments and were diagnosed with dementia. Furthermore, to describe and compare multicomorbidity, health
status and drug use in the three subgroups; dementia diagnosis/not referred, dementia diagnosis/referred and no
dementia diagnosis/not referred to an emergency department (ED) over a one-year period. Methods: A crosssectional
follow-up study was carried out in Sweden. RAI/MDS assessments were conducted on 719 patients in
24 nursing homes, of whom 209 were referred to EDs during a one-year period, accounting for 314 visits. This
study involved an extensive examination of the population. Results: The 719 patients were reported to suffer
from comprehensive cognitive impairments, which not accorded with the dementia diagnoses, they were
significantly fewer. Cognitive decline or dementia diagnosis contributed to a significant decrease of referrals to
EDs. Patients with dementia diagnosis/not referred had difficulties understanding others, as well as impaired
vision and hearing. Patients with dementia diagnosis/referred usually understood messages. Low BMI, daily pain,
multicomorbidity and high drug consumption occurred in all groups. Patients with no dementia diagnosis/not
referred had significantly less multicomorbidity. Neuroleptica was significantly more prevalent among those with
dementia diagnosis. Conclusion: Dementia remains undetected. Patients with cognitive decline and dementia are
probably as sick as or even worse than others but may, due to low priority be undertreated or referrals avoided
with the objective to provide good care in the setting. Observational studies are needed to identify what is done
and could be done in referral situations.

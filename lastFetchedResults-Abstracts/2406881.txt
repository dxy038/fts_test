Objective: In this trial, we intend to assess the effect of simulation-based education approach on advanced cardiovascular life support skills among medical students.

Methods: Through convenient sampling method, 40 interns of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in their emergency medicine rotation (from September to December 2012) participated in this study. Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) workshops with pretest and post-test exams were performed. Workshops and checklists for pretest and post-test exams were designed according to the latest American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines. 

Results: The total score of the students increased significantly after workshops (24.6 out of 100 to 78.6 out of 100). This demonstrates 53.9% improvement in the skills after the simulation-based education (P <  0.001). Also the mean score of each station had a significant improvement (P <  0.001).
 
Conclusion: Pretests showed that interns had poor performance in practical clinical matters while their scientific knowledge, such as ECG interpretation was acceptable. The overall results of the study highlights that Simulation based-education approach is highly effective in Improving ACLS skills among medical students.

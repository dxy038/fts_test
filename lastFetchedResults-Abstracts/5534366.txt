This paper studies multi-attribute decision making problem, which include alternative scheme preference information and the attribute values are internal grey numbers. We construct grey deviated function through subjective conditional probability and objective conditional probability. Based on grey deviated function, an approach to get subjective conditional probability optimized model is proposed. By using the model, the attribute weights can be got. The decision alternatives are ranked by using the priority formula of interval grey number. Finally, an example is given to show the feasibility and availability of this method.

The production of sugar and alcohol is the main objective of the sugarcane processing industry. The evaporation of sugarcane juice has a high energetic cost and is usually performed in multiple-effect evaporators. The loss of performance during operation due to fouling makes the process more complex. In this study, modeling, simulation, validation, and analysis were performed for a sugarcane juice industrial evaporation system (IES) composed of a falling film evaporator followed by three short vertical-tube evaporators arranged in parallel. The IES model was developed using a commercial process simulator and validated with data from the plant. The IES had marked performance losses in the first 14 days of operation, mainly due to fouling in the first effect, with a 30% decrease in the evaporation rate.

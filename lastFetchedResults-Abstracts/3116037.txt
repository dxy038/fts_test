In this paper few variations over the standard PSO algorithm, referred to as Meta-PSO, aimed to enhance the global search capability, and, therefore, to improve the algorithm convergence, are presented. In recently published open literature the results of the application of the Meta-PSO to the optimization of single-objective problems have been shown. Here we will prove their enhanced properties with respect to standard PSO also for the optimization of multi-objective problems, trough their test in multi-objective optimization of planar antenna arrays.

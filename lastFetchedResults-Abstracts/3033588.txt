Typical environment plant stress factors are excess of light, deficiencies of water and nutrients, temperature extremes, diseases, pests and pollutants. An early indicator for vegetation status and vitality by means of remote sensing would therefore serve a range of applications such as renewable resource management and precision farming. Vegetation fluorescence is a direct indicator for plant physiology, and could therefore be used as an early indicator for vegetation health status and vitality. Vegetation chlorophyll fluorescence is a function of photochemical processes and efficiency, which are directly linked to primary productivity and CO<sub>2</sub> flux from the atmosphere, and could therefore also provide a means to assess the terrestrial carbon cycle. A study was launched in October 2002 by the European Space Agency to advance the underlying science of a possible future vegetation fluorescence space mission by addressing the need for an integrated canopy fluorescence model. The objective of this study is to review and advance existing fluorescence models at the leaf level and to integrate these into canopy models in order to simulate the combined spectral reflected radiance and passive fluorescence emission signals. This model is to be validated with new and existing field campaign measurements. This paper reports on the status of this project, the input radiometric and photosynthetic variables have been selected to define the vegetation fluorescence signal consisting of far-red and red-chlorophyll fluorescence as spectral emission features, normalized to the canopy illumination levels, when linked to the leaf-level fluorescence reflectance-transmittance model defined in this study. Measurement protocols to validate fluorescence-leaf models will be defined.

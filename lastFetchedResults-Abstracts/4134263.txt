We propose and demonstrate, for the first time, a bidirectional hybrid dense wavelength-division-multiplexing (DWDM) system for CATV and OC-48 trunking with two wavelengths for AM-VSB video and two wavelengths for OC-48 baseband digital signal transport. Not only twice of the channel capacity, but also good performances of carrier-to-noise ratio /spl ges/50 db, composite second order (CSO)/spl ges/65 db, composite triple beat /spl ges/63 dB and low bit-error rate (&lt;10/sup -9/) were obtained over an 80-km large effective area fiber transport.

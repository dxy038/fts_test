The objective of this paper is to clarify what kind of environmental factors that regulate net ecosystem production (NEP), gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (RE) in forest ecosystems across East Asia. Study sites were widely distributed and included diverse ecosystems, such as evergreen and deciduous, coniferous and broadleaf, planted and natural forests, from subarctic to tropical zones. We measured NEP using the eddy covariance technique at 13 forest sites in East Asia.

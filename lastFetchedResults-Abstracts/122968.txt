Background: Childhood obesity has short and long-term side effects such as insulin resistance and lipid disorders in progression of non-communicable diseases.
Objective: To survey metabolic disorders in obese children and adolescents.
Methods: This descriptive- analytical study was performed on 142 obese children and adolescents (body mass index >95th percentile for age and sex) in 2002. Fasting blood sugar, serum lipids and thyroid function tests were evaluated. Glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed on 42 samples having super obesity (weight >140% of ideal body weight) and Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST) was performed on 22 samples having cushingoid faces. Data were analyzed using SPSS v11/win software by Chi Square and the statistical test (P<0.05).
Findings: The mean serum total cholesterol, LDL-C and triglyceride (TG) was significantly higher than standard value for age and sex. Among the studied samples, the prevalence of total cholesterol, TG and LDL-C more than the 956 percentile was 42%, 49% and 23% respectively, 27% of samples had an HDL-C level lower than the 5th percentile for age and sex. The mean fasting blood sugar was 88.2 mg/dl in all studied subjects; it was significantly higher in boys than girls (90.7 vs 86.6 mg/dl, P<0.05). 7.1% of GTTs and 2.1 percent of thyroid function tests were abnormal. No case of abnormal DST was reported.
Conclusion: This study shows the improper serum lipid profile of obese children and adolescents and emphasizes the importance of prevention and control of overweight from early age in order to promote their present and future health.

The revolution in high-speed broadband network is the requirement of the current time, in other words here is an unceasing demand for high data rate and mobility. Both provider and customer see, the long time evolution (LTE) could be the promising technology for providing broadband, mobile Internet access. To provide better quality of service (QoS) to customers, the resources must be utilized at its fullest impeccable way. Resource scheduling is one of the important functions for remanufacturing or upgrading system performance. This paper studies the recently proposed packet scheduling schemes for LTE systems. The study has been concentrated in implication to real-time services such as online video streaming and Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP). For performance study, the LTE-Sim simulator is used. The primary objective of this paper is to provide results that will help researchers to design more efficient scheduling schemes, aiming to get better overall system performance. For the simulation study, two scenarios, one for video traffic and other for VoIP have been created. Various performances metric such as packet loss, fairness, end-to-end (E2E) delay, cell throughput and spectral efficiency has been measured for both the scenarios varying numbers of users. In the light of the simulation result analysis, the frame level scheduler (FLS) algorithms outperform other, by balancing the QoS requirements for multimedia services.

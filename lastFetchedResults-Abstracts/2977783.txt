We propose a method based on a real-time search for the proper action of an autonomous mobile robot using the framework of the Anytime Algorithm. This is available for a real-time search in a dynamic environment. In order to apply the Anytime Algorithm to the multi-objective real-time search in the dynamic situation around the autonomous mobile robot, we adopt prediction, a switching evaluation function technique, the action watch dog and an evolution strategy. These enable the robots to realize the real time search. The paper explains the proposed method and shows the feasibility through experimental results using real robots

The paper proposes a mobile telemedicine system delivering medical health care services in Sabah areas under the Smart Tele-emergency Project. The system uses Mobile Internet Protocol version 6 (MIPv6) combined with a rapidly deployable network based on mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) and IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN (WLAN) technology. The primary objective of the Smart project is to create a prototype mobile telemedicine system, including hardware and software, that can be rapidly deployed in rural areas or in disaster conditions where telecommunication infrastructures are lacking or destroyed. We propose the integration of MIPv6, MANET and WLAN to provide telemedicine. This project is currently under refinement for simulation and implementation. The project is funded by IRPA (RM 445,000.00) for three years.

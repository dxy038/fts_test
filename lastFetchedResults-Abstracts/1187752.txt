In the present work two types of fillers were incorporated into thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers (TPU): mica and aluminum trihydrate (ATH). In the first stage, mixtures were prepared with TPU and 5, 10, 20, 25 and 30 phr of mica. The optimum amount of filler was evaluated for mechanical properties. In the second stage, ATH was used in mixtures with TPU and mica in the preparation of compositions with good flame retardant. All mixtures were obtained by extrusion and after compression molding they were evaluated through mechanical properties of tensile resistance, Shore A hardness and abrasion resistance. The objective of this work is to obtain good mechanical properties from TPU composites with micaâ€“ATH as fillers and optimum cost-performance balance, in addition to flame retardant characteristics.

This paper deals with the analysis and simulation of the static series compensator (SSSC) for subsynchronous resonance (SSR) mitigation. The purpose of the paper is to derive and analyze a novel control strategy for SSSC dedicated for SSR mitigation. Objective of the proposed controller is to increase the network damping only at those frequencies that are critical for the turbine-generator shaft. By using frequency scanning analysis, the effectiveness of the proposed method for mitigation of SSR due to torsional interaction effect is presented and compared with the existing control strategy. Finally, simulation results show the performance of the proposed method in mitigating SSR due to torque amplification effect.

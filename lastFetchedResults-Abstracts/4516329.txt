Based on analysis of medical logistics characters, reasonable thesis and subject conditions of medical logistics math model were proposed. At the same time, the objective function of the medical logistics distribution routing optimization was composed. The genetic algorithm has the ability of finding the optimization routing. The optimization of the objective function was obtained by genetic algorithm. The experimental results show that the genetic algorithm possesses the better optimization quantity and effect in the medical logistics distribution routing.

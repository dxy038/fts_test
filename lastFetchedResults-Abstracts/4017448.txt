A low-power, wireless, and implantable microstimulator system on chip with smart powering management, immediate neural signal acquisition, and wireless rechargeable system is proposed. A system controller with parity checking handles the adjustable stimulus parameters for the stimulated objective. In the current paper, the ratÂ´s intra-cardiac electrogram is employed as the stimulated model in the animal study, and it is sensed by a low-voltage and low-power monitoring analog front end. The power management unit, which includes a rectifier, battery charging and detection, and a regulator, is used for the power control of the internal circuits. The stimulation data and required clock are extracted by a phase-locked-loop-based phase shift keying demodulator from an inductive AC signal. The full chip, which consumes 48 &#956;W only, is fabricated in a TSMC 0.35 &#956;m 2P4M standard CMOS process to perform the monitoring and pacing functions with inductively powered communication in the in vivo study.

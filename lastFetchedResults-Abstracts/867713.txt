This paper presents an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm in an agent-based system to integrate process planning
and shopfloor scheduling (IPPS). The search-based algorithm which aims to obtain optimal solutions by an autocatalytic
process is incorporated into an established multi-agent system (MAS) platform, with advantages of flexible system
architectures and responsive fault tolerance. Artificial ants are implemented as software agents. A graph-based solution
method is proposed with the objective of minimizing makespan. Simulation studies have been established to evaluate
the performance of the ant approach. The experimental results indicate that the ACO algorithm can effectively solve
the IPPS problems and the agent-based implementation can provide a distributive computation of the algorithm.

In this paper, the problem of model predictive control for drum water level of boiler systems is investigated. The parameter uncertainties are time-varying norm-bounded and the non-linearity is assumed to satisfy the boundedness condition. The aim is to design a state-feedback controller which minimizes an upper bound on a quadratic objective function at each sampling instant. The hard constraint on the variance of the input is also considered. By linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, sufficient conditions are obtained, which guarantee the robustly asymptotic stability of the closed-loop feedback system. An example of a boiler drum system is included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

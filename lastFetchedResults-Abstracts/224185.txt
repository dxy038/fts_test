A neural network for controlling shunt capacitor
banks and feeder voltage regulators in electric distribution
systems is presented. The objective of the neural
controller is to minimize total 12R losses and maintain
all bus voltages within standard limits. The performance
of the neural network for different input selections
and training data is discussed and compared.
Two different input selections are tried, one using the
previous control states of the capacitors and regulator
along with measured line flows and voltage which
is equivalent to having feedback and the other with
measured line flows and voltage without previous control
settings. The results indicate that the neural net
controller with feedback can outperform the one without.
Also, proper selection of a training data set that
adequately covers the operating space of the distribution
system is important for achieving satisfactory performance
with the neural controller. The neural controller
is tested on a radially configured distribution
system with 30 buses, 5 switchable capacitor banks
and a nine t.ap line regulator to demonstrate the performance
characteristics associated with these principles.
Monte Carlo simulations show that a carefully
designed and relatively compact neural network with a
small but carefully developed training set can perform
quite well under slight and extreme variation of loading
conditions.

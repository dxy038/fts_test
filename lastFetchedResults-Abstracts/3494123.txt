A method for estimating the radar cross section (RCS) of a complex shape such as an aircraft, a missile, or a satellite can be based on methods already developed for simple shapes. Several examples are reviewed to give the reader an idea of the nature of the results achievable with this approximation method. Since the ultimate objective is the determination of the radar reflectivity properties of an object of practical interest, interpreta ions and comparisons of RCS data are critical. Therefore, the use of averaging methods is also considered with particular emphasis being placed on the use of the cumulative distribution.

This paper addresses the problem of optimally placing a limited number of wavelength converting nodes in multicast optical WDM networks. The problem is motivated by the high cost incurred in the usage of converters. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation algorithm with the objective function of minimizing the total costs for a given set of multicast sessions in WDM networks. Numerical results show that the algorithm is tractable in networks with dozens of nodes.

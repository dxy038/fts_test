Objective: Having a good quality of life has always been desirable for humans and the concept of a good life and the ways of achieving it have been focused over the years. Personal wellbeing is the mental component of quality of life. Thus, the current study was conducted to estimate psychometric characteristics of “personal well-being index-adult” (PWI-A) in mothers of mentally retarded students of exceptional schools in northern districts of Tehran. Methods: From 358 mothers of mentally retarded students in north of Tehran (districts 1, 2 and 3), 200 mothers were selected by systematic random sampling. The collected data using PWI-A was analyzed by inferential statistics (Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for test reliability and linear multivariate regression for test validity). Results: Results showed acceptable reliability and validity for PWI-A in mothers of mentally retarded students of exceptional schools in north districts of Tehran. The Correlation between seven items was significant (P < 0.001) and this index had the most extensive coverage of construct validity. Conclusion: This study showed that this scale could be applied to measure personal wellbeing in mothers of mentally retarded students

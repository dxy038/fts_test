The objective of this research was to extend ground beef retail display life using antioxidants, reductants, and/or TSP treatments combined with electron beam irradiation. Ground beef was produced with added butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) plus butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) with the following combinations; (1) ascorbate; (2) trisodium phosphate(buffer); (3) erythorbate; (1) and (2); (1) and (3); (1), (2), and (3); and an untreated control, C. Half of the treated samples were irradiated (I) at 2.0 kGy-absorbed dose under a nitrogen atmosphere, half remained non-irradiated (N). Samples were displayed under atmospheric oxygen and evaluated for total aerobic plate count (TPC), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and instrumental color during 9 d of simulated retail display (SRD). Controls had the highest (P &lt; 0.05) TBARS value and the lowest (P &lt; 0.05) redness (CIE aâˆ—), proportion of oxymyoglobin and vividness. Treated irradiated samples were just as red and vivid on SRD day 9 as the non-irradiated untreated control at day 0. Treatments stabilized color and lipids of ground beef after irradiation and during SRD.

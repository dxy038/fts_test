Background: Entering of raw wastewater from textile industries would damage the environment. Mutiple purpose wastewater treatment processes, would probably be of interest to industries' owners.
Objective: The study aimed to use potassium ferrate to refine textile industry's wastewater and compare its efficiency with ferric chloride method.
Methods: This study was done in Tarbiat Modarres university in 1997 which a number of wastewater samples from several textile industries were randomly taken. The potassium ferrate was synthesized with the help of Jartest, the optimum PH and doses of k2feO4 were determined. The surveyed indices were C.O.D, T.S.S, sludge index, percentage of light in A max absorption. Also, the samples were microbiologically assessed.
Findings: Using potassium ferrate, removal efficiency for C.O.D and T.S.S in the range of 89-92.4% and 94-96% were concluded. The optimum PH and doses of K2fe04 were in range of 5-6 and 60-85 mg/I, respectively. The volume of sludge produced were 1.5-2.5% of the primary
wastewater volume. Light transmittance in A max was shown 77-79%. To analyse microbicidal efficiency of this chemical the M.P.N/100ml of samples were performed which all showed figures less than 100.
Conclusion: Because of using less potassium Ferrate, the amount of chemicals and sludge volume were considerably reduced. Also, costs for establishment and conduction of wastewater treatment foundations maybe significantly reduced. In removing C.O.D, T.S.S, color and disinfection of wastewater, K2FeO4 has a great efficiency.

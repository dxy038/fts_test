The current teaching and learning (T&amp;L) activities should exploit the benefits and advancement of mobile learning (m-Learning) technology in providing better learning environment for learners and instructors. Meantime, persuasive computing is the next area that should be coined together in developing m-learning applications. Persuasive computing as an interactive application aims to specifically change people´s behaviour in a specific manner. Nevertheless, the objective of this paper is to propose the customised-design of learning pills that can be applied in T&amp;L activities, as an alternative method to promote persuasion strategies in m-Learning environment. The learning pills are designed contextually using the Foggs´ persuasion message categories, thus this paper involves students from the Requirement Engineering (RE) coursework. As initial results, it is found that the persuasive learning pills were successfully designed for m-Learning platform. At the same time the persuasive learning pills are expected to encourage learners to become more motivated in their studies by inducing enthusiastic learning habits and behaviour.

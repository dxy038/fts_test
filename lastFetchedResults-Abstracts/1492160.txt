Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield and quality is influenced by management of the previous crop but is highly dependent on current year management. The objective of this study was to evaluate the response of winter wheat seeded in two tillage systems [conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT)] to four N rates applied to a previous cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) crop (0, 67, 134, and 202 kg ha−1). The experiment with wheat was conducted on a Dothan sandy loam (fine, loamy siliceous, thermic Plinthic Kandiudults) at the University of Florida North Florida Research and Education Center near Quincy, FL from 1995 to 1997. For most plant characteristics, there was a tillage x N x year interaction. Greater plant emergence (79.4 vs. 65.3%) and grain N (23.5 vs. 21.5 g kg−1), and lower grain moisture (139 vs. 142 g kg−1) were obtained under NT than CT, respectively, in one out of two years. Nitrogen applied to a previous cotton crop increased wheat grain yields, plant height and seed number under NT in 1995–1996 and CT in 1996–1997, head density under NT in both years, harvest index under CT in 1996–1997, and grain N concentration in 1995–1996 and 1996–1997 due to residual plant and soil N. With every 1 kg N applied to a previous cotton crop, wheat grain yields increased by 5.38 kg ha−1 under NT, whereas grain yield under CT was not influenced by N application to cotton in 1995–1996. In 1996–1997, grain yields increased by 4.96 and 4.23 kg ha−1 for wheat grown in NT and CT, respectively. Generally, wheat seeded in NT following cotton did not decrease stand or yields compared to CT and wheat grain yields and grain N content increased with N fertilization of the previous crop. However, we would have to apply about 134 kg N ha−1 to a previous cotton crop to maximize wheat production under NT and CT.

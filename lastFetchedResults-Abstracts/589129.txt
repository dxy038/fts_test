Objective: The present research attempts to identify key factors in acceptance of web-based databases by the academic users.
Method: Data was collected via 15 semi-structured interviews conducted with faculty members, graduate students and university officials. Once openly, axially and selectively coded, these data were analyzed using Grounded Theory Approach.
Findings: A central concept “Intent to use” was formed. This pertains to a person’s decision to use the databases available on campus for scholarly activities. Other categories included Skill/knowledge characteristics, Individual/professional characteristics, attitude, effectiveness, ease of access, carrying of duties and knowledge increase. University and libraries are among factors influencing acceptance of databases that affect intent to use both directly and indirectly.

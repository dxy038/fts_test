In this paper we address the Stochastic Airport Bus Routing Problem (SABRP) where the availability of customers in the meeting points is randomly generated. We solve the problem by utilizing the stochastic programming recourse approach. The objective of our model is to minimize the cost of regular bus tours and the recourse cost when special taxis tours will be sent to specific customers.

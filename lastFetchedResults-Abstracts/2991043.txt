Lineaments are important features showing subsurface elements or structural weaknesses such as faults. Most lineament maps have been drawn based on fieldwork by experts and visual analysis of enhanced image data. In visual interpretation and mapping of lineaments, geologists use their knowledge and experience to extract the lineaments from the curved and straight lines in image data. A different expert may extract different segment elements through a visual approach. In order to conduct the lineament detection under the same conditions, automatic extraction for lineaments though image processing is useful. In an earlier paper, an extraction method for lineaments using airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data was presented. The results indicated that the segments given by the method agree with a lineament map drawn by experts. The objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between extracted segments from both airborne SAR and Landsat 5 thematic mapper (TM) data and geographical features. River erosion creates various stream patterns that are influenced by the subsurface structure. Many lineaments can be extracted from a drainage system for topography. This paper seeks to compare extracted segments and water systems. Also, relief energies can indicate the level of the river erosion. The relief energy at a study site has been compared and the correspondence between the computation and extracted segments is described. Finally, the difference between segments in SAR and TM data has been compared

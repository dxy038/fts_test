A typical phased development approach to CASE (computer-aided software engineering) is discussed. The methodologies that define the unit subsystems matrices are all contained in one all-encompassing methodological set that is referred to as USE, or (Unified Systems Engineering). CASE, with the USE methodology, meets the need to specify the system design in objective, rational, and state-of-technology objectives. USE is a mathematical modeling methodology which includes electrical, inertial, fluidic, structural, and thermal conduction submethodologies

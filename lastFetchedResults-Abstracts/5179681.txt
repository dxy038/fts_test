Cognition concept and dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA) technique are applied in cognitive wireless network to increase spectrum utilization efficiency and alleviate network congestion. Due to the dynamic and random characteristic of radio environment in cognitive wireless network, this paper brings forward a dynamic channel allocation mechanism to minimize the probability of collision with the licensed users and improve the performance of cognitive wireless network. Matching rules are set forth by considering relationship between spectrum statistic characteristic and service characteristic adequately. Furthermore, a multi-objective terminal selection algorithm is designed to minimize the system overhead and the impact on end-users. Simulation results manifest that the proposed scheme is effective in improving the performance of cognitive wireless network, reducing the spectrum handoff times and minimizing the collision probability.

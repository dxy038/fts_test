The forecast of geology prospecting during tunnel boring machine (TBM) working is based on the detection of underground medium resistivity anomaly. Papers use IP( induced polarization) method to detect abnormal body underground It is considered as experimental models that the abnormal resistivity due to a underground sphere using two pole array. Apparent resistivity is measured on the platform of field measurement, and the date will be processed in inversion algorithm. The final result of inversion, an optimization method in mathematics, is obtaining the minimum of the objective function. By means of Genetic Algorithm, it will be found that parameters obtained (resistivity of earth and the radius, the depth, and the horizontal distance of the globularity objection) be more close the true result.

This paper combines with the characteristic of knowledge-based engineering decision problem for circular economy, analyses knowledge representation, rule representation, reasoning mechanism and knowledge base structure of multi-objective attribute decision problems. It proposes a software architecture of knowledge-based engineering decision support system, which lays the foundation for the realization of the dynamic monitoring of the basic conditions of regional sustainable development and accurately reflecting on the relationship of the various elements and the evolution of the process.

The objective of this study is to evaluate whether the retrieval of the leaf chlorophyll content and leaf area index (LAI) for precision agriculture application from hyperspectral data is significantly affected by data compression. This analysis was carried out using the hyperspectral data sets acquired by Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) over corn fields at L'Acadie experimental farm (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada) during the summer of 2000 and over corn, soybean and wheat fields at the former Greenbelt farm (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada) in three intensive field campaigns during the summer of 2001. Leaf chlorophyll content and LAI were retrieved from the original data and the reconstructed data compressed/decompressed by the compression algorithm called Successive approximation multi-stage vector quantization (SAMVQ) at compression ratios of 20:1, 30:1, and 50:1. The retrieved products were evaluated against the ground-truth.

 retrieval of leaf chlorophyll content (the first data set), the spatial patterns were examined in all of the images created from the original and reconstructed data and were proven to be visually unchanged, as expected. The data measures R2, absolute RMSE, and relative RMSE between the leaf chlorophyll content derived from the original and reconstructed data cubes, and the laboratory-measured values were calculated as well. The results show the retrieval accuracy of crop chlorophyll content is not significantly affected by SAMVQ at the compression ratios of 20:1, 30:1, and 50:1, relative to the observed uncertainties in ground truth values. In the retrieval of LAI (the second data set), qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed. The results show that the spatial and temporal patterns of the LAI images are not significantly affected by SAMVQ and the retrieval accuracies measured by the R2, absolute RMSE, and relative RMSE between the ground-measured LAI and the estimated LAI are not significantly affected by the data compression either.

Background: One of the most common causes of limited activity in persons is chronic low back pain and many factors may cause it.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation between strength of pelvic and thigh muscles as related to chronic low back pain in comparison with control group. Also sex as an affecting factor was studied.
Methods: The subjects of the study were patients with chronic low back pain who were admitted to phisical therapy ward of Shiraz hospitals in 2000. 160 subjects (81 male and 79 female) with mean age of 41.3 were included in the study group. 56 with chronic low back pain and one 104 healthy subjects as control group. Data collection was performed by a questionnaire and by using manual muscle testing methods, the strength of fifteen muscles in total sides of pelvic and thigh regions were measured. Statistical analysis was done by T-Test and Levins-Test (P<0.05).
Findings: Findings revealed that the strength of all muscles in patients with chronic low back pain were significantly less than healthy subjects. Also sex influenced muscle strength and women had less power in pelvic and thigh muscles than men with chronic low back pain, but in healthy persons this difference were negligible.
Conclusion: There is significant correlation between chronic low back pain and strength of muscles of pelvic and thighs. Therefore it seems that muscle strengthening of pelvis and thigh muscles may be an important adjunct to chronic low back pain management.

This paper considers an objective picture quality scale for color images (PQScolor). PQScolor approximates the mean opinion score satisfactorily, it takes into account the color perception by using color difference and the properties of visual perception for global features and for localized disturbances. There are two type systems, PQScolor1 is based on GodloveÂ´s color difference and PQScolor2 is based on H, V, C signal difference. The correlation coefficient between PQScolor (1, 2) and MOS is more than 0.9, which is very high compared to the value 0.34 obtained for the mean color difference scale

Recent computer simulations suggest that the presence of aggregates of red blood cells (RBCs), at random angles and lengths, does not affect the measurements of transverse blood flow using a correlation-based method and an IVUS array catheter. Blood velocity gradients were also shown not to influence the correlation-based method for blood velocity estimation. The objective of this study is to quantify the influence of aggregates of RBCs and blood velocity gradients on the correlation-based method during in vitro experiments. For this purpose, measurements were performed on normal and diseased human blood. The decorrelation pattern of a circular ultrasound transducer as a function of transverse blood flow was studied using a Couette system. Agreements were found between the auto-convolution of the acoustical beam and the RF decorrelation patterns.

The objective of this research paper is to develop such a system which can transmit the pressure of the tire on a module, which can not only display the air pressure of the tire but also maintain the pressure of tire by operating an air filling machine. Key elements of this research are pressure sensor, microcontroller, RF transceiver, solenoid valve and analog to digital converter (ADC). This system is basically divided in to two section one is hanging on the tire other is placed on the car dash board. Whole system continuously monitor and display the tire pressure whenever air pressure inside the tire is decrease from certain level define inside the controller it starts the air filling machine.

Objective
jective of this study was to develop quantitative T1ρ-weighted magnetic resonance imaging methodology for the detection and characterization of cartilage degeneration in a rabbit anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) transection model.
s
ght knee ACLs of 18 adult female New Zealand white rabbits were transected. The left knee joint served as a sham control. The rabbits were euthanized at 3 (Group 1), 6 (Group 2) and 12 (Group 3) weeks postoperatively. High-resolution 3D fat-saturated spoiled gradient echo images and T1ρ-weighted images were obtained in both the sagittal and axial planes at 3 T using a quadrature wrist coil. Following MR analysis, histological slides from the lateral femoral condyle cartilage were graded using the Mankin grading system.
s
l three groups, the average overall T1ρ values were significantly higher in the ACL-transected knee compared to control knee, and the percentage differences in T1ρ values between ACL-transected and control increased with the duration of time after transection. The average Mankin score for ACL-transected knees was higher than that for control for each time point, but this difference was statistically significant only for all groups combined.
sions
tudy demonstrates the feasibility of using T1ρ-weighted imaging as a useful tool in the detection and quantification of cartilage damage in all knee compartments in an ACL-transected rabbit model of cartilage degeneration.

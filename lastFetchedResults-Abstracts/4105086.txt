The area ratio of analog to digital for mixed-mode chip has been inversely proportional to the process design rule for a given dynamic range objective, in contradiction to the LSI trend. This paper presents a design approach to realize a high degree of size reduction with process design rules for analog circuitry and a signal processing architecture for digital circuitry. A five-level current-mode &#931;&#916; digital-to-analog converter (DAC) system reveals full scale total harmonic: distortion plus noise (THD+N) of -90 dB and dynamic-range of 100 dB at 3 V (low power of 22 mW). Analog-area down-scaling can be accomplished by this architecture to be 1.09 mm<sup>2</sup>, using 0.6-&#956;m double-poly double-metal (DPDM) CMOS. For the digital filter, a pipeline instruction sequence with multiplierless architecture also gives small area of 1.98 mm<sup>2</sup>

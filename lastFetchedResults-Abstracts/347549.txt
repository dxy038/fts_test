Objective: Increased distractibility is a common impairment in alcoholism, but objective evidence has remained elusive. Here, a task designed to investigate with event-related brain potentials (ERPs) the neural mechanism underlying distraction was used to show abnormal involuntary orienting of attention in chronic alcoholism.
Methods: Fifteen alcoholics and 17 matched healthy controls were instructed to ignore auditory stimuli while concentrating in the discrimination of immediately following visual stimuli. The auditory sequences contained repetitive standard tones occasionally replaced by deviant tones of slightly higher frequency, or by complex novel sounds.
Results: Deviant tones and novel sounds distracted visual performance, i.e. increased reaction time to visual stimuli, similarly in patients and controls. Compared to controls, however, alcoholics showed ERP abnormalities, i.e. enhanced P3a amplitudes over the left frontal region, and a positive posterior deflection instead of the frontally distributed reorienting negativity (RON).
Conclusions: The enhanced P3a to novelty and subsequent positive wave instead of RON in alcoholics suggests encoding into working memory of task-irrelevant auditory events and provides neurophysiological markers of impaired involuntary attention mechanisms in chronic alcoholism.

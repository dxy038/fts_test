This paper presents the role of Evolutionary Algorithms for the design and optimization of specific micro-/millimeter wave components. For this, we have taken two problems: one is a nonlinear taper for a 200 KW, long-pulse gyrotron operating at 170 GHz and another is a dual-frequency proximity coupled Microstrip Antenna. The problems are optimized using single and multi-objective Particle swarm optimization (PSO) respectively.

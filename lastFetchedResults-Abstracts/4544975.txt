Mode division multiplexing (MDM) over few-mode fibers (FMFs) is considered a promising solution for surpassing the capacity limits of single-mode fiber systems. To meet this objective in capacity increase, MDM should comply with wavelength division multiplexing, i.e. apply over each wavelength. A crucial component for a MDM transmission system is the mode multiplexer (MUX), which should be broadband enough to be used in a WDM context. A broadband all-fiber mode MUX based on cascaded FMF couplers is presented and numerically analyzed. The MUX combines modes LP<sub>01</sub>, LP<sub>11a</sub>, LP<sub>11b</sub>, LP<sub>21a</sub>, LP<sub>21b</sub>, and LP<sub>02</sub>, with an optimized performance over the C band. By considering polarization multiplexing, an order of magnitude capacity increase is supported.

The multi-user distributed antenna system (MUDAS) is considered as a promising technology in the future wireless communication. Compared to the multi-user centralized antenna system (CAS), MU-DAS can improve the spectral efficiency significantly. One most attractive feature is that the implementation of the MU-DAS can be reduced by using the clustering approach of the remote antenna units (RAUs). However, the cluster algorithm of DAS has been only partially investigated. In this paper, a novel dynamic clustering algorithm for MU-DAS is presented. The objective of this algorithm is to maximize the total system capacity by using the full channel state information (CSI) or partial CSI. Simulation results show that our approach yields significant capacity gains when compared with some proposed clustering algorithms, and also the implementation complexity of the proposed algorithm remains very low.

The main impetus for IN is their ability to assure service transparency in a multivendor environment and to provide a flexible platform for network providers to create and introduce new services quickly and easily. The IN standards activity in the CCITT is based on a service-driven approach and the main objective is to ensure that the standards developed are easily evolvable to address future services and network capabilities. The authors describe work on Capability Set-1 (CS-1) which is a subset of IN capabilities and addresses the near-term requirements of both manufacturers and network operators and defines the network capabilities to support current services. According to CCITT plans, CS-1 and related network architecture standards will be completed by the end of 1992. The author addresses future IN standardization issues that need to be resolved to define CS-2 and beyond network capabilities

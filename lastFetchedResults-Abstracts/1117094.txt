The present study explores the notion of "prototypical transitivity in speech verbs".  Much has been written about transitivity until now, and it is one of the central concepts in old traditions and modern linguistics. The most important aspect of transitivity is that it is a phenomenon in the structure of human languages and it appears to be universal. However, limited studies concern this issue in speech verbs. A main objective of this study is to seek a comprehensive explanation for transitivity in speech verbs based on Persian language cognition.  Meanwhile the researcher uses the prototype theory as an analytical tool. According to this theory, the prototype is the central example of the category and other members assigns their membership by means of a judgment of similarity to a central example.  The results show all the transitive speech verbs present the same structure (S O V); but at the semantic level it is possible to organize these verbs into 2 groups:first, the prototypical transitive constructions. And the non-prototypical transitive constructions

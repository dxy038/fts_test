The buck converter is an electronic device widely used in power electric applications. This converter has a nonlinear performance in consequence of the switching transistor effects which it uses. Implement a classic controller for this converter results very complex. Hence, fuzzy controllers are used to obtain a better steady state performance of the system. This paper presents a multi-objective optimization to ensure a steady state error (e<sub>ss</sub>)&lt;;0.03 and a ripple factor (Fr)&lt;;0.03. We use the NSGA-II multi-objective algorithm, because this has an elitist approach that guarantees a great genetic diversity. The obtained results are validated using simulation of the algorithm obtaining a smaller e<sub>ss</sub> and Fr than the previous works. This work represents an innovative contribution in the control of buck converters, due to the fact that thereÂ´s no works in the literature that tunes this devices using NSGA-II.

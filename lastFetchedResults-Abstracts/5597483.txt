This paper presents a substitution-based case adaptation CBR to analyze the causes of effecting the change of the aging´s mood status. Substitution-based case adaptation can make use of a limited number of cases to extract the relations between the cases and reach automatic adaptation. With the accumulation of cases in the case library, the result of inference fit in line with the habit of the aging´s life would be improved based on this automatic adaptation. The objective of iCare is to provide quality e-services to the elderly people anywhere and anytime via an iCare home portal (that is grounded on an iCare e-services framework comprising an iCare e-service ontology and an iCare e-service provision quality model). The framework presented in this article not only implies a future roadmap of quality-aging e-services but also manifests possible forms of warm-hearted technologies.

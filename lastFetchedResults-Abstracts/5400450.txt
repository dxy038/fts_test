The dynamic measurement of lubricant film for slide bearing is always a pursuing objective because it can not only show the dynamic information of the lubricant film, but also present a new approach for fault diagnosis of rotary machinery as a possibility. In the paper, a reflective fibre optic displacement sensor is firstly introduced for the dynamic measurement of the lubricant film, and then the influence of the reflector shape with regard to the principle property of the reflective fibre optic displacement sensor is deeply analyzed so that the influence of the reflector shape is zero when the curvature radius is much bigger than the diameter of the fibre. So, a fibre optical based dynamic measurement schedule is presented for the lubricant film of slide bearing. At last, by the experimental verification, the results show that the proposed approach for the influence analysis of the reflector shape is correct, and the presented schedule for the fibre optic dynamic measurement of lubricant film about slide bearing is also feasible.

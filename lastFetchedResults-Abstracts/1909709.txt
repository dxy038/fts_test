Objective
etastasis is a major cause of morbidity in prostatic cancer. Therefore, detecting and monitoring bone lesions are crucial for treatment of prostatic carcinoma. We aimed to evaluate total body bone mineral density and regional bone mineral density in patients with prostate cancer with and without metastases, and to compare them with bone scintigraphy.
s
four patients with prostatic carcinoma and 20 healthy subjects were investigated with bone scintigraphy and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The bone scintigraphic findings were classified as normal (score 0: n = 22), abnormal but not typical for metastases (score 1: n = 18), and typical pattern of metastases (score 2: n = 14).
s
tients with bone metastases prostate cancer had significantly higher total bone mineral density and regional bone mineral density of trunk and pelvis than healthy controls and prostate cancer patients without bone metastases. There was a significant positive correlation between bone scan score and total bone mineral density and regional bone mineral density of trunk and pelvis (r = 0.328, P &lt; 0.05, r = 0.60, P &lt; 0.001, r = 0.480, P &lt; 0.001, respectively).
sion
sults show that patients of prostate cancer with bone metastases have increased bone mineral density (BMD) in the pelvis and trunk, possibly because of a predominance of osteoblastic over osteolytic metastases demonstrated by Tc-99m MDP bone scan.

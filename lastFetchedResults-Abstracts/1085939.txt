Brackish water desalination through distillation produces essentially distilled water devoid of all minerals. In reverse osmosis (RO) all dissolved minerals get depleted but depletion of useful minerals (Mg2 +, Ca2 +, SO42 − and CO32 −/HCO3−) is even greater than of Na+ and Cl–. Conventional electrodialysis (EDconv) too fails to meet the desired objective, all constituents being depleted in similar proportions with respect to feed. Consequently, re-mineralisation is necessary but in many cases not implemented. We report selective electrodialysis (EDsel), for production of desalinated water containing relatively higher proportions of desirable minerals. Commercial cation- and anion exchange membranes (CEMCNS and AEMCNS) were coated with polyaniline (PANI), and the resultant membranes (PANI-CEMCNS, PANI-AEMCNS) were characterised by physico-chemical and electrochemical techniques. Due to sieving and hydrophobic effects, the PANI coating was demonstrated to improve the retention of Mg2 +, Ca2 + and SO42 − during desalination. Retention of mineral constituents was further enhanced with PANI modified styrene-co-divinylbenzene-polyethylene-based interpolymer cation- and anion-exchange membranes (CEMIP and AEMIP). The total alkalinity of the treated stream increased during EDsel, presumably due to concentration polarisation accompanied by preferential transport of H+ over OH−. The process efficiency was only marginally lower (5%) for EDsel, suggesting that this approach to desalination may be of practical importance.

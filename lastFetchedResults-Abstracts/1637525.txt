The objective of this study is to investigate the use of recycled brick powder as replacement of mineral filler in asphalt mixture. A comparative study was carried out on the performance of two mixtures using recycled brick powder and limestone filler. The experimental performed were indirect tensile tests, static and dynamic creep tests, water sensitivity tests and fatigue tests. The results show that the mixtures prepared with recycled brick powder have better mechanical properties than the mixtures with limestone filler. Thus, it is promising to use recycled brick powder as mineral filler in asphalt mixture.

Objective: Biodegradable polycaprolactone/starch composites can be used for bone tissue engineering applications. The effect of the ratio of components on composite properties is of tremendous importance.
Methods: Polycaprolactone/starch composite of 80/20 and 70/30 ratios were fabricated by dissolving them in chloroform followed by evaporation of the solvent.
Results: The composites were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Their bioactivity was evaluated by studying the apatite formation ability after immersing the specimens in simulated body fluid. The results of compressive test on samples showed that the compositeâ€™s modulus and strength approximated that of human trabecular bone. Mass loss in distilled water and starch degradation rate in PBS was evaluated, which showed that the starch ratio was effective in composite degradation. MTT analysis and alkaline phosphatase levels showed that this composite had no toxicity and could increase G-299 cell line osteoblastic activities. 
Conclusion: The increase in cellular osteoblastic activities and the ability for apatite formation on the composite surface, in addition to the polycaprolactone/starch samples' mechanical properties shows their capability to be used as substitutes for bone. Because this composite degradation rate is controlled by changing the starch ratio, it has the potential for use in bone tissue engineering applications. Samples that have a 70/30 ratio are considered optimal due to their enhanced cellular response and better mechanical properties.

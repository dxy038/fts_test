In this paper, a Problem of simultaneous and
coordinated tuning of the PID type Power System
Stabilizer (PSS) and Automatic Voltage Regulators
(AVR) gains in a Single-Machine connected to Infinite-
Bus (SMIB) power system is invastigated. The problem
of robustly stabilizer parameters and AVR gain tunning is
formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem
according to the time domain-based objective function for
a wide range of operating conditions and is solved by the
Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) for improvement
of power system low frequency oscillations. The GSA
optimization technique is simple, robust and capable to
solve difficult combinatorial optimization problems. It
simulates the masses cooperate using a direct form of
communication through gravitational force and has a
strong ability to successful control the local search and
convergence to the global optimum solution. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on a SMIB
power system through the nonlinear time domain
simulation and some performance indices in comparison
with the some version of PSO based approaches to
illustrate its robust performance. Results evaluation
indicate that the proposed GSA based coordinated PID
type stabilizer and AVR achieves good robust
performance for wide range of system operation
conditions and is superior to the other methods.

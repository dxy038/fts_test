One outcome of air transportation deregulation policies worldwide is the growing number of passengers, including people with a disability. Because social equality is recognized as a worthwhile objective, providing an environment at both the airport terminal and on-board aircraft that eases travel for those with various impairments is an objective airlines and airport authorities increasingly view as important, and which they monitor. In order to understand the disabled travelerâ€™s wants and needs, this paper applied importance-performance analysis (IPA) to examine the perception of, and satisfaction with, air transportation services. Data from a sample of 130 respondents with lower extremity function impairment is presented in this research. The results show the service needs are different across three levels of disability categorized as minor, moderate, and severe.

Materials can be purchased either in economic order quantity (EOQ) fashion or Just-in-time (JIT) fashion. When all the companies purchase their materials in JIT fashion from its up-stream material suppliers, a supply chain is formed. Many companies that still use the economic order quantity (EOQ) purchasing system are meditating whether they should switch to the just-in-time (JIT) purchasing policy. The decision is difficult, particularly when price discount and complicated calculation are involved. The objective of this paper is to compute the EOQ-JIT cost indifference point by deploying Matlab. A case study from the ready-mixed concrete industry in Singapore is provided.

Summary form only given. Rapid advancements in magnetic sensor technology are creating opportunities for solving traditional problems of ship magnetism. Both land-based and marine-based measuring instrumentation can provide reliable methods for controlling those fields in magnetically silent vehicles, e.g. geophysical ships and minehunters. This necessitates the development and use of not only improved measurement and processing, but also new ways in general evaluation of structure and intensity of the external field of the vehicles. We present approaches for effective prediction of the external magnetic field of marine vehicles using planar arrays of magnetic sensors. The objective is to compare different arrays of sensors needed to predict the field to a required accuracy at specific distances.

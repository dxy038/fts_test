This paper proposes a resource management approach that integrates a two tier structure to future traffic estimation with the purpose of avoiding forced termination and waste of bandwidth in handoffs. An efficient bandwidth reservation mechanism in neighboring cells is important in handoff process, particularly when the handoff traffic is heavy. As the next generation wireless networks cater for various kinds of applications with varying degree of QoS parameters, resource management is an important part in order to optimize the overall system performance. The performance of a wireless network is bounded by the efficiency of resource management. The objective is lessening the handoff call dropping probability by using future network traffic load and responding properly to it. In prediction based resource reservation, a priori estimation of the future traffic load affects the process of resource reservation. Our scheme is compared through simulations with other schemes. The simulation results show that our proposal provides better performance in terms of handoff dropping probability.

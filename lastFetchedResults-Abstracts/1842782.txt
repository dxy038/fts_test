The objective of this study was the feasibility of imaging hemodialysis fistulae with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). MRA was performed in eight Brescia-Cimino fistulae and seven goretex loop grafts, five of which were stenosed and 10 normal. We compared two MRA methods: a 2D magnetization prepared turbo field echo (MPTFE) and a 3D phase contrast (PC) sequence. Digital subtraction angiography served as the gold standard. MPTFE MRA provided satisfactory quality images of the entire fistula in 14 out of 15 cases, and PC MRA in 9 of 15 cases (p &lt; .05). MPTFE MRA identified all eight stenoses with one false-positive result. PC MRA identified seven of eight stenoses with two false positives. It is feasible to obtain diagnostic images of dialysis fistulae with MRA.

E-learning systems suffer from a lack of tools to provide practical activities for learners. The mixed reality is promised to be a new technology to create a virtual environment where the learner is an actor by interaction with virtual objects. The objective is to establish a virtual laboratory that all tools and products can be manipulated by learners like in real practical work. This virtualization can also solve the safety problems and may reduce the risk of some experiments: nuclear, chemical, etc. Another interesting benefit is the reduction of the investment on real hardware (locally or remotely). We propose an approach for developing integrated E-learning systems, helping to carry out the practical work by the distance learner based on an augmented reality system.

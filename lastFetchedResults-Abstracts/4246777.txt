Integration of a large amount of wind power to the power grid presents many challenges to the power system planners and operators. These challenges stem primarily from the natural characteristics of wind energy, which causes variable and intermittent power output, and secondarily from the missing infrastructure to bring the power from the optimal locations for wind generation to the loads. Storage devices provide the opportunity to overcome these challenges. This paper presents the use of multi-step optimization for the coordination of wind power with storage devices with the objective to fully exploit the transfer capacity of the system and at the same time to balance the variability of wind generation. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is illustrated in simulations for an 8 bus system.

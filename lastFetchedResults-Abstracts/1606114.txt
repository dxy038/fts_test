The trials were conducted at crop farm of IBBU Lapai ( 09 -02 N; 06 34 E) and Niger State College of Agriculture crops
farms, Mokwa ( 09 18 N; 05 04 E) in 2011 and 2012 cropping seasons. The objective was to evaluate the effect of intercropping
maize andAeschynomene histrix on Striga hermonthica management at Lapai and Mokwa, Southern Guinea Savannah of Nigeria.
The experiments were laid out in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) consisted of five (5) treatments viz., sole maize
without infestation, sole Aeschynomene, sole maize under Striga infestation, intercropped maize with Aeschynomene and
intercropped maize with Aeschynomene under Striga infestation replicated three (3) times. The result showed that under Striga
infestation, intercropped maize were taller and more vigorous, having lower reaction syndrome to Striga parasitism and Striga
shoot emergence which resulted in the production of higher grain yield compared with the sole

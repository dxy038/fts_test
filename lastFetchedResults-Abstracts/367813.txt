Evaluation of the host response to implanted materials requires systematic, objective investigations of responses at both the cellular and molecular levels. This article explains the basis behind two technologies: antibody and molecular techniques, which will give valuable information when applied to investigations of cells and molecules involved in the host biomaterial interaction. Such investigations are well underway, and a number of groups are now studying well characterised cell markers or molecules to evaluate the host response to biomaterials. Here we outline current technologies for the development of antibodies as tools to study cell markers or molecules, including those for which reagents are not yet available and DNA based technologies, whose continued application should prove an invaluable adjunct to existing approaches. These technologies may be particularly valuable to investigations focusing on newly characterised cytokines, receptors or cell adhesion molecules and subsequently provide a way forward for the production of advanced biomaterials.

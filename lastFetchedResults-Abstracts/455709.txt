Objective: Lipid disorders associated with the use of protease inhibitors (PI) may be a risk factor for premature atherosclerosis development. The aim of this study is to evaluate the extent of carotid intima media thickness (IMT) among HIV-positive patients treated with PI containing regimens compared to PI-naïve and HIV-negative subjects. Methods: We analysed plasma lipid levels and carotid IMT in 28 HIV-positive patients treated with protease inhibitors (PIs) for a mean of 28.7 months (range 18–43) and in two control groups constituted, respectively, by 15 HIV-positive naïve patients and 16 HIV-negative subjects, that were matched for age, risk factors for HIV infection, cigarette smoke use and CD4+ cell count. Results: PI-treated patients had higher triglyceride, HDL and apo B levels than controls. Carotid IMT was significantly increased in PI-treated patients compared to naïve or HIV-negative subjects. A correlation between cholesterol HDL, triglyceride and ApoB levels and IMT was observed among the entire cohort. Conclusions: Plasma lipid alterations were associated with an increased IMT and intima media thickening was more pronounced in PI-treated patients than in the two control groups. Periodical evaluation of blood lipid profile and, if required, the use of lipid-lowering agents is advisable. Moreover, physicians should address concurrent risk factor for atherosclerosis that can be modified, including smoking, hypertension, obesity and sedentary life-style.

The objective of this review is to analyze potential technologies and their baseline performance of producing hydrogen from catalytic steam reforming of biodiesel byproduct glycerol. High oxygen content and high impurity level of biodiesel byproduct glycerol, as well as the complex intermediates and high coking potential in its thermal degradation, make the modeling, design, and operation of glycerol steam reforming a challenge. Thermal decomposition characterization of biodiesel byproduct glycerol was covered, and the recent developments and methods for high-purity hydrogen production from glycerol steam reforming were illustrated. The thermodynamics constraint of water gas shift reaction can be overcome by the sorption-enhanced steam reforming process, which integrated catalytic steam reforming, water gas shift reaction and in-situ CO2 removal at high temperatures in a single stage reactor. The effectiveness of both the enhanced H2 production and the use of CO2 sorbents have been demonstrated and discussed. The technical challenges to achieve a stable high-purity hydrogen production by the sorption-enhanced steam reforming process included extending operation time, selecting suitable sorbents, finding a way for continuous reaction-regeneration of catalyst and sorbent mixture and improving process efficiencies. The continuous sorption-enhanced steam reforming of glycerol was designed by a simultaneous flow concept of catalyst and sorbent for continuous reaction-regeneration using two slow moving-bed reactors for high-purity hydrogen production and CO2 capture, and in this process, catalyst and sorbent were run in nearly fresh state for H2 production. The sorption-enhanced chemical-looping reforming was also demonstrated. The paper discusses some issues and challenges, along with the possible solutions in order to help in efficient production of hydrogen from catalytic steam reforming of biodiesel byproduct glycerol.

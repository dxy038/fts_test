Widely distributed single-phase power electronic loads are an increasingly important source of harmonics in power distribution systems. The objective of this paper is to investigate the cumulative harmonic current characteristics of a large number of such loads. A complete analytical model for the most common load type is derived. This model is then used to investigate the impact of: (1) interaction due to a shared source impedance; (2) variation in power level; and (3) variations in circuit parameters, on individual and cumulative current harmonics. The key findings of the paper are that diversity and attenuation are very important factors in predicting the behavior of distributed single-phase power electronic loads, especially for the higher-order harmonics, and that due to these two factors, the commonly-used fixed current injection method, using arithmetic sums of harmonic current magnitudes, can significantly overestimate the cumulative harmonic currents produced by these loads

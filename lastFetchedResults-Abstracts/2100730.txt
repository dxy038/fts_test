In Marek's disease virus infection, feather follicle epithelium (FFE) constitutes the site of formation of infectious virus particles and virus shedding. The objective of this study was to characterize cellular and cytokine responses as indicators of cell-mediated immune response in FFE and associated feather pulp following immunization against Marek's disease. Analysis of feather tips collected between 4 and 28 days post-immunization (d.p.i.) from chickens vaccinated post-hatch with either CVI988/Rispens or herpesvirus of turkeys revealed that replication of these vaccine viruses started at 7 d.p.i., peaked by 21 d.p.i., and subsequently, showed a declining trend. This pattern of viral replication, which led to viral genome accumulation in feather tips, was associated with infiltration of T cell subsets particularly CD8+ T cells into the feather pulp area and the expression of cytokine genes such as interferon-Î³, which is an indication of elicitation of cell-mediated immune responses at the site of virus shedding.

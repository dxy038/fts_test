We study the benefit optimization-based resource scheduling algorithm in three-dimensional QoS model in this paper. It is the management of economy model and the user alternation system provide QoS. The objective is to maximize the system benefit. An iterative scheduling algorithm used to maximize the QoS needs of users and resource scheduler is proposed to optimal three-dimensional QoS based resource scheduling. The experiments show that optimal multiple QoS based resource scheduling results in less cost and more efficiency in resource allocation.

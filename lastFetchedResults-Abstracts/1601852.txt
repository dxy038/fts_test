The numerical simulation of nonlinear electro-elastostatics is considered in this work using the coupled boundary and finite element method. The objective of the work is to properly simulate the deformation of an electroelastic body undergoing large deformation subjected to electric stimulations in the case, where the surrounding space has significant influence on the electric field inside the body. Finite elements are used to model the nonlinear electroelastic body in which both mechanical nonlinearity and electrical nonlinearity are taken into account. Boundary elements are used to model the surrounding space and account for the large deformation of the boundary of the body.

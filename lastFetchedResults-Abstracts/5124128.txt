Software radio is not a new technology, but an evolution and convergence of existing digital radio and software technologies. The objective of this paper is to characterize the various implementation considerations with regard to software radio, including an R&amp;D perspective. The different implementation aspects include those on a system level such as network capabilities, handset/base station issues and power control, and critical component technologies like ADC, DSP and RF functionality. General issues affecting the progress of software radio such as commercialization and standardization are also included

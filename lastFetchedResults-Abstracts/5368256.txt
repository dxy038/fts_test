Intensive computation is a potential problem in nonlinear multi-objective control based on numerical simulation. The purpose of this paper is to extend analytical multiobjective parameter synthesis (AMOPS) to nonlinear field. Two proposal extension methods, namely, feedback linearization (FL) and state-dependent coefficient (SDC) approach are introduced and discussed in detail. Furthermore, in order to applied the extension, a new set of analytical cost functions and gradients suitable for nonlinear system is proposed, and the robustness of control system will also be addressed. Finally, a benchmark design problem is presented for demonstration.

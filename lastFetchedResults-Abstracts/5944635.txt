The purpose of this tutorial is to provide with basic knowledge of recent advances in intelligent optimization and control techniques, and how they are combined with knowledge elements in computational intelligence systems. Applications to power problems are stressed, and example applications are presented. The tutorial is composed of three parts: The first part gives an overview of particle swarm optimization and ant colony search algorithm. The second part deals with differential evolution and Pareto multi objective optimization. Finally, the third part covers neural dynamic programming and adaptive critic design technique

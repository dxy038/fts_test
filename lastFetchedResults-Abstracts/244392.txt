This paper describes the feasibility study on the application of passive and active stack systems to enhance natural ventilation in public housing in Singapore. About 86% of the population is staying in high-rise public housing, known as Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats, which is designed for natural ventilation. The primary objective of this work is to assess the status of natural ventilation in a typical four-room HDB flat using scaled model in the wind tunnel, and to develop an effective passive or active stack system to enhance natural ventilation in the flat. Four numbers of stacks with different sizes were tested at two locations in the flat. The study shows that the passive stack, incorporating the principle of airflow due to buoyancy, does not enhance air velocity in the flat. However, the active stack which operates based on the suction effect induced by a fan fixed at the top of the stack leads to substantial increase in the air velocity at the room and thus meeting the humanâ€™s thermal comfort condition. It was noted that the velocities increase along with the increase in the stack size.

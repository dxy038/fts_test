The analysis results on the operation of reactive power compensators in the Thainguyen power substation in Vietnam show their positive effect on the power system. They have a part in maintaining the voltage at the connection points (220/110/23 kV substation) that equals to the setting value U* according to the requirements of the Vietnamese power system dispath center. However, there are still some disadvantages of this substation that need to be overcome: the large number of main devices, much harmonics generated, and very high active power loss. Thus, the author has an idea to solve these problems by application of a bidirectional power converter (BDPC) using a decoupling controller in order to compensate the reactive power corresponding to the setting voltage. The benefit of this new solution is to eliminate the three above fundamental disadvantages. The research results have been verified by simulations in Matlab/Simulink software.

This research describes a Linux/Unix base middleware platform and GUI operating interface that has been created to help developer overcome the difficulties associated with existing software editing, upgrading, updating and integration. With growing in size and complexity of systems using in current organizations, the developing and maintaining existing or new systems can be really cost-and-time consuming. Even, the present new system might be a burden for the future new system development. We present methods for creating a route for data transmission between multiple platforms. Also, we use less than three API to connect with different application software and communication protocol. For example, TCP/IP communicates with X.25, TCP/IP communicates with SNA. The solution is benefit to an application designer to reduce the effort and time when editing or developing system. The major objective of this research is making breakthrough of providing technique for integrating different system while they consist of different OS, application software, protocol and programming language.

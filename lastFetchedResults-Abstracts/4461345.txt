Within the &#8220;model based&#8221; control strategies, several predictive control methods have been developed and proved to ensure good performances, even with severe specifications and complex systems. The efficiency of four polynomial predictive control techniques are compared on a benchmark expressing the behaviour of a motor drive connected to different loads through a flexible transmission. The objective is to obtain a robust control for all configurations. The results are analysed in frequency and temporal domains, and discussed in terms of stability, rapidity and precision

Finding computationally efficient spectrum optimization methods for a multiuser digital subscriber line (DSL) environment is a key objective of dynamic spectrum management for DSL systems. For synchronous discrete multitone (DMT) based DSL systems, the computational complexity issue can be partially addressed using a dual optimization approach that decomposes the problem in the frequency domain. However, the decomposition approach fails whenever the DMT system is asynchronous, in which case the power allocations in adjacent frequency tones interfere with each other. This paper provides a mathematical model for intercarrier interference due to symbol misalignment and proposes ways to modify the dual method for spectrum optimization of asynchronous DSL systems. The main ingredient of the algorithm is an efficient method to evaluate the minimum power required to support a given bit-allocation using a power series approximation, combined with a local gradient search.

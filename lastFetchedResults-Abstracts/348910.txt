Objective
To compare motor unit action potential (MUAP) metrics recorded by standard and pediatric size concentric EMG electrodes.
Methods
Commercial electrodes were used to record MUAPs from biceps brachii, first dorsal interosseous and tibialis anterior muscles in normal subjects and those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
Results
In normal subjects, peak amplitude and area were significantly higher when recorded by the pediatric size electrode in tibialis anterior muscles and peak amplitude recorded in first dorsal interosseous muscles. In ALS subjects, peak amplitude was higher recorded by the pediatric size electrode in tibialis muscle but lower when recorded in first dorsal interosseous muscles.
Conclusions
Differences of MUAP metrics when recording with standard and pediatric size electrodes do not seem to have a clinical relevance.
Significance
Pediatric and standard concentric electrodes record similar MUAP metrics

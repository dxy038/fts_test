ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cerebral ischemia is a common cause of mortality, which can be described as a focal brain defect secondary to trauma. This study aimed to determine the relationship between consumption of Cucurbita moschata seed oil and stroke volume, as well as the neurological disorders in a cerebrovascular model of rats.
METHODS: In this empirical study, 28 mature male Wistar rats weighing between 250 and 350 gr were divided into four groups. The control group was gavaged with distilled water, and the other three groups received 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 ml/kg Cucurbita moschata seed oil orally for 30 days. At the end of the thirty-day period, the animals underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion in order to induce stroke. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, lesion volume and neurological disorders were evaluated.
FINDINGS: It was found that 0.50 and 0.75 ml/kg doses of Cucurbita moschata seed oil reduced neurological disorders (p < 0.021 and p < 0.000, respectively). In addition, stroke volume decreased in the cortical area at doses 0.50 (55.02±7.6) and 0.75 (30.05±9.06) ml/kg, as compared to the control group (133.02±9.11; p < 0.000 and p < 0.000).
CONCLUSION: Consumption of Cucurbita moschata seed oil can reduce symptoms of ischemic stroke.

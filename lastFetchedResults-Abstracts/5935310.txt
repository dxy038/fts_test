Currently computer based systems are used by most of the universities around the world however, these systems are still paper based which involve physical paper existence. At present most of the universities are suffering obstacles in document management due to using paper based or semi automated systems. The objective of this paper is to present a paperless model for the university management system. A survey is conducted that enlisted some fundamental characteristics required to implement successful paperless environment. It was noted that simply converting paper-based activities to digital ones will not achieve a system without paper. Instead it is required to address complete model and its influencing factors at once. At the last we present a case study that reveals that tools and technologies are available for implementing paperless system but only there interweaving is required in a systematic manner.

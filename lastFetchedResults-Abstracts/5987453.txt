Water quality comprehensive evaluation of water supply network was present in this paper. It is on the basis of microcosmic model in water supply network. The water quality indicators, by which the states of water quality are expressed, are selected as the input vector for the comprehensive evaluation model. The self-organizing feature map (SOM) and k-means arithmetic are adopted in the model. Since there are some problems using single indicator grade evaluation method, thus a comprehensive water quality evaluation method is proposed in this paper. The objective water quality evaluation model of water supply network is developed. In comparison to the single-evaluation indicator, both the single water quality monitoring data and the overall data are all considered in the model using SOM, which reflect the water quality distribution in the water supply network objectively.

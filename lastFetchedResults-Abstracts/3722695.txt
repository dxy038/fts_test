A single conductor of arbitrary length is placed close to the surface of a conducting cylinder parallel to its axis. Impedances are connected between the ends of the cable and the cylinder. An incident monochromatic plane electromagnetic wave propagates in the longitudinal direction and is thus polarized in a transverse plane with respect to the axes of the external conductor and the cylinder. The component of the electric field tangent to the terminating impedance excites the circuit. The objective is to derive formulas for the currents in these impedances. The transverse dimensions of the conductor satisfy the inequalities a1 &#194;&#191; a2 &#194;&#191; &#194;&#191;, where a1 is the radius of the external conductor and a2 is the radius of the cylinder. It is assumed that the distance d between adjacent points on the conductor and the rocket is small compared with the wavelength.

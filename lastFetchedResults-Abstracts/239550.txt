In this work, a perceptron neural-network technique is applied to estimate hourly values of the diffuse solar-radiation at the surface in SÃ£o Paulo City, Brazil, using as input the global solar-radiation and other meteorological parameters measured from 1998 to 2001. The neural-network verification was performed using the hourly measurements of diffuse solar-radiation obtained during the year 2002. The neural network was developed based on both feature determination and pattern selection techniques. It was found that the inclusion of the atmospheric long-wave radiation as input improves the neural-network performance. On the other hand traditional meteorological parameters, like air temperature and atmospheric pressure, are not as important as long-wave radiation which acts as a surrogate for cloud-cover information on the regional scale. An objective evaluation has shown that the diffuse solar-radiation is better reproduced by neural network synthetic series than by a correlation model.

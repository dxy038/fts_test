Determining the factors affecting consumer choice of wood products is important
in deciding the competition level and judging the market status. Besides
determining and rating the consumption criteria using Analytical Hierarchy Process
in 2010 the study can be guide for both policymakers and inventors in this industry.
Consumption criteria for wood products were determined on the basis of opinions
of experts, consumers, sale agencies and academic experts, and then were
categorized in three classes of Economic, Technical and Consumption each of them
including eight sub-criteria. The data gathered from 144 citizens of Gorgan were
compared statistically with SPSS package after being rated as income quarters
using Analytical Hierarchy Process technique of Expert Choice software. The
results showed that, considering the economic criteria, as the consumers income
decreases, the product price becomes more important. Among the technical criteria,
product design and product durability are the most important for high-income
quarter and other quarters, respectively. The analysis of consumption criteria
revealed that convenience is the most important for the rich and decrease in
preference with reduction of income. For maid-income clan color and appearance
are important. Among the criteria, the economic ones are the most influenced in
purchasing wood products. While for the high-income clan, technical criteria are of
high importance and moving towards low-income clan reduces its importance and
makes the consumption criteria more important.

This paper deals with the economic dispatch problem in a microgrid to provide the optimal power reference of distributed generators. The objective function and the constraints related to the operation of the microgrid are formulated and the solution method for the problem is introduced. The constraints for this problem include i) additional reserve requirement due to the uncertainty in the output of renewable resources, ii) flow limit between the control areas, and iii) additional reserve for the stable operation during the islanded mode. In order to examine the effect of the constraints on the generation cost, some numerical experiments are conducted.

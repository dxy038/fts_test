In this paper, a no-reference objective sharpness metric based on a cumulative probability of blur detection is proposed. The metric is evaluated by taking into account the human visual system (HVS) response to blur distortions. The perceptual significance of the metric is validated through subjective experiments. It is shown that the proposed metric results in a very good correlation with subjective scores especially for images with varying foreground and background perceived blur qualities. This is accomplished with a significantly lower computational complexity as compared to existing methods that take into account the visual attention information.

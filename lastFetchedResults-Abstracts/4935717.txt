This research work investigates an automated and optimal procedure for the selection of the cost function weights in Finite States Model Predictive Control (FS-MPC). This is particularly useful where the cost function is composed by more variables and where other control parameters need to be carefully designed. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) multi-objective optimization approach is here proposed and tested on a case study represented by the FS-MPC of a Shunt Active Power Filter (SAF). The results of this weights optimization procedure are reported and discussed with the aid of Matlab-Simulink simulation tests.

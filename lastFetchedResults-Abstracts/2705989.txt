This contribution presents the design and the first experimental results of a set of software tools to carry out side-channel attacks against cryptographic devices, especially smartcards. To this aim, the main attacks of this class are commented, with special emphasis in power analysis attacks. The final objective is to make this set of tools available to the scientific community, so that it can be improved and enlarged according to particular needs.

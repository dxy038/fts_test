Channel Assignment in Wireless Mesh Networks has to ensure connectivity, and guarantee an acceptable throughput. This problem, being NP-hard, must be solved taking into account all the parameters that influence the output of the proposed algorithm. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-objective optimization model that, simultaneously, optimizes two conflicting objective functions in order to assign channel to radio interfaces subject to connectivity, interference and bandwidth requirements.

Because of field winding replacement with permanent magnet in brushed permanent magnet DC (PMDC) motors, field losses are eliminated and the structure of the motor is more simple. Efficiency of these motors is therefore increased and the manufacturing process is simplified. Hence, these motors are commonly used in low power applications and their design and optimization is an important consideration. Genetic algorithms are proposed for design optimization of PMDC motors because of their independence to objective function structure and its derivative. In this paper genetic algorithms are evaluated for PMDC motor design optimization. An introduction is first presented about PMDC motors, general design procedure and elements of their optimization. Genetic algorithms are then briefly described. Finally results of optimization by genetic algorithms are compared with the one obtained using a conventional method.

The paper deals with a multirate subband coder employing vector quantization to reduce the overhead due to side information. Two different quantizing schemes are considered to quantize subband signals: scalar and vector quantization. The proposed coders are tested for a bit-rate range of 8 to 16 Kbit/s. Results of objective measures and informal listening test reveal that both techniques offer good quality at the highest bit-rate while vector quantization perform better for the lowest one.

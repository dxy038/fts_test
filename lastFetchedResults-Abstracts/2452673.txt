The measurement of urban segregation patterns and trends  is often taken place by relying  on  the indices which show clearly the spatial patterning of the population  distribution in a city. In this paper, the new approach of measuring Spatial segregation between several groups has been presented. This approach allows the  researchers to measure the segregation at any scale. This research from the objective point of view is an applied one and its method is descriptive-analytical method, the data and information of this research has been collected by field surveying method and the selected samples were gathered by spatial random stratified method. In this paper, social segregation of Kamyaran city has been measured in the form of three variables of income, language and religion by using the introduced indices. The results of the indices by using P-Value test shows the high reliability level of segregation measuring at this study. Based on the results of the case study, by increasing the study scale, the value of segregation indices will decrease.  Intensity of segregation at the three indicator limits(the northeast, northwest and south part of the city) at each three  under study variables is more than the other points. Also dissimilarity value of religion variable is more than the other ones at local scale and the three variable of medium income, Soran group and Sunni  religious group have the highest degree of spatial segregation.

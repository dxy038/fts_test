In this paper, we propose a switching between hybrid Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) structures based on a distortion model per Group of Pictures (GOP) to improve the transmission of video streaming over wireless systems. The proposed algorithm uses measurements of the application and physical layers. In the application layer, a distortion model for GOP is used based on the packet loss rate and media data units. In the physical layer, the switching between hybrid MIMO structures is realized by simultaneously taking advantage of multiplexing and diversity gains provided by hybrid MIMO structure. The simulation results presented in this article show that the switching between hybrid MIMO structures based in the distortion model per GOPs is capable of improving the objective and subjective video quality at the end user.

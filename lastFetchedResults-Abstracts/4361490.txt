In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) with a new mutation operator is presented and applied to determined the equilibrium of power markets. Using a noncooperative Cournot Game model for the market, an equilibrium solution can be formulated as a single objective GA search problem. Accurate and reliable numerical solutions is obtained from the GA with the new mutation operator. The new mutation operator accelerates the GAÂ´s convergence without compromising its global search capability nor its ability to find multiple solutions. The new mutation operator functions by concentrating the population on the global optima found thereby allowing a depth search of the optima

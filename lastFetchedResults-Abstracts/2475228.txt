The main objective of this research is to study analytically and experimentally the liquid sheet breakup of a flat fan jet nozzle resulting from pressure-swirling. In this study the effects of nozzle shape and spray pressure on the liquid sheet characteristics were investigated for four nozzles with different exit widths (1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 mm). The length of liquid sheet breakup, liquid sheet velocity and the size of formed droplets were measured by a digital high speed camera. The breakup characteristics of plane liquid sheets in atmosphere are analytically investigated by means of linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic instability analyses. The liquid sheet breakup process was studied for initial sinuous and also varicose modes of disturbance. The results presented the effect of the nozzle width and the spray pressure on the breakup length and also on the size of the formed droplets. Comparing the experimental results with the theoretical ones for all the four types of nozzles, gives a good agreement with difference ranges from 4% to 12%. Also, the comparison between the obtained results and the results due to others shows a good agreement with difference ranged from 5% to 16%. Empirical correlations have been deduced describing the relation between the liquid sheet breakup characteristics and affecting parameters; liquid sheet Reynolds number, Weber number and the nozzle width.

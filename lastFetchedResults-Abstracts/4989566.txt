A human´s ability to perform physical tasks is limited by physical strength, not by intelligence. We define &#8220;extenders&#8221; as a class of robot manipulators worn by humans to augment human mechanical strength, while the wearer´s intellect remains the central control system for manipulating the extender. Some major areas of application for the extender include manufacturing, construction, loading and unloading aircraft, maneuvering cargo in shipyards, foundries, mining, or any situation which requires precise and complex movement of heavy objects. Our research objective is to determine the ground rules for the control and design of robotic systems worn by humans through the design, construction, and control of a prototype experimental hydraulic extender for manufacturing operation

Objective(s): Irinotecan is a potent anti-cancer drug from camptothecin group which inhibits topoisomerase I. Recently, biodegradable and biocompatible polymers such as poly lactide-co-glycolides (PLGA) have been considered for the preparation of nanoparticles (NPs). Materials and Methods: In this study, irinotecan loaded PLGA NPs were fabricated by an emulsification/solvent diffusion method to improve the efficacy of irinotecan. The effect of several parameters on the NPsâ€™ characteristics was assessed, including the amount of drug and polymer, the amount and volume of the poly vinyl alcohol as a surfactant, and also the internal-phase volume/composition. The irinotecan entrapment efficiency and the particle size distribution were optimized by changing these variables. The cytotoxicity of the particles was evaluated by cell viability assay.Results: NPs were spherical with a comparatively mono-dispersed size distribution and negative zeta potential. Selected formulation (S9) showed suitable size distribution about120 nm with relative high drug entrapment. MTT assay showed a stronger cytotoxicity of S9 against HT-29 cancer cells than control NPs and irinotecan free drug. The release kinetic indicated Log-Probability model in S9.Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that the designed NPs show suitable characteristic and also great potential for further in vivo cancer evaluation.

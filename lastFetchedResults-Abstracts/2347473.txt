The performance of crushing equipment in mineral processing circuits is often critical to the generation of final product. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm has been developed that allows the crusher internal geometry to be created and evaluated against multiple performance objectives. The multiple-objective approach is particularly important in mineral processing, as the optimum performance of single machines is often a trade-off between competing process drivers. A case study is presented that demonstrates the application of the technique to the design of cone crusher liners. New crusher liner profiles resulting from the application of the evolutionary algorithm suggest that significant improvements in the generation of lump product can be obtained. The extension of the approach to wider process plant design is discussed in terms of the objectives and issues to be addressed.

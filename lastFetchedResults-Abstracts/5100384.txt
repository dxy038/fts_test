This paper presents a methodology to reduce the power loss and improve the system performance by simultaneous applying the network reconfiguration and capacitor placement using a Fuzzy-Genetic Algorithm (FGA). The fuzzy multi-objective function comprises the overall annual cost of the network loss and that of shunt capacitors, total harmonic voltage distortion (THDV), voltage profile, and voltage unbalance factor at the network buses. An unbalanced 33-bus radial distribution system is studied in several cases to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

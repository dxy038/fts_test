In todayÂ´s semiconductor manufacturing, recipe is a very important portion of the machine system. With that in mind, there is a huge demand to enable recipe automation. Recipe automation here basically covers the download and upload of a process program. The download refers to downloading from the host to the machine, while the upload is referring to transfer of process program from the machine to the host. For a non-SECS/GEM machine (i.e., one that does not support communication to the host) this will be a challenge. The main objective of performing recipe automation is to ensure that the correct recipe is being used during the bonding process. With this, we can eliminate mis-processing that is due to loading the wrong recipe.

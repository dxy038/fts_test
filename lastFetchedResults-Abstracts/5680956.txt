Tourists deciding to explore a destination spontaneously and unprepared will have to walk and search on their own. This kind of investigation can be very uncomfortable as it often ends up in disarrangement. With today´s agent technology, tourists can have their own intelligent guide taking care of the whole tour organization and execution in time. This is the main objective of the dynamic tour guide (DTG) - a mobile agent that selects attractions, plans an individual tour, provides navigational guidance and offers location based interpretation. Over all it consistently adapts the tour to a tourist´s specific behavior in order to provide any possible support via a mobile device.

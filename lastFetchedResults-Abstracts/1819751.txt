Objective
neralization protein 1 (LMP-1), an intracellular signaling molecule, regulates osteoblast differentiation and maturation, as well as bone formation. However, the role of LMP-1 in the differentiation of human dental pulp cells and formation of dentin has not been determined. The study was to investigate the expression of LMP-1, the related proteins, such as bone morphogenetic proteins 2, 6 and 7 (BMP-2, BMP-6 and BMP-7), and core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfa1) during the differentiation of cultured human dental pulp cells and the formation of mineralized nodules.

entiation of human dental pulp cells was induced by dexamethasone, asorbic acid and Î²-glycerophosphate. The formation of mineralized nodules, was determined by Von Kossa staining and immunocytochemistry detection of dentin sialoprotein. Expression of LMP-1, the related proteins and the differentiation marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was analysed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
s
pression of LMP-1, BMP-2, BMP-6, BMP-7 and Cbfa1 was significantly increased in the process of dental pulp cells differentiation and the formation of mineralized nodules, while the pattern of the expression was distinct.
sions
evated level of LMP-1, BMPs and Cbfa1 expression indicated they might play a role in the differentiation of human dental pulp cells and the formation of mineralized nodules.

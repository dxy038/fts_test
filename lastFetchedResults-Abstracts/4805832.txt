This paper addresses the problem of maximizing the channel utilization in a wireless heterogeneous network with finite population. Slotted ALOHA is used as the multi-access protocol with packet capture in the presence of background noise and Rayleigh fading. To take account of unfairness caused by capture effect, throughputs of individual users are used as constraints in the problem with network throughput being the maximization objective. The problem is then studied under various conditions by controlling transmission power and/or probability. It is shown that for a narrow-band system under equal throughput requirement, transmission probability control is more effective than power control, and when a joint control strategy is employed, perfect or near perfect channel utilization can be achieved in the absence or presence of Rayleigh fading

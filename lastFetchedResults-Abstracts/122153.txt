Objective: Helicobacter Pylori has a precipitating role in the ethiopathogenesis of several benign or malignant gastrointestinal and extra- gastrointestinal diseases. The purpose of this study is determining the correlation between Helicobacter Pylori and SCC of larynx and hypo pharynx.
Method: Serum samples of 30 patients with documented laryngeal and hypo pharyngeal SCC were analyzed in search of lgG anti-H pylori using Elisa technique. Moreover, as an adjunct study we examined the presence of Helicobacter pylori in the laryngeal tumor mass using appropriate stain and specific culture medium. We did the serologic test in 30 properly matched controls who did not have carcinoma of larynx/hypo pharynx. Results:  Sixty-three percent of the patient group and 26% of the control group were seropositive, which supports the role of H Pylori in the genesis of laryngeal/hypo pharyngeal cancer (P<0.005, t-test). The organism was also isolated in one-third of tumoral tissues. Conclusion: Helicobacter Pylori infection can be a risk factor for laryngeal/hypo pharyngeal cancers in the same way as gastric cancer. This might be through a contributing effect with cigarettes and alcohol, or it may be an independent factor. More extensive studies in various communities are recommended.

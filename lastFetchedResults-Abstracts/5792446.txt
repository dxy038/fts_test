The diameter stenosis (%DS) in 226 coronary lesions of 200 patients undergoing primary (p) PTCA was assessed on-site by both visual &#8220;eye balling&#8221; (EB) and independent digital quantitative coronary angiography (DQCA). EB overestimated the %DS up to 49% and had a bimodal distribution with a nadir at 55%DS between the two peaks at ~50% and ~75%DS and a mean of 69.8&#177;19.9% whereas DQCA of the identical lesions revealed a near gaussian distribution with a mean of 58.5&#177;11.3%. EB revealed a %DS&#10878;60% in 166 stenoses (73.4%), an estimate that led to pPTCA. However, only 119 (52.6%) of these lesions had objectively a %DS&#10878;60% by DQCA. With regard to the indication for PTCA 47 of 166 performed pPTCA (28.3%) would not meet the indication criteria based on objective DQCA information. EB and DQCA (&#177;5%DS) led to a concordant indication for pPTCA only in 103 of 226 (60.8%) coronary lesions. The conclusion was reached that independent on-site DQCA supports decision-making and is likely to avoid the bias of &#8220;self-referral&#8221; and thus improve patient selection for pPTCA

In this paper an analysis and design of different structure of rail (guide-way) and electromagnetic levitation system (EMLS) has been performed utilizing ANSYS software. For the successful implementation of any EMLS the proper selection and design of actuator and guide-way is important. The design of actuator is primarily controlled by the input power to lift power ratio and lift power magnet weight ratio [5]. These factors are dependent on the magnet dimensions, required gap flux and hence the required current density in the winding. The magnet configurations chosen on the basis of required pole-face area and necessary window area to house the excitation coils. There are various magnet and rail geometries; i.e. magnet with I, U and E profiles and various winding arrangements with flat and U-profile rail. In this work a FEM based analysis has done to find out the flux pattern, working flux density, field intensity, force etc. for different single actuator based levitation system. The main objective is to propose a suitable configuration of actuator and guide-rail for a specific DC electromagnetic levitation system..

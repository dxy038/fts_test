Modified fumed silica, grafted by hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene
(HTPB) via toluene diisocyanate (TDI) bridging, was incorporated in
styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) as reinforcing filler. The main objective
of this work was to study the effect of the modification method on final properties
of the rubber compounds. As compared to unmodified nanosilica, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) represented nano dispersion of modified fumed silica particles
in SBR compound. The results of mechanical uniaxial tensile test revealed the
significant reinforcement property of HTPB-surface grafted nanosilica. This strong
effect is attributed not only to nanodispersion of silica particles but also due to
participation of HTPB double ligands in sulfur curing system of SBR and chemical
linkage between rubber matrix and silica particles. The study of dynamic mechanical
properties under temperature scan (linear viscoelasticity) displayed strong interaction
between the rubber matrix and modified silica particles and it again reaffirmed the
efficient reinforcement effect of this filler. Also, dynamic mechanical properties under
strain scan (non-linear viscoelasticity) exhibited filler network formation at low filler
content for this modified nanosilica. Surface modification of nanosilica by HTPB
grafting intensified the mechanical reinforcement of the filler; meanwhile, it reduced
the intensity of non-linear behavior by weakening the effect of filler network break
down (Payne effect) relative to that of unmodified silica. Therefore, this method
of silica surface modification could be a novel method in improvement of the final
properties of filled SBR by nanosilica.

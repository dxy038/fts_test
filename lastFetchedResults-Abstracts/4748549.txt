Database watermarking is an important branch of information hiding technology, and it is chiefly used to protect copyright. This paper creatively proposes a novel self-resilience digital watermarking technology which can repair itself. It is the first time to use the theory of error resilience combined with triple compression theory to improve the quality of extracted digital watermark. This paper chooses image which has more information as digital watermark source. In addition, this paper introduces certification authority. Besides to prevent from additive attack, the circuit generator code is also provided by certification authority to ensure the safety of watermark validation. Furthermore, this paper proposes an objective image contrast standard as evaluation basis for certification authority. Through the comparison of simulation experiment, the self-resilience technique performs a good invisibility, and could effectively resist all kinds of subset attacks.

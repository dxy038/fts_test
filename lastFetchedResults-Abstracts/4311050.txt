This paper proposes a novel method for diagnosis of dysathria using acoustic voice analysis. It is an effective and on-invasive method that could be used for confirmation of initial diagnosis and it would provide an objective determination of the vocal impairment. The acoustic parameters pitch and formants are extracted which gives differentiation of normal and pathological voices. Support Vector Machine is used to classify normal and disordered voice, the proposed algorithm offers least computational complexity with an accuracy of 80 to 90%.

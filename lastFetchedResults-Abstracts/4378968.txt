The mitigation of intercell interference is an importance issue for current and next-generation wireless cellular networks where frequencies are aggressively reused and hierarchical cellular structures may heavily overlap. The paper examines the benefit of coordinating transmission strategies and resource allocation schemes across multiple base-stations for interference mitigation. Two different wireless cellular architectures are studied: a multicell network where base-stations coordinate in their transmission strategies, and a mixed macrocell and femtocell/picocell deployment with coordination among macro and femto/pico base-stations. For both scenarios, this paper proposes a heuristic joint proportionally fair scheduling, spatial multiplexing, and power spectrum adaptation algorithm that coordinates multiple base-stations with an objective of optimizing the overall network utility. The proposed scheme optimizes the user schedule, transmit and receive beamforming vectors, and transmit power spectra jointly, while taking into consideration both the intercell and intracell interference and the fairness among the users. System-level simulation results show that coordination at the transmission strategy and resource allocation level can already significantly improve the overall network throughput as compared to a conventional network design with fixed transmit power and per-cell zero-forcing beamforming.

Objective: Animal model studies have shown that MSY2 and JHDM2A genes have an
important role in spermatogenesis process and fertility of male mice. But the potential
role of these genes in human spermatogenesis and fertility is not known yet. Therefore,
we evaluated expression ratios of these genes in testis tissues of men with normal and
impaired spermatogenesis.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, after RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
from 50 non-obstructive azoospermic and 12 normal testis tissues, the expression
ratios of genes were evaluated by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique.
Hematoxcylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used for histological classification of testis tissues.
For statistical analysis, one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was carried out.
Results: Our results showed a significant reduction in mRNA level of YBX2 in samples
with impaired spermatogenesis (p < 0.001) compared to samples with qualitatively normal
spermatogenesis and normal spermatogenesis; however, in JHDM2A gene, despite
sensible reduction in gene expression level in men with impaired spermatogenesis, no
significant differences were shown (p > 0.05). Furthermore in YBX2, a significant negative
correlation was demonstrated between the efficiency score of spermatogenesis and the
threshold cycle (CT) (r=-0.7, p < 0.0001), whereas in JHDM2A, this negative correlation
was not significant (r=-0.4, p=0.06).
Conclusion: Generally, these data indicated that YBX2 and JHDM2A genes may play
an important role in male infertility, and suggested that these molecules can act as
useful biomarkers for predicting male infertility.

A land mobile satellite systems propagation experiment has been performed in Europe, within ESAÂ´s PROSAT phase II program. Its objective was to analyze the propagation factors required to design the LMSS planned for Europe. The measurements were made in Spain, France and Sweden using a van and the MARECS satellite. After studying the behavior of the signal received in various environments, the cumulative distributions obtained are being fitted to some statistical models. The results are shown in this paper. Phase characteristics both in time and frequency domains are presented, including implications for system and receiver design.

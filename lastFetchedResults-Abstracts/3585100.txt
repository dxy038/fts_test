The possibility of making a `bidirectional&#194;&#191; thin-film ferrite lumped-element circulator (l.e.c.) has been deduced after a detailed analysis of the scattering-matrix eigenvaluesÂ´ frequency dependence has been made. The bidirectional effect is obtained for two different frequencies that are not simply related.

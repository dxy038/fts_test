The precedence of divine knowledge to the objective being of possibilities is among the issues agreed upon by all divine ontologists. However, the differences in their intellectual principles and interpretations of scientific and objective beings have led to their different analysis of the way of this precedence. In Aristotelian approach, the causal chain of beings, which finally culminate in God the Almighty, constitutes the objective beings. The Praiseworthy God, who is the root-cause of this causal system, through His knowledge is knower of all possibilities. This knowledge is acquisitive, which is general and simple and is among the requirements of His Sublime Being and regarding the causal precedence is prior to all possible effects. On the basis of transcendental philosophy in which being is the only original objective issue, the objective being includes a chain of possible beings which finally leads to the Almighty as the only essentially independent objective being. But the knowledge of the Truth which causes the issuance of the possibilities is not in the form of conceptual forms but is the knowledge of Truth of its simple essence, which, regarding all existential perfections, while being simple is the very comprehensive discovery. But in mystical viewpoint, the true and objective being is confined to the quiddity of the Almighty and all possibilities are a manifestation of His statuses. The present paper is an attempt to study the precedence of scientific being to objective being in Aristotelian philosophy and transcendental philosophy and mystical principles.

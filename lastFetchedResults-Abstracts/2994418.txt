The area of electric power quality has witnessed increased attention, especially in the area of modeling and analysis of power quality measurements. This paper concentrates on the harmonic decomposition of capacitor-switching transient disturbances with a main objective on introducing a new technique in the area of power system analysis, an ESPRIT-based method. Initial sensitivity tests indicate promising results in providing a new and improved tool in the harmonic decomposition of capacitor-switching transients. The sensitivity tests focus on corrupting the data sequences with zero-mean white Gaussian noise at different voltage deviation levels, and analyzing the performance of the decomposition method. The transient disturbances used in the analysis are real data, created in the Center for Electric Power Engineering, Drexel University

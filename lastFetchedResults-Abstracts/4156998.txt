Given an existing manufacturing technology, the influence of the design parameters has been evaluated in order to improve the robustness of the 3-D capacitors. The objective is to select the capacitor patterns that provide a satisfying density with the required robustness with respect to the reliability indicators. The geometrical and manufacturing-related issues are both considered. The main manufacturing issues are the etching, deposition, and warpage of the wafer. The improvements have been observed experimentally for the robustness of the 3-D structures and the density of the capacitor which are increased for several proposed 3-D patterns. All capacitors tested in this paper are realized with PICS technology.

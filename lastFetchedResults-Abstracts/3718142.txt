This paper presents a model for use in the problem of multistage planning of energy distribution systems including distributed generation. The expansion model allows alternatives to be considered for increasing the capacity of existing substations, for installing new ones, for using distributed generation, and for the possible change to feeders in terms of addition and removing feeders sections; combining, subdividing, and load transfer between feeders; and replacement of conductors. The objective function to be minimized is the present value of total installation costs (feeders and substations), of operating and maintaining the network, and of distributed generation. The model takes operational constraints on equipment capacities and voltage limits together into account with logical constraints, aimed at reducing the search space. This paper presents: (1) an extension to the linear disjunctive formulation to represent the inclusion, exclusion, and replacement of branches and (2) a generalization of constraints related to the creation of new paths which can be applied in more complex topologies. The resulting mixed integer linear model allows the optimal solution to be found using mathematical programming methods, such as the branch-and-bound algorithm. The validity and efficiency of the model are demonstrated in Part II of this paper.

Design space exploration is referred to a search on possible architecture configurations of a system, to find the feasible and optimum solution for the desired application based on the defined objectives. The objective could be optimization of performance, power or area of the system. There are various numbers of algorithmic approaches for exploration. This paper presents a novel method for design space exploration on VLIW processors. Our proposed approach is mainly based on space pruning methodology using binary search tree. This method will be experimented on a specific VLIW embedded system. The focus of the exploration is on optimizing performance or area of the base architecture through finding the optimum number of resources and cache sizes. Experimental results proves that our algorithm gets to the optimum solution comparing with the solution resulted by exhaustive approach, and also outperforms this approach through a logarithmic order against a polynomial one.

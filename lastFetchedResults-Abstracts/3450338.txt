This Special Issue of IEE Proceedings - Circuits, Devices, Devices and Systems contains a number of selected articles of interest on amorphous and microcrystalline semiconductors. The papers that appear in this issue have been selected from a number abstracts submitted to the ´call for papers´ announcement that was advertised through the TEE. The objective of the Special Issue was to put together a wide range of papers that reflect some of the current research topics in this growing field. In addition, we also intended to provide a collection of papers that would be appealing to graduate students to pursue as research topics in this field. Priority was given to experimental papers in as much as the whole field of amorphous semiconductors essentially grew from an experimental base; today the experimental work in this field is as interesting and challenging as it was some thirty years ago when researchers started taking a keen interest in amorphous semiconductors

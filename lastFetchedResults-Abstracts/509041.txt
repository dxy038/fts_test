Background and Objective: Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common diseases in general population. Its prevalence is 5-8 percent in Iran. The disease has symptoms such as neuropathy. The prevalence of neuropathy is equivalent to 7 percent at onset of the disease, but as the underlying disease advances the prevalence of neuropathy can reach to as much as 50 percent. In some patients with neuropathy, the neuropathic pain can affect their daily functioning and quality of life.
Subjects and Methods: The subjects of this clinical trial were 60 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who referred to diabetes clinic of Ahvaz Golestan hospital. After proving painful neuropathy, and according to their history, physical examination and EMG-NCV, and considering their inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study, they were randomly divided into two equal groups. The study was accomplished in a double blind method. One group was treated with amitriptyline (50 mg / d) and the other group was treated with carbamazepine (200mg TID). Based on brief pain inventory quantitative scale amount of pain was scored before and six weeks after the beginning of study. 
Results: Both drugs were found effective, but no significant difference in pain relief was noted. Hb A1C in patients who received carbamazepine was found lower in comparison with other group. 
Conclusion: If the glucose declining effect of carbamazepine would be proved in the future, it can be administered as an adjunct therapy.

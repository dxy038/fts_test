The main objective of this work is to illustrate the development of a new class of intelligent adaptive control system based on a system-centric approach for the control of generators under transient operating conditions. The benefit of such a structure is its ability to control time varying power system operations including complex and multimodal dynamics and scheduled/unscheduled dasiajumpspsila. The underlying structural feature is the introduction of intelligent supervisory loops (ISL) to augment a conventional adaptive controller. The proposed fuzzy model reference adaptive controller uses a fuzzy reference model generator (FRMG) in parallel with the model reference adaptive controller (MRAC). The main advantage of this algorithm is that it is precise, feasible and more effective than other nonlinear adaptive controllers reported to-date. Simulation results are presented in order to show that, the oscillatory and transient response of a generator in a single machine infinite bus (SMIB) has substantially improved while using the proposed control scheme.

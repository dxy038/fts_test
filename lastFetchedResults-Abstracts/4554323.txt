Estimating high-resolution (HR) video from a sequence of low-resolution (LR) compressed observations is the focus of this paper. Based on the theory of regularization, this paper proposes a new form of regularized cost function to control the within-channel balance between received data and prior information, and a channel weight coefficient to control the cross-channel fidelity. The LR frames are adaptively weighted according to their reliability and the regularization parameter is simultaneously estimated for each channel with ameliorating artifacts in compressed video. An iterative gradient descent algorithm is utilized to reconstruction the HR video. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has an improvement in terms of both objective and subjective quality

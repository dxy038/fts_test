The objective of this article is to study the effect of various components of earthquake
on sloshing response of liquid storage tanks. First, commonly used theory for
unidirectional analysis of liquid behavior in cylindrical tanks was reviewed.
Second, the Finite Element Modeling (FEM) strategy which was used to simulate
dynamic response of the liquid tank system was described. The FEM was validated
using a set of experimental measurements reported by previous researchers. Third,
a parametric study for some vertical, cylindrical tanks with different aspect ratios
excited by various time series of earthquake accelerations was performed. Each
tank was subjected to unidirectional and bidirectional excitations of earthquake
accelerations. Fourth, provision suggested by some seismic codes for the estimation
of Maximum Sloshing Wave Height (MSWH) were reviewed and the accuracy of the
codes prediction was numerically investigated. Finally, the available simplified
formulation for evaluating MSWH under unidirectional excitation was extended
for bidirectional excitation.

Objective
Despite the recommendations of numerous clinical practice guidelines, testing of at-risk women for Chlamydia trachomatis infection remains low. We evaluated an intervention to increase guideline-recommended chlamydia screening.
Method

In a two-by-two factorial design randomized trial conducted in 2001–2002, 23 primary care clinics at Group Health Cooperative in Washington State were randomized to either control (standard) or intervention (enhanced) guideline implementation arms. Clinic-level intervention strategies included use of clinic-based opinion leaders, individual measurement and feedback, and exam room reminders. A second patient-level intervention, a chart prompt to screen for chlamydia, was delivered in a random sample of 3509 women. The outcome measure was post-intervention chlamydia testing rates among sexually active women ages 14–25.
Results

The clinic-level intervention did not significantly affect overall chlamydia testing (odds ratio (OR) = 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92–1.26, P = 0.31). However, testing rates increased significantly among women making preventive care visits (OR, Pap test visit = 1.23, 95% CI, 1.01–1.51, P = 0.04; OR, physical exam visit = 1.22, 95% CI 1.06–1.42, P = 0.009, intervention vs. control clinics). The chart prompt intervention had no significant effect (OR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.94–1.23, P = 0.27).
Conclusions

Interventions to improve guideline-recommended chlamydia testing increased testing among women making preventive care visits. Additional organizational change and/or patient activation strategies may improve plan-wide testing, particularly among asymptomatic women.

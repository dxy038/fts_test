European preparations for World Radiocommunication Conferences are coordinated within the European regional posts and telecommunications organization known as the CEPT. The basic objective of the European proposals is to achieve an even playing field for the introduction of competitive mobile satellite services that can provide global services from the earliest feasible common date. Europe believes the additional allocations made at the 1992 conference are sufficient for the foreseeable future, especially now that there is an opportunity every two years to make additional allocations should the need be proven. What must be agreed upon, however, are the allocations for the feeder links to the mobile satellite service to complement the 1992 allocations for service links. Europe also need to consider the technical constraints that were placed on the use of these service links at the 1992 conference. Of particular concern to Europe, is the most unsatisfactory conclusion in 1992 on the date of availability of the 2 GHz mobile satellite service allocations. The article describes the European proposals on these mobile satellite issues

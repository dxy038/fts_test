Background
The objective of this paper was to study the patient characteristics and contemporary short- and long-term outcome in patients with postinfarct ventricular septal rupture.
Methods

Based on patient files and register data we performed a review of 64 consecutive patients with ventricular septal rupture complicating acute myocardial infarction, admitted to our tertiary center.
Results

The mean age of the patients was 70 Â± 7. The median time was five days from onset of symptoms to the diagnosis of the ventricular septal rupture. The overall 30-day, one-, and five- year mortalities were 62%, 72%, and 95%, respectively. Medical treated patients (n = 19) had a 30-day mortality of 100%. Among surgically treated patients (n = 45) the survival at one month, one and five years was 71%, 48%, and 32%, respectively. History of hypertension, complicating congestive heart failure, and age were associated with poor outcome.
Conclusions

Despite improvements in medical and interventional techniques the early as well as the long-term prognosis remains poor in this contemporary series.

Research in the field of tissue engineering is rapidly producing new types of cultured tissues, which may aid in repairing or replacing damaged soft tissues. It is critical to assess the mechanical properties of these engineered tissues to determine if the properties approach those of native tissues. Planar biaxial testing is an appropriate characterization method because thin, soft tissues are generally accepted to be incompressible. The objective of this project is to design and build a low cost, electromechanical testing system for planar biaxial stretching of soft connective tissues. The planar biaxial device designed in this paper has a four -axis control system as well as the four components of: a temperature-controlled testing chamber, a low friction sample attachment system, a stretching/force system, and a deformation analysis system. The deviceÂ´s design is unique and innovative due to its low force capability (&lt;0.5N), low cost (&lt;$15,000), sterilizable materials, and real time computer control.

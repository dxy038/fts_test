This work presents a numerical investigation of crack-tip constraint for SE(T) specimens and axially surface cracked pipes using plane-strain, nonlinear computations. The primary objective is to gain some understanding of the potential applicability of constraint designed fracture specimens in defect assessments of pressurized pipelines and cylindrical vessels. The present study builds upon the J–Q approach using plane-strain solutions to characterize effects of constraint on cleavage fracture behavior for the analyzed fracture specimens and cracked pipes. Under increased loading, each cracked configuration follows a characteristic J–Q trajectory which enables comparison of the corresponding driving force curve in the present context. A key outcome of this investigation is that toughness data measured using SE(T) specimens appear more applicable for cleavage fracture predictions of pressurized pipelines and cylindrical vessels than standard, deep notch fracture specimens under bend loading. The results provide a strong support for use of constraint-designed SE(T) specimens in fracture assessments of pressurized pipes and cylindrical vessels.

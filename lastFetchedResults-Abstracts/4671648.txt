Energy efficient modulation techniques are of paramount importance for wireless sensor communication where energy efficiency directly affects the lifetime of the networks. Transceivers with low energy consumption are indispensable components for wireless sensor networks. The main objective of this paper is to simulate AQ-DBPSK modulation scheme and analyze its performance for wireless sensor communication in indoor environments under Additive White Gaussian Noise channel and Raleigh fading conditions. Also a direct conversion transmitter architecture using AQ-DBPSK modulation at 2.4GHz is simulated.

This paper formulates fuzzy multirow machine layout problem where the clearance between any two adjacent machines is given as a fuzzy set. The membership function of the fuzzy clearance corresponds to the grade of satisfaction of separate distance. The objective function considered here is to maximize the minimum grade of satisfaction over machines and meanwhile to minimize the total travel cost among machines. Genetic algorithms are investigated as a heuristic technique for solving the problem. The performance of proposed algorithm is demonstrated by computer simulations.

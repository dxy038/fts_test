This paper investigates the sliding mode control of three-phase voltage source PWM rectifier (VSR). When the three-phase VSR system is applied in different environmental conditions, external disturbances are inevitable and stochastic, so these conditions should be taken into consideration when designing the controllers. To have a good performance and a fast response, the whole closed loop control is designed in two parts: outer voltage loop control and inner current loop control, to achieve the aim of well controlled output dc-bus voltage, sinusoidal input currents at AC mains, controlled power factor and bidirectional power flow, etc. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method and it is in good agreement with the desired control performance. Therefore, the proposed sliding mode control in this paper presents new insights concerning the control of three-phase VSR in the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances and hence has a wide range of applications with good robustness.

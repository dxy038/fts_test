Home networking is called as digital home network. It means that PC, home entertainment equipment, home appliances, home wirings, security, illumination system were communicated with each other by some composing network technology, constitute a networking internal home, and connect with WAN by home gateway. It is a new network technology and application technology, and can provide many kinds of services inside home or between homes. Currently, home networking can be divided into three kinds: information equipment, home appliances, communication equipment. Equipment inside home networking can exchange information with outer networking by home gateway, this information communication is bidirectional, user can get information and service which provided by public networking by using home networking internal equipment through home gateway connecting public network, meantime, also can get information and resource to control the internal equipment which provided by home networking internal equipment .Based on the general network model of home networking, there are four functional entities inside home networking: HA, HB, HC, and HD. (1) HA (home access) - home networking connects function entity; (2) HB (home bridge) - home networking bridge connects function entity; (3) HC (home client) - home networking client function entity; (4) HD (home device) - decoder function entity. There are many physical ways to implement four function entities. Based on theses four functional entities, there are reference model of physical layer, reference model of link layer, reference model of IP layer and application reference model of high layer. In the future home network should have broadband network function, public network function, and compositive multi-service and multi-application function, etc.

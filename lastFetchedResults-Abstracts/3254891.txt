To eliminate mismatches between the intentions of questioners and respondents of Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) sites, we have clarified the characteristics of the question and answer statements. It has been shown that the impression of the statements could be captured by nine factors, and the factor scores could be estimated from the feature values of the statements. Here, the objective scores of answer statements are provided. This paper tries to estimate the objective scores of answer statements through multiple regression analysis. They are estimated from the factor scores estimated by using multiple regression formulas already obtained. Absolute values of the differences between the factor scores of answer statements and those of question ones, those of the answer statements having the highest scores, and those of the ones having the lowest ones, are used as the explanatory variables. It is shown that objective scores of the objective statements could be estimated fairly good, and that those of subjective statements could be estimated well by taking the natural logarithm of the factor scores.

A computational system is presented to assist decision makers in the task of planning electrical distribution power systems. Three basic models are devised: a single-objective optimization model, with technical and economic considerations; a multiobjective model, which allows the consideration of such aspects as reliability and environmental impact; and a fuzzy mathematical programming model, considering fuzzy objectives and constraints. Some other solution methods are briefly presented and compared. The computational system implemented is detailed and illustrated through a case study.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

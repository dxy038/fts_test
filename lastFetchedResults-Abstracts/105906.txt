A circuit topology is proposed for single-phase online UPS systems. The proposed circuit incorporates a built-in bidirectional AC/DC converter, which provides power factor correction and active power filtering. The input stage, based on a bidirectional AC/DC converter, functions as a rectifier with unity power factor correction for normal AC line mode operation, and as an active power filter for outage mode operation. During input power failure, the bidirectional AC/DC converter functions as an active power filter, providing reactive power to the load. Simultaneously, the DC/AC voltage inverter output stage supplies real power from the battery bank to the critical load. The real power capability is improved compared with that of a conventional online UPS system, and extra loads can be connected to the UPS system during outage. The power circuit of the proposed UPS system is presented and analysed. Circuit models are derived and a UPS digital control system using a digital signal processor (DSP) is developed. Finally, simulated and experimental results obtained from a laboratory prototype are presented to confirm the feasibility and features of the proposed UPS scheme.

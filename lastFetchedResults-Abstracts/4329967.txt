This paper presents a new method with considering the probabilistic characteristics of harmonic current sources for single-tuned harmonic filter planning in the power system. The filter planning problem is formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem. The objective is to minimize the voltage distortion throughout the system while determining the optimal filter locations and sizes. The usefulness of the proposed approach is test by an actual distribution system. Results show that the proposed method is robust and computationally efficient.

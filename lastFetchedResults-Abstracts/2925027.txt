Having developed preliminary design concepts and investigated potential applications, EPRI is ready to launch a high temperature superconducting transmission cable R&amp;D program which will lead to economically viable transmission cables of medium voltage for medium distances. The power capacity of the new cable designs is expected to range from 500 to 1000 MVA at 115 kV or 230 kV. Such designs enhance the prospects of matching, one-on-one, an underground transmission circuit to that of an overhead transmission line. This paper describes the design concepts in EPRIÂ´s program that would fulfill this objective and discusses potential applications for this new technology

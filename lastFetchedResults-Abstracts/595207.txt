Objective: To assess the frequency, causative agents, current treatment options, post-operative complications and final visual outcome of trauma related cataract.Material and Methods: The study was conducted at Khyber Institute of Ophthalmic Medical Sciences, Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar, from November 1999 to November 2001. Detailed history with special reference to age, sex, mode of injury, causes and circumstances of trauma were recorded. Indications for surgery were traumatic cataract with or without open globe injury. All patients had B scans (ultrasonography) to evaluate the posterior segment. All patients were operated under general anaesthesia. The patients were followed up for six months.Results: Out of 77 patients with traumatic cataract (69 males and 8 females), about half of the patients were between 5-15 years of age Commonest trauma was sport related in 32 (41.5%} cases. Commonest etiological agent for blunt trauma was stone in 15 (19.48%) cases and for penetrating trauma vms thorn in 9 (11.7%) cases. In 71 patients (92.20%) presenting visual acuity was less than 6/60. Fifty three patients (68.83%) had final visual acuity of 6/6-6/12 while only 03 patients (03.89%) had a fined visual acuity of <3/60.Conclusion: Traumatic cataract is common cause of visual loss after trauma. Males are affected more than females. Nearly half of patients affected are children under the age of 16. Taking necessary precautions for sports and work can prevent nearly 54%> of cataracts. Most common causative agents are stone and wooden sticks.

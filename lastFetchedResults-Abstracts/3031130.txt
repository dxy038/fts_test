This paper proposes a new framework for local mobility routing to improve intra-domain handoff performance, even when link layer trigger is not available. To support such a framework, we introduce a new mechanism to set up a bidirectional tunnel between access routers to enable mobile nodes to send and receive packets during handover. The mechanism adopts implicit signaling for tunnel establishment, instead of explicit signaling between access routers. Also multi-exit tunnel is established upon access router detecting mobile node´s disappearance without anticipation. Moreover, the proposed routing algorithm allows access routers to forward packets based on mobile nodes´ home address. Performance analysis shows that the proposed framework achieves better performance improvement even in unanticipated handover, and provides better support for three-party handover.

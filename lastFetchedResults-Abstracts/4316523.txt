MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) including also MOEMS (micro-opto-electro-mechanical systems) represent a progressive area of electrical/mechanical engineering. To supply this field with well-educated engineers, it is necessary to teach them basic sciences, technology, applications, and design aspects (reliability, packaging, etc.) belonging to the topic of M(O)EMS. Conventional teaching methods, based on lectures, static written materials, laboratories, etc., has become rather difficult at all levels of education. The main objective of the described project is the development of a multimedia supported education material that teaches the theoretical background, application of microelectronics, and packaging technologies in designing micro-electromechanical systems for the next generation of intelligent systems. The new approach tries to exploit all advantages of multimedia computer aided teaching not only for keeping the competitiveness but also in order to overcome the specific difficulties of the particular area. The modern educational software tool can secure up to date information, easy-to-understand visualisation of the 3D MEMS structures and interactive examples of the subject. The course material will be available on the Internet and on CDs for the technical community, for other university professors for teaching, and also will continuously be developed. The paper highlights the structure of the course material and demonstrates animated examples.

The objective of this paper is to present a new technique for generating small-signal transfer functions of switching converters. The technique requires generation of the input-output data from a switching converter using any simulation software packages, such as Pspice, and applies a simple algorithm on the recorded data to identify an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model for the switching converter. A small-signal transfer function can be obtained from the ARMA model thereby

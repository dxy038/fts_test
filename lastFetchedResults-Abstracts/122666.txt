Over 70 million women use oral contraceptives . Previous studies have reported hypertension and breakthrough bleeding as complications of oral contraceptive (OC LD). Some investigaters believe that triphasic formulations are associated with minimal effects on metabolic parameters _ This study is meant to present an objective comparison of the two . This rondomized clinical trial was prospectively conducted involving 482 women(5-49 years old). They were purposely selected through cluster sampling and divided into two groups and studied for 12 months _ The first group was given OC LD and the second group triphasic . The obtained data were put into statistical analysis . No significant difference was observed between the two groups in unintended preynancy , spotting , hypertension and gastrointestinal complications ; however , a significant difference existed in acne (p<0.02) , weignt gain (P<0.008) and mood complications (p<O.000) between the two groups . Finally , it was concluded that the ratio of satisfaction among the triphasic group was greater than those who used monophasic LD ; also , triphasic formulation had minimal complications.

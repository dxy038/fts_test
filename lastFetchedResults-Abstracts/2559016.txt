Abstract

Objective

The aim of our study was to find the relationship of MPV (Mean Platelet Volume) levels and platelet counts as markers of inflammation between simple and complex febrile seizures.

Materials & Methods

In this retrospective comparative study, we investigated the recordings of 356 children between 5 months and 6 yr with diagnosis of simple and complex febrile seizure (SFS&CFS) in Amircola’s Children’s Hospital, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran between Mar 2011 and Dec 2015.

Results

Mean age was similar in two groups. The MPV of the CFS group (8.32±0.48fl) was lower than that of the SFS group (8.58±0.34fl) but this difference was not significant statistically. The platelet count of the CFS group (315.03×103 ±117.17×103) was higher than that of SFS group (291.82×103 ± 87.49×103) but there was no significant statistical difference.

Conclusion

We did not find significant differences between two groups. Therefore, further studies about this idea should be performed.

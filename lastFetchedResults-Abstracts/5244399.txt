In this paper new sufficient conditions for the existence of strongly stabilizing controllers and stable H-infinity controllers are derived in a unified manner. These conditions are recast as the solvability conditions of positive real controller synthesis problem and multi-objective control problem, respectively, which can be solved efficiently via existing linear matrix inequality (LMI) programs. In addition, characterizations of such controllers for both of the problems are given based on the solutions obtained.

Introduction: Today, the numerous uses of insulation, such as rockwool, glass wool, slog wool and so on, have increased to control and save energy in industries. Due to numerous applications, exposure level is increased in production, handling, installation and removal. Occupational exposure to fibers has been associated with irritation of skin and respiratory tract. The objective of this study was to determine occupational exposure to rock wool
fibers.
Material & Methods: The standard method for the determination of airborne
fibrous particles in the workplace is NIOSH Method 7400 by Phase Contrast
Microscopy. In NIOSH Method 7400, samples are collected on 25-mm
cellulose ester filters. The filter is treated to make it transparent and then is
analyzed by microscopy at 400-450x magnification, with phase-contrast
illumination, using a Walton-Beckett graticule. Using counting rules B, only
fibers <3 pm in diameter and >5 pm in length with aspect ratios of 5:1 are
counted. Pulmonary function test is carried out by P.F.T spirometer to obtain

Ultraperspective is the capability of human beings to step into the shoes of another person. Endophysics is the science of those physical propertis of the world which exist not from the outside but only from the inside. Both have in common the adoption of an ‘exterior’ position. In the one case, the exteriority is ‘horizontal’, in the other, ‘vertical’. Ultraperspective is a macroscopic concept, endophysics a microscopic one. Both can be implemented in computer models. Novel experiments can be set up in either domain: animals acquiring the status of human persons, and objective features of the physical world acquiring the status of an observer-specific mirage. Mead and Levinas, and Einstein and Bohr, are the protagonists. In the age of computer-assisted enlightenment, a new look at the ethical roots of science appears justified.

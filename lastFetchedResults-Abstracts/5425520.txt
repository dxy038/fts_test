We present an optimal adaptive controller that is used to regulate the chemical process of wood ash stabilization (WAS). The model parameters of the time-varying process dynamics are estimated using recursive least squares (RLS). At each batch an auto-tuning sequence produced with the controller disabled is carried through in order to obtain a good estimate of the process dynamics. After the auto-tuning sequence is completed, a generalized predictive controller is enabled to control the WAS process. The control objective is to regulate the normalized effective power P<sub>e</sub>(t) to the level P<sub>e</sub> <sup>crit</sup> that represents the critical rate of useful work being performed by the three-phase asynchronous machine used for the stirrer drive. Hence, P<sub>e</sub><sup>crit</sup> also represents the desired mixture viscosity. If more water is added to the stabilization process after P<sub>e</sub><sup>crit</sup> has been reached, one will obtain a mixture useless for granular material. To cope with this problem, change detection is used to reach the desired level P<sub>e</sub><sup>crit</sup> without any pre-determined set-point. Two methods are evaluated; a probing strategy and the geometric moving average test, both adequate for successful implementation. The used control strategies are presented and off-line simulations with a model of the physical process evaluate the control performance

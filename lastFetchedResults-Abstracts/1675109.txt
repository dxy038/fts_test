A commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) ion trap mobility spectrometry (ITMS) based explosive trace detector (ETD) has been interfaced to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS/MS) for the purpose of characterizing the gas phase ion chemistry intrinsic to the ITMS instrument. The overall objective of the research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the gas phase ionization processes in the ITMS based ETD to facilitate the advancement of its operational effectiveness as well as guide the development of next generation ETDs. Product ion masses, daughter ion masses, and reduced mobility values measured by the ITMS/MS/MS configuration for a suite of nitro, nitrate, and peroxide containing explosives are reported. Molecular formulas, molecular structures, and ionization pathways for the various product ions are inferred using the mass and mobility data in conjunction with density functional theory. The predominant product ions are identified as follows: [TNT-H]− for trinitrotoluene (TNT), [RDX+Cl]− for cyclo-1,3,5-trimethylene-2,4,6-trinitramine (RDX), [NO3]− for ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), [NG+NO3]− for nitroglycerine (NG), [PETN+NO3]− for pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), [HNO3+NO3]− for ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), [HMTD−NC3H6O3+H+Cl]− for hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), and [(CH3)2CNH2]+ for triacetone triperoxide (TATP). The predominant ionization pathways for the formation of the various product ions are determined to include proton abstraction, ion-molecule attachment, autoionization, first-order and multi-order thermolysis, and nucleophilic substitution. The ion trapping scheme in the reaction region of the ITMS instrument is shown to increase predominant ion intensities relative to the secondary ion intensities when compared to non-ion trap operation.

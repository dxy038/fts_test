Objective
Febrile seizure is one of the most common neurological conditions of 
childhood. Several theories, such as iron deficiency anemia have been 
proposed as the pathogenesis of this condition. The aim of this study was to 
find the association between iron deficiency anemia and febrile seizures in 
children aged 6 months to 3 years admitted in Valie Asr hospital in Zanjan.
Materials &Methods
Hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), serum iron (SI), 
total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and SI/TIBC ratio were assessed in one 
hundred children with febrile seizures and compared to the values of one 
hundred healthy children presenting in a heath care center in the same period 
as the control group. 
Results 
A total of 6% of cases had iron deficiency anemia which was similar to the 
control group. In the case group SI/TIBC ratio below 12% was seen in 58% 
of children which was significantly higher than that of the control group 
(29%).
Conclusion
The results of this study suggest that although anemia was not common 
among febrile seizure patients, iron deficiency was more frequent in these 
patients

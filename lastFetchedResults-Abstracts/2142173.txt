The objective of this work was the sustainability assessment of a 50 MW solar thermal power plant in Crete, an isolated Mediterranean system. The selected scenarios were examined on their technical, economical and environmental sustainability. Key results were the estimation of energy efficiency parameters, energy flows during all the months of the year, economic indicators, as well as potential environmental impacts. The main conclusion is that a solar thermal power plant can – under certain conditions – be sustainable in an isolated system. These conditions are appropriate siting and the introduction of environmental measures.

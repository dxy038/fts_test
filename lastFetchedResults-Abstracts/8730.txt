There are instances where efficiency and safety may be compromised as a result of deteriorating fluid transport systems. Thus, it is worth evaluating other methods that can repair the damage for a temporary period without shutting down the operation. The objective was to evaluate the durability of an epoxy-bonded steel in aqueous environments that would represent such a repair. EPONÂ® 828 was chosen as the epoxy resin, and dicyandiamide and polyamidoamine were two types of curing agents evaluated in this study. The epoxy-bonded steel joints were exposed in either distilled water or 3.4% NaCl solution for various times. The mechanical strength of the bonded joints was evaluated using a three-point flexure test. The interfacial shear strength of unaged samples ranged from 0.93 to 0.32 MPa. It was found that the interfacial shear strength decreased with aging time for both epoxy-bonded systems. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to determine the locus of failure of the bonded joints. It was concluded that failure occurred cohesively within the oxide layer if oxides were present on the substrate surface prior to the bonding procedure.

Objective
rpose of this study was to determine the microtensile bond strength of various resin composite/adhesive systems to alumina particle abraded Ti–6Al–4V substrate after aging for 24 h, 10 days, and 30 days in distilled water at 37 °C.
s
aboratory resin composite veneering systems (Gradia, GR; Solidex, SOL; Ceramage, CER; and Sinfony, SF) were bonded to 25 mm diameter machined disks of Ti–6Al–4V with their respective adhesive and methodology, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Microtensile bars of approximate dimensions 1 mm × 1 mm × 6 mm were prepared for each resin composite/adhesive system. After cutting, groups (n = 12) from each adhesive system were separated and either stored in water at 37 °C for 24 h (baseline) or aged for 10 or 30 days prior to loading to failure under tension at a cross head speed of 1.0 mm/min. Failure modes were determined by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Statistical analysis was performed through one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test at 95% level of significance.
s
icant variation in microtensile bond strength was observed for the different systems and aging times. SOL and GR showed the highest mean bond strength values followed by SF and CER at baseline. Aging specimens in water had an adverse effect on bond strength for SOL and CER but not for the SF and GR groups.
icance
ro bond strength of laboratory resin composites to Ti–6Al–4V suggests that strong bonds can be achieved and are stable for certain systems, making them useful as an alternative for esthetic fixed prosthetic restorations.

The objective of this paper is to study the effect of using visual attention (saliency) of an object´s texture to improve the quality of mesh simplification. We present an extension for QSlim method [Garland and Zhou, `Quadric-based simplification in any dimension´, 2005] which uses saliency measurement and we evaluate simplified meshes in terms of geometry loss and synthetic view-dependent image-based measurement.

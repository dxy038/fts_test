A model-based delineation algorithm is presented. It is a flexible model fitting algorithm, approaching contour detection as an optimization problem. An objective function is introduced, which depends not only on local contour features, but also on a global shape constraint. The latter is implemented as the similarity to the instance of a parametric shape model. The algorithm optimizes both the contour points and the parameters of the model. As a result, both global and local characteristics of the contour are determined as a compromise between photometric data and prior knowledge. The method was applied to myocardial perfusion SPECT images, to delineate the entire left ventricle (endocardium and epicardium), including possible regions of reduced perfusion. By adapting the balance between the image data and the shape model, images with different characteristics can be processed, including Thallium-201 and MIBI scans

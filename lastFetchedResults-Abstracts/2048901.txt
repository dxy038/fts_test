Objective: Knee- ankle foot orthoses are the most commonly orthoses in the post-polio syndrome. Metal KAFOs are the most commonly prescribed orthoses in Iran. However, problems have been reported when using them, during walking. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effect of changes in range of motion of metal KAFO ankle joint on balance in patients with Post-polio syndrome.
Method: 22 post-polio syndrome patients (37-50 yr) from Red Crescent Rehabilitation Center participated in this study. Data collection were performed using by the balance master system with the participants wearing the conventional KAFO and KAFO with increased range of motion of the ankle joint. Data collection was performed with a two weeks follow-up period.
Result: In KAFO with increased range of motion of ankle joint, the maximal backward excursion of COG (P<0.002), movement velocity toward the backward (P<0.018) increased when compared to conventional KAFO.  The time of  weight transfer was reduced while wearing KAFO with  increased range of motion of ankle joint in comparison with â€“conventional  KAFO ( P<0.002).  No significant differences were observed at the other parameters such as limit of stability and sit to stand.
Conclusion: the results of this study showed that change in ankle joint range of motion of metal KAFO can let in improvement in some indicators related to postural stability in individual with post-polio syndrome.

In this paper, we have developed an integrated maintenance policy for a manufacturing system subjected to a random failure and calling up on several subcontractor machines. The problem consists on a machine, unable to satisfy a constant demand. That&#194;&#191;s why it called upon another machine, comprising the so-called subcontractor machine, which produces at a certain rate the same type of product. In order to assure an economical objective, we have a choice between several subcontractors having some different data. In this paper we have proved analytically, that the choice of the subcontractor machine is conditioned by the unit lost cost due an unsatisfied demand of one product. A numerical example confirms the analytical results.

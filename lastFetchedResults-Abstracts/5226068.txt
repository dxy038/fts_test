The design and implementation of a dependable system that provides a composition and execution environment for distributed applications whose executions could span arbitrarily large durations is described. The objective is to create a framework for complex service provisioning. By complex service provisioning we primarily mean the ability to compose a given service out of existing ones as well as the ability to exercise dynamic control over the execution of the service. The approach taken is centred around building middleware services based on integration of workflow and agent technologies. The platform enables these two systems to interact via CORBA services. Service behaviour and service deployment are represented as workflow processes. Individual tasks that make up the workflow would be legacy applications, specially created tasks, and agent applications. Agents are able to create workflow instances, receive results from workflow and send inputs to workflows. This enables agents to act as user agents capable of managing workflows on behalf of users

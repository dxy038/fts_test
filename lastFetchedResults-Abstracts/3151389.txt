As a way to reduce the energy consumed by a buildingÂ´s HVAC system, a practical method for optimal control has been developed. Since proposed method identifies objective function model for optimization with past operational data, it automatically adjusts the settings in accordance with the change in the outside environment and building operation. The proposed method was applied to an actual hotel building for validation. As a result, we were able to demonstrate that it realizes energy conservation by increasing the chilled water temperature appropriately.

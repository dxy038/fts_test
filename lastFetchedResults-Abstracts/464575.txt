OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to test the hypothesis that the addition of fetal electrocardiogram time-interval analysis to conventional electronic fetal monitoring would significantly reduce the number of cases requiring fetal scalp blood sampling without an increase in adverse outcome. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized prospective trial was performed in 214 women with high-risk labor. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in the number of cases that had fetal blood sampling performed in the fetal electrocardiogram plus electronic fetal monitoring group (risk ratio for electronic fetal monitoring alone 3.53; p< 0.01, 95% confidence interval 1.39 to 8.95). The fetal blood samplings performed in the electronic fetal monitoring alone group were less likely to be abnormal (pH <7.25, base excess <-8.0) than those performed in the fetal electrocardiogram plus electronic fetal monitoring group (risk ratio for electronic fetal monitoring alone 0.62, p = 0.05, 95% confidence interval 0.35 to 1.10). There was a trend of more infants with an arterial umbilical pH <7.15 and a base excess less than -8.0 mmol/L at birth being unsuspected and more instrumental deliveries for presumed fetal distress being performed in the electronic fetal monitoring alone than in the fetal electrocardiogram plus electronic fetal monitoring group. CONCLUSION: The addition of fetal electrocardiogram analysis to conventional electronic fetal monitoring during labor can reduce significantly the number of parturients undergoing fetal scalp blood sampling and can simultaneously increase its efficiency without an increase in adverse outcome.

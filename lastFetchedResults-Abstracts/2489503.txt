Low swirl burner provides an effective and low cost solution for stable lean premixed combustion. Several studies have been conducted on the performance of these burners in different pressures, temperatures, capacities, mixture velocities and equivalence ratios. The main design parameters of low swirl burners are the swirl number and the recess length. The objective of this paper is the investigation of recess length effects on the burner performance. A rig test has been established and utilized to study the effects of different equivalence ratios and recess lengths on the temperature distribution and flame regime of low swirl burners. Results revealed that increasing the recess length causes the increase in axial bulk velocity and hence the lifted flame would be stable in wider range of equivalence ratios. Observations also show the significant effect of the specific divergent flame regime of low swirl burners on result in uniform temperature distribution inside the combustion chamber and lower NOx production

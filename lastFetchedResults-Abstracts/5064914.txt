Comparative study for optimisation of causal infinite impulse response (IIR) filters with applications to perfect reconstruction quadrature mirror filter (QMF) banks is presented. A hybrid procedure is applied where a constrained genetic algorithm is first used to search the objective function landscape for a promising valley. Sub-optimal filter parameters are then further optimised using four different methods. These are: new GA based `creep codeÂ´, gradient based constrained Sequential Quadratic programming method and Quasi-Newton method and non-gradient based downhill Simplex method. Finally, a comparison is drawn between each of the four methods of optimisation

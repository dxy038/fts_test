The objective of this study was to determine the maximum metabolizable energy intake (MEImax) in the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus). Metabolizable energy intake was measured with metabolic cage and induced by two cold-exposure procedures: group I was gradually exposed to cold from 23°C to −9°C, MEImax was gained at 5° and kept till −9°C (3•40±0•42 kJ g−1 day−1), 3•31 times the basal metabolic rate (BMR); Group II was directly exposed to cold temperature (0°C and −6°C). Mongolian gerbil could maintain their MEImax in a wide temperature range, suggesting that Mongolian gerbils have a greater capacity to tolerate the ambient temperature fluctuation in their natural environments. MEI of group II was lower than that of group I at 0°C and −6°C. Cold acclimation could increase the MEImax and enhance the ability to cope with the cold stress. Mongolian gerbils are able to change their physiological performance to adapt to their natural environments.

The objective of this paper is to introduce the development and technical features of WX/U-desulfurization equipment which is an efficient integrated wet de-dusting and desulfurization facility. Effect of various operational parameters on the desulfurization efficiency of WX/U-desulfurization equipment was studied experimentally. And the experimental data was compared with that of a single venturi scrubber under the optimum operational parameters. The results showed that the desulfurization efficiency of the WX/U desulfurization equipment is higher than that of the venturi scrubber. Experimental data could provide the utilitarian value for the industrial applications and promotion of WX/U desulfurization equipment.

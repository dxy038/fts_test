AC-AC converters have wide applications in AC motor drives and marine power supplies. Modern direct AC-AC converters are based on the new topology of matrix converters. Despite excellent features, matrix converters suffer from the problems associated with bidirectional switch implementation. In this paper, a new direct AC-AC converter is presented. The proposed system has most advantages of modern AC-AC converters while using unidirectional switches and standard power modules available in the market. Simulations and experimental results are given in this paper.

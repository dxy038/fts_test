Objective
te cancer (CaP) is a heterogeneous, multifactorial, and multifocal disease. Therefore, the search for a combination of functional polymorphisms using cell cycle and apoptotic genes as tumor markers is fundamental for a more precise and reliable diagnosis. In the present study, we investigated the diagnostic value of 3 different genes associated with CaP carcinogenesis, encoding for cell cycle (MDM2, CCND1) and apoptotic (Fas) genes that are differentially expressed in CaP.
s
ospital-based case control study of northern India, blood samples were obtained from 192 CaP patients and 224 cancer-free age matched unrelated healthy controls of similar ethnicity. They were genotyped for MDM2 G309T, CCND1 G870A, Fas A670G, and G1377A polymorphisms using polymerase chain restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method.
s
09GG variant was at reduced risk for developing CaP (P = 0.041; OR, 0.59). Whereas CCND1 AA genotype demonstrated increased risk (P = 0.018; OR, 1.86). The diplotype analysis of Fas G670A and G1377A (G-A) was observed to be associated with a significant increase in CaP risk (P = 0.024; OR, 1.63).
sion
gs based on current sample size our results suggested a positive association of CCND1AA genotype and diplotype analysis of Fas G670A and G1377A (G-A) to be associated with CaP risk that could influence the pathophysiology, thereby modulating the risk of CaP.

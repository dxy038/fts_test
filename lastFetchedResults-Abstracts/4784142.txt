The voluminous nature of social scientific, spatial-temporal statistical databases calls for high interactive performance and creative integrated information and geo-visualization tools. A solution to this challenge can be found in the emerging visual analytics (VA), a science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces and innovative visualization and is now actively pursued by research groups worldwide. In this paper, we present a tool called "GeoAnalytics", based on the principles behind VA. Our objective is to define new suitable approaches and tools for exploring time variant and multivariate attributes simultaneous including a spatial dimension. We introduce parallel coordinates integrated with time series and trend graph that serves as the visual control panel for the application. Multivariate attribute dynamic queries can express simultaneously queries involving time varying spatial data. VA encourages the need to build a bridge between the advantages of both human perception and computer science technologies. The sense of immediacy and speed-of-thought interaction is achieved in our dynamically linked components and maximum allocation of screen area for visual displays that helps users stay focused on their work and shortens their time to enlightenment

High dynamic range imaging (HDRI) methods in computational photography address situations where the dynamic range of a scene exceeds what can be captured by an image sensor in a single exposure. HDRI techniques have also been used to construct radiance maps in measurement applications; unfortunately, the design and evaluation of HDRI algorithms for use in these applications have received little attention. In this paper, we develop a novel HDRI technique based on pixel-by-pixel Kalman filtering and evaluate its performance using objective metrics that this paper also introduces. In the presented experiments, this new technique achieves as much as 9.4-dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio and can achieve as much as a 29% improvement in radiometric accuracy over a classic method.

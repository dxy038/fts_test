This paper presents a study of the performance of
distance protection relays when applied to protect shunt Flexible
AC Transmission System (FACTS) compensated transmission
lines. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of
distance relays on transmission lines with FACTS devices applied
for mid point voltage control. Effect of two types of shunt FACTS
devices, Static Var Compensators (SVC) and Static Synchronous
Compensators (STATCOM) are studied. The study is conducted
in three stages. First the situation is studied analytically, where
the errors introduced in the impedance measurement due to the
presence of shunt FACTS devices on the line are analyzed. In the
second stage, the situation is simulated using transient simulation
software, EMTDC. In this method, the response of FACTS devices
for different fault conditions and system conditions is also modeled.
This method brings out some unique problems that would
be experienced by the distance relays due to some specific characteristics
of the FACTS devices. Finally, the findings are confirmed
by testing a commercial distance relay using a Real Time Digital
Simulator (RTDS). The results obtained by testing the commercial
relay validate the analytical and simulation studies.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the efficacy of P6 acupressure in reducing or relieving symptoms of nausea with or without vomiting and retching during pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Symptomatic pregnant volunteers (n = 161) participated in a 7-day community-based clinical trial. All participants were assigned to one of three groups (i.e., P6 acupressure, placebo [acupressure bands inappropriately placed], or control) on the basis of a process of blocked randomization. Data were analyzed by error bar charts and analysis of variance of difference scores. RESULTS: Of 161 women, 149 (92.5%) completed the protocol. Irrespective of group assignment, participants reported significant decreases in nausea (p< 0.0009) and vomiting or retching (p< 0.0009). However, there was no differential treatment effect as a result of acupressure. CONCLUSION: There was no apparent medical benefit from the use of P6 acupressure. Our findings differ from other recently published studies that did not include a control group. (AM J OBSTET GYNECOL 1996;174:708-15.)

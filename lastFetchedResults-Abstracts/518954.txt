Objective- To investigate the short-term results of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on native coronary vessels in patients with prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Methods- Coronary angiography was performed for 82 patients with prior CABG who presented with typical chest pain during the interval from March 2007 to May 2008. PCI and stenting was performed on the eligible native vessels. The resolution of symptoms and the frequency of hospitalization were evaluated during the 6-month follow-up period. Results- The technical success rate for PCI was 94%; the reduction in hospitalization rate and typical chest pain occurrence and improvement in functional class after PCI were statistically meaningful. There was no statistically significant relation between age, sex, triglyceride level, cholesterol level, diabetes, smoking, and ejection fraction with the above parameters. Conclusion- PCI on native vessels is a well tolerated procedure with a minor morbidity and mortality rate and good symptomatic and anatomical outcome for patients with prior CABG (Iranian Heart Journal 2008; 9 (3):6 -9).

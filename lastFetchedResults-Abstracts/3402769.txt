A high-performance adder is one of the most critical components of a processor which determines its throughput, as it is used in the ALU, the floating-point unit, and for address generation in case of cache or memory access. In this paper, low-power design techniques for various digital circuit families are studied for implementing high-performance adders, with the objective to optimize performance per watt or energy efficiency as well as silicon area efficiency. While the investigation is done using 100 MHz, 32 b carry lookahead (CLA) adders in a 0.6 /spl mu/m CMOS technology, most techniques presented here can also be applied to other parallel adder algorithms such as carry-select adders (CSA) and other energy efficient CMOS circuits. Among the techniques presented here, the double pass-transistor logic (DPL) is found to be the most energy efficient while the single-rail domino and complementary pass-transistor logic (CPL) result in the best performance and the most area efficient adders, respectively. The impact of transistor threshold voltage scaling on energy efficiency is also examined when the supply voltage is scaled from 3.5 V down to 1.0 V.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

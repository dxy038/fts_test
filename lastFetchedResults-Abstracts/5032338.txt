Software self-testing of embedded processor cores which effectively partitions the testing effort between low-speed external equipment and internal processor resources, has been recently proposed as an alternative to classical hardware built-in self-lest techniques over which it provides significant advantages. In this paper we present a low-cost software-based self-testing methodology for processor cores with the aim of producing compact test code sequences developed with a limited engineering effort and achieving a high fault coverage for the processor core. The objective of small test code sequences is directly related to the utilization of low-speed external testers since test time is primarily determined by the time required to download the lest code to the processor memory at the testerÂ´s low frequency. Successful application of the methodology to a RISC processor core architecture with a 3-stage pipeline is demonstrated.

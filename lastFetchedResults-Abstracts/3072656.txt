Coded transmission over channels introducing intersymbol interference in presence of a co-channel interferer and additive white Gaussian noise poses a problem for single antenna receivers. In this context we present a bidirectional list-sequential (LISS) interference canceller which performs joint detection of the desired user and the interferer. The tree-based LISS algorithm is derived from a decoding technique for convolutional codes with high memory, namely sequential decoding, and adapted to the soft-in/soft-out detection problem. Due to bidirectional tree-searching with two independent LISS algorithms, the proposed detector allows parallel processing with a controllable complexity even for high memory channels.

Background and Objective: Nowadays the therapeutic methods are being shifted toward “targeted therapy” which means specific therapy against one expressed factor in cancerous tissue.  In recent years several indicators for evaluating the prognosis of breast cancer have been under investigation. One of these is fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR2). Fibroblast growth factors play multiple physiological roles and in some studies have been regarded as effective parameter in prognosis of breast cancer while it has not been the case in other studies. 
Subjects and Methods: The effects of them are exerted via their receptors.A retrospective study was applied.
Immunohistochemical method was applied. Also, statistical analysis was done.
 Results: No statistical correlation between FGFR2 and tumor size, age, microscopic grade and auxiliary lymph node metastasis were found.
Conclusion: We did not find any correlation. It is suggested that the study be performed in larger scale and other parameters be included in the survey. Furthermore, such survey should be performed concerning other common cancers. Also, some pilot medicines must be assessed in a clinical trial.

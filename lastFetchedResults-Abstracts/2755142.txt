The recent Ethernet Ring Protection (ERP) method brings new challenges into the design of next generation Ethernet carrier networks. This letter addresses one of the design challenges that may confront a network operator in its migration to provide ERP capabilities over an existing network. The objective of the design is to properly allocate network resources to maximize the service providerÂ´s revenue given the per-link deployed capacity. We formulate this problem of resource allocation as an optimization model with the objective of maximizing the network flow using the well-known max-min approach. Our proposed model ensures fairness among the admissible flows and the design of a proper protection plan to survive against any single link failure. Numerical results show that the proposed design approach can increase the overall network flow by up to 44.7% in comparison to an arbitrarily designed ERP network while it allocates bandwidth 29.3% more fairly among the sessions.

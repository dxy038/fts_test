We develop a Modified DVRA (MDVRA), distance vector protocol for mobile ad-hoc network. Our objective was primarily intended to remove the weaknesses inherent in the widely used DVRA, based on the well-known Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm. Additionally, the goal was also to enhance the capabilities of the DVRA as to make it an efficient, robust and fully dynamic practical routing algorithm which may prove itself attractive enough for being used more extensively in general network as well as in the global Internet. As a distributed dynamic routing algorithm which is expected to adapt to changes in topology and traffic, the existing DVRA suffers mainly from two types of problems, namely, the problem of slow convergence with occasional count-to-infinity (CTI) and, occasional route oscillations. This paper, proposed routing protocol that use to create the MDVRA that would be truly dynamic, robust and free from the various limitations that have been discussed.

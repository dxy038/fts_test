In this work, we propose a novel self-seeded WDM-PON topology. Unlike previous works, in our case, the self-seeding occurs in RSOAs located at the OLT, allowing upstream transmission based on carrier remodulation at the ONT. Thus, a single wavelength per user can be employed for both traffic directions while eliminating the need for an external broadband light source at the CO. A maximum bidirectional 2.5 dB power penalty for a BER of 10<sup>-10</sup> was obtained for an injection power level of -22 dBm into the ONT RSOAs. We also investigate the tolerance of downstream BER to downstream extinction ratio (ER<sub>D</sub>) and self-seeding power (P<sub>ss</sub>), as well as analyze the impact of upstream extinction level (ER<sub>UP</sub>), injection power (P<sub>inj</sub>) and ER<sub>D</sub> levels on upstream BER performance, on symmetric 1.25 Gbps OOK transmission over 20 km without DTLA and FFCI mechanisms. We have successfully demonstrated downstream error free transmission (BER of 10<sup>-12</sup>) for an as low as 3.5 dB.

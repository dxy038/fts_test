The objective in this study was to determine Celcure(A.C.C.) of 3% concentration retention and penetration in 150x l 0x 10 cm specimens possessing moisture contents of 12, 20 and 40% and taken from the lower, middle and upper (below the crown) portion of poplar stem (Populus nigra var. horizontalis). Impregnation was performed using a modified Ruping Process in that the process was applied three times but the main pressure stage being reduced to one hour. The results are as follows:
Retention means at 12% moisture content were 85.75, 108.25, and 133.5% from collar to the crown, respectively. At 20% moisture content these values were 60.50, 71.50 and 85.5% while at 40% moisture content they were 41.35, 50.75 and 49.67%, respectively. Analysis of variance showed that there were a significant differences among retention means at different heights as well as different moisture contents at a 1% level of confidence.
Penetration increased with increase in retention as well as height. At 12% moisture content, maximum penetration depths were 6.5, 6.6 and 7.6 cm, at 20% moisture content: 4.2, 4.3 and 4.9 and at 40% moisture content: 1.4, 1.7 and 1.8 cm at the three above mentioned heights, respectively.
It was also found that dry density increased with retention of preservative at any moisture content as well as any height, this increase being dependent on the amount of retention. Analysis of variance showed that there was no significant difference between the dry densities at the three moisture contents but this was not the case for different heights. The cross sectional preservative distribution area wasn't uniform in most samples. This can be attributed to the presence of wet spots which counteracted the proper penetration of preservative.

The quality of the voltage levels in permanent regime demands an optimized electric system, with control of equipments and of the voltage profile in the several load patterns. The allocation and configuration of voltage regulators and capacitor banks become complex tasks, because it is a problem of combinatorial analysis with whole-mixed variables and non-lineal restrictions. With the objective of giving support to both allocation of capacitor banks and voltage regulators, this work proposes a computational program based on computational intelligence techniques, that optimizes distributions system, allocating and configuring capacitor bank and automatic voltage regulator simultaneously, considering the topology of the primary and secondary networks. Once the algorithm works with obtained variables of the primary and secondary network, equipments and consumers data, it becomes a powerful tool for future use in networks with smart grid technologies.

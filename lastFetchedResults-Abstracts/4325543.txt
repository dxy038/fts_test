The add-on battery pack in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles can be charged from an AC outlet, feed power back to the grid, provide power for electric traction, and capture regenerative energy when braking. Conventionally, three-stage bidirectional converter interfaces are used to fulfil these functions. In this paper, a single stage integrated converter is proposed based on direct AC/DC conversion theory. The proposed converter eliminates the full bridge rectifier, reduces the number of semiconductor switches and high current inductors, and improves the conversion efficiency.

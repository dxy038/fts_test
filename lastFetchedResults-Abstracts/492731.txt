Moisture front of trickle irrigation system is outstanding and important properties to be considered for designing of the system. The dimension scale and direction of moisture front can increases the water consumption and irrigation system efficiency. Using Super Absorption Polymer (SAP) could be consider to increase water productivity and irrigation efficiency in the soil. The objective of this research is study the effects of SAP on soil properties and the scale of moisture front. An experimental field complete block design was conducted in four level of SAP in three replications. The difference between treatments was the amount of SAP by 0,0.1,0.2,0.3 percent of soil wight and constant flow volume in three irrigation of time schedule. The result showed that application of SAP improved some of the physical properties of soil. For example the hydraulic conductivity and saturated volume of water and specific gravity. The results also showed that the depth and the moisture wide of wetted soil moisture front in first experiment was different compare with other irrigation period.The wide of wetted soil of moisture front in first irrigation period in wettness treatment is greater than other treatment and this is not true in next irrigation periods but it had smaller front,moisture . The standard variation analysis indicated that depth of wetted soil and wide of moisture front has significant difference in five percent of probability level. Result of comparison among all applied treatments by using 0.3 percent SAP in soil showed significant difference in order to increase the depth and wide of wetted front of soil moisture.

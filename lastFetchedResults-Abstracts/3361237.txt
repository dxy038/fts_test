The main objective of this paper is to examine the operation of a fundamental buck-based three-phase single-stage ac-dc full-bridge converter. In this paper, the operation of this fundamental converter is explained and analyzed, and a procedure for the design of its key components is derived and demonstrated with an example. The performance and characteristics of the converter are shown with experimental results that have been obtained from a prototype, and general concluding remarks comparing buck-based and boost-based three-phase single-stage ac-dc full-bridge converters are made.

Summary form only given. The authors present a DSS (decision support system) for multilocation plant sizing and timing problems (MLPSTPs) using the hierarchical decomposition-based optimization method as a model base, which may be amenable to distributed designs for DSS. MLPSTPs deal with the determination of optimal size, location, time phasing, and the utilization of the plants in order to meet the growing demands of geographically distributed customers. The objective function is normally taken as minimization of net present worth of capital costs plus streams of operating and transportation costs. MLPSTP are strategic planning problems with a long planning horizon, and their decisions affect the overall ability of a firm to meet the changes in demand, technology, and product lines

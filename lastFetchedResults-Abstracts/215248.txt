Tuberculosis of the genitourinary tract is one of the late reactivation or complications of pulmonery tuberculosis which is
mostly prevalent In young adults and middle-aged people. Renal tuberculosis is rare in children. We present a 4 year-old
Afghan girl suffering from pulmonary and renal tuberculosis. The child presented to the hospital with severe malnutrition,
fever and cough which initiated a month earlier. She had a history of close contact with her mother who was a smear positive
TB patient. Radiologic findings in her chest x-ray were pulmonary infiltration in the right lower lobe along with n'ght hilar
adenopathy. The diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was made based on the systemic and pulmonary signs and symptoms
as well as the bacteriologic examinations. Anti-tuberculosis drugs were given to the child and after obtaining intravenous
pyelography (lVP), voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and kidney CT-scan; the diagnosis of renal tuberculosis in addition to
pulmonary tuberculosis was made. Urinary symptoms were treated by anti- tuberculous therapy. (Tanaffos 2006; 5(4): 71-74)

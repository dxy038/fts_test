This paper considers the resource allocation problem for device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying cellular networks and proposes a service-aware resource allocation (SARA) scheme for D2D communication to improve the network performance. SARA takes into account the different service requirements of D2D users. It consists of two allocation phases: on-demand resource allocation and secondary resource allocation. In the first phase, cellular user resources are allocated on demand to meet the different service requirements of D2D pairs. In the second phase, the remaining cellular user resources after the first phase are allocated to D2D users based on an objective function in order to improve the resource utilization. Simulation results show that the proposed SARA scheme can significantly improve the performance of a cellular system in terms of the satisfaction ratio of D2D pairs and the system throughput.

The paper describes the design, test, and development of vibration sensing nodes for a wireless sensor network (WSN) that is used for health monitoring of high voltage (HV) equipment in power substations. The principal objective of the project is to investigate the viability of using inexpensive and low-power wireless sensors for power system monitoring applications. Laboratory tests and experimental results that demonstrate the performance of the sensors are presented.

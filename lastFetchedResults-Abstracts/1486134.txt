The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of sweet lupin (Lupinus albus L. var. Multitalia) as a substitute for soybean (Glicine max [L] Merr.) in feed on the productive performance and meat quality of Podolian young bulls. The steers were divided into 2 homogeneous groups and were fed durum wheat (Triticum durum L.), straw and a complete pellet feed containing 20% sweet lupin seeds or 16.5% soybean. Productive performances were similar for both groups. The values of pH, measured on Longissimus lumborum and Semitendinosus muscles 24 h after slaughter, were similar. No differences were shown between groups regarding the colour characteristics of both muscles or the tenderness of the cooked meat. No statistical differences were found between diets regarding the fatty acid profile of meats, except for a significantly higher incidence of linoleic acid in the meat obtained from animals on soybean feed. In conclusion, comparable results were obtained when soybean was replaced with sweet lupin seeds in complete pellet feed for Podolian steers.

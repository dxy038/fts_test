Objective
Weexplored whether tactile defensive children have picky eating habitsbecause fussy or picky eaters are a general problem to parents anddifferent healthprofessionals.
Methods

Children(n = 62) of both sexes, ages 3 to10 y, were assigned to an experimental tactile defensive (TD)group (n = 29) or a control non-TD group(n = 33). A questionnaire on eatinghabits was compiled and given to parents for completion during personalinterviews (children were screened with a checklist and evaluated fortactile defensiveness with the Winnie Dunn Caregiver profilequestionnaire).
Results

Thisresearch confirmed that the eating habits and food choices of TD andnon-TD children differ significantly. TD children had a fair to poorappetite. They hesitated to eat unfamiliar foods, did not eat at otherpeople's houses, and refused certain foods because of the smelland temperature. They also had a problem eating vegetables. They oftengagged and/or bit their inner lips and cheeks. The results showed adefinite difference in the limited selection of foods that TD childrenchose and a pronounced aversion toward textures or consistencies,smells, and temperatures of food as compared with integratedchildren.
Conclusions

Fussy or picky eatersshould be evaluated more widely than to treat only the feeding problem.Tactile or oral defensiveness can be treated. This report underlinesthe team approach of healthprofessionals.

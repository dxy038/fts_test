Background. Dietâ€“lipid associations established in clinical trials have in general been weak or nonexistent in cross-sectional studies within a population. Our objective was to analyze the dietary associates of serum lipids in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) not using lipid-lowering medication.

Methods. Patients with coronary bypass grafting (n = 49), balloon angioplasty (n = 46), acute myocardial infarction (n = 79), and acute myocardial ischemia (n = 79) participated in a survey (EUROASPIRE). Patients were selected from hospital records at least 6 months after hospitalization. Diet was assessed by a food record, a short questionnaire, and fatty acid composition of serum cholesteryl esters (CE).

Results. Neither the intake of total fat nor that of saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated fatty acids was associated with serum lipids. Use of soft margarine on bread (though not in cooking or baking) and high intake of fiber and cereal products were associated with low total cholesterol. Linoleic acid in CE was inversely associated with total cholesterol and triglycerides, and eicosapentaenoic acid was inversely associated with triglycerides and positively associated with HDL cholesterol.

Conclusions. In the present study use of soft margarine on bread (though not in cooking or baking) and high intake of fiber and cereal products were associates of lowered serum cholesterol concentrations in CHD patients. Fatty acid composition of CE reflected dietary fatty acid intake involved in cholesterol lowering better than food records.

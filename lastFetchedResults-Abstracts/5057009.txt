The growing popularity and evolutionary nature of Wireless local area networks have raised some serious security issues to its users which are being solved by advanced security mechanisms. Applying strong security mechanisms affect the TCP and UDP performance negatively. In this research TCP and UDP performance is measured and investigated that how the security affects on performance. The objective of this research is to propose an approach to achieve maximum performance in terms of TCP and UDP throughput and response time in Wireless network. At the end we conclude that how our proposed approach gains maximum TCP and UDP performance.

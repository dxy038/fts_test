Energy-efficient performance has emerged as the key design objective of high-performance logic circuits to address power-induced reliability concerns and battery life requirements in portable devices. In the sub-65nm technology regime, these problems continue to grow as leakage power becomes the predominant form of power consumption. Among numerous power reduction techniques employed at the circuit and architectural levels, supply gating has been proven to be very effective for standby power reduction. In this paper, we propose application of fine-grained supply gating to large complex circuits for active leakage and dynamic power reduction. A design methodology and associated CAD tool is developed to synthesize combinational logic using hypergraph partitioning and Shannon decomposition, which reduces both leakage and switching power by disabling unused logic dynamically in small clusters of gates. Simulation results for a set of ISCAS-85 benchmarks show that the proposed approach can achieve up to 40% saving in total power in active mode (and up to 37% saving in standby power) with negligible impact on performance and die area for a predictive 32 nm technology.

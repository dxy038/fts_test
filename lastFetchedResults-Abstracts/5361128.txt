In electrical distribution systems multiple outages are usually occurred in severe weather conditions and the out-of-service areas should be restored as soon as possible. This paper presents an application of evolutionary algorithm that is effectively improved by heuristic rules to find the optimal scheme of multiple-objective problem of inter-feeder load transfer in the cases of multiple outages. Constraints of discrete radial feeder configuration, nonlinear time-variant load patterns, voltage drop, and feeder current rating are considered in the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by conducting the simulation of a practical distribution system in Taiwan power distribution system.

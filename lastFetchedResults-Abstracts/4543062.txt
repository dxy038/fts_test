Since sensor nodes have limited resources, cooperation may come at a significant expense; but, it gives also an intention to some nodes to act selfishly. This paper studies the application of game theory to wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In particular, the study of selfish behavior in coverage maintenance protocol (CMP). The first objective of this work is the detection and prevention of selfish decisions using game theory. The second objective is to propose a solution to cope with selfishness and thereafter optimize network coverage. The last objective is the performance evaluation of the proposed solution using the NS-2 simulator, patched with CMP features, and a set of performance metrics such as: additional packet control overhead, false positive nodes and missed convicted nodes.

This work describes a non-linear time-domain model of a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) and uses that model to show that pulsed-current loading of a direct methanol fuel cell does not improve average efficiency. Unlike previous system level models, the one presented here is capable of predicting the step response of the fuel cell over its entire voltage range. This improved model is based on bi-functional methanol oxidation reaction kinetics and is derived from a lumped, four-step reaction mechanism. In total, six states are incorporated into the model: three states for intermediate surface adsorbates on the anode electrode, two states for the anode and cathode potentials, and one state for the liquid methanol concentration in the anode compartment. Model parameters were identified using experimental data from a real DMFC. The model was applied to study the steady-state and transient performance of a DMFC with the objective to understand the possibility of improving the efficiency of the DMFC by using periodic current pulses to drive adsorbed CO from the anode catalyst. Our results indicate that the pulsed-current method does indeed boost the average potential of the DMFC by 40 mV; but on the other hand, executing that strategy reduces the overall operating efficiency and does not yield any net benefit.

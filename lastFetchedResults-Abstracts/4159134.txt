This paper presents different approaches to the problem of fuzzy rules extraction by using fuzzy clustering as the main tool. Within these approaches we describe six methods that represent different alternatives in the fuzzy modeling process and how they can be integrated with a genetic algorithms. These approaches attempt to obtain a first approximation to the fuzzy rules without any assumption about the structure of the data. Because the main objective is to obtain an approximation, the methods we propose must be as simple as possible, but also, they must have a great approximative capacity and in that way we work directly with fuzzy sets induced in the variables input space. The methods are applied to four examples and the errors obtained are specified in the different cases

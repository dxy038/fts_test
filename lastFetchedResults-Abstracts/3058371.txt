The ultimate objective of the software development process is to timely build a flawless system. The realization of this objective is quite challenging. Several approaches have been proposed to successfully achieve this goal. Most important is software reuse. The software stability model captures the domain core knowledge and inherently promotes software reuse. In this paper, we apply software stability to node assignment in communication networks. We reuse a software stability based approach for the selection of clusterheads in mobile ad hoc networks to develop a node assignment algorithm for optical wireless networks. We also evaluate the performance of the developed algorithm using computer simulation. Empirical results show a reduction of 53% and 28% in total pairwise delay and maximum link delay, respectively, in networks deploying the developed algorithm as compared to conventional optical wireless networks.

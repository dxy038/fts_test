In this paper, the grey degree model formulated with maximal covering facility location requirements for large-scale emergencies is proposed to provide flexible solutions for the optimal ranges of decision variables and objective function value in emergency management. Thus, relevant decision alternatives can be generated by adjusting different combinations of the whitened decision variable values within their solution intervals and making relevant tradeoffs between system objectives/restrictions in accordance with demand condition. The grey degree maximal covering model studied in this paper is suitable for certain types of large-scale emergencies.

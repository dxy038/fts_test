An enormous amount of data is produced when a two-dimensional light intensity function is sampled and quantized to create a digital image. For motion video, the amount of raw data generated is even much larger that practical storage, processing and communication systems are unable to accommodate. Data compression techniques have to be devised to reduce the bandwidth requirement. The objective of this project is to develop compression technique for still image and motion video. Individual still image is compressed, using the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) algorithm which is commonly employed recently. For full-motion video, the Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) algorithm is used. In addition, a novel idea to perform compression of still picture as well as image sequence is developed using the pyramidal approach.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

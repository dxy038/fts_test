The diagnosis and treatment of many orthopaedic and neurological disorders can benefit from movement analysis of the upper extremities by facilitating an objective and quantitative assessment of the compensatory movement strategies of patients. In this paper, a procedure for upper extremity movement analysis is introduced, which allows the simultaneous measurement of movement in all anatomical axes of the kinematical joint chain of the upper body. In first clinical applications it was shown that the procedure facilitates the detection of pathological movement patterns and therefore, adds significantly to the understanding of upper extremity movement strategies.

OBJECTIVE: My purpose was to measure the volume of the fetoplacental vessel tree and to relate findings to Doppler flow patterns of the umbilical arteries.
STUDY DESIGN: One hundred sixty placentas were examined by means of standardized random block placental histomorphometry after delivery and the results were compared with antenatal Doppler findings.
RESULTS: There was a high correlation (r = â€“0.703) between the intravillous blood volume obtained from measurements of intermediate and terminal villi and the Doppler flow velocity waveforms detected within the last week before delivery. Moreover, the reduced size of a vessel tree less than 85 mL is highly predictive of perinatal complications, such as fetal growth restriction, low umbilical artery pH values after birth, reduced Apgar scores, and cesarean section for fetal distress.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that reduced end-diastolic flow velocities in the umbilical arteries are associated with elevated fetoplacental impedance owing to reduced vascularization of intermediate and terminal villi. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:540-3.)

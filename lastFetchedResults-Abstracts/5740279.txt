Mobile nodes observing correlated data communicate using an insecure bidirectional switch to generate a secret key, which must remain concealed from the switch. We are interested in fault-tolerant secret key rates, i.e., the rates of secret key generated even if a subset of nodes drop out before the completion of the communication protocol. We formulate a new notion of fault-tolerant secret key capacity, and present an upper bound on it. This upper bound is shown to be tight when the random variables corresponding to the observations of nodes are exchangeable. Further, it is shown that one round of interaction achieves the fault-tolerant secret key capacity in this case. The upper bound is also tight for the case of a pairwise independent network model consisting of a complete graph, and can be attained by a noninteractive protocol.

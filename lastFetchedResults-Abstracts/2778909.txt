In this paper, an integrated three-port bidirectional dc-dc converter for a dc distribution system is presented. One port of the low-voltage side of the proposed converter is chosen as a current source port which fits for photovoltaic (PV) panels with wide voltage variation. In addition, the interleaved structure of the current source port can provide the desired small current ripple to benefit the PV panel to achieve the maximum power point tracking (MPPT). Another port of the low-voltage side is chosen as a voltage source port interfaced with battery that has small voltage variation; therefore, the PV panel and energy storage element can be integrated by using one converter topology. The voltage port on the high-voltage side will be connected to the dc distribution bus. A high-frequency transformer of the proposed converter not only provides galvanic isolation between energy sources and high voltage dc bus, but also helps to remove the leakage current resulted from PV panels. The MPPT and power flow regulations are realized by duty cycle control and phase-shift angle control, respectively. Different from the single-phase dual-half-bridge converter, the power flow between the low-voltage side and high-voltage side is only related to the phase-shift angle in a large operation area. The system operation modes under different conditions are analyzed and the zero-voltage switching can be guaranteed in the PV application even when the dc-link voltage varies. Finally, system simulation and experimental results on a 3-kW hardware prototype are presented to verify the proposed technology.

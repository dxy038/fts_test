Findings: Average score of stress rate in pre test and posttest stage in experimental group had a meaningful difference (P=0/001), but this difference was not meaningful in following test. (P=0/659). Average score of mental health in pre test and posttest stages of test group had meaningful difference (p=0/001) but difference of this score was not meaningful in following test (p=0/646).

Objective
tibacterial activity of Casbane Diterpene (CD) was evaluated in vitro against Streptococcus oralis, S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mitis and S. sanguinis. The viability of planktonic cells was analysed by susceptibility tests (MIC and MBC) and antibiofilm action was assayed.
s
nimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) of oral Streptococcus were evaluated through microdilution tests. To assay antibiofilm activity, biofilms were generated on 96-wells polystyrene plates under the presence of CD and quantified by a crystal violet technique and colonies forming units counting.
s
 isolated from Croton nepetaefolius showed antimicrobial effect on planktonic forms and biofilms of oral pathogens, with MIC values of 62.5 μg/mL against Streptococcus oralis and values between 125 and 500 μg/mL against S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mitis and S. sanguinis. CD showed an inhibitory effect on S. mutans biofilm formation at 250 μg/mL, and a decrease on viable cell of 94.28% compared to the normal biofilm growth.
sions
mpound CD can be considered as a promising molecule for the treatment against oral pathogens responsible for dental biofilm.

This paper describes an innovative system and its architecture to offer media scalable content delivery, increasing the robustness and resiliency, enriching the PQoS both within the network and/or at the end-user terminal, while protecting the content from unauthorized access over heterogeneous physical architecture and P2P logical overlay network topologies. The system is focused on different convergent networks including broadcasting, interactive/on demand bidirectional networks and mobile networks, and mesh P2P logical overlay topologies. This system is based on three technology pillars: Multi-layered/Multi-viewed content coding, Multi-source/multi-network streaming &amp; adaptation, content protection and lightweight asset management. In addition, the applicability to IPTV over P2P convergent networks is described to demonstrate the system usefulness to offer commercial services.

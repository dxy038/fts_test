The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of refrigeration, freezing and spray-drying processing method on nutritive components and fatty acid composition of egg yolk, egg white and whole egg. Spray-dried egg products showed higher values than those of frozen or refrigerated products as having higher total solids and comprise the contents in concentrated amounts. There was nonsignificant difference in the cholesterol levels of processed whole eggs and yolks. Fatty acid compositions of whole eggs and yolks that were processed either by refrigeration or freezing or spray-drying revealed major fatty acids as oleic, stearic, linoleic and linolenic acid. It was concluded that processing method do affects nutrient composition of egg products.

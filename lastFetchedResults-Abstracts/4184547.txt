Analog circuits are very important in many high-speed applications. Since the size of analog circuit is becoming larger and more complex, the design is becoming more and more difficult. In this paper, a novel design approach which uses a divide-and-conquer method to evolve the analog circuits is proposed, and a multi-objective adaptive scheme is presented at the same time. The fitness function can be integrated into a vector and the circuit can be evolved more practically than before by this multi-objective adaptive scheme. The experimental results on the designs of the voltage amplifier and the low-pass filter show that this algorithm is efficient

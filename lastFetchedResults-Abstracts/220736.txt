An object recognition approach based on concurrent
coarse-and-fine matching using a multilayer Hopfield neural
network is presented. The proposed network consists of several
cascaded single-layer Hopfield networks, each encoding object
features at a distinct resolution, with bidirectional interconnections
linking adjacent layers. The interconnection weights
between nodes associating adjacent layers are structured to favor
node pairs for which model translation and rotation, when
viewed at the two corresponding resolutions, are consistent.
This interlayer feedback feature of the algorithm reinforces the
usual intralayer matching process in the conventional single-layer
Hopfield network in order to compute the most consistent modelobject
match across several resolution levels. The performance
of the algorithm is demonstrated for test images containing
single objects, and multiple occluded objects. These results are
compared with recognition results obtained using a single-layer
Hopfield network.

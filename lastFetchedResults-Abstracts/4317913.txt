D-STATCOM (Distributed Static Compensator) is an important member in D-FACTS (Distributed Flexible AC Transmission Systems), and the output filter is one of the key links in the design of it, which has a great influence on its output performance. First, the resonance phenomenon in traditional LC output filter is pointed out in this paper. Then, two modified topologies (LCR and LCCR topologies) are proposed to solve this problem. The aspects of resonance character, filtering ability and power loss are compared between them. At last, the parameter multi-objective optimal design of LCR output filter is demonstrated, which is aiming to decrease the value of the inductance and capacitance of the filter to achieve the objective of decreasing the bulk and weight, reducing the power loss and enhancing the ability to bring load. The validity of this optimization method is verified by simulation.

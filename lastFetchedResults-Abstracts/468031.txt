OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the safety of intraoperative autologous blood collection and autotransfusion during cesarean section.
STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter historical cohort study identified 139 patients in whom autologous blood collection autotransfusion during cesarean section was performed. We also identified 87 control patients who underwent similar surgical procedures at the same centers without autotransfusion. The outcome variables we compared were acute respiratory distress syndrome, amniotic fluid embolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation, need for ventilatory support, infectious morbidity, and the length of postpartum hospitalization.
RESULTS: Demographic and obstetric characteristics were similar in both groups. The ranges of autotransfused volumes were 200 to 11,250 mL at Yale, 225 to 1160 mL at Good Samaritan, and 125 to 4750 mL at Hinsdale. No statistically significant differences existed between the two groups in any of the outcome variables analyzed. No case of acute respiratory distress syndrome or amniotic fluid embolism was identified in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our multicenter experience reveals no demonstrably increased risk of complications in patients receiving autologous blood collection autotransfusion during cesarean section. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:715-20.)

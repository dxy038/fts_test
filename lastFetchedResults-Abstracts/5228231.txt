Increasing demand for low profile and low cost power packages for use in commercial applications drives the development of these packages with competitive cost advantage. The objective of this study is to compare the thermal and electrical performance of thinner version power packages. Both modeling and experimental works are resorted to in order to analyze package robustness. While a large package will guarantee a lower thermal resistance, many applications are very restrictive in terms of the space available for the devices - it is in such applications that a small discrete device has advantages over a module.

When fault occurs in distribution network, relays of the distribution network trip and the distributed generations turn to the islanding operation mode to supply the surrounding load. So the distribution network without islanding operation part is outage. Taking this into consideration, this paper considers the restoration of distribution network without islanding operation part as a multi-objective optimization problem. The binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) seeking Pareto Non-dominated solutions algorithm is introduced to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. The algorithm could reduce the switching frequency and the grid loss under the premise of minimum load loss. Finally, IEEE 33 nodes system is used to verifie the effectiveness of the presented algorithm.

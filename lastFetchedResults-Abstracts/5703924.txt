It will achieve better effect in power energy saving of distribution networks by rationally use several low and medium voltage reactive compensations. A mathematical model integrating 10/0.4 kV reactive power compensation is presented in this paper for comprehensive optimal configuration in medium voltage (MV) distribution feeders and lower voltage (LV) side of public transformers based upon the engineering factors of reactive power compensation, whose objective is to minimize the annual expenditure involving voltage the devices investment and the income of energy saving, with satisfying all sorts of operation, fixing and maintenance constrains. The control variables include the capacitor banks´ number and capacity of various compensation schemes. Cataclysmic genetic algorithm with grouped integer encoding is adopted to solve this problem.

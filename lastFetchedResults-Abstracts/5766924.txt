Multiarea economic dispatch (MAED) is developed from the basic economic dispatch (ED) problem, which considers the optimal power dispatch of multiple areas in terms of operational costs. In this study, the concept of MAED is further extended into multiarea environmental/economic dispatch (MAEED) by taking into account the environmental issue. The objective of MAEED is to dispatch the power among different areas by simultaneously minimizing the operational costs and pollutant emissions. In this paper, the MAEED problem is first formulated and then an enhanced multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is developed to derive its Pareto-optimal solutions. The tie-line transfer limits are considered as a set of constraints during the optimization process to ensure the system security. Furthermore, the area spinning reserve requirements are incorporated in order to increase the system reliability. The reserve sharing scheme is applied to ensure that each area is capable of satisfying the reserve demand. Simulations based on a four-area test power system are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization procedure as well as the impacts caused by the different problem formulations

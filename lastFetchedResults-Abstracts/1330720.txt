The objective of this paper is to develop a new energy transport system for district cooling application by using type 2 absorption cycle. Cold energy from the LNG storage system is utilized as the cooling source of the condenser and the rectifier. The pressures of the system, UAs of the evaporator and the desorber, the inlet temperatures of the refrigerant for each component, transportation distance and the pumping power per unit length are considered as the key parameters. The results show that UA of the evaporator has more dominant effect on COP than that of the desorber. The optimum system pressure for the demand side is also determined. For the present system, it is recommended that the refrigerant inlet temperature of the evaporator be lower than 4.3 Â°C for long distance transportation. It is concluded that the cold energy from the LNG storage system can be effectively applied to the long distance transportation system for district cooling application with the type 2 absorption cycle. The maximum transportation distance and the pumping power per unit length are calculated. The optimum operation conditions are also predicted from the parametric analysis.

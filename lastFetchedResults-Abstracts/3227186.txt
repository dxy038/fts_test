As the internet has become increasingly accessible, an online gaming culture has evolved. The growth of online gaming reflects its importance to the gaming industry. Based on a sample of 46 college students, we formulated an ontology-based ethnographic decision tree model (OBEDTM) to predict whether these students will play massively multiplayer online games (MMORPGs). In this study, we applied the model to 180 additional students to test the predictive power of the OBEDTM. Results show that the OBEDTM has a predictive power of 97%, much better than that of the traditional model. In addition, the OBEDTM is more objective, cost efficient, and practical. Our study shows that college students do not play MMORPGs because they do not find them fulfilling. The main reason students choose to play MMORPGs is due to a friendÂ´s recommendation.

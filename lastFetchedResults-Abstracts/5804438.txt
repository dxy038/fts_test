Tangible interface is a newly defined concept, which provides effective and seamless interaction between a human as a subjective existence and a cyberspace as an objective existence. As one of the tangible interface, tactile interface is essential for many exploration and manipulation tasks in the tangible space. In this paper, we suggest a design of an integrated tactile sensor-display system that enables both of tactile sensing and display with kinesthetic force, pressure distribution, and vibration. A human-like tactile sensing system with PVDF strips and a display system with bimorph actuators have been developed and integrated in the tangible space. In the demonstration scenario of haptic navigation in the tangible space, the developed tactile sensing to display system is successfully experimented

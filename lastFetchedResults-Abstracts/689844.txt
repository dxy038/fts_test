Although studies show that grazing and browsing by herbivores have marked effects on host plants, the mechanisms remain unclear. The objective of this study is to determine the effects of sheep saliva on host plant growth. Sheep saliva was manually applied to clipped plants of two different life forms, a semi-shrub, Artemisia frigida Willd., and a herbaceous species, Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzevel. The results showed that sheep saliva significantly enhanced aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and the ratio of ANPP to belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) for both species. This indicated that sheep saliva promotes aboveground compensatory growth and allocation of photosynthate to aboveground for both plant species. Sheep saliva stimulated only tillering of L. chinensis. Regardless of saliva application, clipping significantly decreased BNPP and plant height, but significantly increased the number of branches or tillers for both plant species. The relative growth rates (RGRs) on both species were significantly greater after clipping with saliva compared with control and clipping without saliva treatments. In addition, RGR of the herbaceous species L. chinensis was faster than that of the semi-shrub A. frigida after application of saliva.

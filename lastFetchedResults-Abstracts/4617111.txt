Basic building blocks of power converters have been extracted for next generation 380 V DC distribution system. An approach has been proposed for realizing highly efficient and ultra-compact basic converters as bidirectional AC-DC converters, isolated DC-DC converters and non-isolated DC-DC converters. Based on the proposed approach, over 97 % efficient converters with 10 W/cm<sup>3</sup> have been fabricated, taking characteristics of Silicon (Si), Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Gallium Nitride (GaN) power devices into account. Fabricated converters will contribute to realizing future environmentally friendly distribution system.

The construction of index system for satellite communication network (SCN) evaluation is unstructured problem which is typically solved by creativity procedures. According to the development of satellite communication industry in China, a new creativity procedure named ISWBD (Integrated Stages With Brainstorming and Delphi) is designed based on Brainstorming and the Delphi procedure. Key techniques in ISWBD such as expert selection, question design, consensus measurement and iteration control are designed in detail. By ISWBD, an index system for SCN evaluation is built, which is objective, formal and feasible.

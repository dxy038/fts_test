With the advance of the network technologies, peer- to-peer (P2P) has become a new network application model for state of the art distributed computing and has instigated many researches on it. Message passing is one of the most important operation to accomplish high scalable and reliable services in P2P networks. Among number of techniques, flooding is the most frequent used scheme to perform resource discovery and message forwarding. However, flooding usually causes communication redundancy and network congestion. In this paper, we present different messages passing strategies aim to alleviate drawbacks of flooding in distributed and unstructured P2P overlay networks. Objective of the proposed techniques are twofold, reduce amount of querying and increase resource utilization. Advantages of our techniques are simple, low complexity and easy to implement. Due to the property of distributed techniques, they are easy to be applied in distributed and unstructured P2P overlay network. The simulation results show that the proposed methods can efficiently reduce the number of querying and provide reasonable message coverage for different unstructured P2P overlay networks. The detailed analysis, which weighs the pros and cons of these methods, points out their properties and suggests the better message passing mechanism for different P2P environment is also contribution of this paper.

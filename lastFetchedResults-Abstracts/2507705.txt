Objective: Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is a neurotoxic organophosphorus (OP) insecticide. Its
mechanism of action includes oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase
enzyme (AChE). The aim of the present study is to investigate CPF toxicity
in mature and immature cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs), as well as its effect on glutamate
induced excitotoxicity.
Materials and Methods: This study was an in vitro experimental study performed on mice
cultured CGNs. Immature and mature neurons were exposed to different concentrations
of CPF (1-1000 ?M) and glutamate (10-600 ?M) for 48 hours after which we used the
MTT assay to measure cytotoxicity. Immature neurons had exposure to CPF for 5 days
in order to evaluate the cytotoxic effect on developing neurons. Mature neurons received
sub-lethal concentrations of CPF (10, 100 ?M) combined with different concentrations of
glutamate. AChE activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were assessed
after treatments.
Results: Immature CGNs had increased sensitivity to CPF toxicity compared to mature
neurons. We observed significantly greater ROS production in immature compared to
mature neurons, however AChE activity was more inhibited in mature neurons. Although
CPF toxicity was not well correlated with AChE inhibition, it correlated well with ROS production.
Glutamate toxicity was potentiated by sub-lethal concentration of CPF, however
glutamate induced ROS production was not affected. The results suggested that CPF
potentiated glutamate toxicity by mechanisms other than oxidative stress.
Conclusion: CPF toxicity differed in mature and immature neurons. Potentiated glutamate
toxicity by CPF implied that CPF exposure might be a risk factor for neurodegenerative
disease.

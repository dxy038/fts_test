With the rapid adoption of consumer digital video recorders and an increase of home video data, content analysis has become an interesting and key research issue to provide personalized experiences and services for both camcorder users and viewers. In this paper, we present a novel view to tackle this issue, which aims at modeling and mining of the capture intention of camcorder users. Based on the study of intention mechanism in psychology, a set of domain-specific capture intention concepts is defined. A comprehensive and extensible scheme consisting of video structure decomposition, intention-oriented feature analysis, as well as singular-value-decomposition-based intention segmentation and learning-based intention classification is proposed to mine the usersÂ´ capture intention. Experiments were carried on home video sequences of 90 h in total, taken by 16 persons over the past 20 years. Both the user study and objective evaluations indicate that our proposed intention-based approach is an effective complement to existing home video content analysis schemes

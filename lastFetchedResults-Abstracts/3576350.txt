Magnetic bubble memories have a significant advantage over rotating disk memories as they have no angular momentum. This characteristic theoretically allows them to remain in one position and then be started immediately in either direction. Presented are the results of a simulation of a simple magnetic bubble memory system, which demonstrate that an order of magnitude decrease in latency is possible by going to a bidirectional memory from a unidirectional memory.

Sequence of activities has evident and objective aspects in the people living environment that depend on subjective and meaningful aspects in their culture and lifestyle. The sequence of activities with two forms of "spatial and temporal", are ways of separation or aggregation of activities in different cultures dwelling, which lie at the origin of the formation of behaviour settings. The theoretical framework of this study, based on cultural viewpoints, surveys the "activities, spatial and temporal distances and sequences of activities" and their meanings in dwelling environment. For the purposes of this survey, a case study was done in a residential environment of "Qashqai tribe". In this study, a qualitative research method with data gathering techniques such as taking pictures from the environment and activities, drawing residential units’ maps, behaviour settings diagrams and laddering semi-structured interviews was used. After coding the content of gathered information, analytical findings classified in two parts of "spatial sequence" and "temporal sequence" of activities, and by the Means-End model, consequences and meanings of the sequence of activities was presented in the form of "Feature-Consequence-Meaning" propositions. The results show that the sequence of activities in "Qashqai" dwelling is under influence of “preserving social status" and "observing the privacy of individuals and activities" meanings. Other consequences of meanings like "desirability of human activity settings" prepare lifestyle habitus event conditions in dwelling. In addition to providing a theoretical framework for the study of the human-environment relationship and the presentation of activity sequence properties, the results emphasize the meaningfulness of spatial and temporal sequences of activities in dwellings.

A variety of methods for modeling scattered data are discussed, with an emphasis on two types of data: volumetric and spherical. To demonstrate the performance of the various methods, results from an empirical study using trivariate scattered data are presented. The authorÂ´s objective is to provide information to aid in selecting a type of method or to form the basis for customizing a method for a particular application.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

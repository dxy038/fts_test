Introduction
sive and anxiety disorders often involve a chronic course. This study examined whether objective physical function is a predictor for the persistence of depressive and anxiety disorders.

udy sample consisted of 1206 persons with depressive and anxiety disorders at baseline. Hand grip strength and lung function were used as objective physical function measurements and were determined at baseline. Outcome variable was a 6-month depressive and/or anxiety diagnosis after 2 years of follow-up.
s
hand grip strength predicted the persistence of depressive and/or anxiety disorders at 2-year follow-up (per SD increase: OR = 0.82, CI: 0.69–0.99, p = 0.04). Associations were consistent for depressive and anxiety disorder persistence. Poorer lung function was associated with the persistence of depressive disorders (per SD increase: OR = 0.83, CI: 0.70–0.98, p = 0.03) but not with anxiety disorders.
tions
-up was limited to 2 years.
sions
ively measured poorer physical function predicted the persistence of depressive and/or anxiety disorders.

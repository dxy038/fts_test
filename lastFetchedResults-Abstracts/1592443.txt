Functional type of verb may affect difficulty level of retrieving. It is important for English foreign language teachers to be aware of difficult parts of learning to solve their learner’s problems but not much research is available on the relationship between verb type and verb retrieving for Iranian English foreign language learners. The specific objective of this study was to reveal which English verb type (dynamic or stative) and which sense of a polysemic verb (dynamic or stative) Iranian EFL learners had difficulty to retrieve (within context of sixty Iranian students of intermediate level at Kish Language Institute in Kerman). The picture naming is a way to investigate the processes involved in word retrieval. In this study, the researchers used picture naming task through two kinds of tests. The first test was sentence making and the second was a sentence completion test. Data was analyzed by using descriptive (frequency table) and inferential statistics (Students’ t-test). It was found that there was a significant relationship between verb type and retrieving English verbs among Iranian EFL learners. Retrieving stative verbs were earlier than dynamic verbs for them. Teachers and material developers can benefit from the outcomes of this research in teaching and developing tasks for vocabulary especially verbs in EFL context.

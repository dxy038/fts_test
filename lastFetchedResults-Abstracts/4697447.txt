The semantic integration of heterogeneous information sources across the enterprise together with product information available from the Internet of Things will be so vast, that one of the main challenges will be to provide the right information, at the right time, in the right place, and to the right people. This objective is addressed by the Aletheia - a project targeting the development of a distributed information system that enables the federation and semantic integration of very heterogeneous information sources. In this paper, we present the identified scenarios for semantic data federations in industrial service lifecycle management and discuss the utilization of mock-ups to support the software architects and engineers in the development of the Aletheia system.

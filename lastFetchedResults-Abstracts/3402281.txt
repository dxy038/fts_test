This paper considers the problem of designing an optimal controller for a linear static system with uncertainty modeled as a single induced Euclidean norm bounded multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) perturbation. The objective is the minimization of the singular value of the disturbance to error transfer function. The static (constant matrix) design problem is convex and can be formulated as a sequence of generalized eigenvalue problems. We present a detailed example, applying the approach to the steady-state control of the temperature distribution over a radiantly heated two-dimensional plate.

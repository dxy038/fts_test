This paper presents allocation of power losses to consumers connected to radial distribution networks before and after network reconfiguration in a deregulated environment. Loss allocation is made in a quadratic way and it is based on identifying the real and imaginary parts of current in each branch, and losses are allocated to consumers. The network reconfiguration algorithm is based on the fuzzy multiobjective approach and the max-min principle is adopted for the multiobjective optimization in a fuzzy framework. Multiple objectives are considered for real-power loss reduction in which nodes voltage deviation is kept within a range, and an absolute value of branch currents is not allowed to exceed their rated capacities. At the same time, a radial network structure is maintained with all loads energized. The three objectives considered are modeled with fuzzy sets to evaluate their imprecise nature and one can provide his or her anticipated value of each objective. A 69-node example is considered to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The LASL Van de Graaff Facility includes two accelerators, an 8 MeV vertical and a 16 MeV tandem. Subsystems are being monitored and controlled by a Honeywell H610 process control computer. To improve the man/computer/accelerator communication an Adage AGT-10 graphics system was obtained. Presently the AGT-10 is connected to the H610 and a XDS-930 computer used for data acquisition. Control and monitoring functions have been implemented using the graphics system. It has proved particularly valuable in the optimization problem where many variables may be changed simultaneously. Multi-parameter optimization algorithms suitable for nonlinear objective functions with constraints are being tested on the tandem. Ones which have large tolerance to variations in the measured quantities and fast convergence are being sought. Results to date are given.

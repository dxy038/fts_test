This paper describes the time domain characterization of planar microwave transformers for monolithic RF power amplifiers using the SCN-TLM method. The primary objective of this study is to determine the influence of losses on the electrical properties of such transformers. It emerges that the principle loss mechanism originates from conductor losses of the windings. The influence of the lossy silicon substrate can be neglected up to 5 GHz.

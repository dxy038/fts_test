It presents a practical modeling and solution approach for VMI cyclic inventory routing problem (IRP) under constant customer demand rates. In VMI, the supplier takes the responsibility for replenishing his customerspsila inventories based on their consumption data, with the aim of optimizing the overall distribution and inventory costs throughout the supply chain. The objective of this IRP problem is to determine a distribution plan that minimizes average distribution and inventory costs without causing any stockout at the customers. Deterministic constant customer demand rates are assumed and therefore, a long-term cyclical approach is adopted, integrating fleet sizing, vehicle routing, and inventory management. Further, realistic side-constraints such as limited storage capacities, driving time restrictions and constant replenishment intervals are taken into account. A heuristic solution approach is proposed, analyzed and evaluated against a comparable heuristic. The heuristic solution approach is well capable of finding the appropriate cost trade-off under varying circumstances. Furthermore, when fleet sizing is not considered, the heuristic outperforms an existing heuristic in finding the two-way trade-off between distribution and inventory costs.

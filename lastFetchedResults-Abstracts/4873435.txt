The structure of the elbow-bar mechanism of injection molding machine has a great influence on the axial dimension and efficiency of clamping unit. Based on the motion analysis of the toggle clamping system of the injection molding machine, a mathematical model was established for the optimization design of elbow-bar mechanism. With the least length of the elbow-bar mechanism used as the optimization objective, the design obtained by genetic algorithm was compared with the conventional method. The result shows that the genetic algorithm is much better than conventional design methods and has practical application value.

A guided-wave optical waveguide-division multi/demultiplexer for bidirectional transmission at (0.81 &#194;&#191;m, 1.2 &#194;&#191;m)/(0.89 &#194;&#191;m, 1.3 &#194;&#191;m) wavelengths has been realised using high-silica channel waveguides on silicon substrate. The multi/demultiplexer connected with graded-index multi-mode fibres shows a loss of 3.5&#194;&#191;5 dB together with far-end and near-end crosstalk levels less than &#194;&#191;30 dB and &#194;&#191;50 dB, respectively.

Objective To identify the effect of septorhinoplasty with spreader grafts on patientsâ€™ perception of voice and to measure formant frequencies that may be responsible for perceived changes in voice quality. Methods A total of 20 patients who underwent septorhinoplasty and had spreader grafts placed during the operations were included. All subjects were tested within the week before surgery and 1â€“3 months postoperatively by means of perceptual assessment (Voice Handicap Index-10 [VHI-10] and self-assessment of hypo/hypernasality), acoustic analysis, and formant frequency analysis. Results The mean of VHI-10 score was decreased from 9.44آ آ±آ 6.1 to 5.1آ آ±آ 3.94 postoperatively (Pآ =آ 0.03). Fifteen patients (75%) perceived their voices to be hyponasal before surgery, but only three perceived the hyponasality to persist after surgery (Pآ آ 0.05). Conclusion Septorhinoplasty with spreader grafts significantly improved patientsâ€™ perception of voice; however, acoustic analysis and formant frequency analysis of nasalized vowels did not reveal any significant differences after the operation.

This brief proposes hybrid stable adaptive fuzzy controller design procedures utilizing the conventional Lyapunov theory and, the relatively newly devised harmony search (HS) algorithm-based stochastic approach. The objective is to design a self-adaptive fuzzy controller, optimizing both its structures and free parameters, such that the designed controller can guarantee desired stability and simultaneously it can provide satisfactory performance with a high degree of automation in the design process. Two different variants of the hybrid controller are proposed in this work. These variants are implemented for a benchmark simulation case study and real-life experimentation. The results obtained demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.

This paper presents a new remotely controlled hardware laboratory for distance learning education. The hardware includes a doubly fed induction machine with a bidirectional power source on the rotor to emulate the operation of a wind power generation system. The new laboratory is designed to reinforce the theory learned in class and to verify that modeling and simulations of the lab machine are accurate. The power conversion system is controlled by two FPGA based controllers which communicate with a web server PC through a USB interface so that the laboratory can be executed on campus as well as remotely. The remote students only need access to a PC with internet connection and a standard browser, without the need to install any software or modify its security settings.

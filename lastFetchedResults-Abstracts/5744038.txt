Project resource management could be seen from different standpoints depending on the needs of the participating organisations and the rules or regulations of the individual projects. We present a tool for efficient allocation of project resources of a single project where there is a number of participating organisations working under the rules and regulations of a funding body. The objective of this tool is to improve the allocation of the resources (i.e. person-months) using multiple objectives (minimisation of penalties, strategic distribution of the resources for every activity between the partners, resource levelling of the resources for every participating partner). The allocation of the resources is managed by a control interface that provides all the necessary information to the project manager. Through the control interface the project manager can reallocate the resources appropriately using the aforementioned criteria according to the different events throughout the execution of the project.

This paper presents the design and development of a module of a phased-array antenna for multimedia contents reception in mobile avionics applications. The antenna, which operates in Ku band (12.5 GHz to 12.75 GHz), is based on a modular design. The developed antenna &amp; RF front-end module is implemented in multilayer technology and it has been tested from an electrical, mechanical and thermal point of view. The results presented in this paper are the results of the work developed under the project MULFUN, "Multifunctional Structures", a VI Framework EC project. The objective was to reduce costs and provide added value to avionics equipment by integration of electrical, mechanical and thermal functions.

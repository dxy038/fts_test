Objective
To evaluate the serum zinc level of the patients with simple febrile seizure
and compare them with febrile children without seizure.
Materials & Methods
This prospective case - control study was performed on 60 patients aged 6
months to 6 years from Apr. 2009 to Jan.2010 in Ghaem, Imam Reza and
Dr. Sheikh Hospitals in Mashhad. The serum zinc level was assessed and
compared between the cases (30 individuals who suffered from simple febrile
seizure) and the controls (30 individuals who had fever without seizure).
Results
Mean serum zinc level was 663.7  /l and 758.33  /l in the case group and
the control group, respectively (P < 0.001).
Conclusion
It was revealed that the serum level of zinc was significantly lower in children
with simple febrile seizure in comparison with febrile children without
seizure.

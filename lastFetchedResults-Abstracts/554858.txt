Introduction & objective: One of the most important drawbacks of radial artery is its tendency toward spasm and one of the rare etiologies of that is recurrent blood sampling of the artery. Other causes are injection of drugs in artery in spite of vein, or using radial artery in cardiopulmonary bypass. Papaverine is a useful drug in vasospasm, but it must be used with special caution to avoid it's complications such as arrhythmia.

Case: The patient was a 72 year old man with intestinal gangrene and peritonitis whom was operated in Al-Zahra hospital in 2008. During Laparatomy surgery, because of severe acidosis, blood sampling was done 3 times for blood gas analysis. After being taken to the recovery ward, no radial pulse was detectable in the patient's right hand and severe cyanosis in the same hand was seen. After inserting the arterial catheter in brachial artery, treatment with Papaverine, indications of recovery were seen.

Conclusion: Despite the rarity of radial artery spasm during anesthesia, it is very dangerous situation, and anesthesiologist must try to prohibit and be able to manage this problem and have suitable drugs in the operation room.

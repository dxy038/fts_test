We introduce a spatial stochastic model for the spread of tuberculosis. After a primary infection, an individual may become sick (and infectious) through an endogenous reinfection or through an exogenous reinfection. We show that even in the absence of endogenous reinfection an epidemic is possible if the exogenous reinfection parameter is high enough. This is in sharp contrast with what happens for a mean field model corresponding to our spatial stochastic model.

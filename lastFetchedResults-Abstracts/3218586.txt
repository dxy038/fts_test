Computational science and engineering play a critical role in advancing both research and daily-life challenges across almost every discipline. As a society, we apply search engines, social media, and selected aspects of engineering to improve personal and professional growth. Recently, leveraging such aspects as behavioral model analysis, simulation, big data extraction, and human computation is gaining momentum. The nexus of the above facilitates mass-scale users in receiving awareness about the surrounding and themselves. In this paper, an online platform for modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) on demand is proposed. It allows an average technologist to capitalize on any acquired information and its analysis based on scientifically-founded predictions and extrapolations. The overall objective is achieved by leveraging open innovation in the form of crowd-sourcing along with clearly defined technical methodologies and social-network-based processes. The platform aims at connecting users, developers, researchers, passionate citizens, and scientists in a professional network and opens the door to collaborative and multidisciplinary innovations. An example of a domain-specific model of a pick and place machine illustrates how to employ the platform for technical innovation and collaboration.

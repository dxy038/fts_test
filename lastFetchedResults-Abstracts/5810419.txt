In this paper, the power system stabilizer (PSS) and flexible ac transmission system devices (FACTS) interaction is investigated. The objective of this work is to study and design a controller capable of doing the task of damping in less economical control effort, and to globally link all controllers of national network in an optimal manner, towards smarter grids. This can be well done if a specific coordination between PSS and FACTS devices, is accomplished. Firstly, a genetic algorithm-based controller is used. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is utilized to search for optimum controller parameter settings that optimize a given eigenvalue based objective function. Secondly, an optimal pole shifting, based on modern control theory for multi-input multi-output systems, is used. It requires solving first order or second order linear matrix Lyapunov equation for shifting dominant poles to much better location that guaranteed less overshoot and less settling time of system transient response following a disturbance.

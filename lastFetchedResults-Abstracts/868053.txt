The primary objective of this research was to develop a prototype feature-based multiple-alternative process planning system in which the process plan would be generated directly from design and available factory facility information. An overall removable volume is generated by graphically comparing the 3D part and 3D workpiece blank. The manufacturing features are decomposed into a series of general manufacturing features by using a mixed graph-based and rule-based algorithm. The multiple-alternative process plan generation is based on recognized manufacturing features and various production rules. After generating multiple process plans, each process plan is allocated the possible manufacturing scheduling time and the candidate process plans are retrieved based on the required due day. An example problem is presented to illustrate the functionality of the prototype system. This research presents an alternative method that provides useful information to the factory planner and controller to facilitate production.

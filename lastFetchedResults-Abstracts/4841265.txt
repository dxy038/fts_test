The objective of this study is to propose a control scheme that aims at increasing the control performance of a water-based floor heating system with a large thermal capacity. Experience shows that although floor heating is preferred due to the comfort of the warm floor, the slow control dynamics decreases the overall customer satisfaction. This paper analyzes the control problem and proposes a control scheme with increased dynamic performance. The proposed control scheme is validated using simulation and experimental results.

The objective of the paper is to extend BandyopadhyayÂ´s results on rationality conditions of crisp choice functions. By fuzzifying the rationality conditions in the crisp case, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for the acyclic rationality and a characterization theorem for the W<sub>&#966;</sub>-transitive rationality under a strong De Morgan triple. As a result, some rationality characterizations in the crisp choice functions are generalized.

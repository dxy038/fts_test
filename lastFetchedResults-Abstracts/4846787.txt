This paper proposes a Block-shifting Simulated Annealing (BSA) algorithm for the no-wait flowshop scheduling problem (NWFSP) to minimize makespan. The proposed algorithm makes use of the objective incremental properties of NWFSP and embeds a block-shifting operator based on k-insertion moves into the algorithm framework of simulated annealing. A major advantage of the BSA algorithm lies in its easy implementation since it does not involve sophisticated evolutionary strategy and parameter tuning process. In addition to its simplicity, BSA is shown to be very effective. Through experimental comparisons, the effectiveness of the block-shifting operator is clearly revealed. In addition, the BSA algorithm is proved to be more effective and robust than the state-of-the-art algorithms for solving the NWFSP.

Cascading overload trip due to lack of transmission section protection is an important reason of large-scale blackout. This paper illustrates the meaning of transmission section and points out that the objective of transmission security protection is to maintain its integrality and transmission capacity, and to avoid cascading overload trip. In addition, the implement condition and key technology are discussed, which are online capture of transmission section, real-time prediction of cascading overload and real-time emergency control to avoid cascading trip. This paper has brought forward the primary scheme. Its validity is verified by the calculation result of CEPRI 36 test system and a province system.

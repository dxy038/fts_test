Objective: To evaluate serum Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1) as a biologic marker of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in heart transplant recipients (HTR).
Design and methods: Serum levels of MCP-1 were measured in 49 HTR with and without CAV.
Results: HTR exhibited significantly higher serum MCP-1 levels than controls. However, no difference was observed according to the existence of CAV.
Conclusion: Serum MCP-1 levels do not constitute a marker of the CAV occurring after heart transplantation.

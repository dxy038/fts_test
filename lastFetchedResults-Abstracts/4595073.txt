This paper proposes a multi-objective predictive control based on fuzzy satisfactory goal programming. For the different control goals, the multi-objective predictive control problem with priority is formulated. In order to acquire the preferred result, the fuzzy satisfactory goal programming for three types of fuzzy relations is presented. The released order of the satisfactory degrees is modelled to replace priority according to that the higher priority achieves the higher satisfactory degree. The balance between optimization and priority is realized by regulating the parameter. The example shows the proposed methodÂ´s effectiveness.

Objective: The aim of the present study is assessment of insulin resistance (IR) in obese women by TyG-Index and compared with the HOMA-IR index. 
Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 61 obese women aged 18-45 years. Weights, height, waist circumference (WC) were measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated and recorded. A sample of fasting serum was collected to determine the glucose, triglyceride, insulin, total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C concentration.  HOMA-IR and TyG-Index were calculated as markers of insulin resistance.
Results: The mean age of the precipitants was 32.5 ±0.79 years old and the mean weight was 86.0±1.7 Kg.  The number of people with IR who determined by HOMA and TyG index were 21(34%) and 36(61%), respectively. There was a significant relationship between HOMA-IR and TyG Index, r= 0.044 (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: TyG index represents a useful and accessible tool for assessment of IR instead HOMA_IR in Iranian population, but more researches with greater sample size and via gold standard lab test need to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of this new method.

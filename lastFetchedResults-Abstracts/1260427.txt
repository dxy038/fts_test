 In this study, the calculations and results of acoustic voice analysis as calculated by two different analysis systems (Doctor Speech (DRS), Tiger Electronics, Neu-Anspach, Germany, and Computerized Speech Lab (CSL), Kay Elemetrics Corporation, Lincoln Park, NJ) are compared. A group of 120 normal voices was selected for analysis of the objective parameters: fundamental frequency (F0), variation of F0 (F0SD), jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR). The subject group was a random selection of normal voices of adults. The aim of this comparison was to find determined differences and similarities in data measurements between both systems to make data transfer possible. A significant correlation was found for F0, HNR, and shimmer relative. The correlation for jitter (relative and absolute) and F0SD was weak. DRS and CSL are not comparable in absolute figures, but their judgment against normative data is identical. Further research is necessary to explore the affect on pathological voices or child voices.

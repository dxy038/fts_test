OBJECTIVES
The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation between apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) plasma concentrations and coronary artery disease (CAD).
BACKGROUND
Experimental in vitro and in vivo studies favor apoA-IV to be protective against the development of atherosclerosis. Mice that overexpress either human or mouse apoA-IV demonstrated a significant reduction of aortic atherosclerotic lesions compared with control mice. Data on apoA-IV plasma concentrations and CAD in humans are lacking.
METHODS
We determined in two independent case-control studies of a Caucasian and an Asian Indian population whether apoA-IV plasma concentrations are related to the presence of angiographically assessed CAD.
RESULTS
Plasma apoA-IV levels were significantly lower in 114 male Caucasian subjects with angiographically defined CAD when compared with 114 age-adjusted male controls (10.2 ± 3.8 mg/dL vs. 15.1 ± 4.0 mg/dL, p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the association between apoA-IV levels and CAD was independent of the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. The inverse relationship between plasma levels of apoA-IV and the presence of CAD was confirmed in an independent sample of 68 male Asian Indians with angiographically documented CAD and 68 age-matched controls.
CONCLUSIONS
The results of this cross-sectional study demonstrate for the first time an association between low apoA-IV concentrations and CAD in humans and suggest that apoA-IV may play an antiatherogenic role in humans.

When identification metadata for images in a massive database contains necessary information for detection of rotation of an image, it would be quite efficient in terms of image database management and detection of duplicated images. In this paper, we discuss how the image identifiers can be used for detection of rotated duplicates of an image and provide the experimental results. From the experimental evaluation, we conjecture that our proposed image identifier can be utilized for the given objective effectively.

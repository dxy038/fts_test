This paper describes the use of stochastic differential correction models in refining the Seasat orbit based on post-flight analysis of tracking data. The objective is to obtain orbital-height precision that is commensurate with the inherent Seasat altimetry data precision level of 10 cms. Local corrections to a mean ballistic arc, perturbed principally by atmospheric drag variations and local gravitational anomalies, are obtained by the introduction of stochastic dynamical models in conjunction with optimal estimation/ smoothing techniques. Assessment of the resulting orbit with "ground truth" provided by Seasat altimetry data shows that the orbital height precision is improved by 32% when compared to a conventional least-squares solution using the same data set. The orbital height precision realized by employing stochastic differential correction models is in the range of 73 cms to 208 cms RMS.

A linear degradation model for digital image restoration is considered. It is assumed that the noise is additive, uncorrelated and independent of the degradation process and also of original image. A new objective criterion is used for the least square restoration method proposed here. The criterion is to minimize the correlation between image and noise gray levels. The method can be implemented in the Fourier domain and is computationally attractive. The test results on a chromosome picture are demonstrated for different signal-to-noise power ratios.

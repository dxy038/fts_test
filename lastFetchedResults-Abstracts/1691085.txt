Inroduction & Objective: Spreading of pollutants, including nitrate causing acute or semi-acute poisoning especially in fry fish in water, its concentration in cause interference physiological functions and cause of unknown death. purpose of this pilot study was to determine safe levels of nitrates in the water and acute effects on the gill ,liver and kidney tissues of sturgeon (Acipenser persicus) which is a valuable fish in the Caspian Sea.
Materials and Methods: The concentration of the initial inception of LC10, LC50 and LC90 during 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours according to OECD method, for the nitrate on larve of Acipenser persicus (weighing 2to3g) compared with the control group , were measured. As for the larve, Acipenser persicus 750, 773, 798, 823 and 850 mg per liter of nitrate was calculated. 
Results: The LC10 of nitrate 24, 48, 72 and 96 was 775.6097, 716.2509, 677.9556 and 669.7878 mg per liter, the LC50 nitrate 909.7434, 825.9397, 793.645 and 764.5538 mg per liter and the LC90 nitrate, 1067.074, 952.4265, 929.076 and 872.728 mg per liter, respectively. Results showed that the gills phenomena such as congestion, swelling of the primary lamella, hyperplasia, adhesions secondary lamella, hemorrhage and necrosis were observed after exposure to nitrate within 96 hours. It should be noted that the severity of injuries getting higher in the plots treated 1 to 5 treatments. In the liver of Persian sturgeon after exposure adverse effects such as hyperemia, cellular necrosis, bile record and cell atrophy was observed, but their intensity was varied in each treatment and even in some treatments may be one of the complications do not seen. In the kidney of Persian sturgeon complications such as hyperemia and bleeding, melanomacrophage, increased urinary space and hypertrophy were observed. The most common complication were in treatments 4 and 5.
Conclusion: According to present study Persian sturgeon is sensitive species to nitrate and nitrite concentrations should be considered in growth stages. That not be more than declared.

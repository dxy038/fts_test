Full-duplex has emerged as a new communication paradigm and is anticipated to double wireless capacity. Existing studies of full-duplex mainly focused on its PHY layer design, which enables bidirectional transmission between a single pair of nodes. In this paper, we establish an analytical framework to quantify the network-level capacity gain of full-duplex over half-duplex. Our analysis reveals that inter-link interference and spatial reuse substantially reduces full-duplex gain, rendering it well below 2 in common cases. More remarkably, the asymptotic gain approaches 1 when interference range approaches transmission range. Through a comparison between optimal half- and full-duplex MAC algorithms, we find that full-duplex´s gain is further reduced when it is applied to CSMA based wireless networks. Our analysis provides important guidelines for designing full-duplex networks. In particular, network-level mechanisms such as spatial reuse and asynchronous contention must be carefully addressed in full-duplex based protocols, in order to translate full-duplex´s PHY layer capacity gain into network throughput improvement.

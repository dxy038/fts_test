This paper develops a fuzzy multi-objective programming model for solving the fuzzy multi-objective expressway planning problems. The proposed model aims to minimize the total system costs and the total construction cost with reference to fuzzy available OD. Then the goal programming was proposed. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the ability of the proposed model to expressway system planning.

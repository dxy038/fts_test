Years of 1330-1332 / 1951-1953 are of great importance for various reasons.
One of the important aspects of the mentioned period is Iranian nation's movement
for nationalizing oil, and reaction of the United States of America against it. This
article, by an emphasis on the national interest of the United States, is going to
review the factors that changed America's approach towards the nationalization of
the oil industry and the removal of Mosadaq as the Iranian prime minister. Unlike
the well-known thought, the reason does not seem to be the fear of growing power
of communism in Iran, but the main factor is Iran's strategic position, and USAâ€™s
craving for a share of oil. This main objective of this paper is to documentary focus
on the nationalization of Oil industry in Iran during the era of Dr. Mosadaq and
how the United States interest in the region placed the USA on the side of the
United Kingdom in the removal of Mosadaq from power.

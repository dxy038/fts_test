The objective of this paper is to extract a suitable number of evenly distributed matched points, given the characteristics of the site and the sensors involved. The intent is to increase the accuracy of automatic image-to-image registration for high-resolution multisensor data. The initial set of matching points is extracted using a scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)-based method, which is further used to evaluate the initial geometric relationship between the features of the reference and sensed images. The precise matching points are extracted considering location differences and local properties of features. The values of the parameters used in the precise matching are optimized using an objective function that considers both the distribution of the matching points and the reliability of the transformation model. In case studies, the proposed algorithm extracts an appropriate number of well-distributed matching points and achieves a higher correct-match rate than the SIFT method. The registration results for all sensors are acceptably accurate, with a root-mean-square error of less than 1.5 m.

The objective of present study was to investigate the effect of various levels of Vitamins E and C in
milk and tris extenders on Atabay ram semen characteristics in frozen condition. Semen were
collected from 6 Atabay rams using artificial vagina and suitable samples were mixed together and
subjected to different treatments in milk and tris extenders. Spermatozoa characteristics including
percentage of motile and viable cells were assessed by electronic microscope. This experiment was
carried out in 3x3 factorial arrangement on the' basis of completely randomized design. First factor
was various levels of Vitamin E (0, 30 and 60 ug/rnl) and second factor was various levels of Vitamin
C (0, 150 and 300 ug/ml). Results indicated that in frozen condition, the effect of Vit. E on motility
and viability percentage of spermatozoa in milk and tris extenders was significant (P<O.OI). The effect
of ViI. C on motility and viability percentage of spermatozoa in milk and tris extenders was not
significant (P>0.05). Mean comparison on the basis of Duncan test showed that the highest motility of
spermatozoa in tris (48.48±O.087) and milk extenders (46.45±O.085) were obtained in level 30 ug/ml
ViI. E. In conclusion, use of Vitamin E (30 ug/ml) in milk and tris extenders is recommended for
storage of Atabay ram semen in frozen condition.

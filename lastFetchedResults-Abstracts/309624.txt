Objective:
To measure free and protein-bound R- and S-enantiomers of methadone and its major metabolite, 2-ethylidine-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP) in serum.
Methods:
To determine free fraction, samples were filtered using ultrafiltration membranes with a molecular weight cut-off of 10,000 Da and extracted using liquidâ€“liquid extraction. The solvent extract was evaporated and reconstituted in mobile phase for analysis by LC/MS/MS. Total analyte was determined by extracting unfiltered samples. Enantiomeric separation was by chiral chromatography.
Results:
LC conditions resulted in baseline separation of R- and S-EDDP, and 85% resolution of methadone enantiomers. Precision of spiked specimens for both R- and S-methadone and R- and S-EDDP was less than 10% at 100 nM, and did not exceed 20% at 10 nM.
Conclusions:
Using minimal sample clean-up and a total instrument run-time of 10 min, a rapid, sensitive and highly specific method was developed for quantitation of free and total R- and S-enantiomers of methadone and EDDP.

Conventional optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) formulations utilize minimization of total system real power loss or voltage deviation as an objective to compute optimal settings of reactive power output or terminal voltages of generating plants, transformer tap settings and output of other compensating devices such as capacitor banks and synchronous condensers. This paper has considered the setting of flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices as additional control parameters in the ORPD formulation and studied the impact on system loss minimization. Static models of three FACTS devices consisting of static VAr compensator (SVC), thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC) and thyristor controlled phase angle regulator (TCPAR) have been included in the ORPD formulations. The results of ORPD have been obtained on a practical system network of Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT)

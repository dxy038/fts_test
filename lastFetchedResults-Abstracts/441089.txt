The repair of a corrected transposition of the great arteries, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary atresia is presented. An Ebstein anomaly of the tricuspid valve, dextrocardia, and severe distortion of the pulmonary arteries complicated the surgical procedure, which was performed in two stages. Reconstruction of the pulmonary arteries and a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis were performed first; Rastelli and hemi-Mustard procedures completed the correction. The rationale and the possible indications of this “one and a half ventricle” repair are discussed.

Inroduction & Objective: Liver is an important organ with special function in metabolism of drugs. Danazol is a drugs for treatment of some patients. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect Danazol on function, liver enzymes including ALT, AST, ALP and blood biochemical factors such as protein and albumin and histological changes of liver in newborn male rats.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study 40 newborn male rats wistar strain divided into 5 group of 8.the newborns were taken from pregnant mothers which divided to the control group that received nothing, the sham group that received solvent (1.6H2O+0.4 ethanol) and three experimental groups that received 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg b.w. Danazol in the pregnancy period for 21 days orally. In 22thdays after parturition, the newborns weighted and the blood samples prepared for AST, ALT, ALP, albumin, protein a valuating by Technicon RA1000 autoanalyzer and pars Azmoon kit made in Iran. In addition , the newborns liver evaluated by H&E histological staining methods.
Results: The body weight in the experimental group showed decreasing and the concentration of AST, ALT and ALP showed increasing significantly (P < 0.05) compare with control group. whereas in plasma concentration of albumin and protein weren’t seen any significant change. In tissue samples prepared with increasing amounts of the drug was observed  more necrosis.
Conclusion: It can be concluded that Danazol causes weight loss by increasing the levels of liver  enzymes also this drug causes necrosis and damaging in liver tissue،however،more investigations are needed.

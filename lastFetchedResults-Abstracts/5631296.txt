A noise suppression algorithm for enhancing speech signals corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise is presented in this paper. The algorithm is based on the subtraction of estimated noise spectrum from the noisy speech spectrum. The performance of the algorithm is assessed by comparing the original clean speech and processed speech. An objective measure based on the log area ratios of a speech segment is used

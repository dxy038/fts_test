Effect of amplitude criteria on the operating characteristics of algorithms for detecting OSAH events based on the analysis of oxygen saturation alone is investigated. The objective is to establish that there exists an oxygen desaturation level that leverages these algorithms to be more sensitive or more specific, irrespective of the differences in detection mechanism and database, a first ever attempt. Linear classification of algorithms from previous studies discovered that a drop in oxygen saturation of 3% or less makes the detection algorithms more sensitive while a drop of 4% or more makes it more specific. Results from two algorithms developed here also supported this. This finding explains the contradiction cited in the performance of algorithms from the different authors, which casts doubts on their detection ability. It could lead to the establishment of standard oxygen desaturation levels for screening and diagnosis of moderate/severe OSA, thus providing a more credible comparison basis for automated detection algorithms or even clinical tests.

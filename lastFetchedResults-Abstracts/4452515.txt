System time or system cost is often used as criteria of assignment when concerning system assignment criteria in a multi-user multi-mode transportation network. In other instances, generalized system time or generalized system cost is used. However, it is more meaningful to use bi-criteria to describe userÂ´s choice behavior. This article considers both criteria of system assignment, using multi-objectives theories to establish a multi-user multi-mode bi-criteria system assignment model and introduces bi-objective minimization problem. Using &#949; - constraint to solve the problem and investigate the gap between bi-criteria system optimization and single-criteria system optimization.

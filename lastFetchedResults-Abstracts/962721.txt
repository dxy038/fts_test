Using a simple random sampling, out of 98 residents, 12 attending who were enrolled in the study. Data collection was done by questionnaire and interviewing forms. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. 

  Results: In the residents view in six items which were assessed in the questionnaire, taking history, physical presence of the residents, clinical analysis and on time presence on the bedside were the highest items evaluated. From the attending point views taking history, timely presence of the residents, diagnosis methods and exact physical exams were the most items being evaluated respectively. There were significant differences between evaluated universities on the items such as timely presence on the bedsides and following cost effective treatments and patient's care.

The objective of the paper is to apply singularity theory to stability robustness analysis. Instead of using the mapping theorem of Zadeh and Desoer, singularity, open covering and the Jordan curve theorem of topology are used as major tools for stability margin computation. It is shown that singularity theory and differential topology are useful to understand the discontinuity phenomenon of real robustness margin problems

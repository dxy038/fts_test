Different cytokines have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). The frequencies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD4+CD25+ Forkhead Box Protein (FoxP)3+ T cells, interleukin (IL)-6, interferon (IFN)-γ, Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and IL-10 were assessed in HIV-negative, pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients (n = 30) and in healthy controls (n = 23) in Gabon. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated with purified protein derivative (PPD) and early secretory antigenic target-6 (ESAT-6). In patients, a pronounced pro-inflammatory cytokine response with highly significant increased levels of IL-6 and TNF-α accompanied by increased TGF-β was detectable. Differences in IFN-γ responses between patients and healthy individuals were less pronounced than expected. FoxP3 expression did not differ between groups. A distinct cytokine pattern is associated with active pulmonary TB in patients from Central Africa.

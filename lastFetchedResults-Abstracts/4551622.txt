In this paper, a structure composed by a wideband dual polarized antenna, a filter for harmonic suppression, a matching circuit and a band-notch filter, is presented. This complete structure is called a versatile intricate antenna because, on one hand, functions that are typically outside the antenna have been integrated into the radiating part, and on the other hand, the antenna provides two orthogonal linear polarizations over a wide frequency bandwidth. The objective of this communication is to focus on a comparison between three different shapes of slots for the band-rejection filter. The better band-notch function is obtained by utilizing of a V-shaped slot. This band-notch corresponds to the WiMAX band around 3.5 GHz. The peak gain is reduced of about 6.5 dB at 3.5 GHz.

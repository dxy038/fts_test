This paper presents a fuzzy-logic approach to the energy management of an embedded fuel-cell system. The main objective is to study one of the most technological bolts to be overcome for embedded fuel-cell systems: Their energy optimization. To reach this aim, experimentally validated models of a low-power 5-kW proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell and its most power-hungry ancillary (the fuel-cell air-supply system) are described. All simulation results have been performed using Matlab/Simulink environment. Two fuzzy controllers will be proposed for both the internal air-supply control loop and for the whole-embedded energy-management strategy

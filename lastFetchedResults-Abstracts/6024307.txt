The determination of backscattering coefficients is important to analyze echoes objective signals. To describe a rough sea surface naturally, a non-fully developed full-range sea spectrum (NDFSS) is reconstructed, and a fractal sea model based on NDFSS is presented. Based on the conventional two-scale model for backscattering coefficients, a complementary term is added for considering the skewness of sea waves. The additional part is proportional to the surface bispecctrum and it is a critical part in explaining the scattering difference between upwind and downwind observations. The numerical results show this modified model is consistent with the real radar data.

This paper focuses on a three-level pulse width modulation (PWM) rectifier with direct power control (DPC) strategy based on switching table. The influences of power control coupling on system performances are analyzed and an optimized three-level DPC strategy is developed. The proposed three-level DPC changes the selection of control vectors dynamically according to the location of grid voltage vector and the transmission direction of active power, maintains the bidirectional control of reactive power, and therefore eliminates the power control coupling effectively. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method improves the steady-state performance of three-level DPC remarkably.

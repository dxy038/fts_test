  Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed in 2012-2013. Medicine, dentistry, nursing and paramedical students were selected based on their filed of study and gender by stratified random sampling from the Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences (n = 370). Data gathering tool was a Course Experience Questionnaire (CEQ). The questionnaire fields included good teaching, clear and standards goals, appropriate assessment, workload, and general skills; one question about satisfaction of course was used to measure their course experience. Students’ grade point average (GPA) in previous semesters was used as an index for academic achievement. 

  Results: 31.8% of participants were boys and the rest (68.2%) were girls. Statically significant difference existed between GPA of boys and girls (P = 0.001). Nursing-midwifery students had the highest score (15.23 ± 3.30) in five course experience variables and medical students the lowest (14.06 ± 4.35) (P = 0.001). CEQ and GPA had significant and positive correlation (P = 0.004, r = 0.164). Predictor factors of GPA were clear and standard goals and appropriate assessment. 

  Conclusion: This study represents the importance of appropriate assessment ( particular emphasis on understanding until know something from memory) and of clear and standards goals at the beginning of the semester by teachers to promote academic achievement and performance of students.

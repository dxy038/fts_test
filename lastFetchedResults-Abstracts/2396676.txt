The bidirectional photometric properties of the surface of Mars describe how remote measurements of surface reflectance can be linked to hemispherical albedo used for energy balance calculations. A simple Lambert's law is frequently assumed for global data processing, even though several local studies have revealed the complexity of Mars surface phase functions. In this paper, we derive a mean Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) representative of widespread typical Martian terrains. OMEGA and CRISM orbital observations are used to provide observational constraints at solar wavelengths over a wide range of viewing conditions all over the planet. Atmospheric contribution is quantified and removed using a radiative transfer model. We observe a common phase behavior consisting of a 5%–10% backscattering peak and, outside the backscattering region, a 10%–20% reflectance increase with emergence angles. Consequently, nadir measurements of surface reflectance typically underestimate hemispherical reflectance, or albedo, by 10%. We provide a parameterization of our mean Mars surface phase function based on Hapke formalism (ω=0.85, θ=17, c=0.6, b=0.12, B0=1 and h=0.05), and quantify the impact of the diffuse illumination conditions which change surface albedo as a function of local time and season. Our average phase function can be used as a refinement compared to the Lambertian surface model in global data processing and climate modeling.

Contact dermatitis is frequent skin pathology and eyelids are one of the more frequent locations of this pathology. The objective of the present work was to study the population distribution of periocular dermatitis, determine the allergens which most frequently indicate positive in patch tests and in provocative use tests, and analyse the clinical relevance of the positive tests.
Patients with periocular dermatitis (N=93) underwent a thorough physical examination and a patch test with standard series. According to clinical suspicions, 76 patients underwent a patch test with specific series. Finally a provocative use test was done for 36 patients with suspected  products  that  the  patients  brought.  The  tests  were classified according their relevance.
The most  frequently observed allergen in the  patch tests (with standard and specific series) was nickel followed by mercury, and anti-glaucoma drops in the provocative use tests with patients products.
Patients’ sex, age, occupation, clinical status, presence of associated periocular symptoms, and presence of atopic or seborrheic dermatitis and/or rosacea did not relate with relevance.
We conclude that  a clinical diagnosis may not  always be made with patch tests with standard and specific series due to lack of relevance. It is important to do provocative use tests with the products suspected as allergens in those cases where patch tests with standard and specific series indicated positive for more than one allergen.

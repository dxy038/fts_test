Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence of fear and anxiety in patients awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting and the factors associated with high fear and high anxiety. Design: The survery included 240 patients placed on the waiting list for coronary artery bypass grafting at one hospital. Subjects: Two hundred and seven patients completed the questionnaire. Instruments: The Bypass Grafting Fear Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were used. Results: Half of the patients experienced low fear and anxiety. Twenty-five percent had high fear, but only 5% had high anxiety. Patients who felt high fear were mainly women, had no vocational education, were on sick leave, were depressed, had a tendency towards anxiety, and had a short wait for operation. Patients who displayed medium or high anxiety were mostly under 55 years of age and had depression, but only low or no pain. Conclusions: The results facilitate better identification of predictors of high fear and anxiety as well as direct support and information for those patients. (Heart LungÂ® 2001;30:302-11.)

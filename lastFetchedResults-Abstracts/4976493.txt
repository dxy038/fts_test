This paper presents the investigation of a new solution whose purpose is to obtain a much shorter time domain response between two narrow-band transducers than the one which is produced by a short reference driving pulse (SRP). It is based on generating a new driving signal made up of an appropriate weighted series of SRP which will produce the desired objective time response (OTR). Concretely, the SRP time response of our targeted application is determined and the OTR is selected from it. Finally, the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion is applied to compute the weights of the new driving signal. Complete series of practical tests with different kinds of transducers operating in varied conditions have confirmed the theoretical results

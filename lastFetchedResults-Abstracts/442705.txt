Background
Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is becoming a promising alternative with many potential advantages, but this procedure is still under study. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of the laparoscopic approach to ventral hernia repair.
Methods

One hundred consecutive laparoscopic ventral hernia repairs between April 2000 and February 2003 were prospectively entered into a database and reviewed.
Results

Ninety-seven ventral hernia repairs were completed laparoscopically. The mean time in the operating room was 128 minutes (range 37 to 255). The average length of stay was 2 days (range 0 to 9). The mortality rate was 0%. A total of 23% of patients experienced postoperative complications. Over a mean follow-up period of 3 months (range 0 to 26), 6% (6 of 97) of patients experienced recurrences.
Conclusions

Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair can be safely performed with a low conversion rate and acceptable recurrence rate, operative time, length of stay, and morbidity. Securing the mesh with full-thickness abdominal wall sutures in at least 4 quadrants remains a key factor in preventing early recurrence.

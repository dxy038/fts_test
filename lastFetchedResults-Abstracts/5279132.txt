This paper presents a new three-port dc-dc high voltage gain boost converter based on the bidirectional version of the three-state switching cell for battery charging using photovoltaic (PV) modules in a single conversion stage. The presented converter is able to supply a 200-V dc link using a battery bank and a PV array and, depending on the solar irradiance level, it is also possible to charge the batteries by using a single-stage approach. Moreover, all switches of the converter are able to operate under zero voltage switching (ZVS) condition over a wide operation range. The static gain and experimental results on a 500-W laboratory prototype are presented in order to support the theoretical assumptions.

This paper describes an intelligent energy-efficient street lighting system based on solid-state LED technology. The system integrates wireless networking sub-systems to enable its use as a cost-effective access point for mobile traffic offload and for enhancing remote operational visibility to municipal field staff. We also discuss a new deployment approach that can help Urban Local Bodies to join forces with mobile operators and significantly reduce their upfront investments for LED rollouts while advancing the operatorsÂ´ objective of cost-effectively expanding mobile broadband coverage.

Enhancement of the potential root growth volume is the main objective of farmers when they establish a conventional tillage system. Therefore, the main function of primary tillage is to increase soil’s structural macroporosity. In spite of this, during secondary tillage operations on these freshly tilled soils, the traffic on seedbeds causes significant increases in soil compaction. The aim of this paper was to quantify soil compaction induced by tractor traffic on a recently tilled non consolidated soil, to match ballast and tyre size on the tractors used during secondary tillage. The work was performed in the South of the Rolling Pampa region, Argentina. Secondary tillage traffic was simulated by one pass of a conventional 2WD tractor, using four configurations of bias-ply rear tyres: 18.4×34, 23.1×30, 18.4×38 and 18.4×38 duals, two ballast conditions were used in each configuration. Soil bulk density and cone index in a 0 to 600 mm profile were measured before and after traffic. Topsoil compaction increased as did ground pressure. Subsoil compaction increased as total axle load increased and was independent from ground pressure. At heavy conditions, topsoil levels always showed higher cone index values. From 150 to 450 mm depth, the same tendency was found, but with smaller increases in the cone index parameter, 22 to 48%, averaging 35%. Finally, at the deepest layer considered, 600 mm, differential increases due to the axle load are great enough as to be considered similar to those found in the upper horizon, 36 to 64%, averaging 55%. On the other hand, bulk density tended to be less responsive than cone index to the traffic treatments. Topsoil compaction can be reduced by matching conventional bias-ply tyres with an optimized axle weight.

Objective
The study assessed the adequacy of nutrition support in critically ill infants and children and identifies barriers impeding the delivery of estimated energy requirement (EER).
Methods
Forty-two children (median age, 6.6 mo; range, 0–198) who were admitted to a tertiary-level pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) were studied prospectively over a 6-mo period. Patients staying in the PICU longer than a full 3 d and who received enteral or a combination of enteral and parenteral nutrition were eligible for inclusion. Patients were assigned to one of two groups: patients after cardiac surgery (n = 18) and all other diagnoses (n = 24). EERs were compared with actual energy intake, and clinical information was collected throughout the PICU admission.
Results
Patients in the PICU received a median of 37.7% (range, 0.2–130.2%) of their EERs. The cardiac group achieved significantly lower energy intakes than did the non-cardiac group (P = 0.02). Only 22 of 42 patients (52%) achieved full EERs at any time during their admission, and this was more likely in non-cardiac patients (67% versus 33%, P = 0.03) Children undergoing cardiac surgery had a significant fall in weight-for-age Z scores (WAZ) from PICU admission to discharge (median WAZ, −1.44 versus −2.14; P < 0.001). In both groups, the major barrier to achieving EER was fluid volume restriction. Interruption of feeding for procedures and feeding intolerance reduced energy intake to a lesser degree.
Conclusions
This study highlights the inadequacy of nutrition support in critically ill children in the PICU. Restriction of fluid intake was the main barrier to the delivery of adequate nutrition, particularly in infants undergoing cardiac surgery

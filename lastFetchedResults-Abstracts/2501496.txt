Objective: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?) is a member of the
PPAR nuclear receptor superfamily. Although PPAR? acts as a master transcription factor
in adipocyte differentiation, it is also associated with a variety of cell functions including
carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, cell proliferation and cell differentiation.
This study aimed to assess the expression level of PPAR? in order to address its
role in cardiac cell differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs).
Materials and Methods: In this an intervening study, mESCs were subjected to cardiac differentiation.
Total RNA was extracted from the cells and quantitative real time polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR) was carried out to estimate level of gene expression. Furthermore, the requirement
of PPAR? in cardiac differentiation of mESCs, during cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs)
formation, was examined by applying the respective agonist and antagonist.
Results: The obtained data revealed an elevation in the expression level of PPAR? during
spontaneous formation of CPCs and cardiomyocytes. Our results indicated that during
CPC formation, PPAR? inactivation via treatment with GW9662 (GW) reduced expression
of CPC and cardiac markers.
Conclusion: We conclude that PPAR? modulation has an effective role on cardiac differentiation
of mESCs at the early stage of cardiomyogenesis.

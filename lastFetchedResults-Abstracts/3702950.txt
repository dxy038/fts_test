No theory or analysis, only some very general conclusions of a case study are presented here. The subject seems appropriate at this time since it covers the objective-setting of a large industrial firm, with particular emphasis on large-scale plant control systems. Three of the authors represent three distinct functional units of a steel company, i.e., planning and engineering, production, and research and development. The objectives are defined in terms of the functions of their respective departments. This paper should provoke thoughts and questions and be helpful to others in setting overall objectives for control systems in a large corporation.

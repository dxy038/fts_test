Personnel risk is an issue which has not been researched well but plays an important role to determine whether a software project succeeds or fails. Most existing research workfocuses on subjective expertise while an objective view is lacking. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the demand for an automatic tool to support risk management has not been answered yet. In this research, based on objective historical data, we extend our earlier model, cability- based scheduling framework, by including risk analysis. Hence we provide a novel approach to mitigate personnel risks while achieving a project schedule with minimum cost.

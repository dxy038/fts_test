Objective: The purpose of this work was to compare DNA damage, acetylcholinesterase
(AChE) activity, inflammatory markers and clinical symptoms in farmers exposed to organophosphorus
pesticides to individuals that had no pesticide exposure.
Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with a total of 134
people. The subject group consisted of 67 farmers who were exposed to organophosphorus
pesticides. The control group consisted of 67 people without any contact with
pesticides matched with the subject group in terms of age, gender, and didactics.
Oxidative DNA damage, the activities of AChE, interleukin-6 (IL6), IL10 and C-reactive
protein (CRP) in serum were measured and clinical examinations conducted in order
to register all clinical signs.
Results: Compared with the control group, substantial gains were observed in the farmersâ€™
levels of oxidative DNA damage, IL10 and CRP. There was significantly less AChE
activity in farmers exposed to organophosphorus pesticides. The levels of IL6 in both
groups did not significantly differ.
Conclusion: The outcomes show that exposure to organophosphorus pesticides may
cause DNA oxidative damage, inhibit AChE activity and increase the serum levels of inflammatory
markers. Using biological materials instead of chemical pesticides and encouraging
the use of safety equipment by farmers are some solutions to the adverse
effects of exposure to organophosphorous pesticides.

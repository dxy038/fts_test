The objective of this retrospective study is to describe a surgical technique to correct large, recurrent, incisional hernias in horses using a polypropylene mesh. The study sample included 15 horses with large hernias (range, 16âˆ’43 cm in length) developed after failure of previous abdominal closure. A double-layer polypropylene mesh was inserted between the internal rectus abdominis muscle sheath and peritoneum. Wound healing was assessed using clinical and ultrasonographic examinations. During a follow-up period of 6 months, no major complications related to the surgical procedure were observed. Subfascial retroperitoneal insertion of a double-layer polypropylene mesh is a valuable treatment option in cases of large and complicated incisional hernias in horses.

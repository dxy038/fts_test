A compiler for a Pascal-based language Actus is described. The language is suitable for the expression of the type of parallelism offered by both array and vector processors. The implementation described is for the Cray-1 computer. An objective of the implementation has been to construct an optimizing compiler which can be readily adapted for a range of array and vector processors. As a result the machine-dependent sections of the compiler have been clearly identified.

Glare should be eliminated because it is one of the main causes of errors, fatigue, and accidents in the working environment. The objective of this study was to develop a chart showing the distribution of glare sensation over the entire visual field. The experiments were conducted using a glare tester. The luminance of the borderline between comfort and discomfort (BCD) was measured at sixteen radial angles from a horizontal line in the visual field. The kinetic method was used to take the measurements. Three types of tests were carried out. The first test was conducted to determine the average visual field. The second test determined the BCD luminance at the line of sight. The third test was used to draw four equal glare sensitivity curves, which show the distribution of glare sensation over the entire visual field. Based on the findings of this research, a distribution chart of glare sensation over the visual field was developed. The chart can be used as data to control discomfort glare coming from lighting in indoor work places.

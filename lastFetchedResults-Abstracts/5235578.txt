In studies of a new coupling system with two bidirectional negative resistance transistor (BNRT) oscillators, the authors give its dynamic equation by a piecewise linear dynamic version. By analyzing its synchronous relaxation wave feature, the frequency demultiplicated distribution is drawn in 3D parameter space and a general fractional phase-locking formula is derived. An analysis of the nonlinear phenomenon based on the geometry in the parameter plane and a synchronous sharp corner model is presented. The frequency demultiplicated ratio for any condition can be easily obtained. Experimental results agree well with the computed ones by using this method

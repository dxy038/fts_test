Objective: To determine the type, incidence, and risk factors for complication with the intra-aortic balloon pump. Design: Descriptive, chart review. Setting: Midwestern community teaching hospital. Patients: Two hundred eighty-three patients with 287 intra-aortic balloon pump insertions from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1994. Outcome Measures: Complications of therapy. Results: Seventeen percent of balloon insertions resulted in minor complications, and 14 patients had major complications. Polychotomous logistic regression was used to determine which study risk factors were predictive of the development of minor or major complications in patients. Patients with longer balloon duration had an increased risk of a major complication; whereas smokers and patients with lower body mass index had an increased probability of the development of a minor complication.

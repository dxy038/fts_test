Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether second-trimester plasma homocysteine levels are elevated among women whose pregnancies are subsequently complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, or intrauterine growth restriction. Study Design: Women with normal but relatively low plasma zinc levels were randomly assigned to receive zinc supplementation or placebo from 19 weeks’ gestation until delivery. Plasma homocysteine concentration and plasma and erythrocyte folate levels were determined for all available stored samples (zinc group, 231/294; placebo group, 206/286) at 26 and 37 weeks’ gestation. Among all women with available samples, pregnancy-induced hypertension (n = 12) or preeclampsia (n = 4) developed in 16 women, and 22 pregnancies were complicated by intrauterine growth restriction. Results: Mean homocysteine levels in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia were similar to those of control subjects at 26 weeks’ gestation but were significantly higher at 37 weeks’ gestation. Homocysteine levels were similar between women with pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth restriction and control subjects at both time points. Conclusion: Second-trimester plasma homocysteine concentrations do not predict the subsequent development of pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction.

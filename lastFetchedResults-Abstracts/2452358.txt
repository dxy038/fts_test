The main objective of DEMO design activity under the Broader Approach is to develop pre-conceptual design of DEMO options by addressing key design issues on physics, technology and system engineering. This paper describes the latest results of the design activity, including DEMO parameter study, divertor and remote maintenance. DEMO parameter study has recently started with “pulsed” DEMO having a major radius (Rp) of 9 m, and “steady state” DEMO of Rp = 8.2 m or more. Divertor design study has focused on a computer simulation of fully detached plasma under DEMO divertor conditions and the assessment of advanced divertor configuration such as super-X. Comparative study of various maintenance schemes for DEMO and narrowing down the schemes is in progress.

Genetic algorithms have been successfully applied in the area of software testing. The demand for automation of test case generation in object oriented software testing is increasing. Genetic algorithms are well applied in procedural software testing but a little has been done in testing of object oriented software. In this paper, we propose a method to generate test cases for classes in object oriented software using a genetic programming approach. This method uses tree representation of statements in test cases. Strategies for encoding the test cases and using the objective function to evolve them as suitable test case are proposed.

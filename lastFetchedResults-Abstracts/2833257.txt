One of the objectives of the present study is to develop a way of scheduling management between ZigBee communication and intermittent microwave power transmission, which is compatible with the wireless sensor network. The other objective is also development of a RF-DC rectifier circuit of which RF-DC conversion efficiency is high in the range of impedance which cover 140 &#937; and 1.5 K&#937;. We confirmed that the developed algorithm of the transmission scheduling allowed a ZigBee device to communicate robustly. We also found out that a RF-DC rectifier circuit with a slave rectifier operated with high efficiency in the wide range of output load because the slave circuit rectified the reflection from the master circuit. Finally we demonstrated that the ZigBee device worked and communicated correctly without a battery by intermittent microwave power transmission with the transmission scheduling.

In this research, stacking sequences of hybrid composites composed of aluminum plate and carbon/epoxy laminate under explosion loading have been optimized and analyzed. First, the effect of explosion wave on the stress, deflection field, and Tsai-Wu criteria has been investigated. Then, by using finite element modeling for these laminates and Response Surface Method (RSM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), objective functions have been determined and the stacking sequences of aluminum plate and carbon/epoxy laminate were optimized. Results of this study show that change of the stacking layups can increase the resistance of FML for preventing the explosion effects as well as, providing maximum safety factor and minimum deflection.

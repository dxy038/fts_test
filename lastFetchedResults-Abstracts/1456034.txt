The objective of this study is to investigate the distribution of products, i.e. liquid, gas and solid from wood (sawdust) and non-wood biomass (rice husk), and major biomass components, i.e. lignin, cellulose produced by hydrothermal treatment (280 °C for 15 min) and analysis of liquid hydrocarbons (oils) for the differences in the hydrocarbon composition with respect to feed material. Cellulose showed the highest conversion among the four samples investigated in the present study. Sawdust and rice husk has almost similar conversions. Liquid products were recovered with various solvents (ether, acetone, and ethyl acetate) and analyzed by GC–MS. The oil (ether extract) from the hydrothermal treatment of cellulose consisted of furan derivatives whereas lignin-derived oil contained phenolic compounds. The compositions of oils (ether extract) from sawdust and rice husk contained both phenolic compounds and furans, however phenolic compounds were dominant. Rice husk derived oil consists of more benzenediols than sawdust derived oil. The volatility distribution of oxygenated hydrocarbons were carried out by C-NP gram and it showed that the majority of oxygenated hydrocarbons from sawdust, rice husk and lignin were distributed at n-C11, whereas they were distributed at n-C8 and n-C10 in cellulose-derived oil. The gaseous products were carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane in sawdust, rice husk, lignin and cellulose. In addition to this, ethylene, ethane and propane were observed for sawdust, rice husk and lignin. The major gas product was carbon dioxide for all samples.

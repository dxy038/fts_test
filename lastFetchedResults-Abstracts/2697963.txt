There is no doubt nowadays that Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is the dominant technology in the area of mobile wireless access. The objective of this work is to analyze and compare the performance and spectral efficiency of 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) and mobile Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX). Both technologies (based in OFDM) are the dominant options to provide mobile broadband access today, and in the near future.

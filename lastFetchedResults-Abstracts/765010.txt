Background: Oxidative stress induces different diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, arteriosclerosis and Alzheimer. In this study, the antioxidant effect of hydroalcoholic extract of Salvia officinalis was investigated. 
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, isoniazid, as an anti tuberculosis agent, has been used to induce free radicals. Male rats were used and divided in 9 groups; in each group, 7 rats were included. Isoniazid with dose of 50 mg/kg was orally administered to rats continuously once per day for 28 days using a feeding atraumatic needle. The treated groups received hydroalcoholic extract of Salvia officinalis with the doses of 100, 250 and 400 mg/kg intraperitonally, and the effects of the extract and isoniazid on liver enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanin aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gama glutamyl transferase (GGT) were studied. 
Results: Serum levels of AST, ALT, ALP and GGT and also hepatic histopathologic observations indicated that the effective doses of Salvia officinalis extract were 100 and 250 mg/kg. 
Conclusion: This study showed that Salvia officinalis hydroalcoholic extract is potentially effective in the reduction of damages caused by oxidative stress.

Only capacitated sperm cells are able to fertilize egg cells, and this process is triggered by high levels of bicarbonate. Bicarbonate renders the plasma membrane more fluid, which is caused by protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated alterations in the phospholipid (PL) bilayer. We studied exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in human sperm cells. Surface exposure of PS and PE on sperm cell activation in vitro was found to be bicarbonate dependent and restricted to the apical area of the head plasma membrane. The PL scrambling in bicarbonate-triggered human sperm was not related to apoptosis, because the incubated cells did not show any signs of caspases or degeneration of mitochondria or DNA. The PL scramblase (PLSCR) gene family has been implicated in this nonspecific, bidirectional PL movement. A 25kDa isoform of PLSCR was identified that was homogeneously distributed in human sperm cells. We propose that compartment-dependent activation of PKA is required for the surface exposure of aminophospholipids at the apical plasma membrane of sperm cells. Bicarbonate-induced PL scrambling appears to be an important event in the capacitation process, because the entire intact scrambling sperm subpopulation showed extensive tyrosine phosphorylation, which was absent in the nonscrambling subpopulation. The proportion of live cells with PL scrambling corresponded with that showing capacitationspecific chlortetracyclin staining.

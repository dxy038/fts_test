Energy consumption in the residential sector represents a global average of around 30% of the total consumed in the country, so any measures that could help to reduce it, would have significant effects on the entire State. Thus, knowing the characteristics of consumption will provide important measures to reduce it, make more efficient the use of energy, and even set on advising for cheaper habits by focusing spending on slots where the fees may be lower. Residential electricity demand profile is highly correlated with timing of active occupancy. The objective of this study is to determine occupancy profiles in Spanish houses and some of its various regions, according to data from the Time Use Survey 2009-2010, conducted by the National Statistics Institute of Spain. With these data, it was implemented a model to generate artificial data and validate the occupation model achieved. The aim of this is to adopt strategies that could minimize energy consumption in the residential sector.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Varicocele is one of the infertility factors in men and has negative effects on sperm parameters. Using varicocelectomy that is the most effective method for treatment of varicocele, there will be significant improvement in sperm parameters. The purpose of this study was to survey sperm parameters before and after varicocelectomy and fertility rate after surgery.
METHODS: This interventional study was done on 118 infertile couples from 2003 to 2004 that referred with male factor and varicoceles disease to Fatemeh Zahra infertility center. The sperm parameters were compared before and after varicocelectomy and the pregnancy results were compared with each other.
FINDINGS: The type of varicoceles was unilateral in 72 persons (61%) and bilateral in 46 (39%). The mean number (±SD) of sperm reached from 42.3±26.9 millions before surgery to 48.4± 27.1 million after surgery. Also, sperm motility reached from 50.8±18 percent to 54.8±11.9 percent and round cells reached from 1.9±4.7 to 0.6±3.3 percent that this process is meaningful in each three cases (p<0.007). The mean normal morphology of sperms showed an increase after surgery but wasn't meaningful. After varicocelectomy, the rate of pregnancy was seen in 42% of persons that increased to 48,3% in persons who used different methods of ART.
CONCLtSION: According to the results of this study, varicocelectomy can increase sperm parameters. Also, with increasing normal sperm morphology, almost half of the operated persons experienced their fertility.

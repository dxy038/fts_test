The objective of this work is to assess some fundamental limits of operation for cognitive radios in a frequency- planned environment. We present a first-order analysis of the carrier-to-noise-and-interference situation in a cellular wireless network, and analyze the impact of cognitive users starting to transmit. The main conclusion is that introducing cognitive transmitters in a frequency-planned cellular network without causing substantial interference is very challenging.

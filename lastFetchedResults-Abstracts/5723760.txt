Collaborative editing is a subset of groupware system. Groupware or computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) application is "a computer-based system that supports groups of people engaged in a common task (or goal) and that provide an interface to a shared environment". This research area is also known as collaborative computing. Collaborative environment enables computer-based collaboration in wide-area network, static and dynamic resource sharing and instant or delayed feedback from collaborators. The objective of a collaborative environment is to allow coherent and consistent object sharing and manipulation by distributed users. Some examples of collaborative activities include desktop conferencing, cooperative document editing, cooperative designing and modeling. Consistency management mechanisms are needed to resolve conflicting actions performed by multiple users. Conflicting actions include simultaneous modification of shared data and out-of-order of data arrival and data execution due to communication delay.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine whether women with polycystic ovary syndrome have greater subclinical atherosclerosis as measured by carotid artery ultrasonography. STUDY DESIGN: Sixteen premenopausal women ≥40 years old with a history of clinical polycystic ovary syndrome and a current total testosterone concentration ≥2.0 nmol/L and 16 age-matched (±5 years) cycling women underwent carotid scanning. Intima-media thickness and plaque were compared between cases and controls, as were risk factors for atherosclerosis including body mass index and fasting insulin and lipid levels. Statistical analysis included t tests, Fisher's exact test, and multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Mean ± SE intima-media thickness was found to be significantly greater for cases with polycystic ovary syndrome (0.680 ± 0.019 mm) than for controls (0.630 ± 0.012 mm) (t = 2.31, p = 0.035). Five cases (31.3%) and two controls (12.5%) had ultrasonographic evidence of plaque (not significant). Univariate regressions of intima-media thickness yielded significant coefficients for insulin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and body mass index. When either total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein were included in the model simultaneously with polycystic ovary syndrome, each retained significance. This was not true for insulin and body mass index, however, suggesting that these factors covaried with polycystic ovary syndrome in a dimension affecting intima-media thickness. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of a major limitation of small sample size, these data suggest that women with polycystic ovary syndrome have an increased risk of subclinical atherosclerosis in their 40s.

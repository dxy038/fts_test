Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine whether age is a risk factor for perioperative and postoperative complications.
Study design
This was a retrospective case-control study of 120 women over age 79 (group 1) compared with 1,497 younger patients 50-79 (group 2) undergoing major elective gynecologic surgery.
Results
Mean length of stay was 4.8 days for group 1, compared with 3.8 for group 2 (P = .018). Patients hospitalized longer than 1 week was higher (P< .01) among group 1. There were statistically significant increases in UTI, psychiatric events, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, sepsis, and hypovolemic shock. No significant difference in mortality rate was noted (group 1: 0.83%, n = 1 vs group 2: 0.47%, n = 7).
Conclusion
Although length of stay for the elderly is slightly increased, mortality and complication rates are comparable to younger patients with few exceptions. We conclude that age need not be the sole determinant in the decision to undergo major elective gynecologic surgery.

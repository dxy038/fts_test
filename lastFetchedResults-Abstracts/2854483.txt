Protecting the information inside a memory is vital in any digital system. The target objective is to make the data unreadable because device specific attacks can occur at any time. We propose a novel security measure for protecting and securing the stored data from a memory system, by using random vectors for scrambling the information. The results show that data scrambling is possible in any kind of memory system, all with low area overhead, small delay penalty and low power consumption.

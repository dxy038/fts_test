The total information sharing for pilot situational awareness enhanced by intelligent systems, Phase 1 (TALIS 1) project was carried out from September 2001 until February 2004. The objective of the project was to investigate the viability and benefits of adopting an approach based on standardised architectures to provide for pilot situational awareness resulting in a safer and more efficient air traffic management process involving interactions between the ground and the air to bring benefits to the travelling public. This work provides a summary of its final report with a high-level technical overview of project results.

In this letter, a 100-m dispersion-flattened nonlinear microstructure fiber (MF) prepared by crystal fiber A/S was applied to obtain wide-band wavelength conversion using four-wave mixing. It is indicated that such converters with dispersion-flattened nonlinear PCFs are promising for wide-band wavelength conversion applications in all-optical networks. A bidirectional distributed Raman fiber amplifier with the 100-m MF was also demonstrated pumped by a CW Raman fiber laser with output wavelength of 1480 nm.

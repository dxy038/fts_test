The main objective for this research is to develop an antenna that can shift its frequency over a broadband. A coplanar waveguide (CPW) antenna was designed with the center conductor of the CPW transmission line connected to a bowtie patch. The size of the antenna is 6mm &#215; 6 mm. The antenna is tuned with a barium strontium titanate (BST) thin film varactor which can tune the device from 5.75 GHz to 6.1937 GHz by adjusting the DC bias from 0 to 10V.

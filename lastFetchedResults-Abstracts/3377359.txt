In this paper, a decomposition method is proposed which relates the unit ramping process to the cost of fatigue effect in the generation scheduling of thermal systems. The objective of this optimization problem is to minimize the system operation cost, which includes the fuel cost for generating the required electrical energy and starting up decommitted units, as well as the rotor depreciation during ramping processes, such as starting up, shutting down, loading, and unloading. According to the unit fatigue index curves provided by generator manufacturers, fixed unit ramping-rate limits, which have been used by previous studies, do not reflect the physical changes of generator rotors during the ramping processes due to the fatigue effect. By introducing ramping costs, the unit on/offstates can be determined more economically by the proposed method. The Lagrangian relaxation method is proposed for unit commitment and economic dispatch, in which the original problem is decomposed into several subproblems corresponding to the optimization process of individual units. The network model is employed to represent the dynamic process of searching for the optimal commitment and generation schedules of a unit over the entire study time span. The experimental results for a practical system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in optimizing the power system generation schedule

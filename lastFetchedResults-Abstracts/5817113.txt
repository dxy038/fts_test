Quality of Experience (QoE) is the key criteria for evaluating the Media Services. Unlike objective Quality of Service (QoS) metrics, QoE is more accurate to reflect the user experience as it considers human visual system and its complex behavior towards distortions in the displayed video sequence. In this paper, we present a new QoE tool solution, named ALICANTE Pseudo Subjective Quality Assessment (A_PSQA). It relies on a No-Reference QoE measuring approach, hybrid between subjective and objective methods fully functional in Future Media Internet context. To validate this approach, we deployed a video streaming platform, and considered different video sequences having different characteristics (low/high motion, quality, etc.). We then compared the results of A_PSQA with two Full-References methods (SSIM and PSNR) and two No-References approaches. Obtained results demonstrate that A_PSQA shows a higher correlation with subjective quality ratings (MOS) than all others methods.

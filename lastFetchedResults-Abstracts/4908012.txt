This paper proposed a new objective video quality metric for multimedia videos based on a different perspective. We extended one existing image quality assessment metric to a video quality metric by considering temporal information and converted it into some compensation factor to correct the video quality score obtained in the spatial domain. After some experiments, we find out this proposed quality assessment metric does work well in the Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering (LIVE) Video Quality Database and is also competitive with the other existing state-of-the-art video quality assessment methods.

We present two different measurement techniques intended for closed metal vessels, where the objective is to measure the permittivity inside the metal vessel. This problem is relevant for many applications found in e.g. process industry. The first approach exploits the measurement of resonance frequencies, where the metal vessel is used as a microwave resonator. In the second approach, we let the boundary of the metal vessel be equipped with aperture antennas, where the aperture antennas are implemented in terms of rectangular waveguides. The waveguide apertures loads the cavity significantly and we exploit the scattering matrix parameters for the solution of the inverse problem.

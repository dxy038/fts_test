A novel method for the cancellation of broadband noise is analyzed and presented. This method differs from other established techniques since it relies on a psychoacoustic representation of the noisy signal and it is shown that audible noise cancellation can be achieved using optimum filters. These filters affect only the audible noise, thus do not distort the underlying audio signal and in this way they achieve superior performance to existing methods as is indicated by objective tests. A number of audio demonstrations illustrate the performance of the proposed method in comparison to existing methods

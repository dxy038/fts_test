Most of ad-hoc network features encourage self- management. This paper introduces security solutions for ad-hoc networks, taking into consideration their need for an autonomic nature. After defining autonomic networks, we present the MAutoNet (mobile autonomic network) which is our specific type of ad-hoc networks. Our general objective is to build an autonomic security system for MAutoNets. We introduce here a security-based network structure, according to which such system can control a MAutoNet. We then elaborate a relevant access control model that we call SRBAC (secure-relation-based access control). It is a variant of RBAC enhanced with trust management, which is required in autonomic communications.

Deals with the implementation of an efficient walking pattern for quadruped robots. The main objective is to give the robot the ability to walk in every direction as quickly as possible. Not only forward motion, but also backward motion, turning gaits of variable curvature including rotation around the body platform center of gravity (COG) are considered separately. For this purpose the well known crawl gait with duty factor of &#190; represents the starting point of the experimental study. From this point the regular symmetric gait is improved thanks to sideways motion, turning gaits are adapted from the forward crawl gait and a special rotation motion is designed. All transitions between forward, backward, left and right turning and rotation motions are detailed. Experiments have been carried out using the Sony quadruped &#8220;pet robot&#8221; prototype which look part in the Paris Robocup-98 legged robot exhibition

Objective (s): Consumption of omega-3 fatty acids can alter the inflammatory response in diabetic patients, which may enhance the benefits of aerobic training. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 8 weeks aerobic training with omega-3 supplementation on inflammatory and metabolic syndrome parameters in type 2 diabetic patients.
Methods: In this semi-experimental study with pretest–posttest design, thirty diabetic patients (aged 48.58±7.4 y) were randomly assigned to omega-3 supplementation only (2000 mg/d), omega-3 supplementation plus aerobic training or non-exercising control groups. Aerobic training program was performed 50-60 min/d, 3d/wk, for 2 months. Serum levels of CRP, TNF-? and IL-1, body composition and metabolic parameters were assessed before and after the training period. 
Results: The data analysis showed that omega-3 supplementation in conjunction with aerobic training lead to greater improvements in adiposity indices (p=0.03), total cholesterol (p=0.03), and triglyceride (p=0.03). Inter-group comparison (among the 3 groups) showed that there were no significant differences with regard to CRP (p=0.27), TNF-? (p=0.15) and IL-1 (p=0.12).
Conclusion: The results suggest that aerobic training and omega-3 supplementation can have beneficial effects on metabolic indices over a two-month period. Based on the results a daily consumption of omega-3 and aerobic training is suggested for patients with type 2 diabetes.

Electromyography (EMG) provides an in vivo quantitative measure of the musculoskeletal system. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of epoch duration on the estimated EMG parameters in both time and frequency domains. The results obtained showed that the window size has no significant effect on the EMG estimated parameters in the time domain. On the other hand, window size has a significant effect on the estimated characteristic frequencies of the power spectrum. The load was found to have significant effects on all EMG parameters used in this study.

The objective of the experiment was to evaluate the impact of laser stimulation on crural ulceration healing.

groups were established at random from patients with crural ulceration: A, B and C. Group A included 21 patients, group B included 22 patients and group C, 22 patients. Patients in all groups were treated with pharmaceuticals and with compressive therapy. The ulcers in group A were additionally irradiated with laser light of wavelength 810 nm, so that a dose of 4 J/cm2 was applied in each procedure. Patients in group B were additionally subjected to a blind test (with placebo in the form of quasi-laser therapy).

 end of the treatment a statistically significant reduction of the area and volume of the ulcers was found in all groups. No statistically significant difference was found between the groups in terms of average rate of change per week of the relative area of ulceration and average rate of change per week of the relative volume of ulceration. Reduction of infected area was observed in all groups, but a significant change was only observed in group C.

nificant impact of laser light (Î»=810 nm, P=65 mW, p=4 J/cm2) on any of the stages of ulceration healing was observed.

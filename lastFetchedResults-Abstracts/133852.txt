BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Morphine causes disorders in testis and fertilization in animals. On the other hand they have shown important role of glycoconjugates in spermatogenesis. Lectins can detect glycoconjugates with specific terminal sugars. This study was conducted to assess possible effects of morphine on testicular glycoconjugates. METHODS: One hundred and two BALB/c male mice (2-4 months) were assigned in three groups. One group received morphine, second treated with normal saline and third remained intact. After preparing paraffin blocks from testes, 51.tm sections were obtained and incubated with different lectins by means of lectin histochemistry. Testicular cells reactions were assessed and graded with light microscope. Then results analyzed by variance test.
FINDINGS: Statistical test showed that there was a significant difference (p<0.05) in reaction to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), specific for sialic acid, between experimental and control groups. About other lectins, which were employed for galactose, fucose and galactose- N acetyl galactosamine, there were no significant differences.
CONCLUSION: Changing in reaction to WGA in significant reduction form in morphine treated samples, means sialic acid content reduction. Considering sialic acid importance in spermatogenesis, we can predict that adverse changes in spermatogenesis and reduction in fertilization rate due to sialic acid deficiency was resulted by morphine administration.

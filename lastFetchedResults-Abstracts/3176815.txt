In many designed experimental situations, several responses are considered simultaneously. Compared with much research work on how to simultaneously optimize multiple responses based on certain criteria or objective functions, little research has been done on how robust the optimum solution is. Generalized distance function approach is one of the most popular methods for the multiresponse optimization problem. However, the consideration of robustness is usually ignored in this method. This paper presents a robust generalized distance function for the multiresponse robust optimization. And its practical application is illustrated with an example. The proposed robust generalized distance function gives more robust optimal result.

Inroduction & Objective: Sardines and other microfilidae have very important ecological role in marine ecosystems because they  are first consumers in marine food chain and they are the main food of valuable species as tuna. So decries in their population will decline fishing of these spices. There are 10 genus of Cloupeidae in south of Iran and Sardinella sindensis is the  one of the most abundant of  them. In this study we investigated about morphological differences in population of this species.
Materials and Methods: About 63 specimens from three regions of its distribution: Jask (Oman sea), Qeshm ( Hormoz ) and Lengeh (Pearsian golf) have been collected. Morphological  research of their characters  and statistical studies were done with One-way ANOVA and MANOVA. 
Results: Statistical studies show a meaningful morphological difference between characters and also a cline from Lengeh to Jask port which might be a result of  creation of subpopulation in this fish. Post- hoc analysis show that in all characters jask has a meaningful different with gheshm and lengeh. On the base of Perinciple component  TL, FL,StL, BD and SL play more important role in  diversity in 3 region.Regarding to claster analysis we unrestood that the population of 3 region are seprated from the each other.
Conclusion: Such a situation might be result of Monsoon, Upwelling and better weather which occur in Oman Sea in spite of  Persion golf . So this might be an aspect of  creation of sub population in Sardinella sindensis in Persian golf and Oman Sea.

In this research, a new control policy for the acceptance sampling problem is introduced. Decision is made based on the number of defectives items in an inspected batch. The objective of the model is to find a constant control level that minimizes the total costs, including the cost of rejecting the batch, the cost of inspection and the cost of defective items. The optimization is performed by approximating the negative binomial distribution with Poisson distribution and using the properties of binomial distribution. A solution method along with numerical demonstration on the application of the proposed methodology is presented. Furthermore, the results of sensitivity analysis show that the proposed method needs a large sample size.

In this paper, we developed an optimal dispatching model of Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS) with distributed energy resources (DERs) and intelligent domestic appliances. In order to achieve multi-objective optimization between the saving money and living comfortable, we investigate the math models of various components and come up with the new concept &#8220;load value&#8221; for quantitative measure of usersÂ´ comfort. Then we set up the control strategies with demand response and adjust the parameters of optimal dispatching model by the load characteristic in this system. Applying this model to one house with Photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), storage battery and time-of-use prices, the simulation at the end of this paper proves that the energy management system and optimal dispatching model can make users of smart home live in a comfortable and economical way.

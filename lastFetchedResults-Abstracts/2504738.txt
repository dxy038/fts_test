Groundwater is one of the common resources in Varamin Plain, but due to over extraction it has
been exposed to ruin. This phenomenon will lead to economic and environmental problems. Also, the world is
expected to face with more stochastic events of water supply. Furthermore, incorporating stochastic
consideration of water supply becomes more acute in designing water facilities. Therefore, the strategies
should be applied to improve managing resources and increase the efficiency of irrigation system. Hence, in
this study the effect of efficiency improvement of irrigation system on the exploitation of groundwater and
cropping pattern is examined in deterministic and stochastic condition using Nash bargaining theory. The
results showed that farmers in B scenario are more willing to cooperate and as a result of their cooperation,
they lose only 3 percentages of their present value of the objective function. Therefore, the efficiency
improvement of irrigation system can result in improving the cooperation between farmers and increasing the
amount of reserves.

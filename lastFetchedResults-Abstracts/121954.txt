Background: The hands' grip strength and endurance have an important role in doing activities of daily living and different jobs.
Objective: The aim of this study was comparing the grip strength and endurance in typist and non-typist women in both dominant and non-dominant hands.
Methods: For better evaluation of subjects tested in special hour forms a day (between hour of 12-16). The number of subjects are 68 (35 typist and 33 nontypists). Evaluation of handgrip strength was carried out by dynamometer and handgrip endurance (time and number) was carried out by chronometer and rubber hand device.
Finding: In all subjects, grip strength in dominant and nondominant hands of typist subjects was lesser of nontypist subject and from a statistical results point, was observed significant difference (P<0.05). Grip endurance in dominant and nondominant hands of typist subjects was more than nontypist subjects group.
In all subjects of this study, grip strength and grip endurance in dominant hand was more than nondominant hand, and was observed significant difference (in dominant hand were grip strength, number of endurance and time of grip endurance alternative 4%, 4.5% and 2.5% more than nondominant hand).
Conclusion: The result indicant that, typist subjects as compared with nontypist subjects have less grip strength and more grip endurance.

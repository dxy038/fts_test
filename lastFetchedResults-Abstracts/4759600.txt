We investigate the survivable problem of wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks, and propose a joint optimal path selection algorithm (JOPS) to setup dependable connection for dynamic traffic in WDM networks. JOPS attempts to perform optimization on the path selection for each request by simultaneously finding a pair of link-disjoint paths, which act as the primary and the backup paths respectively. Its main objective is to achieve efficient resource utilization. Based on dynamic traffic with different load, the performance of JOPS has been examined against the traditional approaches via simulations. The results show that the scheme can improve the performance of the network significantly.

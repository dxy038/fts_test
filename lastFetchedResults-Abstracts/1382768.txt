This paper describes the acoustic program of the competition opened by the Town Council of Venice for the reconstruction of the “La Fenice” opera house after the fire which destroyed the threatre on 29 January 1996. The experience of the authors in the preparation of this document suggests the need of guidelines which establish a general agreement on the objective parameters and on the procedures to be introduced in the acoustic program of an architecture competition for the construction of a threatre.

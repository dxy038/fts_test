Gas lift is one of the most important operations to improve oil recovery in low production or non productive oil wells. Gas 
lift optimization includes design optimization such as optimum selection of injection depth and pressure and operation 
optimization such as gas lift allocation optimization or real time optimization Different algorithms are applicable for gas 
lift allocation optimization as the most important part of gas lift optimization. The optimization procedure is done by 
considering incremental oil revenue, gas lift cost and mainly compression cost. Many objective functions are applicable 
for gas lift optimization such as cost function, oil production function and added value. This problem can be solved in a 
limited or unlimited gas injected condition.
In this paper, we look at different steps to solve a gas lift allocation optimization problem including the effect of gas 
injection on oil production, concept of gas lift performance curve, objective function definition and solution methods. 
The most important algorithms to solve this problem are graphical algorithms, numerical optimization algorithms, usual 
algebraic algorithms and evolutionary algorithms. Although each of these methods with a good objective function can get 
a reliable solution, using algebraic algorithms and evolutionary algorithms are most common because of easy constraint 
application, higher degree of flexibility, accuracy in optimum solution and existence of different software

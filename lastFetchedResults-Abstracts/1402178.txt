The objective of this work is to develop manufacturing method of porous SiC ceramics with mechanical and chemical stability. The nanoinfiltration transient eutectic (NITE)-porous SiC ceramics were fabricated by decarburization of the hot-pressed NITE-SiC including carbon particles. Porosity could be controlled at less than Â±0.5% by the amount of carbon particles. The NITE-porous SiC ceramics exhibited a substantially high strength in comparison with other conventional porous SiC ceramics, due to its robust microstructure consisted of spherical pores.

This paper presents a no-snapback lateral double-diffused MOSFET (LDMOSFET), which endures the electrostatic discharge (ESD) requirement for automotive applications under the condition of 15 kV, 150 pF, and 150 &#937;, representing one order of magnitude higher ESD voltage than conventional LDMOS. First, the mixed (circuit and device) mode simulations analyze the typical ESD failure dynamics of the conventional LDMOSFET, correlating the circuit level transient responses and the device level snapback characteristics (i.e., the negative breakdown voltage-current (V-I) characteristics). Then, the mechanism of the snapback is clarified from the aspect of the feedback link between the turn-on of the parasitic bipolar junction transistor (BJT) and the breakdown of the drain n-n<sup>+</sup> diode. Finally, a no-snapback LDMOSFET is experimentally demonstrated that attains the objective ESD endurance.

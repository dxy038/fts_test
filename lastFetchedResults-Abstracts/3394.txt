A diabatic distillation model is improved and the effects of the allocation of a heat-exchanger inventory on the diabatic-distillation performance are taken into account. Minimizing the entropy-production rate of the diabatic distillation column is taken as the optimization objective and the allocations of the heat-exchanger inventory on each tray in the diabatic distillation column are optimally redistributed under the condition of the fixed total heat-exchanger inventory. The optimal performance of the diabatic distillation column is obtained. The diabatic distillation model is meaningful for the design and optimization of diabatic distillation plant.

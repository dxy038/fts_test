Objective: Lower pregnancy rates of in vitro matured oocytes compared to those of in
vivo stimulated cycles indicate that optimization of in vitro maturation (IVM) remains a
challenge. Reduced developmental competence of in vitro matured oocytes shows that
current culture systems for oocyte maturation do not adequately support nuclear and/or
cytoplasmic maturation. Therefore this study evaluates the effects of different concentrations
of saffron (Crocus sativus L.) aqueous extract (SAE), as an antioxidant agent on IVM
of immature mouse oocytes.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study ,cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs)
were collected from 6-8 weeks old novel medical research institute (NMRI) female mice
ovaries. COCs were cultured in IVM medium supplemented with 0 (control), 5, 10, 20 and
40 ?g/ml of SAE in 5% CO2 at 37°C. The rates of maturation, fertilization and development
were recorded. ANOVA and Duncan’s protected least significant test, using the SAS
program was applied for all statistical analysis.
Results: The maturation rate was significantly higher in all groups treated with different
concentrations of SAE compared with the control group (p < 0.05). However, the lower
concentrations of SAE (10 and 5 ?g/ml) in maturation medium respectively increased the
fertilization rate of oocytes and in vitro developmental competence when compared with
the control group (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that lower concentrations of SAE are more
appropriate to be added to maturation medium when compared with other experimental and
control groups. Generally, we conclude that addition of appropriate amounts of natural extracts
such as SAE to maturation medium improves oocyte maturation and embryo development.

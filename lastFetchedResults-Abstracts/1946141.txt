The main objective of this work was to investigate the biosorption performance of nonviable Penicillium YW 01 biomass for removal of Acid Black 172 metal-complex dye (AB) and Congo Red (CR) in solutions. Maximum biosorption capacities of 225.38 and 411.53 mg g−1 under initial dye concentration of 800 mg L−1, pH 3.0 and 40 °C conditions were observed for AB and CR, respectively. Biosorption data were successfully described with Langmuir isotherm and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The Weber-Morris model analysis indicated that intraparticle diffusion was the limiting step for biosorption of AB and CR onto biosorbent. Analysis based on the artificial neural network and genetic algorithms hybrid model indicated that initial dye concentration and temperature appeared to be the most influential parameters for biosorption process of AB and CR onto biosorbent, respectively. Characterization of the biosorbent and possible dye-biosorbent interaction were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy.

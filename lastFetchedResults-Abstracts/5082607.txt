Linear induction motors are used in various industries but the low efficiency and low power factor are their major problems. These two problems become more baneful in high power and high speed applications. For example in transport industry, they lead to high energy consumption and high input current that occupy transmission line capacity. Thus it is necessary to improve efficiency and power factor, furthermore, the decrease in weight, cause to lower cost and better performance of linear induction motors. In this paper two different multi objective functions are developed. One of these objective functions will improve power factor and efficiency and the other one will decrease the weight of the motor. This procedure is done by analytic method and using particle swarm optimization technique. In this paper a new equivalent circuit model has been used that include all of specific effects of single-sided linear induction motors. Results show the accuracy of the equivalent circuit model and the improvement of objective functions at the end of optimization procedure. Two-dimensional finite-element analysis evaluates the analytical result.

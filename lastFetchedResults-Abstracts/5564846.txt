The URE-Ocean/Marine Science program supports active research participation by undergraduate students in remote sensing and GIS. The program is based on a model for undergraduate research programs supported by the National Science Foundation. URE project features mentors, research projects, and professional development opportunities. It is the long-term goal of the URE in Ocean/Marine Science to provide an active research experience as an effective way to attract talented undergraduates and retain them in careers in ocean and marine science. The program objective is to promote the professional development of underrepresented undergraduate students through their participation in ongoing ocean and marine science research. During the summer 2001 and 2002 programs, research team investigations focused on: (1) ARCVIEW/GIS software as a tool for evaluating coastal populations, (2) Coast Watch Remote Sensing Data Validation Study, (3) validation of LITE tropospheric and stratospheric measurements, (4) seasonal changes in phytoplankton concentration in the Atlantic Ocean using MODIS satellite images, (5) fishery stock yield and spawning biomass per recruit model. (6) correlation of AVHRR SST with the presence of loggerhead turtles, and (7) satellite observations of surface eddies in the North Atlantic Ocean reveal complex physical processes that aid in the preservation of regional marine ecosystem.

Background and objective: Using an effective method of teaching nursing students to learn drug calculation is a necessity in nursing education. This study aimed to determine the effect of two educational methods, case study and simulation, on nursing studentsâ€™ drug dosage calculation skill.
Materials and Methods: In this quasi-experimental study 51 first semester students of in nursing were selected by randomized sampling and were divided into two groups. Case study in the classroom and simulation in practice. Before training and 10 days after that, skills of drug dosage calculation was measured by a 10-question questionnaire.  Data was analyzed by SPSS 18, descriptive statistical test, independent and paired t-test.
Results: Independent t-test results showed no significant difference in mean scores of two groups before training (P > 0.05), but the difference was significant after training (P < 0.05). Paired t-test also indicated a significant difference in mean score compared to the post-test in both groups (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Since the method of simulation training increases skills and reduces drug dosage calculation errors, it is suggested that this method be used for training of nursing students to calculate drug dosage

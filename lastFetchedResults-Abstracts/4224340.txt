This paper presents the development of E - School System Architecture (ESSA), the architecture for an E-Learning System. This architecture is introduced for the purpose of providing flexibility, scalability and modularity to the E-Learning system. Its main objective is to propose an architecture under which different e-learning software modules can be developed and integrated. During the course of development of this architecture, different services needed for an E-Learning system are identified, together with their functional understanding and means of technological realization. ESSA is motivated by MVC Architecture. It has a model that represents the data for the application, the view that is the visual representation of that data and a controller that takes user input on the view and translates that to changes in the model. It is developed for School of Computer Science &amp; IT, DAVV, Indore. A prototype (ESS) is being built to verify and validate this architecture.

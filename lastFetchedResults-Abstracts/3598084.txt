Among the diverse activities of research and development of electronic parts at the U. S. Army Signal Research and Development Laboratory, particular emphasis has been placed on the evolution of a coherent and practical microminiaturization "system." An objective analysis of the several techniques suitable for a system base indicates that the advantages of each of the techniques could be combined logically into an approach called the "micromodule." The flexibility of this system to assimilate advancements in the state of the art, its compatibility to mechanized assembly, and its short- and long-range applicability as a universal construction system for all low and medium power circuits are reviewed. The weakness of "miniaturization for miniaturization\Â´s sake" is discussed frankly, and perspective is drawn for microminiature, circuits, for digital circuits and for general electronic usage. Latest experimental micro-modules are illustrated and their features are discussed. Several complex solid-state circuits are shown and quantitatively assessed to show the ultimate capabilities of this approach and its adaptability to the micro-module construction philosophy.

Background
m was to study the clinical profile of pediatric patients admitted with HIV infection.
s
ospective study was conducted from January 2000 to October 2001 at a tertiary care referral teaching hospital in Mumbai, India. Admitted in-patients (aged 1 month to 12 years) detected to be HIV-positive (on triple ELISA test) were enrolled in the study. HIV status of patients &lt;18 months of age was confirmed by DNA-PCR testing. Demographic data, clinical features, investigations and outcome were recorded in a pre-designed proforma.
s
HIV-positive children (31 males and 19 females; M:F = 1.6:1) were enrolled. Thirty cases were completely immunized, 9 were partially immunized while 11 were not immunized. Forty-two were perinatally infected, while eight cases were infected via blood transfusion (patients with thalassemia major on chronic transfusion therapy). Clinical features at presentation in 42 symptomatic cases included protein-energy malnutrition (90%), fever &gt;1 month (50%), weight loss &gt;1 month (50%), persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (24%) and skin manifestations (79%). The gastrointestinal (62%) and respiratory (52%) were the most commonly involved organ systems. Opportunistic infections noted included tuberculosis (19 cases), candidiasis (6 cases), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (4 cases), herpes zoster (3 cases) and giardiasis (1 case). Six patients died (mortality, 14%).
sions
tal transmission is the most common mode of acquiring HIV in the pediatric age group. Most patients have protein-energy malnutrition. Tuberculosis is common in HIV-infected Indian children. Patients with HIV-encephalopathy have a poor outcome.

In this article some elements are exposed about security in Next Generation Networks (NGN). Important aspects of the accumulated experience in tasks of security Planning and Implantation for different NGN solutions are summarized. In these tasks a Security Architecture and a Management System, obtained in previous works for this type of networks, has been used. This allows presenting many theoretical-practical results, with the objective that it can be generalized in similar environments.

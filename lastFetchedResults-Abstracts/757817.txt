The core of operation research is the development of approaches for optimal decision making. Multi criteria decision making (MCDM) refers to making decision in the presence of multiple, usually conflicting criteria. MCDM has been growing during at least the last two decades. The need of business environment to these methods is a reason for growing of MCDM methods. MCDM consists of two related paradigms: multi attribute decision making (MADM) concentrates on problems with discrete decision space. In these problems the set of decision alternatives has been predetermined. Multi objective decision making (MODM) studies decision problems in which the decision space is continuous. MADM is the most well known branch of decision making. MADM has very diverse methods and this diversity can confuse decision makers to choose a suitable method. In this paper, we define 13 related attributes to choose suitable method and evaluate 20 compensatory methods of MADM. In this evaluation, we also use TOPSIS and SAW (Composite programming and ELECTRE methods) for evaluating and ranking of MADM methods. AHP and fuzzy AHP are introduced as the best methods and Permutation is the worst one.

In this paper the converter performance of grid connected wind energy conversion system is analyzed. For that doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) is examined with two back to back PWM bidirectional power converters, which are connected between the rotor side and utility grid. The simulation models of wind turbine, doubly-fed induction generator and bidirectional power converter are developed in the MATLAB-simulink environment to study the power flow characteristics during wind variations. The effect of modulation index on the grid side converter is analyzed and effectively the modulation region is utilized to improve the grid performance under variable load conditions.

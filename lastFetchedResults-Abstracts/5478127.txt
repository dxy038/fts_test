In this work, a limited survey of the diverse issues related to robot control design architectures is presented. Based on this review, an initiatory taxonomy of robot control tasks, motions, architectures, and controllers is proposed. The objective for this taxonomy is to develop an expert system for industrial robot control under the emerging open architecture controller paradigm

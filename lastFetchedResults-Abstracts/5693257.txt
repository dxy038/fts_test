Layout is an important issue in designing sensor networks. This paper proposes a new approach for energy efficient layout of wireless sensor network. The sensors communicate with each other to transmit their data to a high energy communication node which acts as an interface between data processing unit and sensors. Optimization of sensor locations is essential to provide communication for a longer duration. An energy efficient layout with good coverage based on Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is proposed here. During the process of optimization, sensors move to form a uniformly distributed network The two objectives taken into consideration are coverage and lifetime. Basically a set of network layouts are obtained. The simulation results also exhibit improvement of performance with increase in number of generations in the algorithm

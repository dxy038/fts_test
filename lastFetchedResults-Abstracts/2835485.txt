Natural computing, also called Natural computation, is a recent emerging field of research that introduces three classes of methods: 1) a division of techniques which can be used to solve novel problems by retrieving inspiration from the nature; 2) a division that concentrates on the use of computers to synthesize natural observable fact; and 3) a division that employ natural materials (e.g., molecules) to compute. The main scheme of research that compose these three branches are artificial neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, artificial immune systems, fractal geometry, artificial life, DNA computing, and quantum computing, among others. In this paper, we make an attempt to investigate the working nature, applications, variants and generative power of various bio-inspired computing models such as membrane computing, splicing circular words, Bidirectional sticker system.

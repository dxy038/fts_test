Sympathetic Skin Response (SSR) was measured in 14 paediatric patients (age range 3â€“15 years, mean 7.2 years) following repair of lacerated upper limb peripheral nerves (median, ulnar or both). All nerves had been completely divided and were repaired by primary epineural repair. Measurements of SSR were made at regular, 1-2 monthly, intervals during nerve regeneration in 6 patients. A further group of 7 patients had single SSR measurements at the end of nerve regeneration (21-63 months). A 4-year-old boy was also followed up from 10 to 21 months following replantation of a proximally amputated right upper limb. The method was first standardised in 16 healthy volunteers (age range 3-17 years, mean 9.4 years). Patients over 6 years of age were also clinically tested for return of sensation.

The results show that the objective measurement of sudomotor nerve regeneration in children is possible with this method. They demonstrate its universal acceptance by children as young as 3 years old.

Generation scheduling mode not only affects the economy of power systems operation, but also affects the efficiency of energy use, environmental and social issues such as efficiency of resource allocation. So this paper proposes the Green generation scheduling mode, which is a better energy-saving and environment-protection. Green generation scheduling model can not only economic benefits, but also achieve more environmental benefits. Integrating power system dispatching theory, power system economic theory and DEA assessment theory, this paper introduces DEA assessment index as the assessment index of generation scheduling model considering the energy saving and environmental protection factors. The calculation example shows the efficiency of the scheduling model assessment index of scientific, objective, practical, green power dispatch is better than other power generation scheduling model. The calculation example shows that the efficiency assessment index model of generation scheduling mode is scientific, objective and feasible, and that generation scheduling mode is superior to other generation scheduling mode.

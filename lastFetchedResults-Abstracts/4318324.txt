A thorough review of the TA articles published in leading journals in the MOT field is conducted to identify the methodologies or research tools in the studies. The paper starts with a brief overview of the development of the TA field over its history. This section provides the readers with knowledge of the movements in the field. A classification of the approaches, methods and tools that are available for TA studies is then introduced. The main content of the paper presents the works done in TA literature that involve certain research methodologies.

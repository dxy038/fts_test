The garimpo gold mining activity has released about 2.500 tons of mercury in the Brazilian Amazonian environment in the
1980–1995 period. The northern region of Mato Grosso State, an important gold mining and trading area during the Amazonian
gold rush is now at a turning point regarding its economic future. Nowadays, the activities related to gold mining have only a low
relevance on its economy. Thus, the local communities are looking for economic alternatives for the development of the region.
Cooperative fish farming is one of such alternatives. However, some projects are directly implemented on areas degraded by the
former garimpo activity and the mercury left behind still poses risks, especially by its potential accumulation in fish. The objective
of the present study was to evaluate the levels of mercury contamination in two fish farming areas, Paranaı´ta and Alta Floresta, with
and without records of past gold-washing activity, respectively. Data such as mercury concentration in fish of different trophic
level, size, and weight as well as the water physical and chemical parameters were measured and considered. These preliminary
data have shown no significant difference between these two fish farming areas, relatively to mercury levels in fish.

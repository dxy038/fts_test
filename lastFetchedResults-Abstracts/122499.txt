Objective(s): Deficiencies in calcium and vitamin D intakes are involved in the etiology of osteoporosis, and health authorities recommend that the population consume a diet providing sufficient calcium and vitamin D. We studied the safety and efficacy of milk fortified with vitamin D3.
Methods: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of fortified milk (600 IU/l vitamin D3) compared to unfortified milk in 216 subjects (aged 2-98 years). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], calcium, creatinine, PTH were measured at baseline and after intervention. 109 subjects ingested 400 mL fortified milk with 240 IU vitamin D, and 107 subjects ingested a control milk daily for 8 wk.
Results: After subjects consumed fortified milk for 8 wk, serum 25(OH) D3 concentrations increased by 33%, and serum parathyroid hormone concentrations decreased by 40% compared with baseline; control subjects had a decrease of 7% in 25(OH)D and no significant change in serum parathyroid hormone.In the fortified group, serum 25(OH)D increased by 13 nmol/l from 39.94 nmol/l to 53.37 nmol/l . In the control group, serum 25(OH)D felt by 3 nmol/1 from 43.11 nmol/l to 39.9 nmol/l.
Conclusion: Vitamin D-fortified milk may assist in maintaining vitamin D status in the general population.

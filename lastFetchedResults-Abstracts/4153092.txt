The authors study the problem of limited channel information feedback in multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channels serving heterogeneous users. The heterogeneous users have different feedback channel capacities because of their physical constraints and limitations. Our objective is to design an optimised limited feedback strategy for multiple users by using a set of multi-resolution codebooks such that, under varying and quantised channel information feedback, the multiuser system can maximise its achievable sum rate. By exploiting the receive antenna combining technique, the authors further generalise the proposed scheme to the multiuser beamforming case with multi-antenna users. Finally, the authors verify the proposed scheme by numerical methods. Simulation results show that the sum rate performance for heterogeneous users can be effectively improved by using the proposed limited feedback scheme, which is optimised according to only statistic channel information of users.

Advances in computer technology, computer aided design (CAD) and graphics equipment have led to displays of three dimensional objects with perspective correction and full shading. The final format of the output is restricted to two dimensions, limiting the visual impact and usefulness of the technique. The potential of synthetic holograms, and in particular holographic stereograms, to produce a fully three dimensional output from a computer system has been known for nearly 20 years, and yet the method is not in widespread usage. The primary objective of this work was to economically produce a continuous three dimensional image reconstructed in white light of imaginary, computer stored objects. To achieve this result a system solely using a pulse laser has been developed for increased speed of production

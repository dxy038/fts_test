With the regard of trailer scheduling problem, the hybrid flow shop problem with blocking (HFS-B) was introduced to analyze the flow of container with different attributes (import container, export container) in order to describe and optimize trailer scheduling problem. The mathematics model that was described using HFS-B with attribute for trailer scheduling problem was setup. The four section chromosomes based on the coding of job form and machine form were constructed. The weight approach was introduced to solve multi-objective problem of trailer scheduling. At last an instance of trailer dynamic scheduling based on HFS-B with output container attribute was simulated and the outputting data were compared with the data of trailer static scheduling. It showed that the method could effectually solve the trailer scheduling problem.

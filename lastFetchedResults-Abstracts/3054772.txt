ITU-R BS.1387-1 gives a method for objective measurement of perceived audio quality known as PEAQ (perceptual evaluation of audio quality). This algorithm has been developed for measuring the quality of mid and high quality audio. We show that the advanced version of PEAQ performs poorly when compared to the previously developed energy equalization approach (EEA) for evaluating the quality of low bitrate scalable audio. We also show that including an energy equalization parameter as one of the model output variables (MOVs) of the advanced version improves its performance significantly; the performance of this modified version is superior to that of EEA.

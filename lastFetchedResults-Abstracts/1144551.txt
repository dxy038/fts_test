This paper aims at developing an integrated design method of the active/passive hybrid type of piezoelectric damping system for reducing the dynamic response of the flexible structures due to external dynamic loads. The design method is based on the numerical optimization technique whose objective function is a control effort of the active damping. A vibration suppression performance, which is evaluated by the maximum value of the gain of the frequency response function of the structure, is constrained. In order to demonstrate the structural damping capability of the hybrid type of piezoelectric damping system designed by proposed method, numerical simulation and laboratory experiment will be done using a three-story flexible structure model equipped with 12 surface bonded PZT tiles pairs. Both numerical and experimental results indicate that the optimally designed hybrid piezoelectric damping system can be successfully achieving excellent performance as compared to a conventional purely active piezoelectric damping system.

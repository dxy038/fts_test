In sciences and industries such as signal optimization, traffic assignment, economic market
and etc, many problems have been modeled by bilevel programming (BLP) problems,
where in each level one must optimize some objective functions. There are so many algorithms
in order to find the global optimum of the linear version of BLP problems.
This paper addresses multi-objective linear bilevel multi-follower programming (MOLBMFP)
problems in which there is no sharing information among followers. It presents a new
method for solving these problems.

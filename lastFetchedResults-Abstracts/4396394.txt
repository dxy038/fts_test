Based on the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, this paper proposes a novel design approach for self-navigation of a multi-robot system. To treat the self-navigation (or on-line path planning) of multi-robot system, the hybrid objective functions for target, obstacles, and robots collision avoidance are selected. By the ABC algorithm, the next positions of each robot are designed and then, the tracking control to the planned neighborhood target is done by the PID controllers. Thus, the mobiles robots can travel to the target without collision. Finally, simulation results are introduced to show the effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach.

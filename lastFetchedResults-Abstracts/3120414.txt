Currently the research on the quality of service (QoS) composition in ASKALON grid workflow management system is still rare, a computational method of activitiesÂ´ QoS of grid workflow is proposed based on abstract grid workflow language (AGWL) model. Existing grid workflow scheduling algorithms commonly suffer by one or several of the following drawbacks: monotonous expressing structure, not enough consideration of multidimentional QoS parameters and single objective optimal scheduling. A scheduling algorithm of multiobjective optimal grid workflow scheduling with QoS constraints based on multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is proposed, compared with a grid workflow scheduling algorithm based on NSGA-II algorithm, the experimental results show the validity of algorithm.

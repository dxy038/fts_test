This paper describes a software architecture for the remote monitoring of warehouses equipped with simple RFID reader devices. Its main design objective is to enable a flexible and efficient integration of resource constrained readers that may be implemented as low-cost embedded systems, while allowing higher-level middleware components to access them in a transparent way. The proposed design has been implemented in a Linux-based environment and is currently being tested in conjunction with early prototypes of simple RFID readers that are accessed over low-bandwidth.

Bidirectional boost rectifiers (BBR) are widely employed in high power factor correction (PFC). On the other hand, the one-cycle control (OCC) technique offers various advantages when compared to other control techniques for switching converters: overcomes nonlinearities; eliminates crossover distortion; does not use input voltage sensor and has stability in a large dynamic range while reaching zero error in just one switching cycle. This paper proposes an OCC block named unified one-cycle controller (UOCC) which generalizes the control task for BRB. The proposed block is applied to control a total of four topologies: full-bridge boost rectifier (FBR), half-bridge boost rectifier (HBR), interleaved full-bridge boost rectifier (IFBR) and interleaved half-bridge boost rectifier (IHBR). Among these topologies, the FBR allows three different control possibilities so that a total of six BBR options are investigated. The components count is an attractive aspect of the topologies. Besides the theoretical analysis of the UOCC, the paper presents a quantitative study of the current ripple for comparison of all six rectifier options. Experimental results for the chosen BBR options are provided to verify the theoretical predictions developed in the paper

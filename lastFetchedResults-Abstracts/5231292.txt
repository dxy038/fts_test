A cost-based job shop problem with multiple objectives (MOCB-JSP) is proposed in this paper. Three different objectives are considered in the objective function of MOCB-JSP: work in progress (WIP) holding cost, earliness cost and tardiness cost. tabu search algorithm is applied to improve the initial schedules of MOCB-JSP. Extensive experiments are conducted to test the performance of the tabu search when different parameter combinations are taken. Computational results show that tabu search with a properly configured parameter combination significantly improves the schedule quality with reasonable computational effort.

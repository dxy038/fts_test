The subjective Chinese speech intelligibility evaluation experiments and objective speech transmission index STIPA measurements were respectively carried out under a total of 234 simulated transmission conditions. The relationship curve between Chinese intelligibility scores and STIPA was established and compared with the standard reference curves given in IEC 60268-16 2011. It is found that remarkable differences exist among those curves; the current STI recommended by IEC standard seems to overestimate Chinese speech intelligibility, which means that even with similar STI values, the predicted speech intelligibility score according to the standard reference curve might be higher than actual speech intelligibility score for Chinese PB words test. The comparison also indicates that the differences in languages and subjective test methods may significantly influence the credibility of speech intelligibility evaluation results.

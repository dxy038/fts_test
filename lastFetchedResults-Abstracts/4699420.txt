We present a novel boundary-based (discontinuity tracking) hierarchical statistical criterion to address the interactive contour extraction problem. Our criterion relies on a Markov Chain representation of the boundary and can be efficiently optimized using Dijkstra&#8217;s algorithm for solving the shortest paths problem. Unlike other criteria optimized with Dijkstra&#8217;s algorithm, ours is capable of extracting geometrically complex boundaries even when the features incorporated in the objective function are based only on user markings on a small part of the image. The critical quantity in our criterion that yields the above-mentioned results is a normalization factor that boosts the probability of a particular boundary segment based on the candidate boundary segments in its vicinity. Although similar in spirit to the technique of non-maximum suppression routinely employed in edge detection, our method boosts gradually the probability of a particular segment given its surroundings using windows of increasing size in a hierarchical fashion.

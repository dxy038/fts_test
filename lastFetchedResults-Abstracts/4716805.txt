A fast and efficient multi-objective design method is developed for comparison of the traditional distributed winding (DW) and the more popular concentrated winding (CW) configuration for surface mount permanent magnet (SMPM) machines. First an analytical design model previously developed for DW machines is adapted for CW machines and the accuracy is verified by finite element analysis (FEA); then the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is applied to optimize the design. With an objective function defined by the user to emphasize machine performance indexes, such as weight, volume, efficiency and so on, the PSO optimized designs of the two winding type machines provide valuable insight on winding choices. Two example objective functions and their respective optimized designs for both winding types are illustrated and analyzed. Another merit of the proposed method is that it is FEA-free, fast and efficient, which will save significant time and energy for machine designers.

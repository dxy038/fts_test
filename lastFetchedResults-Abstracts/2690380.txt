In this paper, a new finite element mortar approach with moving nonmatching overlapping grids is introduced. The bidirectional transfer of information between the fixed and moving subdomains is realized for each new position of the moving part. Two numerical examples are presented to support the theory: 1) an electrostatic problem with known solution, to state the optimality of the method and 2) an eddy current nondestructive testing configuration, to underline the flexibility and efficiency of the proposed approach.

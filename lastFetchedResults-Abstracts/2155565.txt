One type of this migration heading toward Arab neighboring countries located in Persian Golf Basin. The major objective of this study is to compare income level and standard of living of the rural migrants as opposed to non-migrant ones in Larestan County. Data were obtained via documentary as well as questionnaire. The study area is composed of 18 villages and 400 rural households with both migrants and non-migrants members. Data analysis demands application of excel and SPSS as well as frequency table and chi square for confirming or rejecting the hypothesis. This study suggests remittance generated in Arab countries will lead to higher income as well as welfare for rural settlers.

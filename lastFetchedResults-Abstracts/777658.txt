This paper presents the modeling and optimization of a solar assisted heat pump using ice slurry. Solar collectors are used as the
primary source of thermal energy, with two distinct loops allowing the collectors to operate in series with an ice tank, or a warm water
tank. Thermal energy stored in the ice tank is transferred to a warm water distribution tank via a heat pump. First, a new mathematical
model of an ice slurry storage tank is presented. Validation of the model with experimental data confirms its ability to predict the ice
mass and tank fluid temperatures during the charging and discharging modes of operation. The developed ice tank model is combined
with the TRNSYS energy simulation program to formulate a complete model of the proposed heat pump system. This computer model
then serves as a base for a mathematical optimization with the objective to minimize the energy use for heating and DHW over a single
heating season. Simulated results demonstrate the potential of the optimized system in reducing the heating operating energy use of a
high performance home in Montreal, QC.

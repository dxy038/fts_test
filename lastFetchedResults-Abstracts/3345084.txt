This paper has studied the issue for waiting time and availability constraints. Many researchers have studied each of these two kinds of constraints, but, fewer studies about the two constraints at the same time. In this paper, Makespan is the objective function taking into account, the waiting time between stages can not exceed the bound. To clarify the issue, the limited buffer time constraints have extended to solve the problem, and two more well-known algorithms are used for comparison. We can see the impact of experimental parameters on the problem solution, as well as a variety of different adaptive algorithms.

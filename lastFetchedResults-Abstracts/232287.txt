The current method of utilising biomass derived fast liquid (bio-crude oil or bio-oil) in a diesel engine requires three fuels and a complex start-up and shut down procedure. For more rapid and successful commercialisation of this renewable liquid fuel, a more convenient and cheaper method of utilisation is needed that provides a single fuel that is stable and readily ignites in a compression engine. This paper describes the production of emulsions from biomass fast pyrolysis liquid and diesel fuel for utilisation in diesel engines. The objective is to allow unmodified diesel engines to run on fast pyrolysis liquid derived from biomass without the cost and complexity of a dual fuel system. The immediate application is in stationary engines for power generation, but there are longer term opportunities for use as a transport fuel. This paper describes the production of the emulsions that have been tested in different diesel engines (tests in engines is reported in a separate paper).

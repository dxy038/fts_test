At the present time many embedded and real time systems require access to increasingly larger amount of data. Data structures can not be fully application dependent as usual and more sophisticated data processing algorithms are required. Placing conventional database principles into the real time environment is an obvious way but it is very difficult to achieve guaranteed real time database services because various components can compete for system resources. Our objective is to design an experimental real-time database system which would be suitable enough to study the most important real-time database issues, including CPU scheduling, concurrency control and conflict resolution. Because of the strong interactions among the processed components, proposed system can help us to understand their effect on system performance and to identify the most important factors

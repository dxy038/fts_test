The objective of this paper is to propose a modeling of self-excited induction generators (SEIG), which is driven by compressed air energy based on a field-oriented control (FOC) principle for a renewable power generation. In this study, the compressed air energy storage (CAES) has developed as small unit to avoid the site limitation as the conventional CAES does. The relationship of pressure and air flow of the CAES, which varies continuously during the discharge of compressed air to drive an induction generator, is considered as a command to control the SEIG. As a result, the SEIG generates power in a wide-range of speed. The simulation results express that the systempsilas respond and performance change as the input changes. The proposed system can use for both stand-alone and grid connected for renewable power applications. In addition, it can use as the power back up system and the peak shaving for the energy building management.

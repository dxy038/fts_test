Three-phase four-wire active power filters (APFs) are presented that can be paralleled to
enlarge the system capacity and reliability. The APF employs the PWM four-leg voltage-source
inverter. A decoupliiig control approacli for the leg connected to the neutral line is proposed
such that the switching of all legs has no interaction. Functions of the proposed APF include
coinpensation of reactive power, harmonic current, unbalanced power and zero-sequence current
of the load. The objective is to achieve unity power factor, balanced line current and zero neutralline
current. Compensation of all components is capacity-limited, co-operating with tlie cascaded
load current sensing schenic. Multiple APFs can be paralleled to share tlie load power without
requiring any control interconnection. In addition to providing the theoretic bases and detailed
design of tlie APFs, two 6 KVA APFs are implemented. The effectiveness of the proposed method
is validated with expcrimcntal results.

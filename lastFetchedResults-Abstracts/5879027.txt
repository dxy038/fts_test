This paper proposes a practical problem of optimization of production process based on time constraints in Pinggao Group Co., Ltd. According to customÂ´s demand, it needs to complete the productive task of designated work pieces in a strict time window. The practical problem is originated form the produce demand. The objective is to minimize the total cost of production process, satisfying the time constraint. In this paper, the practical problem is formulated as an integer programming model. As a case study, a software package (Lingo 9.0) is applied to solve the optimization problem of the production process for slave cylinder in 2<sup>nd</sup> factory of Pinggao Group Co., Ltd.

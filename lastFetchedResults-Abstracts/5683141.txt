Eigensystem assignment and command generator tracking are applied to the design of yaw pointing and lateral translation control laws for the FPCC aircraft. The eigenvalues are chosen to obtain desired frequency and damping. The eigenvectors are chosen to decouple lateral directional flight path and yaw rate. Feed-forward command tracking gains are utilized to ensure steady state tracking to the pilotÂ´s command. An interesting feature of the design is that the control objective is achieved even when selected elements of the output feedback gain matrix are constrained to be zero.

We developed a new modulation code that is effective for advancing a high-density optical disk and a reproduction signal-processing system. The reproduction characteristics of a ROM disk having a recording capacity of 19.8 Giga-bytes (GB) are examined with combining the newly developed reproduction signal-processing system with an optical system composed of a NA=0.7 single objective lens and a GaN laser diode

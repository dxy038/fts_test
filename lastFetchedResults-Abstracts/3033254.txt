The objective of this study was to compare prostate elastograms in vitro with histology to document the elastographic appearance of prostate structures for use in the interpretation of future elastograms in vivo. Prostates were obtained from 15 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Multi-compression elastograms were acquired every 2 mm using a balloon compression. A standard cross-correlation technique was used to calculate the elastograms. Registration was performed with pathology. Minimal undesired motion allowed for the acquisition of prostate elastograms with sharp details. The peripheral zone was seen as a high strain area in the elastograms, whereas the transition zone was seen as a stiff region. Anatomical zones shown by the elastograms corresponded well in shape and size with pathology slices. Structures such as the verumontanum, benign glandular hyperplasia and myotamous nodules were visible. Cancer was visible in 5 out of 16 cases. These findings bode well for continued development of elastography in vivo.

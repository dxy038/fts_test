Objective
Long-term outcome of tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) in women with a history of surgery for urinary incontinence and/or prolapse.
Study design
Prospective cohort study of 809 women. Twenty-eight teaching and 13 local hospitals, 54 gynecologists and urologists performed the TVTs. The Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7) and Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6) were used to measure the results of the TVT procedure (preoperative at 2, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months postoperative). According the recommendation of the International Continence Society, the question “Do you experience urinary leakage during physical activity, coughing or sneezing?” was selected from the UDI to assess stress urinary incontinence.
Results
The decrease in IIQ/UDI mean scores was statistically significant. The UDI scores of women with a history of previous prolapse and/or incontinence surgery were not statistically different to the scores for primary cases after 3 years follow-up (P = .193).
Conclusion
TVT is effective for women with recurrent stress urinary incontinence and/or previous prolapse surgery.

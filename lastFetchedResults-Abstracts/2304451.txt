Under the principles of international law, no State has the right to use or permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause damage to the environment of other States. Spatial econometrics provides an effective tool to assess the influence of the pollution of neighboring countries on a country's pollution level. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the factors influencing on CO2 emissions among 11 Caspian Sea countries under spatial spillovers of pollution and technology (energy intensity as proxy) over the period of 1992-2010. To this end, the empirical model has been estimated using Panel Spatial Durbin Model. The results show that urbanization degree, energy intensity, spatial lag of per capita CO2 emissions and spatial lag of energy intensity have positive and significant effects on the per capita CO  2 emission. Moreover, the results of this paper indicate that the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) phenomenon has been confirmed in these countries. According to the results, commitment to the collaborative environment concept and cooperation within regional arrangements to reduce emissions are the main policy implications of this paper to the policy makers in these countries.

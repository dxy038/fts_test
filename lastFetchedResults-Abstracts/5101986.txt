Injuries by landmines are of public interest all over the world especially in countries with constant violent conflicts. In order to reduce the damage caused to the victims of landmines many kind of projects about prostheses have been developed, in the last years much has been achieved in this field. However, the main problem is that functional prostheses are very expensive. This paper shows the advances in a project which its superior objective is the design and fabrication of an intelligent lower-limb prosthesis prototype with magnetorheologically controlled impact force at affordable cost.

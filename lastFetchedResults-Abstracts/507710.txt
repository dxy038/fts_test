OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of childhood obesity is increasing worldwide. This study investigated the prevalence of obesity and its associated factors in schoolchildren of Neishabour, winter 2006. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a crossâ€“sectional study, 1471 students, aged 6-12 years, were selected by a two-stage cluster sampling. Height and weight of the students were measured and BMI was calculated. A hundred and fourteen subjects were selected as a case group (had a BMI ? 95th percentile of Iranian reference) and control group (n = 102) were chosen from the students having 15th ? BMI ? 85th. 
RESULTS: The prevalence of obesity was reported to be 8.5 % (CI 95%, 7.1-10%), 4.6% (CI 95%, 3.5-6%), 7.3% (CI 95%, 6-9%) according to the Iranian reference, CDC 2000 and IOTF 2000, respectively. Obese children had significantly higher birth weight than the non-obese ones. The ratio of the first and second born child in the case group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.001). Also, the rate for children who began taking their complementary foods under 6 months of age was significantly higher in the case group (80.7%) than control group (46.1%). There was significant difference in the mean time of watching TV and playing computer games between the case and control groups (P < 0.001). Significant association was found between BMI and the above-mentioned variables in the case group. Mean scores of physical activity differed in the case and control group (P < 0.001). 
CONCLUSION: Since the prevalence of obesity differs based on various references, it is recommended that each country applies the most relevant BMI percentile for assessing its children. Obesity had significant association with high birth weight, birth grade and the age of the introduction of complementary food. The findings of this study may be helpful in implementing practical interventions to prevent obesity and overweight in the study population

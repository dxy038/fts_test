A new CMOS buffer circuit for high capacitive loads is presented. The objective of the design is a high-power, area-efficient buffer to be used in very large scale analogue applications. The buffer can deliver a slew rate of 1.2 V/ mu s to capacitive loads in excess of 5000 pF. It has a total harmonic distortion of less than 3% at 20 kHz. At stand by, it consumes only 125 mu A (0.625 mW). The buffer occupies 100 mils<sup>2</sup> of die area in a 3 mu m technology.

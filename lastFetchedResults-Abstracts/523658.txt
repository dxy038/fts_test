Despite a decade of football clubs’ privatization in developed countries, the vast majority of Iranian football clubs continue to be handled by the government. This study attempts to investigate professional football clubs privatization for the period 2008- 2009. The objective of this study is to identify and interpret the economic barriers in the way of Iranian football clubs’ privatization. As there is currently no  research done  regarding the football clubs’ privatization in Iran, this  research is done using exploratory–descriptive method .To accomplish this objective professional football clubs’ managers at  super league and first  division, football federation top managers and sport management experts familiar with football clubs were selected as research sample (N= 150). Questionnaire (Validity was confirmed, Reliability 0/92) was used for Data gathering. Binominal test and Freidman were applied for ranking variables. The Binominal Test results indicated that except for player transfer income and match result prediction system all other investigated barriers are important preventive elements’ in the way of football clubs’ privatization, so null hypothesis was rejected. Ranking of barriers has shown that, the importance of the barriers is not the same.  The most important economic barrier is the low income of ticket selling. However matches result prediction system was the least important economic barrier. Economic barriers have to a large extent prevented achieving privatization objective of Football clubs and  fans in Iran seek for more attention paid to efficiency ,effectiveness , optimal management , the  result of the  matches  and  the brand  of  the   clubs .So the economic barriers in the way of privatization to be removed, otherwise privatization will be impossible.

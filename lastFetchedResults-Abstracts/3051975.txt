Independent component analysis (ICA) is a statistical technique to decompose multivariate data into statistically independent components. It could be applied to mine data of medical, economy or telecommunication systems, and to analyze data of GIS systems for agriculture or environment applications. To solve the problem of blind source separation, this paper introduces the theory and developments of ICA. The analyses of different methods as well as the comparisons with each other on objective functions and optimization algorithms are given. Finally, some problems of ICA to be solved are discussed

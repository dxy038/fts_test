The paper presents a GEO satellite network simulator developed upon the ´network simulator´ (ns) platform. Initially, its objective was the investigation of the interaction of the transmission control protocol (TCP) with the data link layer in satellite networks. However, it has evolved to a simulator capable of addressing a wide range of issues that arise in current and future satellite networks. Its features are outlined and its capabilities are described and demonstrated via representative results.

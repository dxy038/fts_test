Abstract
Objective: Diabetes and hypertension are among the commonest diseases in developed countries, and the frequency of both diseases rises with age. By progression of diabetes the incidence of hypertension become higher than the age-matched general population.
Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out on 300 type 2 diabetic patients who were admitted to medical ward of Moosabne Jafar hospital in Quchan for follow-up from April 2011 to August 2012. The structured questionnaire was used to gather information on sociodemographic variables, history of hypertension, use of anti-hypertensive medications and duration of diabetes. Anthropometric measurements including weight and height were measured by trained staff. Blood pressure was measured using standardized sphygmomanometers. 
Results: Two hundred and ten out of 300 subjects had hypertension, thus giving a prevalence rate of 70%. One hundred males (47.6%) were hypertensive compared with 110 (52.4%) females, but this difference was not significant (?2=0.1, df=1, P > 0.05). The mean age of them was 62.9 years. One hundred and fifty subjects (50%) had reported at least one problem in past history like heart disease, CVA, DVT, CRF, retinopathy, diabetic foot and paresthesia. The most common problem in past history was heart disease (37%).
Conclusions: According to the results, 70% of the diabetic patients had hypertension. It is necessary to inform the patients to control their diabetes in order to prevent its complications

ABSTRACT: The main purpose of the current research project was to investigate the application of politeness strategies in disagreement by Iranian Advanced EFL learners. The other objective was to see whether male and female learners would use different politeness strategies or not. To achieve these objectives, 40 MA, EFL learners were invited to participate in the project. The participants were given a discourse completion test (DCT) designed by Umale (2011). The data obtained through this test were analyzed by the valid statistical procedures. The statistical analysis revealed that there was no significant difference between the two genders with regard to the type of politeness strategies in disagreement speech act. Based on the result of the present study, the material developers and teachers are recommended to note that male and female students use almost the same types of politeness strategies in disagreement speech acts.

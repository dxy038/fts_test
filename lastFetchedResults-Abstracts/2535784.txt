The objective of every industrial manager is that industry should be in an operative state for a long period of time. Keeping in mind the above objective the present work is done. In the present paper washing system which is an important system of paper industry have been discussed in detail. It involving many unit operations and processes Reliability, long run availability and M.T.T.F. have been studied. Reliability of the system can be analyzed by forming differential equations with the help of mnemonic rule and the transition diagram of the process. These differential equations can be solved using well known integrating factor technique. Recursive method has been used to calculate the long run availability of the process. The effects of failure and repair rates of different sub systems on long run availability have been studied through tables and graphs.

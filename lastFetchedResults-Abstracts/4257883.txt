In this paper, we propose a multiobjective evolutionary approach to design a microwave heating device. The goal is to heat the maximum amount of water, above certain temperature, and spending the minimum energy. The device is modeled as a loss multilayer dielectric irradiated by microwave power. The resulting bi-objective problem is then solved using SPEA2 and a set of solutions is obtained. The results show that SPEA2 finds a higher number of non-dominated solution when compared with the traditional approaches used in this problem, within lower computational cost.

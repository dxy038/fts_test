The objective of this study is to demonstrate the ability of a computer simulation of the microstructure evolution in the hot forging of C–Mn steel. The development of the microstructure is strongly dependent on process and material parameters that affect the time history of thermomechanical variables such as temperature, strain, and strain-rate during deformation. A model to predict the development of the microstructure has been suggested by many researchers but has usually been applied to the hot rolling process, where dynamic recrystallization can be ignored due to the small deformation involved. In this study, the analysis program combined with a recrystallization model and the rigid–thermoviscoplastic finite element method is developed in order to investigate the microstructure evolution during a hot forging process with large deformation. To show the validity and effectiveness of the developed program, the experiment of hot upsetting is performed, the results of the experiment being compared with those of simulation.

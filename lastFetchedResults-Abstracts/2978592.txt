This paper shows the estimation of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) using ADEOS/POLDER image data. The POLDER instrument was developed by Centre National d´Etudes Spatiales (CNES), France. In this paper we have analyzed the POLDER data over land obtained in June, 1997 by using a realistic atmospheric-ground model, including multiple scatterings. The atmospheric effects are removed from observed reflectance images by using our atmospheric correction scheme. Then, we estimate the BRDFs for land surfaces in Mongolia at 443 nm, 670 nm and 865 nm, by using Roujean et al.´s (1992) BRDF model

The key to developing line drawing algorithms is an explicit reference model for quantifying a &#8220;good&#8221; raster approximation. The article looks at old practices, then demonstrates the development of line and edge drawing algorithms. Computer driven raster displays introduce a higher performance, more demanding technology that benefits from systematic rules. To examine the development of a compact, integer arithmetic algorithm for line rastering, the article looks at some pixel space basics, then considers alternative measures by which closeness to a true lineÂ´s locus could be evaluated. The key to effective use of all algorithms is a clear understanding of your objective function and the implications that can arise from incomplete or unintentionally fuzzy assumptions

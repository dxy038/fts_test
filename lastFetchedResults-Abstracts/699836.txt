Carbon fixed-beds are usually used to remove organic contaminants. Adsorption in a carbon filter is a dynamic, non-steady process which is not yet completely understood. The objective of this paper is to establish a methodology to simplify the study of this process based on the wave theory, rapid small-scale column test and experimental design/surface response analysis. The constant pattern wave hypothesis was confirmed by the experimental data. The influence of the inlet concentration of p-nitrophenol and the flow rate on dynamic adsorption was studied at 20 Â°C following a central composite design using a second-order model. Both parameters have an important influence on the response variables studied. The methodology used is a useful tool for studying the dynamic process and shows interactions that are difficult to verify by the classical step-by-step method.

Using data miningÂ´s decision tree classification, DBSCN cluster analysis, and K-nearest neighbor algorithm realizes the information mining of natural gas pipeline leak, and alse uncovers the objective laws behind the natural gas pipeline transmission, intrinsically linking to the each parameter and development trend. We could reduce the risk of accidents and economic losses, in order to control the natural gas transmission in advance.

Most of the admission control algorithms treat every admission request uniformly and hence optimize the system performance by maximizing the number of admitted and served requests. In practice, requests might have different levels of importance to the system. Requests offering high contribution or reward to the system performance deserve priority treatment. Failure of accepting a high-priority request would incur high penalty to the system. Our Proposed framework takes three priority classes of requests. The network capacity is divided into three partitions based on the threshold values: one for high class of requests and second for low class of request and third is common pool which accept the high, low and other classes of requests respectively. We take a condition in common pool if common pool is filled &#190; of its total capacity and at this time new request comes then we degrade the low priority class and accept that coming request. Reward and penalty are adopted in the proposed system model. High-priority requests are associated with higher values of reward as well as penalty than low-priority ones. In this paper, we have used these characteristics of the system in access provider network to admit more requests and to increase workload without degradation of system performance. Our proposed framework will improve the processing of the system model and optimize the system performance based on the objective function of the total reward minus the total penalty. The negotiation mechanism reduces the QoS requirements of several low-priority clients, by cutting out a small fraction of the assigned capacity, to accept a new high-priority client and to achieve a higher net earning value for enhancing the system performance.

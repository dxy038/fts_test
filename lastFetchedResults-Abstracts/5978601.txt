Educational systems have been developed to apply computer abilities to various education domains and promote the activities of learners successively. However, the traditionally developed educational systems are not always designed to supply the knowledge handling process constructively to various education domains. When educational activities are looked upon as the knowledge management, it is necessary to design and implement the cooperative mechanism among individual phases of knowledge management. An architectural framework for educational activities of persons is addressed. A five-layer model is proposed, which is composed of educational environment, support system, person role, functionality and knowledge media. The idea is to integrate them under the corresponding relationships among layers, and transform interpretatively the concepts in the upper layer into those in the lower layer. In line with this approach, the objective is to investigate knowledge handling mechanism for a viewpoint of person activity. The effectual results discussed are: framework of seamless personal activities among educational styles and framework to be supported practically by computers.

Carbon dioxide emission from soil plays an important role in the global carbon cycle. Short term losses of soil carbon due to tillage are of a variable magnitude. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of plowing the soil on CO2-C emissions during summer in a coarse-loamy mixed thermic Typic Hapludoll from the Argentine Rolling Pampa. Temperature after tillage was higher in the plowed soil than under no-tillage, being higher the soil water content in the later treatment. Plowing the soil did not produce an immediately impact on soil surface CO2-C emission, but induced an important CO2-C flush few days later. A difference of 16 up to 25 kg C ha–1 d–1 in the CO2-C emissions was observed from the second up to the fourth sampling dates after tillage. Difference in total CO2-C emissions between the plowed soil and the no-tillage treatment was 580 kg C ha–1, during the 40 days measurement period. This difference in CO2-C emission was partitioned between residue decomposition and humus mineralization. Carbon mineralized from humus was 270 kg C ha–1 higher under plow tillage than under no tillage. This figure represented an important extra loss of 0.48% of the soil organic carbon content from the 0–30 cm depth, as consequence of plowing in the warmest season of the year.

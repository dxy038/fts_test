As a means of maximising reuse, component-based application development is a laudable objective. CORBA is an influential component model already adopted by the computing industry. The nature of a typical CORBA development process is examined. There is a discussion of the requirements for a more complete component-based application development method, and focus on the shortcomings encountered when applying CORBA outside such a framework. The ISO RM-ODP standard is introduced, its relevance is highlighted, and the issue of reuse in relation to both CORBA and RM-ODP is reviewed. It is concluded that, in order to successfully model the business domain, component models such as CORBA need to be integrated into a component-based application development process which takes account of a broader context such as that provided by RM-ODP

The location-routing problem is one of the problems in distribution network designing and logistic management, whose mathematical model is proposed in this paper firstly, which is recognized as NP-hard. In this paper, a particle swarm optimization method for location-routing problem is proposed. It adopts a novel particle representation to correspond to the LRP, and modifies the objective function with additive penalty function part in order to make the solution more feasible. From an illuminated example, the availability and performance of proposed PSO can be approved

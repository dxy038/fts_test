The main objective of this study was to characterise the five-factor personality model profile of the broader autism phenotype as assessed by the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Comparison data were also obtained for a brief Asperger syndrome screening measure. The psychometric properties and factor structure of the AQ were also assessed and group differences in AQ scores examined. The AQ and personality scale were completed by 201 undergraduates. A second group of 136 adults completed the personality scale and the Asperger screening measure. Examination of correlations showed that high scores on both ‘autism' measures were associated with high neuroticism and low extraversion and agreeableness. Three of the five proposed sub-scales of the AQ emerged from the factor analysis. The AQ and sub-scales had satisfactory or near-satisfactory reliabilities. Group differences were generally as expected: Males had higher AQ scores than females, ‘hard' science students had higher scores than other students and students with parent(s) in a scientific occupation had higher scores.

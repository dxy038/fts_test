In this demo, we demonstrate a cooking recipe recommendation system which runs on a consumer smartphone. The proposed system carries out object recognition on food ingredients in a real-time way, and recommends cooking recipes related to the recognized food ingredients. By only pointing a built-in camera on a mobile device to food ingredients, the user can obtain a recipe list instantly. The objective of the proposed system is to assist people who cook to decide a cooking recipe at grocery stores or at a kitchen. In the current implementation, the system can recognize 30 kinds of food ingredient in 0.15 seconds, and it achieved the 83.93% recognition rate within the top six candidates.

Pulse width modulation schemes are aimed at adjusting the fundamental component while reducing the harmonic content of an inverter output voltage or current. This paper addresses the topic of optimal inverter operation in reference to a given objective function. The objective function could embody either a single performance criterion, such as voltage or current total harmonic distortion (THD), or a weighted sum of multiple criteria. The proposed method ensures primacy of the chosen solution while imposing no restriction over its modulation index. In particular, operating the inverter by the chosen solution would result in performances superior to any other modulation scheme commutating in an equal number of switching angles per fundamental cycle. The proposed method allows for the consideration of practical inverter constraints and prevents the possibility of impractical switching sequence. A detailed investigation of the method is given, accompanied by two practical cases minimizing, respectively, phase-voltage THD and line-current THD of a three-level inverter. Selected simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the theoretical part.

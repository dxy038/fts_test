The main objective of this research is to present a fast and efficient method based on Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for measuring the frequency deviation as well as the voltage magnitude and phase angle of a noisy sinusoid wave. The frequency estimation is formulated as an optimization problem, where the goal is to minimize the estimation error. The use of GAs has the advantage of better immunity against noise disturbance present in the input data. In addition, this work investigates the implementation of a GA scheme in FPGA (<i>Field-Programmable</i> <i>Gate</i> <i>Array</i>) in order obtain a device that can work properly in real time. The new approach is able to accurately estimate the frequency, voltage magnitude and phase angle, simulating an online frequency relay. The proposed methodology provides an efficient alternative for frequency relays with advantages in comparison with traditional approaches.

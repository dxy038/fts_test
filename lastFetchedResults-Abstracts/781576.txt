The objective of this work was to evaluate the intake (I) of all Buddleia skutchii foliage (BSF), collected from three different sites (places: A, B and C) in feeding sheep (phase 1), and in combination with Pennisetum clandestinum (Pc) (phase 2). Trials of feed intake, in vivo dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), and digestibilities of crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and nitrogen balance were carried out during phase 1. Diet was given to nine Creole male lambs of 23(±3) kg body weight (BW), located in individual metabolism crates. During phase 2, four treatments were evaluated (T1 = 100% Pc, T2 = 20% BSF + 80% Pc, T3 = 40% BSF + 60% Pc and T4 = 60% BSF + 40% Pc) in a 4 × 4 Latin square design, using four ruminal cannulated Creole male rams of 50 ± 2 kg BW and remained in individual metabolism crates. In vivo digestibility (DM, CP and gross energy (GE)) and kinetics of in situ disappearance of DM were evaluated. The results in phase 1 indicated that BSF from Site B had relatively higher CP (14.9%), ADF (50.6%) content and nitrogen retention (1.93 g d−1). On the other hand, the lambs showed intake levels of 376.29 g d−1 DM, 56.21 g d−1 CP, 206.24 g d−1 ADF and 1418.21 kcal gross energy (P > 0.05); and digestibilities of 54.23% DM, 47.17% CP and 39.31% NDF. Therefore, BSF from Site B was selected for the second phase of this work as the best result. We observed that the nutrition quality of the diets was higher as a result of increasing BSF concentration in the diet. When sheep were fed on 40% BSF–60% Pc, DM intake levels of 900.6 g d−1, and DM, CP and GE digestibility of 70.0, 52.82 and 55.1%, respectively, were observed. There were not significant differences among diets, and in situ disappearance, Kd and Kp, but the diet with 60% of BSF presented higher ruminal digestibility (42.3%). The results allowed to validate the local knowledge on BSF as a promising forage species, and showed that BSF should be incorporated in a sheep production system.

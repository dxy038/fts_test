Objective(s): The study aimed to investigate the effects of resveratrol on colorectal cancer HCT116 cells, including cell viability, apoptosis, and migration, and the partial mechanisms focused on hedgehog/gli-1 signaling pathways. Materials and Methods: We chose the appropriate time and concentration of recombinant human Sonic hedgehog (Shh) stimulation by cell viability. The proportion of cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry; HCT116 cell migration was measured by scratch test; the expression of Ptch, Smo, and Gli-1 was measured by Western blot analysis. Results: Shh signaling increased HCT116 cell viability and migration, inhibited cell apoptosis, and upregulated the expression of Ptch, Smo, and Gli-1. Resveratrol obviously inhibited HCT116 cell viability and migration, promoted cell apoptosis, and suppressed the protein of Ptch, Smo, and Gli-1. Furthermore, the effects of resveratrol and Shh on human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells were in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Conclusion: The inhibitory effect of resveratrol on HCT116 cells may be mediated by hedgehog/gli-1 signaling pathways.

Complex mixtures of disinfection by-products are formed in drinking waters when chlorine is
used as disinfectant, among which are found trihalomethanes. Trihalomethanes are very stable in the natural
environment and are moderately lipophilic. Thus they accumulate in the human organism, which may be
related to a greater risk of certain cancers.The objective of this study is to investigate the association between
trihalomethanes exposure (e.g. total trihalomethane concentration, TTHM; occurring as chlorination of drinking
water) and bladder and certain digestive cancers. Data were collected on different districts inside a Mediterranean
city (Valencia, Spain). Samples were analyzed via head-space and electron capture detector to determine
TTHM concentrations. The relative influence of different factors has been evaluated. Our results suggest a
possible association between bladder cancer in women and trihalomethanesâ€™ exposure at levels below the
European Community legal limit; that, at least, advices that such studies deserves more attention.

An integrated design and optimization platform for vehicles vibration isolation system is presented. The integrated platform can not only direct the design by getting the precise analyze result of 3D models, but also carry through multi-objective optimization based on genetic algorithms. These can both expedite the optimization and improve the optimization result. Furthermore, we validate the reliability and validity of the platform by optimizing a heavy forklift.

This paper demonstrates the possibility of trapping and manipulating a gas bubble in water by high-repetition rate femtosecond laser pulses, focused in water by a high numerical aperture objective.The parameters of the experiment for bubble trapping were determined.The trapping force emerges at local heating of the gas inside the bubble due to nonlinear absorption in the focal volume of the objective.

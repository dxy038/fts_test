In order to relieve current urban traffic congestion, this study proposes a new model of network based on cell transmission model (CTM). A typical model of network with four three-line intersections is established by analyzing the confluence phenomenon, the divergence phenomenon and the extern dynamic input phenomenon, which appears in the actual traffic flow movement. The model depicts a transmission relation of traffic flow between different intersections efficiently. The timing schedule of traffic signal of the intersections can be optimized dynamically to reduce the average network delay and enhance the road capacity. In this study, a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to optimize the timing schedule where the average network delay is considered as the objective of optimization. The simulation result shows that the proposed model of network can deal with the signal timing schedule of obstructed and unobstructed traffic phenomenon and the average network delay can be reduced efficiently.

The objective of this work was to expose dried trabecular bone material to a decalcifying environment and to quantify the change in the spatial distribution of the bone with a fractal measure. Digitized radiographic images were produced from four separate slices of human vertebral bone as they dissolved within a solution of nitric acid. Pixel data from a region of interest (ROI) within the trabecular bone were used to estimate the time-dependent change in fractal dimension of the ROI as the bone dissolved. Results demonstrated that a change in the spatial distribution of trabecular material may be expressed in terms of a concurrently changing estimate of the fractal dimension.

The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of a commercial surgical navigator using optical tracking modality with automated registration between O-arm images and the scanned object. Automated registration was enabled by using the spine navigation software of the navigator. The used phantom was designed by the authors of this paper. The surgical navigators and the O-arm are routinely used at Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland. The distances measured with the surgical navigator from the fixed origin of the phantom were compared to the known phantom accuracy assessment coordinates. The error of the surgical navigator was the difference between measured and true values. The mean displacement error was 0.20 mm with a standard deviation of 0.14 mm. The results show that automated registration is very reliable for image guided surgery (IGS) and that the present accuracy assessment method can be used to periodically check surgical navigator accuracy using O-arm data.

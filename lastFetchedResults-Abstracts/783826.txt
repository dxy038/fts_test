Objective To determine within a nationally representative
sample of young Australian children: (1) the association
amongst intellectual disability, borderline intellectual
functioning and the prevalence of possible mental health
problems; (2) the association amongst intellectual disability,
borderline intellectual functioning and exposure to
social disadvantage; (3) the extent to which any betweengroup
differences in the relative risk of possible mental
health problems may be attributable to differences in
exposure to disadvantageous social circumstances.
Methods The study included a secondary analysis of a
population-based child cohort of 4,337 children, aged 4/
5 years, followed up at age 6/7 years. The main outcome
measure was the scoring within the ‘abnormal’ range at age
6/7 years on the parent-completed Strengths and Difficulties
Questionnaire.
Results When compared to typically developing children,
children identified at age 4/5 years as having intellectual
disability or borderline intellectual functioning: (1) showed
significantly higher rates of possible mental health problems
for total difficulties and on all five SDQ subscales at
age 6/7 years (OR 1.98–5.58); (2) were significantly more
likely to be exposed to socio-economic disadvantage at age
4/5 and 6/7 years. Controlling for the possible confounding
effects of exposure to socio-economic disadvantage (and
child gender) significantly reduced, but did not eliminate,
between-group differences in prevalence.
Conclusions Children with limited intellectual functioning
make a disproportionate contribution to overall child
psychiatric morbidity. Public health and child and adolescent
mental health services need to ensure that services and
interventions fit to the purpose and are effective for children
with limited intellectual functioning, and especially
those living in poverty, as they are for other children.

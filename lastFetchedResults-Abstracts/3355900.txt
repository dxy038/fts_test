This paper investigates multiple signal classification (MUSIC) imaging method approach to solve the inverse scattering problem based on microscopy system using intensity-only (phase-free) data. The location of a collection of small scatterers embedded in the focal region of the objective lens can be determined. Due to the specific characteristic of the microscopy system, the relationship between the rank of the multistatic matrix and the number of the small scatterers is different from that in traditional inverse scattering. Multiple scattering between scatterers is considered. Numerical simulations show that the inverse construction dramatically improves the resolution of microscopy system.

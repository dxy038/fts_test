Objective: To assess the feasibility, safety and cost effectiveness of ambulatory cataract surgery.Material and Methods: This study was conducted on patients with age related cataract at Hayatabad Medical Complex from 1st January to 31st December 2000. Patients with unilateral cataract and pathological cataract were excluded from the study. Patients were either admitted to the hospital or were operated as day cases. Extra capsular cataract extraction with intra-ocular lens was done in all cases by two senior surgeons. Patients were observed peroperatively and postoperatively for complications, visual acuity and the comfort and difficulty they faced during the process.Results: Out of 302 patients 175 (57.94%) males and 127(42.06%) females. 153 patients (50.67%) were operated as day cases and 149 patients (49.33%) were operated as indoor cases. Peroperative complications were noted in 8 (5.22%) day cases and 10 (6.71%) indoor cases. Postoperative complications were noted in 18 (11.29%) day cases and 12 (8.05%) indoor cases. Postoperative corrected visual acuity of 6/6 to 6/18 was found in 80 (93.02%) day cases and 73 (92.40%) indoor cases. An average of 84 (97.67%) day cases were satisfied with the process of intervention, visual outcome and cost of intervention while an average of 77 (97%) indoor cases were satisfied with the above mentioned aspects of surgery.Conclusion: Ambulatory cataract surgery under optimal condition is safe, feasible and cost effective. The patient immediately returns to his/her home environment and avoids the physical and psychological stresses of the hospital environment.

In this paper, a simulation based optimization method is introduced. This method uses the technique of coupling industrial simulation software with a multi objective optimizer based on a genetic algorithm. This coupling is used to optimize the performances of a simulation model representing a railway maintenance facility by choosing the best queuesÂ´ scheduling policy. Our results show that coupling is adapted to our problem and can be extended to cover other domains than sequencing rules and other types of simulation models

The manufacture of clothing, along with the closely associated activities of fibre and textile production, continues to be one of the driving forces of industrialisation throughout the developing world. At the same time, the clothing industries of many developed consumer industries are fighting to maintain their share of the total value (as opposed to volume) which is created throughout the entire chain of apparel design, manufacturing and distribution. In order to accomplish this objective, managers are empowering employees to take responsibility on productivity and performance. By creating a workplace that is conducive to achieve this performance, in consideration of health and safety, work design and productivity, the implementation of ergonomics can become one of the sustainable competitive advantages in the clothing industry. Integrating ergonomics into a plant´s culture can cut worker´s compensation costs, reduce lost time, improve productivity and quality and strengthen labour-management relations. The investigation focused on gathering information relating to workers in the different sections of clothing manufacture from incoming raw materials to dispatch of finished goods. The objective was to highlight the plight of the clothing manufacturing employees and to provide workable solutions that could be implemented in order to improve their health and safety. A cross sectional analytical survey was conducted using direct observation, discussion and questionnaires to gain insight into ergonomic related illnesses experienced by employees.

In this paper we present the second stage of a two-phase strategy for reducing the required background memory sizes for a large class of data-intensive multimedia applications. This strategy is particularly useful in an embedded application context, where memory size and the corresponding power consumption are the main cost factors together with data transfers. Our strategy optimizes the storage order of arrays in memory by trying to improve the reuse of memory locations, as well for elements of the same array as for elements of different arrays. Although size reduction is the main objective, an added benefit is a reduced power consumption due to the decreased capacitive load of the memories. The memory size reduction task is part of an overall memory size and power reduction methodology called ATOMIUM in which other tasks can increase its effectiveness (e.g. loop, transformations), but it can also be used on a stand-alone base. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by experimental results for some real-life multimedia applications, for which a considerable memory size reduction was obtained

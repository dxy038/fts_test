The concept of virtual channels is extended to multiple virtual communication systems that provide adaptability and fault tolerance in addition to being deadlock-free. A channel dependency graph is taken as the definition of what connections are possible, and any routing function must use only those connections defined by it. Virtual interconnection networks allowing adaptive, deadlock-free routing are examined for three <e1>k</e1>-ary <e1>n</e1>-cube topologies: unidirectional, torus-connected bidirectional, and mesh-connected bidirectional

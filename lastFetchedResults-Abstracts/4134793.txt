A robust sliding-mode controller, suitable for the output voltage control of voltage-sourced unity-power-factor three-phase pulsewidth modulation (PWM) rectifiers, presenting no steady-state errors, is described. This &#8220;just-in-time&#8221; switching controller controls the output voltage and the line input currents, while providing bidirectional power flow, near-unity-power-factor operation, low harmonic content, fast dynamic response of the output voltage, and minimum switching frequency due to a new &#945;-&#946; space-vector current regulator. The voltage controller performance is compared with the behavior of the conventional proportional integral output voltage control, aided by PWM current-mode modulators, and with the nonrobust fast and slow manifold sliding-mode approach. The comparison shows that the proposed controller confers faster dynamics and does not present steady-state errors. Test results confirm that the performance of the controller is independent of system parameters and load and exceeds the performance of existing hysteretic current-mode control systems

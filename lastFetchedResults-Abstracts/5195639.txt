The paper presented a case study on build an archetypical BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) parameters database for every 16-day period of a year for the snow and no snow condition with multiyear remote sensed data. A database (the 3Y DB) for MODLAND tile H26V06 was built through inversed high-quality BRDF parameters using the RossThick-LiSparse-Reciprocal model with three-year (2002-2004) Terra MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging and Spectraradiameter) data. Albedo inversion experiments with data of year 2004 indicated the 3Y DB more effectively improved effectiveness of the magnitude inversion and accuracy of the magnitude inversed albedo than the U.S. operational archetypical BRDF parameters database. It showed great potential to improve accuracy of the magnitude inversed albedo using the inversed high-quality BRDF parameters with historical remote sensed data.

In this paper, the level-set evolution is exploited in the design of a novel evolutionary algorithm (EA) for global optimization. An application of Latin squares leads to a new and effective crossover operator. This crossover operator can generate a set of uniformly scattered offspring around their parents, has the ability to search locally, and can explore the search space efficiently. To compute a globally optimal solution, the level set of the objective function is successively evolved by crossover and mutation operators so that it gradually approaches the globally optimal solution set. As a result, the level set can be efficiently improved. Based on these skills, a new EA is developed to solve a global optimization problem by successively evolving the level set of the objective function such that it becomes smaller and smaller until all of its points are optimal solutions. Furthermore, we can prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a global optimizer with probability one. Numerical simulations are conducted for 20 standard test functions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with that of eight EAs that have been published recently and the Monte Carlo implementation of the mean-value-level-set method. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient.

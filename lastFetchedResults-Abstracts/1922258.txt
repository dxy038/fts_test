No published studies have evaluated the role of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging for the assessment of Ebstein anomaly. Our objective was to evaluate the right heart characteristics in adults with unrepaired Ebstein anomaly using contemporary CMR imaging techniques. Consecutive patients with unrepaired Ebstein anomaly and complete CMR studies from 2004 to 2009 were identified (n = 32). Volumetric measurements were obtained from the short-axis and axial views, including assessment of the functional right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume. The volume of the atrialized portion of the right ventricle in end-diastole was calculated as the difference between the total RVEDV and the functional RVEDV. The reproducibility of the measurements in the axial and short-axis views was determined within and between observers. The median value derived from the short-axis and axial views was 136 ml/m2 (range 59 to 347) and 136 ml/m2 (range 63 to 342) for the functional RVEDV, 153 ml/m2 (range 64 to 441) and 154 ml/m2 (range 67 to 436) for the total RVEDV, 49% (range 32% to 46%) and 50% (range 40% to 64%) for the functional RV ejection fraction, respectively. The axial measurements demonstrated lower intraobserver and interobserver variability than the short-axis approach for all values, with the exception of the intraobserver functional RVEDV and interobserver total RVEDV for which the limits of agreement and variance were not significantly different between the 2 views. In conclusion, measurements of right heart size and systolic function in patients with Ebstein anomaly can be reliably achieved using CMR imaging. Axial imaging appeared to provide more reproducible data than that obtained from the short-axis views.

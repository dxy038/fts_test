The objective of this study is to introduce the possible ball-burnishing surface finish process of a freeform surface plastic injection mold on a machining center. The design and manufacture of a burnishing tool was first accomplished in this study. The optimal plane ball-burnishing parameters were determined by utilizing the Taguchi’s orthogonal array method for plastic injection molding steel PDS5 on a machining center. Four burnishing parameters, namely the ball material, burnishing speed, burnishing force, and feed, were selected as the experimental factors of Taguchi’s design of experiment to determine the optimal burnishing parameters, which have the dominant influence on surface roughness. The optimal burnishing parameters were found out after conducting the experiments of the Taguchi’s L18 orthogonal table, analysis of variation (ANOVA), and the full factorial experiment. The optimal plane burnishing parameters for the plastic injection mold steel PDS5 were the combination of the tungsten carbide ball, the burnishing speed of 200 mm/min, the burnishing force of 300 N, and the feed of 40 μm. The surface roughness Ra of the specimen could be improved from about 1 to 0.07 μm by using the optimal burnishing parameters for plane burnishing. Applying the optimal burnishing parameters for plane burnishing to freeform surface plastic injection mold, the surface roughness Ra of freeform surface region on the tested plastic injection part could be improved from about 0.842 to 0.187 μm, through a comparison between using the fine milled and using the ball-burnished mold cavity.

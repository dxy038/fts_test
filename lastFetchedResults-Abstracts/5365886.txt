The objective of this paper is to present a new topology of power converters which use a special autotransformer-ADZ. This autotransformer allows independent control of voltage phasors, phase by phase. This feature permits the application of this converter in unbalanced systems. This paper analyzes the technical feasibility of the transformer converter set. Waveforms of voltage and current in both sides of the converter are also presented

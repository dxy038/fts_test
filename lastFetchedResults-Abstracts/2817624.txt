Distribution networks must be equipped for a significant increase in future electrical demand. This challenge must be met in a cost-effective manner and without undue environmental impact. This paper quantifies the operational benefits of the Capacity to Customers (C<sub>2</sub>C) project presently being led by Electricity North West Limited in the UK. The objective of the project is to use demand-side response (DSR) technology and increased network interconnection to significantly increase the available network capacity, avoiding the cost and environmental impact of traditional reinforcement. Through the analysis of real distribution circuit data for a cross-section of circuits involved in the project trial, and assuming evenly-distributed load growth, it is shown that the presence of DSR increases usable circuit capacity by a mean of 66%. The use of network interconnection generally reduces the number of steady-state voltage constraints and thereby yields a further increase in capacity. Consequently, it is shown that interconnection significantly reduces the need for cable and overhead line reinforcement, often needed for connecting relatively large industrial and commercial loads. The paper also comments on protection issues that could potentially impact upon C<sub>2</sub>C deployment.

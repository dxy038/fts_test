In this work, the authors propose a new control technique, namely, &#8220;interval based control&#8221;. The objective is the automatic control of physical systems, represented by imprecise mathematical models. A new physical systems representation form has been introduced and a general procedure to perform automatic control has been fully described. To illustrate the method, a successful application (crane motion control), using the interval based control technique has been presented, and the experimental results shown

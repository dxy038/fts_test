In this contribution an overview of the Hypercomputing project is given. The objective of this project is to employ unused computer resources, which are distributed over wide areas. A Hypercomputer represents a system of workstations and/or workstation clusters, which are integrated as a homogenous resource both for the solution of sequential as well as of parallel problems. German-wide Universities, research institutes and industrial partners are taking part in the project. Beside giving an explanation of the goals of this project, the status of the development is described. Central problem areas and the chosen attempts for the realization of the Hypercomputer prototype are demonstrated and some experiments and first experiences are explained

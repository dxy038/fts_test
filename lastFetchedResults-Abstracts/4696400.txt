We present an interactive query system applied to the specific problems of immunogenetics being undertaken with under international sponsorship (currently European with EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory)). The challenge is to adapt the models available in computer science (database conceptual models, grammars, formal models) to the specific area of genetic data with the objective of structuring this data. We provide a querying tool for the biological community, to enable then to crystallise their thoughts on "annotations" and to thereby arrive at a consensus on their standardisation. With the help of concepts stemming from the domains of databases, software engineering and human-computer interaction, we have developed a generic and adaptative system. Our study is currently concerned with the following problems: the integration or the binding of treatment software, sharing of data and communication.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

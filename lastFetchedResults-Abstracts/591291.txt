This paper introduces the philosophy and method of critical
conscientization in adult education and critical social analysis. An
overview of some Iranian research papers on Freire’s views on education
suggests that although some of his educational and social themes are
familiar in our society and they have been discussed in different papers,
however, they have not been considered as a coherent epistemologic -
intellectual system.
In line with this objective, the intellectual origins of Freire’s views have
been explained based on Hegel’s philosophy, Frankfurt School critical
theory, Goldman’s structuralism, and Vygotsky’s theory. In addition, his
epistemological and ontological foundations have been studied in the
context of critical hermeneutic and critical realism.

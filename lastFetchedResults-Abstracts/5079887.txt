It is difficult to use simple mathematics to quantize transit network optimization, because the transit network optimization is a multi-objective nonlinear programming problem, and the objective function is multiple and complex. The matter element analysis theory in extension field is introduced by some scholars. We can transform the multi-objective decision problem to a single-objective decision problem by the matter element model. In this paper, we propose a matter element model for transit network optimization by matter element analysis theory and operations research while taking the interests of both passengers and enterprise into account. The quantitative optimization results can be obtained by Euclidean distance calculation. At last, an example is given to shows the process of the method is reasonable, and reflects the optimization process clearly.

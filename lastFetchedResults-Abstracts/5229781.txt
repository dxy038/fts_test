The purpose of this paper is to establish a mathematical model for optimization design of three-stage cylindrical gear reducer and carry out a research on parametric design based on Pro/Engineer. In the optimization design, the minimum of overall gearpsilas center distance in reducer is the objective function, the pinionspsila tooth numbers, normal modules and the first two-stage transmission ratios are used as design variables. The optimization results of the gear reducer can be used in the parametric modelling with the help of Pro/Toolkit development module and Visual C++. The motional condition and working process of the gear reducer are shown by modelling and simulation. The three-stage cylindrical gear reducer can be optimized and designed parametrically in the software, which have the applicable significance of actual engineering and can be the base of the design of other kinds of gear reducer.

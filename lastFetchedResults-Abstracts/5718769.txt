The feasibility of a phase modulated optical OFDM upstream transmission employing IM/DD downstream for achieving a bidirectional transmission with symmetric data rate of 10 Gb/s over a single wavelength is investigated for a passive optical access network scenario. Upstream modulation is performed using a reflective semiconductor amplifier, and coherent detection is employed at the central office. The system performance is assessed in terms of transmission distance and possible back-reflections.

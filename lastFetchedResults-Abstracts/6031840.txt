In 1976 Diffie and Hellman gave the path breaking concept of public key cryptosystem. After that many public key cryptographic algorithms have been proposed based on single mathematical problem. Enhancing security is the major objective for public key cryptosystem on the basis of hardness of the intractable computational problem. To enhance security a new public key encryption scheme is designed based on two hard problems namely expressing a torsion point into linear combination of basis points and factoring. Since former is more complicate than solving ECDLP. So our proposed scheme is more secure than cryptosystems based on ECDLP and factoring. Therefore, this scheme is expected to gain a higher level of security. Developed scheme is more efficient with respect to encryption and decryption since it requires only minimal operations in both algorithms.

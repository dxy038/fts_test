We evaluate the capacity of an IEEE 802.16d and IEEE 802.11g testbed to simultaneously carry emulated H.264/AVC video and Speex VoIP and present results from an extensive measurement study. First, we employ two fixed WiMAX subscriber stations and one base station and report results for packet loss and one-way delay under both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight conditions. In addition, we put these results in perspective by repeating the experiments using an off-the-self IEEE 802.11g router. In particular, we use the IEEE 802.11g access point as an extension to the WiMAX network, a case often considered in simulation studies. Finally, we consider the IEEE 802.11g access network in isolation, and measure its capacity to carry video streams and emulated bidirectional VoIP calls simultaneously and compare it with the WiMAX access network.

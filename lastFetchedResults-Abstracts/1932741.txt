The aim of the present study was to evaluate the protective effect of l-glutamine (l-Gln) against cryopreservation injuries on boar sperm. In Experiment 1, l-Gln from 20 to 80 mM was evaluated as a supplement for a standard freezing extender (egg yolk – EY – 20%, and glycerol 3%). No significant improvement (P &gt; 0.05) was obtained for any post-thaw sperm parameter assessed (objective sperm motility – CASA system – and flow cytometric analysis of plasma and acrosomal membrane integrity −SYBR14/PI/PE-PNA− and plasma membrane stability −M540/YoPro1−). In Experiment 2, l-Gln was evaluated as a partial glycerol substitute in the freezing extender. Significant (P &lt; 0.05) enhancement of post-thaw sperm motion parameters was achieved in sperm frozen in the presence of 2% glycerol and 80 mM l-Gln compared to control (3% glycerol). In Experiment 3, l-Gln was evaluated as an EY substitute in the freezing extender, and no functional sperm were recovered after thawing sperm frozen in the presence of l-Gln and the absence of EY. In conclusion, l-Gln has the ability to cryoprotect boar sperm when it is used as a partial glycerol substitute in the freezing extender.

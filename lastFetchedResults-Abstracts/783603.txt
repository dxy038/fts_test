Background The objective of this study
was to follow the development of met and unmet
needs in a sample of severely mentally ill after the
1995 Swedish mental health care reform and to analyse
whether the efforts made by social services and
mental health care have been more adequate since the
reform. Method Inventories were made in 1995/1996,
2000/2001 and 2006 in an area of Sweden. A total of
171 persons who were considered to be severely
mentally ill both in 1995/1996 and 2006, using the
same criteria of definition, were interviewed using the
same form of interview and their needs were assessed
according to Camberwell Assessment of Need on all
three occasions. Results The number of met needs
had increased between 2006 and 1995/1996 and unmet
needs in important need-domains had decreased. The
changes in needs mostly referred to needs in the
factor ‘functional disability’. The degree of effort by
psychiatric care and social services had increased. The
number of wage-earners in the group had decreased
to almost zero and the degree of social isolation had
increased in 2006. Conclusions The target group had
made some progress referring to their functional
disability and the efforts from services had increased.
However, the integration in society had decreased in
fundamental aspects

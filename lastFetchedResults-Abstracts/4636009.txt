The exchange of independent information between two nodes in a wireless network can be viewed as a two-way traffic flow. Such information exchange can be efficiently performed by exploiting relaying technique in a two-way channel. In this paper, we introduce two novel relaying techniques for Bidirectional Amplification of the Throughput (BAT) relaying in wireless multi-hop networks, termed as Equalized Detect-and-Forward (EDF) and Pre-equalized Amplify-and-Forward (PAF) BAT relaying schemes respectively. It is shown that the EDF BAT relaying scheme can decrease the complexity of the relay node by equalizing at the relay node, and the PAF BAT relaying scheme can reduce the signaling overhead by pre-equalizing at the transmitter. Furthermore, we analyze the achievable throughput of these relaying schemes, considering the impact of the location of the relay node.

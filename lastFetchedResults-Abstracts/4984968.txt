We define the requirement of the visible-light communication (VLC) transceiver for bidirectional high-speed and short-range communications and examine its practicability. VLC transceivers were implemented with edge-emitting laser diode and silicon photo diode, designed primarily to operate in a full duplex mode at 120 Mbit/s. The design of an optical antenna was also included in this paper, which is to alleviate the performance degradation due to tilting. Their bit error rate performance was examined experimentally with respect to the transmission distance, the coverage range and the tilt degree.

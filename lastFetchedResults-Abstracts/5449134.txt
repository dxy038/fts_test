A scientific and rational evaluation on road-region ecosystem stability is the premise to properly deal with the relationship between highway constructing and ecological environment protecting to a continuable development. It is very important to properly select the evaluation indexes. Only on the basis of systematic analysis on highway environment problems and a rational indexes system, which can exactly extract the character parameter of the indexes and endow it with scientific evaluation criterion, can it makes the evaluation true and objective exactly reflecting the zoology status of the highway range. As a result, it can provide scientific and exact gist and suggestions for further regulation and control. Based on the connotative meaning and the procedure of evaluation on road-region ecosystem stability, this paper studied the principles and the method on determining the evaluation index system on road-region ecosystem stability. It put forward an index system for assessing road-region ecosystem stability as a reference, and discussed such problems to be solved as the evaluation criterions and evaluation methods and so on.

Objective: An accompaniment has been established between philosophy and science by cognitive science and obtained conceptually and empirically defensible theories of mind. Method: This article examines methodological changes that occurred in cognitive science and its implications in methods of research in education. Results: The results of this examination shows that although there are diverse methods in investigation of mind such as conceptual analysis, computational approach, methodological materialism, simulation and etc., there is no accurate distinction between philosophy and science. Hence, at least in two aspects, these fields could be tied each other: the first is that methods of science have philosophical assumptions and the other one is that philosophy should be based on empirical basis. Conclusion: Thus, innovation and implication of cognitive science for research in education will fall dawn the boundary among philosophical and scientific research and so philosophical research on education will be in the process of scientifically research in education.

Recently there has been much interest in slot antennas for microwave and millimeter wave applications. CPW-fed slots are one of the most popular kinds of antennas since they can be easily integrated with microwave integrated circuits (MICs) and monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) (Tsai, H.S. and York, R.A., 1996). Slot antennas have bidirectional radiation patterns. Unidirectional patterns can be achieved with the use of a reflector. This includes the cavity-backed slot design (Yeganeh, S.H. and Birtcher, C., 1993) or slot antennas on PBG (photonic bandgap) substrates (Yang, F. et al., 2000). It has been demonstrated that folded slot antennas have input impedances that can be easily matched with conventional transmission lines (Tsai and York). We present two types of modified folded slot antennas (MFSAs) which provide impedance bandwidths of 44% and 80% respectively within a VSWR of 2:1.

The objective of the paper is the search for algorithms to reduce the spatial-time complexity of dynamic programming. These algorithms have been verified in second-order continuous systems, with indexes of performance where the time explicitly appears. The use of such algorithms is vital when dealing with third-order systems and second-order stochastic systems.

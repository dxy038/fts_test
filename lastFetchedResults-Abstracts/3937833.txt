This paper proposes a novel constructive training algorithm for cascade neural networks. By reformulating the cascade neural network as a linear-in-the-parameters model, we use the orthogonal least squares (OLS) method to derive a novel objective function for training new hidden units. With this objective function, the sum of squared errors (SSE) of the network can be maximally reduced after each new hidden unit is added, thus leading to a network with less hidden units and better generalization performance. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm considers both the input weights training and output weights training in an integrated framework, which greatly simplifies the training of output weights. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by simulation results.

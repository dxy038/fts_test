This paper focuses on an a posteriori error estimator for FE approximations of 3D linear elasticity problems. The objective is to present the application of the new generation of error in constitutive relation to the calculation of the local error in classical tetrahedral elements. We show on examples whose solution is known analytically that the local error estimation gives satisfactory effectivity indexes.

Feed-water heating repowering is defined as using gas turbine(s) flue gasses energy for recovery
by steam plant feed water heaters. Minimizing related total cost in new thermal system is the critical subject,
beside of this purpose an optimal balance between capital cost investment and exergy destruction should be
considered. In this research feed water heating repowering modeling of Shahid Rajae steam plant has been
performed; in the next stage, optimization of mentioned system variables has been done based
on thermoeconomic objective functions. Then objective functions sensitive analysis in contrast of steam
turbines extraction flow rates have been performed and optimum amount of flow rate are determined by
using Genetic algorithm. As a result of this optimization, some of technical and economical system
properties have been upgraded. Thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency are anticipated to be 42.2 and 40.17
respectively and exergy destruction cost is increased about 1 to 16 percent; also it should be mentioned that
26 months has been derived for optimum period of preliminary capital return.

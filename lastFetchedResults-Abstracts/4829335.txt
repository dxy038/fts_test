An iterative algorithm for the design of multi-channel cosine-modulated quadrature mirror filter (QMF) banks with near-perfect reconstruction is proposed. The objective function is formulated as a quadratic function in each step whose minimum point can be obtained using a closed-form solution. This approach is very efficient and leads to filter banks with high stop-band attenuation and low aliasing and amplitude distortions. Two design examples are included to demonstrate the proposed algorithm and some comparisons are made with existing designs

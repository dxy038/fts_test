In this study, the potential use of the non-uniform FFT (NUFFT) in SAR imaging is analyzed. The main objective has been the improvement of the computational efficiency and image accuracy of seismic migration SAR processing. Different NUFFT methods have been implemented and tested in order to choose an adequate technique for the imaging problem. Our approach consists in substituting both the Stolt interpolation and the final range inverse FFT, in the &#969;-k algorithm, by a single NUFFT. Numerical simulations illustrate the performance of the new method and the influence of the selection of NUFFT parameters in the precision and computation time of the SAR imaging algorithm.

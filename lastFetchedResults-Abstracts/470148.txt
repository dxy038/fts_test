Objective
The study was undertaken to evaluate the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) in managing menorrhagia associated with hemostatic disorders.
Study design
Retrospective notes review.
Results
Nineteen of 28 (68%) patients experienced improvement with the LNG-IUS. There was nonacceptance by 9 of 28 (32%) who refused the LNG-IUS or had it definitively removed.
Conclusion
The LNG-IUS should be considered when managing menorrhagia because surgery carries additional risks in this subset of patients.

Human performance and supervisory control strategies were examined using the RoboFlag simulation environment. In an emulation of a multiple unmanned vehicle mission, a single operator supervised a team of six robots using automated modes or "plays" as well as manual control. Simplified form of a delegation type interface, Playbook, was used. Effects on user performance of two factors, opponent "posture" (offensive, defensive, or mixed) and environmental uncertainty (visual range of the robots: low, medium, or high), were examined in 18 participants who completed five mission trials in each of the nine combinations of these factors. Objective performance measures and subjective assessments of mental workload and situation awareness were obtained from each participant. Opponent posture had a significant effect on the percent of missions successfully completed and the duration of the games. Both opponent posture and visual range also significantly affected the use of manual and automated control strategies. Operator strategy selection and implementation are discussed with regard to performance data and the design of supervisory control interfaces that support flexible task delegation.

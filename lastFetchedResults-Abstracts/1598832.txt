New algorithms based on mixed integer programming formulations are proposed for reactive scheduling in a dynamic, make-to-order manufacturing environment. The problem objective is to update a long-term production schedule subject to service level and inventory constraints, whenever the customer orders are modified or new orders arrive. Different rescheduling policies are proposed, from a total reschedule of all remaining and unmodified customer orders to a non-reschedule of all such orders. In addition, a medium restrictive policy is considered for rescheduling only a subset of remaining customer orders awaiting material supplies. Numerical examples modeled after a real-world scheduling/rescheduling of customer orders in the electronics industry are presented and some results of computational experiments are reported.

The objective of the paper is to present the dependence of the wind profile of a monsoon on the depth of the layer, the ground surface roughness length, and the atmospheric stability. The paper also indicates that the wind profiles of the typhoon are composed of two layers, the upper one with the nearly constant velocity and the lower one in which the velocity decreases with the decrease in the height. The typhoon wind profiles are not stationary but changes abruptly.

The objective of this work is to describe the design and construction of an automated laboratory for electromagnetic radiation, which will be used in the study of the effects of radiation in living organisms, focusing the study in the effects of oncologic hyperthermia. Actually, there are no reports that describe the design of an automated laboratory of electromagnetic radiation for hyperthermia for a high range of frequency.

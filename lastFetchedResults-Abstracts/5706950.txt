This paper presents a circularly polarized slot-loop antenna excited by a dual-feed mechanism using metamaterial line. Wideband performance was achieved using slot perturbation in conjunction with dual feed. Return loss and axial-ratio bandwidths were measured as 86% and 36%, respectively. Bidirectional radiation was observed with a gain of 4.9 dBic.

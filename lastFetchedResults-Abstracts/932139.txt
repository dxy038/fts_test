The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence and occurrence of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in dairy products produced in Brazil. A total of 123 samples of three different groups of dairy products (cheese, yoghurt, and dairy drinks) consumed by Brazilians were collected during 2010. All samples including 58 cheese samples, 53 samples of yoghurt and 12 dairy drinks were purchased from grocery stores in the Ribeirão Preto-SP area. Cheese samples were classified into three categories depending on their moisture and fat contents: Minas Frescal cheese, Minas Frescal light cheese and Minas Padrão cheese. Samples were analyzed for AFM1 by a published method. The method comprised aqueous methanol extraction, immunoaffinity column purification and isolation, reversed phase liquid chromatography separation and fluorescence detection. AFM1 was detected in 84% of the analyzed cheese samples (>3 ng/kg) with levels ranging from 10 to 304 ng/kg in 67% of the samples. AFM1 was detected in 95% of the yoghurt and dairy drink samples with levels ranging from 10 to 529 ng/kg in 72% of the samples. Despite the lack of a Brazilian regulatory limit for AFM1 in yoghurt and dairy drinks the survey data of this study may offer information useful in the determination of whether the occurrence of AFM1 in Brazilian dairy products may be considered as a possible risk for consumer health and whether Brazilian regulatory guidelines for AFM1 in dairy products are needed.

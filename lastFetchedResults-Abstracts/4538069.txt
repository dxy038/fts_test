This paper focuses on side information (SI) refinement in Wyner-Ziv video coding and proposes to exploit the intrinsic property of channel coding for improving the joint decoding performance. In this paper, we propose to use syndrome and information bits from the encoder to help the decoder in refining the SI. We use extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis to deduce the mutual information variation in LDPC iterative decoding during the SI refinement process. The objective is to obtain the same decoding quality under lower coding rates. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

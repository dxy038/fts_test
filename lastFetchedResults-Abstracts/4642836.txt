This paper presents the DER aggregation solution that will be deployed in the frame of the Reflexe pilot project. This project brings together a consortium of industrial partners and research laboratories with the objective of examining all aspects of the commercial and industrial flexibility aggregation activity in order to provide energy and ancillary services to the grid through the market. The aggregation solution will provide functionality required by the technical and commercial aggregator roles. The technical functions supported by the solution include participant enrollment, flexibility modeling and flexibility activation, monitoring and control. The commercial functionality will provide the trader with decision support tools to build optimal bids based on the information provided by the technical aggregation functions. Monitoring and control functionality is intended to minimize penalties resulting from deviations from market obligations. The solutions developed in the project will be tested in a demonstration phase involving twenty commercial and industrial participants.

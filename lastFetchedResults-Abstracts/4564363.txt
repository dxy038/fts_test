In this paper, a modified clustering algorithm for fuzzy modeling is developed to overcome the scattered hyperplane-shaped clusters using fuzzy C-regression model. A new objective function for clustering is proposed by adding an item in the optimum cost function such that the resulting clusters are continuous, as well as hyperplane-shaped. Two examples are given to show the better modeling performance of the new clustering approach than the original one

The objective of this paper is to propose a current amplitude limitation control (CALC) strategy for the threephase Photovoltaic (PV) power system with the low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability. The PV power system with the proposed CALC strategy can output both demanded active and reactive power depending on the output power condition of the PV arrays and the power rating of the PV inverter. Therefore, the PV power system is able to continuously extract power from the PV arrays. When the voltage sag is eliminated, the PV inverter can quickly achieve its maximum power output. In this paper, the operational principle and the analytical derivation of the proposed CALC for the three-phase PV power system will be introduced in detail. Then, computer simulations are shown to verify the performance of the PV power system with the proposed CALC.

This paper presents the comparative performance analysis of various artificial immune networks applied to Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller design for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems. Four artificial immune networks (i.e, opt-aiNet, IA-AIS, AHAIS and AINe-SL) are used to find optimal controller parameters for multivariable PID controller design with/without decoupler. Four conventional objective functions with respect to error are taken into account. The simulation results indicate that AINet-SL is more efficient for such multivariable PID controller design compared to opt-aiNet, IA-AIS and AHAIS.

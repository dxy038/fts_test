The objective of this work was to evaluate the non-linearity (NL) and 5% offset or maximum load (5%-Max) criteria that are commonly used to define initiation in interlaminar fracture tests. This study is in the sequence of a previous paper where the mode I DCB and mode II ENF specimens were analysed. Finite element (FE) simulations of delamination growth were here performed for the mode II end-loaded split (ELS) and 4-point end-notched flexure (4ENF) tests. The results indicated that the formation of large process zones could affect significantly NL criteria. The maximum load point gave the most accurate toughness values, especially for the 4ENF specimen. Finally, present and previous results were compared to experimental data available in the literature.

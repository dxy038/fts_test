OBJECTIVE: The objective was to test the hypothesis that women with a recent history of preeclampsia have abnormalities in renal hemodynamics and volume status.
STUDY DESIGN: We studied a group of 26 primiparous women with history of preeclampsia and a group of 12 parous women with a history of uneventful pregnancies (control group). At least 4 months post partum we compared the following variables between these groups: effective renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, plasma volume, plasma concentration of active renin, plasma concentration of angiotensin II, plasma concentration of aldosterone, and plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide.
RESULTS: Both plasma volume and plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide were lower in the formerly preeclamptic group. Compared with the control subjects, the formerly preeclamptic group also had a lower effective renal plasma flow, a higher filtration fraction, and a higher renal vascular resistance. Intergroup differences in plasma concentration of active renin, plasma concentration of angiotensin II and plasma concentration of aldosterone were small and inconsistent.
CONCLUSIONS: Women with history of preeclampsia are relatively hypovolemic and tend to have lower effective renal plasma flow and higher renal vascular resistance and filtration fraction than do control subjects. These findings support the hypothesis that otherwise healthy women with a history of preeclampsia show abnormalities in their volume status and renal hemodynamics, irrespective of their blood pressure.

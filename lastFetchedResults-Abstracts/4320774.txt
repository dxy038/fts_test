The LTE (Long-Term Evolution) is a high-data rate open multimedia mobile system. In this paper, we consider the LTE QoS model framework and try to optimize the operator policy with regard to the radio use efficiency. Our objective is to propose a link between the PCRF (Policy Charging and Rules Function) decisions and the radio situation as an evolution for the LTE standard. We define a central database for the access network radio information that can be used for the operator policy choices. In this paper, we concentrate on the voice service, as a first step. Simple computations are provided. We show that our contribution can lead to a greater user average quality without loss of capacity. Other important openings are highlighted, promising interesting radio efficiency gains.

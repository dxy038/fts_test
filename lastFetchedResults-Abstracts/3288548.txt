In this paper, different path loss value have compared and present a statistical path loss model derived from modified propagation models for WCDMA system based on principal component analysis (PCA). The objective of this study is to improve the signal prediction for WCDMA networks. This paper begins with a review of the information available on the various concepts of path loss predication model, link budget and PCA. In addition to this one of the main characteristics of the radio channel - such as path loss is discussed. The mean square error (MSE) was calculated between measured path loss values and different predicated values such as COST231 model value, New PCA Path Loss value and the modified modes values. The study shows that the mean square error decreased 4.67 dB, 4.5 dB and 5.92 dB in sample site 1, 2 and 3 respectively. This result clearly shows that the proposed Principal Component Analysis method provided more accurate path loss value (improves signal prediction) in WCDMA network.

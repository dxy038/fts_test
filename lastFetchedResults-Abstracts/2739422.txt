This paper describes a new probabilistic model for generation and transmission expansion planning (G&amp;TEP) problem considering reliability criteria. Probabilistic reliability criteria accounts for random generator or line outages with known historical forced outage rates (FOR). The resultant model considers the installation and operation costs as well as the cost of expected energy not supplied (EENS) to optimally determine the number and location of new generating units and circuits in the network, power generation capacity for those units and the voltage phase angle at each node. Also, efficient linear formulations are introduced in this paper to deal with the nonlinear nature of the problem including objective functions and constraints. Modified 6-bus test system, IEEE 24-bus RTS and IEEE 118-bus test system are utilized to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

The objective of this work is to provide the necessary elements to back up the fact that Mexico has not increased its levels of competitiveness and it neither has equaled to other countries in the region. Therefore, it is required to implement comprehensive reforms in sectors such as education, infrastructure, healthcare, information technologies and telecommunications, among others. Some of the difficulties that prevent Mexico to improve its competitiveness levels, are the lack of incentives that drive for an increase in the school-study grades of the population, asymmetry in the coverage and service offering in telecommunications that have concentrated their commercial activity mainly on the main capital cities, lack of transparency and the need to accelerate evolution of the judicial system. In order to attain a coherent strategy and promote reforms in the sector, we will analyze different and yet related aspects such as the adjustments needed in regulations, the availability of Broadband Internetworking Technologies (BBINT), expansion of the Telecommunications Industry (TI) infrastructure, mobile mainly, the promotion mechanisms for innovation and the existence of good conditions for research and development on this BBINT arena, to mention only a few of them.

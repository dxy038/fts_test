In this paper, a Bayesian networks, BNs, approach to dialogue modelling is evaluated in terms of a battery of both subjective and objective metrics. A significant effort in improving the contextual information handling capabilities of the system has been done. Consequently, besides typical dialogue measurement rates for usability like task or dialogue completion rates, dialogue time, etc. we have included a new figure measuring the contextuality of the dialogue as the number of turns where contextual information is helpful for dialogue resolution. The evaluation is developed through a set of predefined scenarios according to different initiative styles and focusing on the impact of the userÂ´s level of experience.

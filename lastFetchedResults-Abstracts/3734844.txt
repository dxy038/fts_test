Hotspot traffic is common in metro ring networks connecting access networks with backbone networks, and these metro rings are also expected to support a mix of unicast, multicast, and broadcast traffic. Shortest path (SP) routing, as employed in the IEEE 802.17 Resilient Packet Ring (RPR), is widely considered for metro rings as it maximizes spatial reuse and, thus, the achievable packet throughput (capacity) for uniform traffic. In this paper, we analyze the capacity of bidirectional optical ring networks, such as RPR, employing SP routing for multicast (nonuniform) hotspot traffic (whereby unicast and broadcast are considered as special cases of multicast). We find that, when the traffic originating at the hotspot exceeds a critical threshold, then SP routing leads to substantial reductions in capacity to a value close to one simultaneous packet transmission. To overcome this limitation of SP routing, we propose a simple combined SP/one-copy routing Hotspot traffic is common in metro ring networks connecting access networks with backbone networks, and these metro rings are also expected to support a mix of unicast, multicast, and broadcast traffic.

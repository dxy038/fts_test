The objective of this article is to analyse critically a government proposal to privatize
the management of federally-run secondary schools in Nigeria. Although they have
performed relatively well over the years, recent problems have led to a decline in
academic standards in these schools. The article examines the potential merits
and demerits of the proposed public-private partnership with a view to assessing
whether the partnership can add value to the current public model. Although the
analysis falls short of endorsing the proposed reform, the article recommends its
phased implementation subject to the application of specific legal and practical considerations.
It argues that there are enforceable limits to changes in secondary education
policy and that the government has an obligation progressively to implement
free and compulsory secondary education. It also highlights a number of practical
matters meant to ensure that the best interests of any affected children will be
taken into account.

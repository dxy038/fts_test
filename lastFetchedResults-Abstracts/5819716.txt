In order to solve the problem of partitioning nodes into MIs (multicast islands) in overlay multicast network, a MI partitioning model is established. The model uses RTT (round trip time) of links and the network-accessing frequencies of nodes as properties to partition nodes to the nearest MSNs (multicast service nodes), namely, the centres of Mis. Also, the similarity degree between nodes and relevant MSNs and the objective function of MI are designed under fuzzy condition. Given MSNs, an optimal fuzzy recognition matrix is calculated and analyzed including its algorithm. Results from the simulation verify the feasibility and validity of the model.

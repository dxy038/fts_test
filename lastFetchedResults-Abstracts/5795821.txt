It´s necessary for the government to put out of the &#8220;visible hand&#8221; to have a strong macro-control. This paper proposes the government organise a kind of united exam on the same major of different colleges and link the test scores with various employment opportunities, through which we do hope to promote the students to fully achieve the objective of full quality employment.

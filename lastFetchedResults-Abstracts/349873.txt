Objective
To evaluated P300 (P3b) abnormalities in young first episode patients with schizophrenia and their healthy young siblings.
Methods
An auditory oddball paradigm was used to assess P300 in 53 patients, 27 unaffected siblings and 28 healthy controls. Amplitude and latency of the three midline sites (Fz, Cz, and Pz) were compared between patients, siblings, and controls by a mixed-effects regression model.
Results
P300 amplitude was significantly reduced in patients with schizophrenia but not in healthy siblings, when compared to healthy controls. P300 latency did not significantly differ between the three groups.
Conclusions
P300 amplitude but not latency was found to be affected in young patients with recent onset schizophrenia. However, P300 amplitude and latency were found not to be affected in healthy unaffected young siblings and, therefore, did not qualify as an endophenotype for schizophrenia.
Significance
The failure to find the P300 (P3b) abnormality in healthy siblings of patients with schizophrenia is an important finding and should be added to P300 literature.

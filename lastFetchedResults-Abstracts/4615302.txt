Individual packet losses can have differing impact on video quality. Simple factors such as packet size, average motion, and DCT coefficient energy can be extracted from an individual compressed video packet inside the network without any inverse transforms or pixel-level decoding. Using only such factors that are self-contained within packets, we aim to predict the impact on quality as measured by VQM (video quality metric) that the loss of this packet would entail. In the context of both compression artifacts and packet loss artifacts, we develop generalized linear models to predict VQM scores and our final model gives a good performance on objective evaluation of packet importance.

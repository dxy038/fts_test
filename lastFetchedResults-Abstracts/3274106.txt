For operational optimization of the iron ore beneficiation process which is a multi-stage process, the objective of each unit process (i.e. the operational indices) should be coordinated to fulfill the targets of global production indices. The relationship between the operational indices and the production indices is complex and it is difficult to be described using exact mechanism model, therefore the existing approaches cannot be used. To solve this problem, a multiobjective operational optimization approach for iron ore beneficiation process is proposed, which includes a multiobjective optimization module, a prediction based evaluation module and a dynamic regulation module. The proposed approach can generate the initial operational indices and then adjust it using the prediction information of production indices. The experiment based on the actual production data is carried out and results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

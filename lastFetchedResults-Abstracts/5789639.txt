In real optimization, we always meet the criteria of useful outcomes increasing or expenses decreasing and demands of lower uncertainty. Therefore, we usually formulate an optimization problem under conditions of uncertainty. In this paper, a new method for solving linear programming problems with fuzzy parameters in the objective function and the constraints based on preference relations between intervals is investigated. To illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method, a numerical example is presented.

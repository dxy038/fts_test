Wth a significant increase in the number of psychiatric patients, there has been a growing concern regarding the quality of medical care in psychiatric hospitals in Taiwan. Human resources and service quality, in particular, have drawn considerable public attention. As a result, the objective of this research is to study the relationship between medical care quality (human resources and service) and operating performance (technical efficiency, attractiveness measures, and progress indices). We formulate a mathematical model by integrating bounded-variable and context-dependent data envelopment analyses (BNV-DEA, CND-DEA respectively) and conduct an empirical study on 29 psychiatric institutes in Taiwan.

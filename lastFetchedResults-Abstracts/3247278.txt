Semicon Associates is a world-class producer of dispenser cathodes for traveling wave tubes, cathode ray tubes, ion lasers and space qualified cathode assemblies. The research objective is to allow Semicon Associates to determine the effects of mass load on cathode etching and Hydrogen (H) gas consumption during the impregnation process. Hydrogen (H) is a chemical element with symbol H, atomic number 1 and a molecular formula of H<sub>2</sub>. Hydrogen is naturally occurring and is rare on Earth because it readily forms covalent compounds with most elements.

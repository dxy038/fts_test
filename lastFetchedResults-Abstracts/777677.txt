The objective of this paper was to determine if three different direct normal irradiance (DNI) models were sufficiently accurate to
determine if concentrating solar power (CSP) plants could meet the utility electrical load. DNI data were measured at three different
laboratories in the United States and compared with DNI calculated by three DNI models. In addition, utility electrical loading data
were obtained for all three locations. The DNI models evaluated were: the Direct Insolation Simulation Code (DISC), DIRINT, and
DIRINDEX. On an annual solar insolation (e.g. kW h/m2) basis, the accuracy of the DNI models at all three locations was within:
7% (DISC), 5% (DIRINT), and 3% (DIRINDEX). During the three highest electrical loading months at the three locations, the monthly
accuracy varied from: 0% to 16% (DISC), 0% to 9% (DIRINT), and 0% to 8% (DIRINDEX). At one location different pyranometers
were used to measure GHI, and the most expensive pyranometers did not improve the DNI model monthly accuracy. In lieu of actually
measuring DNI, using the DIRINT model was felt to be sufficient for assessing whether to build a CSP plant at one location, but use of
either the DIRINT or DIRINDEX models was felt to be marginal for the other two locations due to errors in modeling DNI for utility
peak electrical loading days â€“ especially for partly cloudy days.

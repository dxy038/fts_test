Study objective: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration developed the EMS (emergency medical services) Technical Assessment Program to assist states in developing and improving their EMS systems. The main goals of this evaluation were to document the level of improvement in EMS system development following completion of the Technical Assessment Program and to identify necessary program improvements at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Design: Independent investigators retrospectively reviewed the information in Technical Assessment Program reports from 35 states that participated in the program during a 5-year period. Results: Training and certification programs for prehospital personnel were the most well-developed elements of EMS systems. Conversely, comprehensive quality management and EMS system evaluation programs were almost uniformly absent (89% of states). Areas of need targeted for improvement included enabling legislation for EMS (60%) or trauma system development (69%), an improved mechanism to assess system resources (71%), an established or updated state EMS plan (80%), aging and unreliable communications equipment (89%), fully operational prehospital data collection systems (89%), and consistent medical oversight for all prehospital providers (92%). Conclusion: Program evaluation revealed that significant recommendation-based changes occurred in all components of EMS systems. The Technical Assessment Program is one tool that states can use to promote EMS system improvements.

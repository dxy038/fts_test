The proposed scheme in this paper combines adaptive channel coding with additional duplicate packets. Adaptive channel coding takes place by: varying the amount of redundancy according to channel conditions; and by retransmission of extra redundant data to reconstruct corrupted packets. In video streaming, greater bandwidth efficiency occurs by transmitting the same video quality at a reduced bitrate. This paper shows that the proposed protection scheme for data-partitioned video achieves that objective when streaming over an IEEE 802.16e (mobile WiMAX) channel.

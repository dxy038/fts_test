Background: The oral methoxsalen plus UVA (Ultraviolet Radiation A) is used for the management and treatment of psoriasis. Psoriasis is a common skin disease that can be treated with this drug. Due to the teratogenic effects of methoxsalen, the main objective of this research is to investigate the effect of methoxsalen on rat liver. Methods: A total of 50 adult female Wistar rats, aged approximately 10 weeks and mean weight was 15 Â± 200 g. The rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: control, sham and experimental groups receiving (mg/kg 5, 10 and 20) drug methoxsalen, which was given to rats by gavage for 21 days, were used. At the end of the experiment, mice in all groups, and describe the changes in hepatocytes, cell necrosis, and ballooning lymphocytic invasion of liver cells in different groups were compared. The results showed that the experimental group 1 lymphocytic invasion, hydropic swelling, granular cells, a central venous congestion is observed. Experimental group 2 cell necrosis, lymphocytic invasion, hydropic swelling, granular cell wall and nuclear changes were observed. Cell necrosis in experimental group 3, invade lymphocytes, granular cells, increase Kupfer cells, the nuclear chromatin and wall were observed. Conclusions: Methoxsalen have devastating effects on liver morphology and liver hepatocytes and sinusoids.

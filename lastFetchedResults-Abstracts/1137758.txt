Electronic equipment systems are precision system. There are some vibrations and impact in moving vehicles for road environments. Therefore, shock absorber is significant in protection of electronic equipment in moving vehicles. The objective of this paper is to provide a systematic investigation to design or evaluation of a shock absorber for protection of electronic equipment system in harsh vibration-impact environment. A novel Si-oil coupling damping shock absorber is designed and manufactured through coupling Si-oil, rubber ball and spring by ingenious tactics. The physical mechanism of a prototype shock absorber is systematically investigated by dynamic test. A nonlinear dynamic model for the shock absorber is presented by analyzing the internal fluid dynamic phenomenon with respect to the prototype. Comparisons between experimental data and simulation result confirm the validity of the model. In the meantime, evaluation of the importance of some key factors by using the mathematical model for designing is discussed. It shows amplitude and frequency of excitation, as well as fluid viscosity, ratio of damping area are the key factors to ensure the performances of the shock absorber. The change of these factors will change the working characteristics and performances of the shock absorber.

Microstrip-feed enables possible integration of dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) with other microwave circuits in a planar arrangement. In the past critical coupling of microstrip-coupled DRA is found by experimentally adjusting the position of the DRA with respect to the microstrip line. The objective of the study reported in this paper is to provide an insight of how a microstrip line could efficiently couple electromagnetic energy to a rectangular dielectric resonator antenna (RDRA) on different PCB substrates. Antenna parameters under investigation include the resonant frequency, return loss, impedance bandwidth and the co- to cross-polarisation levels. The PCB substrates investigated include RT/duroid 5880 and FR4 of different thicknesses. The results of this study are presented.

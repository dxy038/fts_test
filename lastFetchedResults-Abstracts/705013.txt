This paper reviews 10 yearsâ€™ experience with schistosomiasis control in different endemic settings in Africa, Asia and the Americas. Research projects, pilot programs and long-term large-scale programs with the objective of controlling morbidity have been included in the review. Major advances in diagnostic tools and rapid assessment techniques have evolved during the decade making it possible to follow changes in pathology after treatment and to get baseline epidemiological information at very low cost. At the same time prices of drugs like praziquantel has declined dramatically (to <US$ 0.10 per tablet). Equipment for indicators of morbidity due to Schistosoma haematobium (e.g. urine reagent strips for micro-haematuria) have also become cost-effective. Cheap and simple parasitological methods for examination of urine and stool specimens have now been available for almost two decades. The impact of different control strategies on morbidity and the duration of the effects on pathology have been reviewed and suggestions for new treatment and re-treatment strategies are made based on the existing experience from different regions and countries.

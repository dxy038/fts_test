With several developments in the communication devices and increasing complexity of its system functions it is very important for one to test the device before it is actually deployed in an industry. In this project the primary objective is to test a Satellite data Configuration Module (S.C.M) for its system functions automatically without any human operation. In order to achieve this objective, various methodologies that are currently being used for automated testing and in particular the usage of LabVIEW for automated testing were explored. By implementing automated testing the human errors are eliminated and the time consumed to perform the tests can be drastically reduced. Based on this research, automated test equipment was developed and LabVIEW programs were developed using this system.

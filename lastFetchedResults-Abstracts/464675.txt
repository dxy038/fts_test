OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to study the feasibility of conservatively managing selected cases of dysplasia involving endocervical cone margins. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of patients conservatively managed after being found to have squamous cell dysplasia involving the endocervical margins of their cervical cone biopsy specimens. In phase I patients who had cold-knife conization with positive endocervical margins underwent repeat Papanicolaou smears and colposcopy, with biopsies and endocervical curettage as indicated. Those found free of disease were followed up with frequent Papanicolaou smears. In phase II patients with dysplasia to the endocervical resection edges on loop electrical excision procedure biopsy specimens were followed up with frequent cytologic studies. RESULTS: In phase I, 31 patients with positive endocervical margins on cold-knife conization and no evidence of dysplasia on reevaluation were followed up for 1 to 18 years. Dysplasia was detected in one patient during cytologic surveillance. In phase II, 11 patients were followed up for 12 to 31 months; only one patient has dysplasia. CONCLUSION: Selected patients with squamous cell dysplasia at endocervical cone biopsy margins may avoid additional surgery. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1996;174:1695-700.)

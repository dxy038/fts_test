Background and Objective: Linear growth is one of the most important criteria of general public health. As a micronutrient, zinc is known to affect linear growth. Considering the low prevalence of zinc deficiency in Zanjan, analysis of the impact of zinc deficiency in children with short stature in this province could provide valuable information. The aim of this study was to compare the serum concentration of Zinc in children with short stature and those with normal growth in Zanjan.
Materials and Methods: This case–control study was conducted on two groups of school children under the age of 15, including 50 subjects with short stature, who were randomly selected from the patients of endocrine clinic of Vali-e-asr general hospital, and 50 normal-growth children. Normal subjects were selected from the cases classmates with the same socioeconomic situation. After collection of general health data and anthropometric measurements, blood samples were taken to detect serum concentrations of zinc in all of the participants.
Results: One hundred children, including 50 males and 50 females, with a mean age of 10.2±3 years were investigated. Serum concentrations of zinc were significantly lower in the subjects with short stature (94±23.1 µg/dl vs. 110.9±12.4 µg/dl in normal subjects; p: 0.001).  A significant positive correlation was found between serum concentrations of zinc and the height of the subjects in both groups (r: 0.2, p: 0.02).
Conclusion: There is a positive correlation between serum zinc concentration and the height of the children even in the zinc sufficient areas like Zanjan. Future studies for analysis of the impact of zinc supplementation on the growth velocity of subjects with zinc deficiency are recommended.

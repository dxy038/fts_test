The objective of this paper is to analyze some factors influencing the performance of different farmer parallel programs, developed for the hierarchical Kalman filtering. During our research we systematically modified a number of hardware and/or software parameters which characterize the farmer and we have shown that these modifications has a reduced influence to linear speed-up rate

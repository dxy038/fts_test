Robust optimization is conventionally defined as the collection of the possible problem solutions that can ensure acceptable
performances and sufficient immunity against the effects of uncertain parameter variability. Methods proposed until
now use a probabilistic way to model uncertainty and to quantify the final sensitivity. In this work, a fuzzy uncertainty
modellization is adopted for structural engineering. In particular, to define solution performance scattering, the fuzzy
entropy is used as a global measure of variable dispersion. The final formulation of the problem deals with two antithetical
objective functions, the fuzzy expected value of structural performance and its fuzzy entropy. This fuzzy-based approach in
robust design is able to give a set of Pareto optimal solutions in terms of structural efficiency and sensitivities regarding
uncertainty, and represents a suitable tool in supporting the decision maker. Finally, different applications have been developed
to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.

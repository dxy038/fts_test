In this paper, based on the stochastic optimization theory, we add dynamic constraint condition of objective function to chance constrained programming model. Through compound dynamic constraint of expectation and variance, we establish a kind of stochastic optimized model which has guiding significance. We also show that under certain condition, this new model is a convex programming and get the algorithm of this model.

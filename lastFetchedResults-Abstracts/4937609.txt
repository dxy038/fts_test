The e-model is a computational tool standardized by the ITU and developed to estimate the quality of VoIP communications. The objective of this model is to determine a voice quality rating that incorporates the quality of encoding processes and the mouth-to-ear characteristics of a path along a given call. The model was originally developed for narrowband 4-kHz telephony. This paper discusses a new methodology for extending the e-model to wideband 7-kHz communications.

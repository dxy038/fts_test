In the Coqos project task performance measures and a corresponding framework are suggested and pursued as a novel and more suitable means for determining utility curves. TPM are intended to avoid limits inherent in traditional measures like mean opinion scores. MOS rely merely on subjective ratings rather than on more objective performance in relation to a particular task or application of interest. Informational relevance and its impact on subjects can be measured more effectively by TPM. Inhibiting psychological and cognitive effects like consciousness or nonconsciousness of degradations or individual focusing and perspectives of subjects can be more appropriately evaluated and dealt with by means of TPM. The increasing importance of adaptation, in particular with the advance of MPEG4, as a means for QoS provisioning, both in wireless and wired environments, requires sensible techniques to effectively determine utility curves

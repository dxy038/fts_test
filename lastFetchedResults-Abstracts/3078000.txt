In this paper, we propose a high-resolution image reconstruction algorithm to reduce the distortion in the reconstructed high-resolution image due to the inaccuracy of motion estimation. For this purpose, we analyze the noise caused by the inaccurate motion information. Based on this analysis, we propose a new regularization functional. The proposed algorithm requires no prior information about the original image or the inaccurate motion information. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional approaches with respect to both objective and subjective criteria

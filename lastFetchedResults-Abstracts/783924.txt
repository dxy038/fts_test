Background Understanding the determinants of major
depression in sub-Saharan Africa is important for planning
effective intervention strategies.
Objective To investigate the social and life-event determinants
of major depressive disorder in the African
sociocultural context of rural Uganda.
Methods A cross-section survey was carried out in 14
districts in Uganda from 1 June 2003 to 30 October 2004.
4,660 randomly selected respondents (15 years and above)
were interviewed. The primary outcome was the presence
of ‘probable major depressive disorder’ (PMDD) as
assessed by the Hopkins symptom checklist.
Results The prevalence of PMDD was 29.3% (95%
confidence interval, 28.0–30.6%). Factors independently
associated with depression in both genders included: the
ecological factor, district; age (increase with each age
category after 35 years); indices of poverty and deprivation
(no formal education, having no employment, broken
family, and socioeconomic classes III–V). Only a few
adverse life events, notably those suggestive of a disrupted
family background (death of a father in females and death
of a mother in males) were associated with increased risk.
Conclusion Socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors,
operating at both ecological and the individual level
are the strongest independent determinants of depression.
Adverse life events were less strongly associated with
depression in this sample.

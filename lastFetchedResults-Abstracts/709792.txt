Background
This cross-sectional study addresses the relationship between organisational and social factors and burnout in a group of registered and assistant nurses in Sweden.
Objective
The main objective of the study was to analyse the relationship (and the specific relationship patterns) between three different work-related sources of social support and Maslach's three burnout dimensions, while taking the dimensions in the Karasek job-demand-control model, emotional demands, workload outside the work situation and demographic factors into account.
Data and method
Data was collected using a questionnaire which was based on validated instruments, in accordance with the job-demand-control model and Maslach's Burnout Inventory. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and three hierarchical regression analyses were conducted using a sample of 1561 registered and assistant nurses in Sweden.
Results
The results showed statistically significant correlations between the three support indicators and all three burnout dimensions. In the regression analyses, co-worker and patient support were statistically significantly related to all three burnout dimensions, whereas supervisor support was only statistically significantly related to emotional exhaustion. In accordance with prior findings, high levels of psychological demands were most strongly related to high emotional exhaustion. Further, high levels of emotional demands showed the strongest correlations with high personal accomplishment.

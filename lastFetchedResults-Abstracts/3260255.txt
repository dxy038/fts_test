Video transmission over wireless networks suffers from packet loss due to either packet drop or fading-induced bit errors. Temporal error concealment (EC) is an useful video coding technique to recover the errors in video transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for temporal EC for H.264 over wireless networks. The proposed framework combines the properties of Inter Mode in H.264 Inter frame and motion inpainting in the computer vision community. In the framework, modes of the correctly received surrounding blocks of the corrupted macroblocks (MBs) are checked first. Then, according to the modes, we divide into four EC methods to conceal the corrupted MBs , which include 4 &#215; 4 blocks motion inpainting, 8 &#215; 8 blocks motion inpainting, the boundary matching algorithm and zero motion vector (MV) based EC method. Experimental results on several videos show that the proposed method has good objective and subjective video quality performance, whilst also being with low computation cost.

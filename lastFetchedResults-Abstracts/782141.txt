Historically, several goat breeds and types have been introduced into Brazil with the intention
of increasing goat production efficiency. Selection and multiplication of genotypes
appropriate to several production systems found in the country have been important to
the development of the goat sector in Brazil. Until 2002 there were no formal breeding
programs for goats in the country. Attempts for genetic improvement were concentrated
in animal importations and in isolated crossbreeding. This paper assesses the main aspects
of goat production in Brazil and presents the establishment of breeding programs for meat
and dairy goats. Breeding Program for Meat Goats and Sheep (GENECOC) were started in
2003 with the objective of supporting breeders on the utilization of the available genetic
resources to optimize their production systems. Nowadays only seven flocks of goats are
enrolled in this program. These flocks are located in States of Ceará (Northeast region),
Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul (South region). In 2005, EMBRAPA (Empresa Brasilerira de
Pesquisa Agropecuaria), the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation, started the Dairy
Goat Breeding Program. The program aimed to structure the dairy goat national databank
and conduct the progeny tests for the main dairy breeds raised in the country. Semen from
five Saanen, three Anglo-Nubian and two French Alpine goats was collected and distributed
among 15 collaborator flocks. Official Dairy Control Tests have been accomplished in eleven
flocks in the states of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo (Southeast region). Many
difficulties were faced in the implementation of goats breeding programs in Brazil. The
results are not readily available, but the perspectives are promising. Goat breeders’ interest
has been increasing and the actions have been expanded to other regions of the country,
while a large number of institutions have shown interest in collaborating with these
breeding programs.

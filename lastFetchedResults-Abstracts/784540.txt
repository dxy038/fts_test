Objective: It has previously been demonstrated that oral administration of ovine Colostrinin™ (CLN),
a proline-rich polypeptide isolated from ovine colostrum, can effectively treat Alzheimer’s disease patients. This
study aims to determine whether CLN has effects on the aggregation and toxicity of synthetic ß-amyloid (Aß),
implicated as a causative agent of AD. Design & measurements: Using cell assays, we examined if pre-treatment
of neuronal cells with CLN confers protection. Results: The data from cytotoxicity assays (using MTT and LDH)
demonstrated that pre-treatment of human neuronal SHSY-5Y cells with 5 μg/ml CLN, for 24 hours, confers
neuroprotection against Aß-induced neurotoxicity. Twenty-four hour pre-treatment with 5 μg/ml CLN was also
shown to reduce Aß 1-40-induced apoptosis in human neuronal cells as determined via qualitative and
quantitative apoptosis assays. Conclusion: The neuroprotection conferred with CLN pre-treatment was reduced
with the Fas ligand (FasL) binding antibody Nok1, suggesting that the effects of CLN may involve a Fas:soluble
FasL interaction. These findings indicate that CLN could possibly play a role in the prevention of AD
pathogenesis, though the inhibition of Fas-mediated apoptosis.

In this paper, we have developed a project scheduling approach to analyze the operational mode for an information technology intelligence organization during a time of crisis. The paper assumes that the number of servers and the steady-state average waiting times at each node (characterized by GI/G/s queues) of the organization network are computed a priori. Under standard assumptions of the program evaluation and review technique (PERT), the organization network is transformed into an activity-on-arc digraph. The problem of meeting a shortened deadline for projects during a time of crisis is formulated via an optimization model with a nonlinear cost time tradeoff objective function. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to gain insights on the effect of input data on the objective function. A generic example from the Canadian Forces Geomatics division is employed to illustrate the methodology.

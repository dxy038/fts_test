The objective of this investigation was to examine the effectiveness of a magnetic ion exchange resin (MIEX®) to enhance the coagulation of disinfection by-product precursors in nine surface waters, each representing a different element of the USEPA's 3×3 enhanced coagulation matrix. The effect of MIEX-pretreatment on the requisite alum dose needed for subsequent coagulation of turbidity was also evaluated.
Enhanced coagulation with MIEX was found to be very effective for removing trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HAA) precursors from the nine waters examined. THM and HAA formation potential was reduced by more than 60% in all of the waters studied; reductions approaching 90% were seen in the waters with the highest specific ultraviolet absorbance values. The residual total organic carbon concentration, ultraviolet absorbance, and THM and HAA formation potential were all substantially lower as a result of MIEX and alum treatment compared to alum coagulation alone. MIEX pre-treatment also lowered the coagulant demand of each of the waters substantially.

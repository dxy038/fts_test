The authors propose the de Bruijn graph (dBG) as a topology for multi-hop lightwave networks and their hierarchical structures. Three routing algorithms that would progressively improve on the mean path length and network throughput-delay performance are studied under various topological variations and locality factors. The study shows that the performance of the bidirectional dBG networks and their hierarchical derivatives are desirable and are comparable to other types of multi-hop systems. Therefore, they are candidates for metropolitan area networks

Hostility has been associated with coronary heart disease, and hostility may affect coronary risk through its influence on risk factors such as cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. The objective of this study was to determine relationships between hostile personality, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption in the general population. The Edinburgh Artery Study comprises a cross-sectional survey of 1592 men and women aged 55–74 years sampled from age-sex registers of 10 general practices throughout the city. The Bedford-Foulds Personality Deviance Questionnaire was used to elicit extrapunitiveness (including hostile thoughts), dominance (including hostile acts) and intropunitiveness. Social class, age and deprivation score were controlled for in multivariate analyses. The hostile thoughts scale emerged as a significant independent predictor of alcohol consumption in men and women (P ≤ 0.01), and the models accounted for 4–9% of the variance in alcohol consumption. Hostile acts were independently predictive of smoking in men (P  ≤ 0.001), with the model accounting for 5% of the variance in smoking. Hostile thoughts were independently predictive of smoking in women (P  ≤ 0.001), and the model accounted for 4% of the variance in their smoking. We conclude that hostility may affect coronary risk through its influence on lifestyle-related coronary risk factors, although in future further elucidation of hostility type and standard measurement of hostility are necessary.

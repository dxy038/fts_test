To increase the number of users of mobile communications we propose to incorporate directional sensitivity trough the use of an antenna array. The objective is to estimate the signal arriving from a desired emitter in the presence of noise and interfering signals. The methods we analyse in this paper perform spatial filtering to separate signals that have overlapping frequency content but originate from different spatial location. In order to increase sensitivity we propose in this paper to use high resolution array processing techniques, instead of traditional beamforming. Comparisons of these methods are made with simulations corresponding to situations which occurs in mobile communication systems.

In order to satisfy the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of the business application, this paper presents an asynchronous replication protocol with RPO guarantee (ARPRG). ARPRG can guarantee the RPO of business application by taking account of the criticality of replicated data and the dynamic changes of network status. In addition, ARPRG improves the data consistency by deleting the redundant write requests. It is proved by experiments that ARPRG affords high performance very close to the asynchronous replication protocol. It is useful to construct a practical replication system with RPO guarantee.

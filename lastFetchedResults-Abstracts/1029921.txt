Boron compounds generally produce a battery with high energy density. Since boron is an excellent conductor of electricity a battery with a high power density can also be achieved. With this objective, the electrochemical characteristics of boron carbide (B4C) added manganese dioxide (MnO2) for use as a cathode in alkaline battery were investigated during the dischargeâ€“charge process. Results of electrochemical measurements, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy show that boron aids the formation of lithium intercalated MnO2 (LixMnO2) during discharge with some degree of reversibility, however, capacity fade and a steep voltage profile is observed. The addition of boron nitride (BN) improved the discharge performance and characteristics of the cell are also compared and discussed.

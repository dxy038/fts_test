The e-health domain has for objective to assist and manage citizens health. It concerns many actors like patient, doctors, hospitals and administration. Current and forthcoming generations of application will be web based and will integrate more and more mobile devices. In such application domain, dependability is a key notion. This paper presents, through a case study, how we can develop an application that controls the insulin injection and that is embedded in a mobile device belonging to an e-health Web Information System (WIS). In order to ensure the dependability of the control systems, we show how to use coordinated atomic actions (CAA). In order to implement our design, we explain how to use a development framework that we have made to implement CAA, which originally was not tailored for mobile fault-tolerant applications. Thus, in this paper, we also explain how we have adapted and used CAA-DRIP for mobile devices.

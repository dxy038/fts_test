In TDMA networks, Reference Burst generated in a primary station is very important because it gives all nodes timing reference and frequency/timing information to enact acquisition and synchronization in the receiver. Therefore Reference Burst mostly has one or more substitutes. In case of military communication, the primary station and its substitutes could be destroyed, so there would be no Reference Burst. In spite of this problem that there is no Reference Burst, communication network has to guarantee TDMA network survivability. The objective of this paper is to present the method of the TDMA network synchronization maintenance when Reference Burst is vanished. By tracking the time difference between virtual beam center point and individually received ranging data, and using the accumulated local frequency difference estimation before the Reference Burst was vanished, we could maintain TDMA network synchronization for a long time although the station was on the move under severe channel distorted circumstance.

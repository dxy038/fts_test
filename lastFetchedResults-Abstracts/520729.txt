In building codes, it is considered that the overall stability of the structural system and it's compressive members should be satisfied safely. The effective length factor method is used commonly. In this method for any individual column with various end conditions in structural system, the effective length factor is estimated analytically and then the critical load is determined, critical load is used for design, in this case, it is assumed that structural system is stable. The objective of current study is related to this point that the stability of individual columns does not reflect the overall stability of the structural system and also the available and commonest method in this field is investigated.

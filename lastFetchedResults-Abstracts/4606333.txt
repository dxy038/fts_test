Within the traditional mass spec instrumentation field there is ongoing interest in new atmospheric ion source designs for more effective and versatile ion generation. The objective of the present study is to apply organic MEMS microfabrication technologies to generation of atmospheric pressure ion optical devices. We have devised novel materials, processes, and designs for micro ion optical systems for control of ions within sources, and across apertures and conductance arrays. PCBMEMS using LCP have been used in the construction of the devices. Vacuum compatibility of the polymeric material has been found to be similar to glass in performance characteristics. Processes for shaping the polymer dielectric for fluid flow control and the metallization for electrical field control have been devised. Different geometries, both tubular and planar, combined with electrical field shaping circuitry and fluidic flow control networks are part of the effort.

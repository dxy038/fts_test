Many engineering components are subjected to erosive wear at elevated temperature. As erosive wear at elevated temperature is governed by the synergistic effect of erosive wear and oxidation, it is possible to modify surfaces of the components in order to achieve improved performances. In view of the above, two different types of hardfacing alloys of Fe–Cr–C were designed incorporating Nb, Mo and B to ensure improved performances at elevated temperature. In order to achieve the above objective, mild steel was hardfaced with these alloys under optimised gas metal arc welding (GMAW) condition. The microstructures of the hardfaced coating was characterised with the help of optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The mechanical properties of these coatings were obtained by means of micro indenter. Erosive wear of these coatings was evaluated for four different temperatures, for two different impact angles and at one impact velocity. The morphologies and the transverse sections of the worn surfaces are examined with SEM. The erosive wear of these coatings were compared with conventional M2 tool steel. Results indicate that erosion rate of these coatings increases with increase of test temperature and impact angles. Among various coatings, Fe–Cr–C coating containing higher amount of Nb, Mo and B exhibits best erosion resistance particularly at elevated temperature.

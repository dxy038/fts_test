The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) provides the Long Term Evolution (LTE) standards for the fourth generation (4G) wireless communication systems. Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) and Orthogonal Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) are the two major techniques used in LTE. The main drawback of OFDMA over SC-FDMA is its high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Hence OFDMA is used in the downlink of the fourth generation (4G) wireless communication systems for its high spectral efficiency and high PAPR. SC-FDMA is used in the uplink of the fourth generation (4G) wireless communication systems since it is more power efficient. The main objective of this paper is to design optimum physical layer architecture of a high data rate LTE uplink transceiver using SC-FDMA multiple access scheme with error correction mechanism using Low dense parity check codes (LDPC) to provide lesser Bit Error Rate (BER) and avoiding packet loss by Interleaving. The optimum physical layer architecture for the fourth generation (4G) wireless communication systems is chosen by comparing the LDPC coded SC-FDMA with the LDPC coded OFDMA. The chosen architecture must be more power efficient and support high data rates, which is the main prerequisite for the mobile user.

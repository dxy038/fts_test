There exist various guidelines for facilitating the design, preparation, and deployment of accessible e-learning applications and contents. However, such guidelines address accessibility in a rather technical sense, without giving sufficient consideration to the cognitive aspects and issues related to the use of e-learning materials by learners with disabilities. The paper sketches the methodological guidelines of a design framework based on involving the users with disabilities, as well as pedagogical experts, in the e-learning content development process. The underlying objective is to increase the potential to realize learning systems that better meet different user needs and that provide a more satisfying learning experience.

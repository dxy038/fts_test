Background: The purpose of orthotics prescription for children with cerebral palsy (CP) is to affect body structure and to help their function. Dynamic orthotics is a new generation of orthotics in gait rehabilitation of children with CP. 
Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of neoprene dynamic orthoses on motor function of children with spastic diplegic CP.
Methods: This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 16 children with spastic diplegic CP at University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation, during 2010-11. Standard tests have been used for evaluating the walking speed and the gait variation in children. Muscle spasticity and knee range of motion were assessed by modified Ashworth’s scale and electro-goniometry. Data were analyzed by Kolmogorov Smirnov test and paired T-test.
Findings: Knee joint angle, walking speed and gait variation were -18.31±4.61 (degree), -0.50±1.82 (m/s) and 4.18±1.51, respectively. The triceps surae muscle spasticity was 1.56±0.34. After application of the orthoses, the differences of walking speed and muscle spasticity were not significant but the differences of knee joint angle and gait variation were statistically significant (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: With regard to the results, Neoprene dynamic orthoses can improve the gait variation and knee joint kinematic but it is not effective on muscle spasticity and walking speed.

Summary form only. The author describes the implementation of an in-vehicle navigation and location system coupled, via a bidirectional UHF data communications link, with a base monitoring and dispatch system. The structure of the in-vehicle system, using dead reckoning and GPS for navigation, is presented. The results of dynamic tests showing the system performance with and without dead reckoning and the system improvements using GPS navigation in the differential mode are presented. Digital mapping and vehicle guidance are shown as they appear on the in-vehicle color liquid crystal display. The implementation of the digital map database stored in CD ROM, differential GPS, and the ability of the system to operate in various reference modes are discussed. Two commercial applications and one military application are presented.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

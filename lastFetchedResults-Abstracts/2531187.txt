Objective(s): Our previous studies have shown that MgO nanoparticles (MgO NPs) could improve anxiety and reduce pain in animals. In this study, the effect of co administration MgO NPs and vitamin C on anxiety like behavior and nociception in postpartum depression (PPD) model were investigated.Materials and Methods:  Female mice (27 ± 3 g) were divided into groups: two control groups, PPD groups:  saline or MgO NPs 1, 5, 10 mg/kg (acute/ chronic), vitamin C 5 and 25 mg/kg (acute) alone or co-injected with MgO NPs 5 (acute). For induction of PPD, chronic injection of progesterone for 5 days was used and three days after progesterone withdrawn (PWD), the depression behavior was evaluated by tail suspension test. Elevated plus maze and hot plate tests were used for evaluation of anxiety and pain perception, respectively. Results: PWD induced anxiety and acute injection of MgO NPs 5 reduced anxiety while chronic injection increased anxiety (P<0.05). Acute and chronic injections of MgO NPs 10 increased anxiety (P<0.05, PConclusion: Effects of MgO NPs on anxiety like behavior induced by PWD, is depends on dose and usage duration. Probably usage of antioxidant can improve efficacy of MgO NPs on anxiety reduction and nociception.

In this paper, a supply chain network design problem is explained which contains environmental concerns in arcs and nodes of network. It is assumed that there are some routes such as road, rail, etc., in each pair of nodes. In this model decision variables are choosing facilities to open, environmental investment level in each facility and flow of products between nodes in each route. A multi-objective optimization model is proposed in this paper to capture the trade-off between the total cost and the environment influence. Some simulated numerical examples are considered to evaluate the model and the solution approach. Comparisons verify the suitability of the model and solution approach.

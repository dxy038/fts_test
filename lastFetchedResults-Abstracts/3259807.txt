In this paper, we introduce a new framework for Intra-Frame spatial error concealment. It is based on a method of multilevel matching which divides the lost areas into several sections and recovers every section by adaptive interpolation. It contains three steps: 1) A line growing based segmentation algorithm is used to detect the edge points in the neighbouring lines of the lost areas; 2) A multi-level edge points matching algorithm is utilized to connect the edge points adaptively, which divides the lost areas into several separated parts; 3) A scanning-based interpolation algorithm, which is similar to the bilinear interpolation, is applied to recover the parts separately. Compared with other methods, it can be found that our algorithm can recover the lost edges (especially oblique edges) efficiently and get better objective and subjective results with lower complexity.

Phenolic acids are components of the plant defence
system; however few studies had been done with fruits.
The objective of this experiment was to elucidate the
changes in phenolic acid content in tomato fruits in
response to pathogenic attack. Tomato fruit  Pinto 
was inoculated with spores of Alternaria alternata and
stored for 10 days at 25 C and 90â€“92% of relative
humidity. Sampling of epicarp and mesocarp tissues of
control and infected tomato fruits were done every
2 days. Phenolic acids were extracted from each tissue
and identified by HPLC coupled to a mass spectrometer.
Quantification was done based in standard
curves. In vitro evaluation of the phenolic acid effect
either one-by-one and in a mixture of phenolic acids
(MPA) over A. alternata spore germination was done
with 25, 50, 100, 200 and 500 mm. It was found caffeic,
chlorogenic and vanillic acids in both epicarp and
mesocarp tomato tissues before the beginning of the
experiment. Infected tomato fruits showed significantly
higher concentrations of vanillic acid in the epicarp,
only. Chlorogenic acid and the MPA inhibit spore germination
by 30%, whereas caffeic acid and vanillic
acid inhibit 16% at 500 mm. It was concluded that
chlorogenic, vanillic and caffeic acids are phytoanticipins
in tomato fruit. The concentration of vanillic acid
also increases in tomato fruit epicarp as part of the
defence system during a pathogenic attack

Objective (s): To perform confirmatory factor analysis for the HELIA to insure its validity further.
Methods: This was a reanalysis of the data measuring health literacy among Iranian adults. For the purpose of the current study the data for 1856 Iranian adults aged 18 to 65 years living in 31 provinces were examined using the confirmatory factor analysis. The fit indexes were calculated for both each province individually and for the whole country.
Results: Reliability was found to be satisfactory for the instrument throughout the country exceeding the 0.7 thresholds. The fit indexes for the country were as follows: RMSEA = 0.058, NFI = 0.96, NNFI = 0.97, CFI = 0.97, IFI = 0.97, RFI = 0.96, and SRMR = 0.051 
Conclusion: The findings confirmed that HELIA is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring health literacy among Iranian adults throughout the country.

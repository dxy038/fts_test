This paper focuses on a shunt active filter based on the detection of harmonic voltages at the point of installation. The objective of the active filter is to attenuate harmonic propagation resulting from series/parallel resonance between capacitors for power factor correction and line inductors in a power distribution line. The active filter acts as a low resistor to the external circuit for harmonic frequencies, and it is installed on the end bus of the power distribution line, just like a 50 &#937; terminator installed on the end terminal of a signal transmission line. Therefore, the function of the active filter is referred to as &#8220;harmonic termination&#8221; in this paper. Experimental results obtained from a laboratory system rated at 200 V and 20 kW verify that the active filter for the purpose of harmonic termination has the capability of harmonic damping throughout the power distribution line

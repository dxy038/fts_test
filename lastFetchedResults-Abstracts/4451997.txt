This paper constitutes an introduction to the field of quality evaluation of sound (speech and audio) signals. The need for such an assessment is inherent to modern communications: VoIP, mobile phone, or teleconference systems require meaningful measures of performance, which may ultimately assure good service or profitable business. A brief survey on subjective and objective evaluation methods is provided. Recent developments as well as new topics to be investigated are also addressed. Experiments are conducted to illustrate how to validate quality assessment methods.

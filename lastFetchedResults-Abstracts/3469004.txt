This correspondence provides stochastic exponential stability for Markovian jumping bidirectional associative memory neural networks with time-varying delays. An approach combining the Lyapunov functional with linear matrix inequality is taken to study the problems. Some criteria for the stochastic exponential stability are derived. The results obtained in this correspondence are less conservative, less restrictive, and more computationally efficient than the ones reported so far in the literature

Trading blocs are found with the objective to gain benefits and exchange economic and
social traditions. Trading blocs are FTA (Free trade agreements) and PTA (preferential
trade agreements). In this present era approximately all countries are part of at least one
trading bloc, while there are some countries which are members of more than one trading
blocs. India is an example of this. This study is conducted with the objective to find the
trading magnitude of one of the emerging Asian trading blocs i.e. ASEAN and SAARC
with another effective trading blocs of the world i.e. EU and US worldâ€™s largest and
developed economy. Data spans from 1990 to 2012. The nature of this study is
qualitative. It has been found that trade of both trading blocs i.e. ASEAN and SAARC
has increased with the time while magnitude of ASEAN's trade is greater than the trade
of SAARC with EU and US.
EU is one of the strong and effective trading blocks, and is engaged in bridging relations
with other regions of the world. EU is in the first row for the peace, prosperity of the
South Asian countries as well as for the other developing economies of the world.

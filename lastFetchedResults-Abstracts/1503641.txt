In this contribution a particular attention is being given to the strategic objective for the establishment of a North Africa (NA) countries cooperation on water and clean energy superhighway as the solution to regional energy challenges, water shortages, climate change and other environmental problems arising from the current fossil-fuel heavy global energy paradigm. Advanced and technical know-how and resources of Japan, through the Sahara Solar Breeder (SSB) project, can facilitate to achieve sustainable development in the region, cooperation to accelerate and expand its research activity with ambitious quantitative targets for solutions between the growing water crisis in NA and energy resources (fossil and renewables energies (RE)). With global energy demand set to rise significantly over the next 15 years, there will be a pressing need for fresh investment in new output capacity across the entire water/energy supply chain. It is still believed and emphasized that Photovoltaic (PV) will be a significant contributor within a portfolio of energy sources in the coming 10â€“20 years and that SSB is providing science and technology that are poised to play a transformative role in providing clean and sustainable water/energy for the whole world. Japan's energy/water innovative strategy for NA is encouraging since problems cannot be solved by one country alone hence local, regional and global cooperation is crucial.

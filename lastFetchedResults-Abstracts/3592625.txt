An analysis of the throughput achieved by broadband nonpersistent carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) on the bus topology is discussed. The transmission is unidirectional, with the head-end being either active or passive. A homogeneous infinite number of users is assumed to be uniformly distributed on the bus. It is shown that although unidirectional broadband transmission allows for higher transmission rates, and longer distances, the normalized throughput achieved is less than that achieved by bidirectional broadband or baseband transmission

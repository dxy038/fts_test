This paper addresses the problem of optimal beamforming in the MISO interference channel. Different approaches are known to obtain the Pareto rate region. In this paper, several frameworks are thoroughly analyzed and compared. It is shown that there is an equivalence between all methods. Indeed, we show that they are different scalarization techniques of the same vector objective optimization problem. The results provide a bridge between the frameworks which were studied separately in the literature. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical findings.

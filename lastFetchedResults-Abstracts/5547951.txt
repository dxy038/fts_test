In this paper, we propose a Call Admission Control-based dynamic pricing scheme that aims at preventing congestion and maximizing the utilization of broadband wireless access systems. The main aim of our scheme is to provide monetary incentives to users to use the wireless resources efficiently and rationally; hence, allowing efficient bandwidth management at the admission level. By dynamically determining the prices of units of bandwidth, the proposed scheme can guarantee that the number of connection requests to the system are less than or equal to certain optimal values computed dynamically; hence, ensuring a congestion-free system. The proposed scheme is general and can be implemented with different objective functions for the admission control as well as different pricing functions. Comprehensive simulation results with accurate and inaccurate demand modeling are provided to show the effectiveness and strengths of our proposed approach.

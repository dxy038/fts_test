Objective (s): To study and compare the psychological status of male and female teenage victims of landmine and unexploded ordnances in 5 border states of Iran.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. The Youth Self Report (YSR) test of Achenbach (YSR) questionnaire was used to collect data. 
Results: Of 68 injured adolescents 43 (35 boys and 8 girls) participated in the study and completed the Iranian version of YSR questionnaire (response rate=63.2%). The mean age of the samples was 16.18 (SD=2.30), girls 15.5 (SD=2.82) and boys 16.25 (SD=2.18). The mean percentage of injury was 42.67% (SD=16.65) ranging from 20 to 70%. Academic performance in most teenagers was moderate. Academic performance was not significantly different between girls and boys (p > 0.05). Overall, the highest mean score of youth self-report questionnaire was observed for anxiety/depression 10.88 (SD=6.04) and aggressive behavior 8.67 (SD =7.15). The Achenbach mean score was higher in girls than boys (71.50 vs. 48.77). The disability rate had a negative impact on the overall Achenbach score and internalizing factor of the injured adolescents. Compared to boys, girls significantly had higher scores in anxiety/depression, thought problems and attention problems (p < 0.05). The most important factors affecting the overall Achenbach score in adolescents injured by landmines and unexploded ordnance were age, educational level and family size (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: Injuries due to landmine and unexploded ordnances in adolescents were more associated with anxiety/depression, thinking and attention problems.

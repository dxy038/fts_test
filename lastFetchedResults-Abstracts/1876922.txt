Objective
 foramen ovale (PFO) is frequent but rarely associated with platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome and with no pulmonary hypertension.
als and Methods
formed a retrospective analysis of 12 consecutive patients with hypoxemia and PFO without increased pulmonary arterial pressure. The study was conducted at a single-center university hospital. We analyzed the patients' clinical records, gas exchange, contrast echocardiography studies, and survival.
s
 patients, aged 73.1 ± 9.5 years, were diagnosed with PFO between 1993 and 2005. All patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia. Six right hemidiaphragmatic elevations were observed on radiography. The shunt was apparent in three patients using transthoracic echocardiography and in all patients using transesophageal echocardiography. The mean follow-up was 27.6 ± 32.9 months. The PFO was closed in eight patients, six via percutaneous approach and two via surgery.
sion
y be patent and responsible for hypoxemia without pulmonary hypertension. This condition is easily recognized with transesophageal echocardiography, leading in most cases to a percutaneous closure resulting in a dramatic correction of hypoxemia.

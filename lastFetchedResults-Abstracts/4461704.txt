The research that is described in this paper focuses on incorporating theories of individual differences in information processing within the context of generic Hypertext and Hypermedia Environments. The main objective of this paper is to introduce a framework for the automatic reconstruction of Web content based on human factors. It is supported that human factors may be used in order to enhance the design of generic hypertext (or hypermedia) content in a measurable and meaningful way. A Web Browser extension set of custom xml tags has been therefore developed in order for the browser to recognize and implement these set of tags for the imminent transformation and enhancement of Web content. An increase on users&#8217; satisfaction as well as more efficient information processing (both in terms of accuracy and task completion time), has been observed in the personalized condition than the original one. Consequently, it is supported that human factors may be used in order to enhance the design of generic hypertext (or hypermedia) content in a measurable and meaningful way.

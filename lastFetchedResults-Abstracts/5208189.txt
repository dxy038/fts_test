The paper presents the possibilities of using a parallel virtual machine for cost optimization of complex lighting systems. The objective function includes entire costs of the lighting systems. In order to determine the distribution of the luminous flux in one of the optimization algorithms a heterogeneous virtual machine was used. Communication between the processes was effected with the help of the MPICH-2 library, operating under the LINUX SuSE 10.0 system. The results of example optimized computation, speedup and efficiency of a parallel algorithm analysis of electromagnetic field (visible range) are presented

The objective of this study was to characterize the transfer of cholesterol from Manduca sexta larvae fat body to high-density lipophorin. [3H]–Cholesterol–labeled fat body was incubated with lipophorin under different conditions and cholesterol transfer was determined. Transfer rate exhibited a hyperbolic dependency on lipophorin concentration with an apparent Km of 3.6 mg/ml, which is consistent with either an aqueous diffusion mechanism of cholesterol transfer or a receptor-mediated process. Several results, including the high Km, the high activation energy, and the lack of Ca2+ dependence favor aqueous diffusion model. In addition, anti-lipid transfer particle antibodies had only a small inhibitory effect, suggesting it is not involved in cholesterol transfer. However, the transfer was inhibited in the presence of suramin, which would be consistent with a receptor-mediated process. The effects of suramin may be complex because it can change membrane properties when bound to the lipophorin receptor and affect the rate of cholesterol desorption. The preponderance of data suggests that the export of cholesterol from fat body to lipophorin follows a simple aqueous diffusion pathway. Although we cannot completely exclude some contribution from a receptor-mediated pathway, it seems that if such a pathway were present, it represents a minor route.

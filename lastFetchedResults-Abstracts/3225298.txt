The objective of this research was to develop a calcium phosphate-based synthetic bone mineral (SBM) that will have a potential for osteoporosis therapy and prevention. The goal of this study was to test the efficacy of SBM in preventing loss of strength in long bones of osteoporotic sheep. The animals were divided into four groups: sham-operated; ovariectomized (OVX); OVX supplemented with SBM without fluoride; OVX supplemented with SBM containing fluoride. The bones were scanned by CT and tested mechanically in 4-point-bending from which the mechanical properties and fracture behavior were evaluated. The load at 1mm deformation for the OVX sheep tibias was significantly lower than the sham operated group and groups with special diets. The sheep given the SBM (+F) showed the highest load carrying capacity. Similarly, the stiffness and energy to fracture of the OVX sheep was also significantly lower than the group given SBM (+F). The ultimate stress and the elastic modulus did not show any statistically significant difference among the four groups. SBM was partially successful at preventing loss of bone strength in osteoporotic sheep.

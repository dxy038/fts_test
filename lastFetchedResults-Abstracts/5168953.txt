The Optoelectronics Industry Development Association (OIDA), founded in 1991, is a North American partnership of suppliers and users of optoelectronics components. OIDAÂ´s objective is to improve the competitiveness of the North American optoelectronics industry. To that end, OIDA has undertaken an Optoelectronic Technology Roadmap Program, intended to identify the critical paths for the development of enabling optoelectronic technologies. A major conclusion of the road map program is that key to driving optoelectronics technology to higher performance, lower cost and improved competitiveness is volume manufacturing. With a few exceptions, North America lacks a large volume product manufacturing infrastructure for optoelectronic components and subassemblies.

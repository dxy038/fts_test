Evaluations of the predictions and auralizations from the room acoustic modeling program, ODEON, have been run using three directional source types with the same sound power: (a) an omni-directional source; (b) three sources with realistically-directional characteristics based on measurements from real instruments (grand piano, violin, and singing voice); and (c) an artificial, extremely directional beaming source. Objective analyses have been run for nine source/receiver combinations in a simple hall on three acoustic parameters: relative sound pressure level (SPL), reverberation time (T30), and clarity index (C80). Auralizations were subsequently created for two source/receiver combinations and used in subjective testing with 28 subjects. Results show that, objectively, differences in SPL were negligible for the majority of cases. Some differences in T30 and C80 were found between the omni-directional and realistically-directional sources; however, subjects did not perceive any corresponding differences when comparing the auralizations, possibly due to the limited directional octave band data available. Subjects did significantly differentiate between auralizations from the omni-directional source and the extreme beaming source. Subjective results from comparing these two sources in terms of reverberation, clarity and realism were generally consistent with objective data, although source/receiver combination and musical track had some influence on the outcomes.

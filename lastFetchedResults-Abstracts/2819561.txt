This paper presents an evaluation of process and temperature variability in PFET and NFET transistors using predictive 20nm FinFET technologies. The objective of this work is to evaluate the environment and physical variability impact in FinFET devices. The main physical parameters affected by process variability are fin width, fin height, gate length, metal gate workfunction and oxide thickness. Monte Carlo analysis shows high dependence of the workfunction fluctuations on the device behaviour. This work also evaluates the environment variability, investigating the influence of temperature variations. The main goal is to highlight the influence of these variations in the I<sub>ON</sub> current for predictive FinFET technologies.

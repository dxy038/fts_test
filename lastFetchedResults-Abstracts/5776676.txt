Research on grasping force optimization of dexterous robot hand is an important topic in manipulation planning, it is an effective way to improve the grasping precision and save energy. Based on the force manipulability ellipsoid of manipulator, this paper defines force directional manipulability of multi-fingered dexterous hand. On the condition that the operational configuration is known, and taking the force directional manipulability as the objective function, the optimization on force transmission direction of dexterous hand is presented. A numerical example of three-finger dexterous hand is presented that the force transmission performance and the best transmission direction of dexterous hand on a given configuration are obtained.

Objective
We investigated factors that may be involved in the reduced leukocyte migration observed in intrauterine undernourished rats.
Methods

Male Wistar rat offspring (8–9 wk of age) of dams fed during pregnancy with 50% less food than control dams were used to measure L-selectin expression (by flow cytometry), bone marrow cell count, blood cell count, laminin and type IV collagen in the basal membrane of venules of the spermatic fascia (by immunohistochemistry), total protein level and serum albumin, and the production of leukotriene B4 after stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-α and corticosterone plasma levels (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).
Results

Hypocellularity in bone marrow and peripheral blood and reduced L-selectin expression were found in the undernourished rat offspring (UR) compared with nourished offspring (NR; P < 0.05). Type IV collagen in the basal membrane of the venules of the spermatic fascia was less in UR than in NR (P < 0.05). The total protein levels and serum albumin did not differ between the two groups. Leukotriene B4 production after stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-α was lower in UR (P < 0.05). These differences could not be attributed to circulating glucocorticoids levels, which were not different in the NR and UR groups.
Conclusion

Our data suggest that all observed differences contribute to reduced leukocyte migration in undernourishment.

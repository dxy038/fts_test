Recent progress of CO2 eddy covariance (EC) technique and accumulation of measurements offer an unprecedented perspective to study the land surface phenology (LSP) in a more objective way than previously possible by allowing the actual photosynthesis measurement â€“ gross primary productivity (GPP). Because of the spatial, temporal, and ecological complexity of processes controlling GPP time series, the extraction of important LSP dates from GPP has been elusive. Here, we present objective measures of several LSP metrics from GPP time series data. A case study based on long term GPP measurements over a mature boreal deciduous forest is provided together with LSP estimates from remote sensing data. Results show that most LSP metrics are interrelated within each season (spring and autumn) both from GPP and remote sensing based estimates. We provide simple mathematical derivatives of GPP time series to objectively estimate key LSP metrics such as: the start, end and length of growing season; end of greenup; start of browndown; length of canopy closure; start, end and length of peak; and peak of season. These key LSP metrics indicate the collective ecological responses to environmental changes over space and time.

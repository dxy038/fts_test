The objective of this work is to examine the large strain localization properties of
hyperelasto-plastic materials which are based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation
gradient. Thereby, the case of stron 9 discontinuities is investigated. To this end, first an explicit
expression for the spatial tangent operator is given, taking into account anisotropic as well as
nonassoeiated material behaviour. Then the structure of a regularized discontinuous velocity gradient
is elaborated and discussed in detail. Based on these two results, the localization condition is derived
with special emphasis on the loading conditions inside and outside an anticipated localization band.
Thereby, the intriguingly simple structure of the tangent operator, which resembles the structure of
the geometrically linear theory, is extensively exploited. This similarity carries over to the general
representation for the critical hardening modulus which is exemplified for isotropic materials. As a
result, analytical solutions are available under the assumption of small elastic strains, which is
justified for metals. Finally, examples are given for the special case of the associated von Mises flow
rule. To this end, the critical localization direction and the critical hardening modulus are investigated
with respect to the amount of finite elastic strain within different modes of homogeneous
elasto-plastic deformations. Â© 1997, Elsevier Science Ltd~ All rights reserved.

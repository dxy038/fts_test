We develop a polynomial-time detector for maximum likelihood (ML) detection over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. Our proposed polynomial moment relaxation (PMR) detection gives a unified framework for MIMO detection with relaxation including semi-definite relaxation as a special case. We give three approaches to replace a finite alphabet constraint with a polynomial constraint. Since both the objective function and the constraints are polynomials, we use a moment relaxation approach by applying the dual theories of moments and positive polynomials solvable by semi-definite programming. With different relaxation orders, our PMR achieve a flexible trade-off between complexity and performance.

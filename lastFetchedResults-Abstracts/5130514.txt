Interfacing two electrical components, and accuracy of data, based on a specified protocol, are critical parts of electronic interfacing. This work highlights the design and implementation of an integrated circuit under bidirectional interfacing of a digital signal processor (DSP) to a Manchester encoder-decoder (MED), and to a secondary device. The implementation of this design is used for a global positioning systems such as in 3ATI avionic display systems. This interface design is specifically for Actel ProASIC<sup>PLUS</sup> programmable FPGA chip in behavioral and data flow levels using VHSIC hardware description language (VHDL). Libero integrated design environment software is used for implementation. Synthesis was done with synplicity, while simulation and post-synthesis were done with ModelSim. Verifications were operated at the hardware level.

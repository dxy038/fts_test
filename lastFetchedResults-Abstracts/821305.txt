This paper seeks to revise the Avicennan argument with an analytical view. On this basis, first a specific division concerning the theory of the Avicennan argument is presented based on its inclusion of doctrine, method and skill. Then focusing only on the doctrine part its contents and claims are studied by dividing it into the two conceptual (or logical) and objective (or epistemological) parts.
In this paper an attempt is made to discuss the main characteristics and the key points concerning the doctrine of argument.

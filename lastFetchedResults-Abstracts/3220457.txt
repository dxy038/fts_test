This paper examines issues surrounding the 911 service outage in St. JohnÂ´s, Newfoundland, Canada. The major objective of the paper is to investigate the responses of the regulator (CRTC), local governments and Bell Aliant to discern if major corrective action was taken as result of this near miss. A revised telecommunications accountability model is developed to aid in providing better quality of emergency preparedness for the country.

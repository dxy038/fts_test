In this paper, we study a theoretical traffic control problem with the consideration of vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. During the control process, vehicles approaching the intersection inform the control center their data, then the control center authorizes each vehicle a precise time to cross intersection by analyzing the received information. Our objective is to minimize the time of evacuating all autonomous vehicles at intersection and the key point is to decide an optimal vehicle passing order. An dynamic programming algorithm is proposed to solve this problem.

Due to the limitation of Production Main resources such as water, allocation of this resources has a high importance. In order to prevent the Loss of surface water and groundwater resources And also promoting economic prosperity farmers, Applying policies that have been established based on the pattern of cultivation and protection of water resources, will be necessary. In such a situation the choice of method that multiple targets simulated in a environment and guide administrator to choose the best method counts necessary. One of these methods is using of multiobjective metahuristic algorithms. In this study for determinate optimal cultivation pattern on 2039, Increase farmers&#039; income and reduce loss of water levels (influenced climate change effects) in the aquifer Birjand were selected as fitness function. Also for reach to this aim used of multi objective particle swarm optimaization algorithm (MOPSO). for simulation of climate parameters used of BCM2 outputs model under B1emission senarion. Results and discovers of this study showed that there is needful potentioals for reach to better sitution proportion now, So that the optimum values for crops and horticultural crops can moreover raise of total income saling crops, aids to lessen groundwater loss in aqufer. Results showed that Raise of area in crops such as saffron, jujube and barnerry as agriculture potentioal in cultivation pattern In addition to the reduce of groundwater loss can also obtain economic development In the event that caused minimal loss of aquifer level, the average profit to the cost of products will be equivalent to 3.86. Value of groundwater loss in this sitution equal with 26.9 centimeter per year.

In this paper, an order selection problem for chicken processor is addressed. When customer demand is over the company production capacity, all order could not be satisfied. A mathematical model is developed to choose type of orders should be produced. The objective function of the model is to maximize profit of processor taking into account production capacity constraints. The result demonstrates that the mathematical model could practically solve the problem of the case study company under acceptable computation time.

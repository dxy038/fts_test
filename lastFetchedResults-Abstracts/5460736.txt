The parameter optimization for parallel hydraulic hybrid vehicle(PHHV) system has a significant impact on the vehicle dynamic performance, fuel economy and emission. In this article, several factors affecting system efficiency are used as the objective functions, system parameters are used as the independent variables, and the multi-objective optimization process is compiled in MATLAB. The process takes the ant colony algorithm as the optimization method, obtains the best system parameters through computing, and verifies the accuracy of optimization results through simulation.

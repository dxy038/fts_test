Objective Our purpose was to test the hypothesis that converting patients with stable angina to long-acting antianginal medications would improve their functional status, symptom control, treatment satisfaction, and quality of life. Methods and Results  A single-blind randomized trial of 100 patients with stable coronary artery disease was performed in the outpatient clinic of a Veterans Affairs Health System. Outpatients with chronic stable angina taking at least 2 antianginal medications were studied. Patients were randomized to one of two treatments: optimal adjustment of their usual antianginal medications or conversion to solely long-acting medications (long-acting diltiazem ± nitroglycerin patches ± atenolol) with subsequent optimization. The primary outcome was the 3-month change in Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores. Although no differences in physical limitation scores were noted, patients randomized to receive long-acting medications had improved symptom control (3-month improvement in anginal stability [19.1 vs 5.6, P = .02] and anginal frequency [17.8 vs 5.5, P = .006]), more treatment satisfaction (3-month improvement of 8.2 vs 3.0, P = .057), and better quality of life (3-month improvement of 11.2 vs 5.6, P  = .09) compared with patients whose pretrial medications were optimized. The improvement in symptom control was statistically significant. Conclusion Converting patients with chronic, stable angina to long-acting antianginal medications resulted in substantial improvements in symptom control with a trend toward better treatment satisfaction and quality of life.

A semi-automated patient specific Computational Fluid Dynamics framework has been developed, with the objective to provide a valuable tool for medical diagnosis and prognosis. The framework begins from medical imaging examination data through geometry reconstruction, structured multi-block mesh generation and blood flow simulation. Each of these components is presented in this manuscript. Furthermore the utilization of the framework on two applications that are of great interest for the biomedical community, namely the abdominal aorta aneurism and the iliac bifurcation, are briefly presented.

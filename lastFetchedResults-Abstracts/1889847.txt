Background and Objective: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder, characterized by
inflammation, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia of the small bowel mucosa. In this study
we considered and compared sensitivity and specificity of serological tests in patients with celiac
disease.
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study we prospectively recruited children with
suspected celiac disease. An intestinal biopsy specimen was obtained from all patients. Celiac disease
diagnosed on the basis of histologic findings of Marsh classification. A serum sample was taken at
the time of biopsy for serologic tests. Findings were analyzed using SPSS program, t-test, and chisquare
tests.
Results: Out of a total of 134 children in this study, seventy (52.21%) patients were boy and
sixty four (47.8%) patients were girl. Celiac disease was diagnosed in 14 (10.4%) of the patients.
In serologic tests, 11 patients (78.6%) were positive for antigliadin-Ab, 4 (28.6%) for anti tissuetransglutaminase
Ab, and 9 (64.3%) for antiendomysial antibody. Sensitivity of antigliadin-Ab was
78.6% and its specificity was 95.9%. Sensitivity of anti tissue-transglutaminase Ab was 28% and its
specificity was 95%. Sensitivity of antiendomysial Ab was 64% and its specificity was 96%.
Conclusion: Positive serologic tests are supportive of the diagnosis in those with characteristic
histopathologic changes on small intestinal biopsy. The best tests for this purpose are the IgA
antiendomysial antibody or IgA anti tissue-transglutaminase, both of which are highly sensitive
and specific.

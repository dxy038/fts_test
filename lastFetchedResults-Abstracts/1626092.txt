BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Scrophularia Striata has been used to treat inflammation, ear and eye infection, skin burn and infectious wounds. This study investigated the effects of hydro-alcoholic extract of Scrophularia striata on second-degree burn. 
METHODS: In this experimental study, 21 male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were selected. Then animals randomly divided into control and 3 treatment groups which received olive oil as vehicle or Scrophularia extract with the doses of 2.5 and 5 percent for 21 days. The perimeter and area of the wounds were measured exactly every three days. Finally, tissues samples were collected from burned area for further histological study. 
FINDINGS: Comparison of wound area showed in 5% dose on 6th day (1447.77±41.73), 15th day (885.74±159.35), 18th day (556.52±122.44) (p < 0.05) and 21st day (293.12±58.06) (p < 0.001) and in 2.5% on 18th day (664.66±123.35), 21st day (398.94±56.00) (p < 0.05) significantly different from the control group on 18th (891.98±73.52), on 21st (538.13±55.70) and olive oil group on18th (756.93±96.31) and 21st day (480.69±43.34). Comparison of wound environments showed in 5% dose on 18th day (105.24±13.14) (p < 0.01), 21st day (75.06±8.61) (p < 0.05) significantly different from the control group on18th day (136.65±4.62), 21st day (104.47±4.86) and olive oil group on 18th day(122.07±12.73), on 21st day (100.76±11.04). Histological study showed ulcer granulation tissue, blood vessels, exudate and collagen significantly increased in both 2.5% and 5% groups. Muscle involvement was significantly decreased in 5% group.  
CONCLUSION: The results showed that hydro-alcoholic extract of Scrophularia Striata are effective for burn healing and dose of 5% more effective than 2.5%.

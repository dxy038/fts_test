The objective of this study was the application of driving comfort for the prediction of the driver&#194;&#191; seat. At the first, triangular type membership function was introduced to depict the driver&#194;&#191;s feeling of comfort for the uncertain meaning of &#194;&#191;comfort&#194;&#191;, and then a model was built to assess the relation between design parameters and comfort assessment based on Fuzzy SVM. This method can also be used to solve other relative problems.

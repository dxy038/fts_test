This paper develops an algorithm for integrated dynamic routing of bandwidth guaranteed paths in IP over WDM networks. By integrated routing, we mean routing taking into account the combined topology and resource usage information at the IP and optical layers. Typically, routing in IP over WDM networks has been separated into routing at the IP layer taking only IP layer information into account, and wavelength routing at the optical layer taking only optical network information into account. The motivation for integrated routing is the potential for better network usage, and this is a topic which has not been been studied extensively. We develop an integrated routing algorithm that determines (1) whether to route an arriving request over the existing topology or whether it is better to open new wavelength paths. Sometimes it is better to open new wavelength paths even if it feasible to route the current demand over the existing IP topology due to previously set-up wavelength paths. 2) For routing over the existing IP-level topology, compute &#8220;good&#8221; routes. (3) If new wavelength paths are to be set-up, determine the routers amongst which new wavelength paths are to be set-up and compute &#8220;good&#8221; routes for these new wavelength paths. The performance objective is the accomodation of as many requests as possible without requiring any a priori knowledge regarding future arrivals. The route computations account for the presence or absence of wavelength conversion capabilities at optical crossconnects. We show that the developed scheme performs very well in terms of performance metrics such as the number of rejected demands

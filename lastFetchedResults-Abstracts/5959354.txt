A primary objective of the intelligent model-assisted sensing system (iMASS) project is to combine computer simulated nuclear resonance fluorescence (NRF) with real-time Monte Carlo calculations to be used in the detection of nuclear materials hidden in cargo containers. This paper introduces the preliminary results related to the Monte Carlo simulation of NRF spectra signal and the importance of reconfigurable computational technique to accelerate Monte Carlo iMASS computational sequences. The selected Monte Carlo platform Geant4 was analyzed for the NRF implementation, modeling of a 3.2MV bremsstrahlung spectrum and the radiography images of cargo container.

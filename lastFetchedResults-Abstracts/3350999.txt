The present paper addresses the problem of designing a control scheme for induction generator working as a variable speed stand-alone generating system. The excitation of the generator is achieved by means of PWM inverter/rectifier connected to a single capacitor on the DC side. The objective is to keep the DC voltage at the rectifier output constant and equal to the reference value regardless of changes in the rotor speed. To achieve this, an MPC control is proposed and investigated. The effectiveness of the developed MPC is evaluated though a comparison with a fuzzy PID controller previously developed. The obtained performance are then presented and discussed.

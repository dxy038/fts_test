Resource management in a grid environment is complex. Scheduling strategy plays an im-portant role in the grid environment to schedule the user jobs, and dispatch them to appropriate gridresources. A good task scheduling method is essential to reduce the total time taken for job execution inthe grid. In a grid environment, the jobs are processed at the grid resources in a fine-grained form thatresults in a low computation-communication ratio. So an efficient job grouping-based scheduling systemis required to dynamically assemble the individual fine-grained jobs of an application into a group ofjobs and then transmit these coarse-grained jobs to the grid resources. The objective of this paper is todevelop a scheduling strategy using job groups that optimizes the utilization of processing capabilities ofgrid resource and reduces the total time taken to process user jobs

Tuned to different frequencies of a structure, multiple tuned mass dampers (MTMD) systems can suppress the vibration of multiple modes. A sequential procedure is developed to optimally place the dampers on the structure using the acceleration reduction as optimization objective. Four optimal location indices are defined and compared. Numerical simulation indicates the advantage of using the MTMD systems over a single tuned mass damper

This paper presents a complete method for optimizing a linear actuator in order to perform its sensorless speed control. The optimizer maximizes the difference of inductances between two positions of interest in order to perform the efficient position detection. The paper shows how the modifications made on a normal E-shaped reluctant actuator achieve the objective of sensorless position detection and speed control.

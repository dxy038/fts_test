The subject matter of this paper refers to the objective visual acuity assessment methods using non-invasive measurements of visual evoked potentials by means of special electrodes. Two techniques basing on the measurement of visual evoked potentials were discussed and detailed results of one of them presented. The equipment cooperating with them was presented, data acquisition and data processing devices, in particular. An attempt was also made to classify the data acquired enabling prompt and objective visual acuity assessment.

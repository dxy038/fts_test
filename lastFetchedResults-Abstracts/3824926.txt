In this paper, different rotor current control methods are investigated with the objective of eliminating the influence of the back electromotive force (EMF), which is that of, in control terminology, a load disturbance, on the rotor current. It is found that the method that utilizes both feed-forward of the back EMF and so-called "active resistance" manages best to suppress the influence of the back EMF on the rotor current, particularly when voltage sags occur, of the investigated methods. This method also has the best stability properties. In addition it is found that this method also has the best robustness to parameter deviations.

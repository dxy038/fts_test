A MATLAB educational simulation program was developed to explore and understand standardized speech coding algorithms such as the FS-1015 LPC-10e, the FS-1016 CELP, the ETSI GSM, the IS-54 VSELP, the G.721 ADPCM, and the G.728 LD-CELP algorithms. The simulation software provides an interactive environment that allows users to display time- and frequency-domain representations of input and reconstructed speech on an IBM PC compatible equipped with a standard sound card. Scores associated with subjective and objective performance measures are computed using simulation tools. This tool is used in undergraduate and graduate DSP courses to introduce speech coding fundamentals

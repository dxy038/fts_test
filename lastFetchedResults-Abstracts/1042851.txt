An analytical solution for a two-dimensional boundary-value problem that models the transfer of heat to the workpiece during an intermittent grinding process has been previously constructed. In this solution, two variable functions in the boundary condition of the problem described the interrelation between the grinding wheel, the workpiece and the grinding fluid. In this paper, a numerical algorithm is developed. This algorithm allows one to study the effect on the workpiece temperature of varying either the velocity of the workpiece and/or the cycle-times related parameters. Our objective is to determine the values of the appropriate parameters so that the amount of material removed is maximized and the amount of coolant required is minimized.

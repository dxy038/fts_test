In saturated soils, heating induces thermal expansion of both grains and the pore fluid. Lower thermal expansion 
coefficient of aggregates results in the increase of pore pressure and reduction of the effective stress besides subsequent 
volume changes due to the dissipation of pore pressure and heat transfer. Dissipation of thermally induced pore pressure with 
time is a coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) phenomenon, involving gradients of pore pressure and temperature, 
hydraulic and thermal flows within the mass of soil and changes in the mechanical properties with temperature. The objective 
of this paper is presentation of a numerical method to determine the effect of temperature on consolidation of clays. In this 
regard, the finite element code, PISA is used for one dimensional THM analysis of porous media. The analysis performed 
using both linear elastic and elastoplastic Cam clay models. Modified Cam clay model was applied in elastoplastic analysis. 
Variation of temperature, displacements and pore pressure determined with time and compared with numerical solutions of 
other researchers. Also it was indicated that implementation of coupled THM analysis yields better results for displacements 
compared to the hydro mechanical (HM) one. Application of elastoplastic constitutive model instead of linear elastic one 
indicated that preconsolidation pressure has an important effect on results of analysis.

The objective of acoustic crosstalk cancellation is to use loudspeakers to deliver prescribed binaural signals (that reproduce a particular auditory scene) to a listener´s ears. Such systems are very sensitive to the position of the listener´s head. In this paper we perform a joint least squares optimization of both the filter coefficients and the modeling delay in order to obtain a robust solution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique

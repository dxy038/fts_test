The use of mobile phones while driving is one of the most dangerous and widely seen causes of fatal road accidents. The objective of the paper is to develop a device to find people who use mobile phones while driving and evade from stringent laws enforced by the government easily. This novel and ingenious technique facilitates the government to take adequate action against those who are violating these laws. To meet the requirements of an intelligent vehicle monitoring system, this architecture integrates Global Position System (GPS), Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) and a Microcontroller in the whole. This device is used to prevent texting and calling of mobile phones while driving vehicles. If the driver is using the phone while the vehicle is in motion, it triggers a signal which notifies the cops with the vehicleÂ´s number plate and the location with the help of GPS system. It receives the mobile signal and detects the presence of mobile. This signal eventually triggers the microcontroller with a glowing LED. Due to the voltage fluctuation, the message is sent to the cops using GSM communication.

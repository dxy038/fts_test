On the basis of a large-scale survey with 269 sampling sites and a field experiment with 12 cultivars grown at 3 ecologically
different locations, Cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) contamination in milled rice grains and its variation among different locations
were investigated in the area of southeast China. The objective of this study was mainly to assess the present situation of Cd and
Pb contamination in rice grains harvested locally and find out the variation of Cd and Pb background levels in rice grains among
the diverse regional locations. The results showed that: a) Cd concentrations in milled rice grains ranged from trace (below 10
ng/g) to 340 ng/g, with the means of 81.4 ng/g (AM) and 55.2 ng/g (GM) for the 269 samples, whereas Pb concentrations
ranged from trace (below 10 ng/g) to 1136 ng/g, with the means of 113.5 ng/g (AM) and 51.0 ng/g (GM), respectively. High
frequency was observed for both the Cd and Pb concentrations ranging from trace to 200 ng/g, with 95.9% for Cd and 84.8%
for Pb, respectively. b) ANOVA for the AMs and GMs among 269 sampling sites indicated that there were significant
differences among the different spatial locations in Cd or Pb concentrations. c) The Cd concentrations in milled rice grains were
poorly correlated with Pb concentration among the 269 sampling sites surveyed, and no significant difference ( P N0.05) in the
AMs or GMs of Cd and Pb concentration was observed among different cities within a range of the same provinces, only with
an exception for 1â€“2 provinces. d) Variance analysis of Cd, Pb concentrations for 12 rice cultivars grown in three locations
showed that the great difference in coefficients of variation (CV) was observed both among cultivars grown in the same location
and among locations of cultivars planted, in which locations showed much more contribution to the variation of Cd or Pb
concentration in milled rice grains as compared with cultivars.

Present knowledge management initiatives and systems failed or remained ineffective due to the lack of knowledge creation activities in organizations. It is hypothesized that emphasizing the knowledge creation activities and embedding such activities in the organization&#8217;s objective, mission and processes will directly enhance the effectiveness of the organization&#8217;s Knowledge Management System. In designing the Holistic Knowledge Management System (HiKMaS&#8482;), a new approach that focuses on a knowledge friendly culture and behaviour among the member of staff in an organization is used and supported by appropriate processes which is enabled through technology. This holistic KM system is designed to be more pragmatic and dynamic as opposed to a knowledge management system that has the expectation on its people in the organization to give their cooperation and contributions at times, unwillingly.

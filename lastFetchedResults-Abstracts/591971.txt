Composite pavement is a special type that contain with combination of one or more layers of concrete include RCC, PCC, CTB or CSB with one or more layers of asphalt pavement that is generally on the concrete. There are two views in composite pavement design. First view of pavement design is a lump sum and a product with two components of concrete and asphalt. In the second view, the implemented concrete pavement for various reasons such as lack of appropriate instruments of resistance or due to noise reduction or in some cases for driving safety increase to improve the surface texture feel the need to cover, so in this case, the desired quality asphalt layer is performed on a layer of old concrete. In this regard, the different sources cited the different designs of composite pavement and the objective of this paper is review the different methods and compare the results of composite pavement design methods. Thus, at first an introduction presented to determine the position of this pavement, and continues with principles used in the design process in various methods such as AASHTO 1993 and design method of UK code, these two methods with other methods like U.S. Military, Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) and DANISH methods were compared.

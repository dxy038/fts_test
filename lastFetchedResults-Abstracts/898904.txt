ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It is necessary to study the effect of obesity on children's dental maturity. Accelerated dental development in obese children can effect on pediatric dentistry and orthodontic treatment planning. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between dental development and BMI in 7-15 year old children of Babol in 2011.
METHODS: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 168 subjects aged 7-15 years were studied. Dental age of subjects was determined using the Demirjian method. Weight and height of the subjects was measured and BMI status was determined for each subject. Chronological age was calculated by subtracting the birth date from the date on which the radiographs were done for every individual. The difference between chronological and dental age was measured and analyzed regarding BMI and gender.  
FINDINGS: In this survey168 subjects including 84 females and 84 males were studied. Mean of dental and chronological age was 11.44±2.85 and 11.06±2.29 years, respectively. Mean of dental age was measured 0.38±1.24 year more than chronological age. There was no a significant relationship between chronological age and dental age, and their difference based on gender and BMI. But the difference between the dental age and chronological age only in boys showed a significant difference (p < 0.05).  
 CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, in the difference between the dental age and chronological age for boys, considering the BMI can influence the timing of intervention.

In recent years, many converters are being proposed to be used like bidirectional. Some applications of these DC-DC converters can be battery charger-dischargers, hybrid vehicles, and DC-UPS. In applications like hybrid vehicles a high voltage DC bus to supply power to the motor is usually required. When the DC bus in hybrid vehicle is held by a big capacitor, the selection and design of the converter has an additional difficult, since the converter has to work with an output voltage that ranges from 0 to 420 V in steady-state conditions. In this paper, a bidirectional DC-DC converter is proposed to satisfy the hybrid vehicles requirements and can be used to work permanently with any output voltage from 0 to 420 V without any difficult. Analysis, design and experimental results of a 200 W laboratory prototype circuit are included

Objective
globulin A (IgA) is transported across glandular epithelial cells by polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (plgR), with each receptor molecule participating in only one round of transcytosis. Nerve-related stimuli rapidly increase salivary secretion of IgA, while concentrations are increased in the autoimmune disease Sjögren's syndrome. Our aim here was to determine whether autonomic agonists and cytokines present in Sjögren's-affected glands can up-regulate salivary cell plgR expression.
s
es of rat parotid acinar cells (PAR C5) and human submandibular gland ductal cells (HSG) were exposed to carbachol or adrenaline for 24 h and to interleukin-4 and/or interferon-γ for 48 h. The human colonic cell line HT-29 served as a positive control for cytokine response. plgR mRNA was quantified by reverse transcription and real-time PCR and protein expression was examined by immunoblotting.
s
hol increased plgR mRNA levels significantly in all cells but adrenaline did so only with PAR cells (P &lt; 0.05). HSG and HT-29 cells both up-regulated plgR gene transcription on exposure to interleukin-4 and interferon-γ either alone or in combination (P &lt; 0.05). By contrast, production of plgR mRNA in PAR cells tended to decrease in response to all cytokine treatments. plgR protein levels rose in line with mRNA expression in cytokine-treated HT-29 cultures (P &lt; 0.05).
sions
mimetics can up-regulate plgR transcription in transformed and neoplastic salivary and colonic cells, although intracellular coupling mechanisms require further investigation. Immunomodulatory cytokines increased plgR expression in one of the salivary cell lines, but additional work is needed to establish whether this occurs in Sjögren's patients.

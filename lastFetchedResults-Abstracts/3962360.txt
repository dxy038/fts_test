As future technology generations for integrated circuits continue to &#8220;shrink&#8221;, TCAD tools must be made more central to manufacturing issues; thus, yield optimization and design for manufacturing (DFM) should be addressed integrally with performance and reliability when using TCAD during the initial product design. This paper defines the goals for DFM in TCAD simulations and outlines a formal procedure for achieving an optimized result (ODFM). New design of experiments (DOE), weighted least squares modeling and multiple-objective mean-variance optimization methods are developed as significant parts of the new ODFM procedure. Examples of designing a 0.18-&#956;m MOSFET device are given to show the impact of device design procedures on device performance distributions and sensitivity variance profiles

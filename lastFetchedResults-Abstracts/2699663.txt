Objective: We consider the problem of clustering white matter fiber pathways, extracted from diffusion MRI data via tractography, into bundles that are consistent with the neuroanatomy. Methods: We cast this problem as clustering streams of data, and use a sequential framework to process one fiber at a time. Our method, named as sequential hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC), represents the clusters with parametric models, performs HAC of relatively small number of fibers only when the parameters need to be initialized and/or updated, and assigns the labels to the following streams of data according to the current models. Results: Experiments on phantom data evaluate the sensitivity of our method to initialization and parameter tuning, and show its advantages over alternative techniques. Experiments on real data demonstrate its efficacy and speed in clustering white matter fiber pathways into anatomically distinct bundles. Conclusion: Sequential HAC is a fast method that benefits from having a predefined number of clusters, and rapidly assigns labels to incoming data with high accuracy. It can be thought of as a mechanism that does clustering, while simultaneously accepting newly computed fibers; thereby, alleviating the burden of computing the distances between every pair of fibers in a tractogram. Significance: Sequential HAC is a practical tool that can interactively cluster fiber pathways and can be integrated into fiber tracking, which will be very useful for clinical researchers and neuroanatomists.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the buckling phenomenon as a typical defect affecting sheet metal forming procedures of interstitial free (IFS) sheet steels used in automotive industry. The occurrence of the buckling in sheet metal forming is an important problem for efficient press shop operations. The initiation and growth of these defect depends on different parameters such as mechanical properties of the sheet materials, stress ratio, geometry of the pieces, etc.

In this paper, a modified Yoshida buckling test is presented as an improved and more reliable buckling test in order to determine the buckling limit diagrams (BLDs) of IFS when ranking the formability of sheet metals. The finite element analysis (FEA) is carried out for the modified Yoshida buckling test and compared with the experimental results.

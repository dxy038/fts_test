We propose, in this paper, a general modelling technique of an autonomic multi-tier system implementing self-healing and self-protection properties. The modelling is based on stochastic Petri nets (SPN). Our objective is to forecast the most appropriate configuration for a multi-tier system and ensure the effectiveness of the autonomic manager. We consider in our modelling an autonomic diagnostic and recovery, with fault tolerance solutions. The diagnostic is directed by the workload intensity, possible attacks and failure frequency. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of our modelling through a set of experimental analysis results.

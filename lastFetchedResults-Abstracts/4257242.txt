The paper develops an inexact penalty function method to solve a bi-level multi-commodity optimal tolls problem. After reducing the original problem to a single-level one by solving an auxiliary linear or quadratic programming problem, the said mathematical programÂ´s objective function is penalized and treated as an unconstrained minimization problem. Convergence of the proposed algorithm is also established.

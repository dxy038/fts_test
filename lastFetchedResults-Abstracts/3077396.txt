In peer-to-peer (P2P) environments, trust is a very important issue when transactions/interactions occur between peers. In general, the trust evaluation on transactions/interactions relies on the recommendations from other peers, which may be inaccurate. This paper presents Dynamictrust, a P2P trust evaluation system. It is based on our peer trust evaluation model, which measures the credibility of peersÂ´ recommendations, and thus filters noise in responses and obtains more accurate and objective trust values

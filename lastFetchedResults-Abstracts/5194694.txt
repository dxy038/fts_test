The IEEE 802.16 WiMax standard provides a mechanism for creating multi-hop mesh, which can be deployed as a high speed wide-area wireless network To realize the full potential of such high-speed IEEE 802.16 mesh networks, two efficient wireless radio resource allocation extensions were developed The objective of this paper is to propose an efficient approach for increasing the utilization of WiMax mesh through appropriate design of multi-hop routing and scheduling. As multiple-access interference is a major limiting factor for wireless communication systems, we adopt here an interference-aware cross-layer design to increase the throughput of the wireless mesh network. In particular, our scheme creates a tree-based routing framework, which along with scheduling is interference aware and results in a much higher spectral efficiency. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed interference-aware scheme achieves significant throughput enhancement over the basic IEEE 802.16 mesh network.

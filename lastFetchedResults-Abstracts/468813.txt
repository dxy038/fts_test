Objective
The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the impact of optical spectroscopy, a new approach for the detection of cervical dysplasia, on patient well-being and satisfaction.
Study design
Patient distress and satisfaction with optical spectroscopy compared with the Papanicolaou test and colposcopically directed biopsy were measured in a volunteer sample of 314 women with no history of abnormal Papanicolaou test findings.
Results
Participants reported significantly less pain and anxiety (P<.001) during optical spectroscopy than during the Papanicolaou test or colposcopically directed biopsy. Generally, participants found spectroscopy equal to the Papanicolaou test and to biopsy on a variety of questions that measured satisfaction. There were statistically significant differences between spectroscopy and the Papanicolaou test or biopsy on issues such as the discomfort and fear caused by the test, the amount of time taken, the room lighting, and perceptions of accuracy.
Conclusion
That patients reported less distress during spectroscopy than during a Papanicolaou test, colposcopy, or biopsy suggests the possibility of improved adherence to cervical cancer screening and follow-up in settings in which it is used.

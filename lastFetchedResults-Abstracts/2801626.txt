Genetic algorithm (GA) is widely used because it is an efficient, effective and robust optimization method. However, it needs a lot of computational time to find the optimal solution, especially when the objective function is complex. To overcome these difficulties, the concept of immunity based on vaccination is integrated into GA to promote the reproduction of excellent schemata. Furthermore, in order to improve the correctness of vaccines, based on the characteristic of GA and with the help of statistical concepts, how to peoduce the excellent group is proposed and vaccines are obtained from it. vaccine extraction, vaccine effectiveness determination for current generation are proposed. Experiments show that without compromising the solution quality, the proposed method reduces the computational time and increases the convergence rate greatly.

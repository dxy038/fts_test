This paper presents a software-based tool for designing passive filters by using an optimization technique. The proposed procedure takes into account the non-convex behavior of any objective function in case of considering harmonics below the tuned frequencies of the filters. In this sense, it is always assured that the optimal filter is obtained with respect to an optimization criterion. The implemented optimization problem also considers usual real constraints such as reactive power limitation provided by the filters. The proposed software includes different optimization criteria depending on the designer concerns. Finally, a case study is proposed including a comparison between the results of different objective functions.

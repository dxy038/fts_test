Presents two cases of multi-objective structure designs for mechanical systems described by Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models. One is a state feedback case. The other is a dynamic output feedback case. The design purpose is to determine not only feedback gains of a fuzzy controller but also structure parameters of a controlled object. In each case, structure-oriented design conditions are derived from decay rate and optimal control performance points of view. In the dynamic output feedback case, we derive LMI conditions by introducing a new type of fuzzy controller. The multi-objective structure designs are applied to a parallel-type double inverted pendulum system. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the multi-objective structure designs

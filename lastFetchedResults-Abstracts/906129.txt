The objective of this study was to determine predictors of parental control over children's eating. Data were obtained from 135 children and their parents from the Stanford Infant Growth Study. Assessments were obtained from parents at their child's birth and age 7. Parental body dissatisfaction at their child's birth predicted pressure to eat for both sons and daughters. In addition, minority status, parent being born outside of the United States, and a mother's early return to work predicted parental pressure to eat for sons. For daughters, an early maternal pushy feeding style also predicted parental pressure to eat. Parental hunger, a parental history of eating disorders and parent being born outside of the United States predicted food restriction for daughters. There were no predictors of food restriction for sons. We concluded that parental control appears not always to be simply a reaction to a child's lack of self-control or overweight, but may be present before such issues arise, particularly with the presence of certain cultural factors.

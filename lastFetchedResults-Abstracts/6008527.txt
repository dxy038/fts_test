For each view, the color and depth information are essential to consitute the elements of 3DTV. But in real situations, not all the depth cameras can provide color information. Therefore, propagating color information from reference view to the view of depth camera is important. Depth-Image-Based Rendering (DIBR) has been considered as a crucial technology to create virtual view. However, it still has some problems. In order to improve the quality of virtual image, a method without pre-processing the depth image is proposed. Only one reference view is taken use of, and a novel way to calculate priorities of points in 3D image warping is proposed. After eliminating tiny cracks through HVDE algorithm, a linear background texture filling method is applied to fill the holes. Experimental results show that the proposed method can gain better performance in both subjective quality and objective evaluation.

An in-pile test of helium cooled pebble-bed (HCPB) typical pebble-bed assemblies will be performed in the high flux reactor (HFR) Petten. Its major objective is to study the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the ceramic breeder pebble-beds and neutron irradiation effects. In order to arrive at the final design of test elements, results have been obtained from out-of-pile pre-tests and modelling activities. Preliminary thermo-mechanical analyses of the behaviour of the in-pile test-elements have been performed.

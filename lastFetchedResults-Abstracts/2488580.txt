This paper aims to study the operating mechanism of Stirling Pulse Tube
Refrigerators (PTRs) by tracing the characteristics of working gas elements at the cold
end of the system using both Eulerian and Eulerian-Lagrangian (E-L) methods. The main
objective of the investigation is to demonstrate non-symmetry eects in the pulse tube
section of the system. Elemental cyclic-enthalpy transfer of Simple (S), Double-Inlet (DI)
and Multi-Mesh regenerator (MM) PTRs are also investigated to demonstrate the eects of
DI and MM systems on the refrigeration mechanism of PTRs. It is shown that the elemental
cyclic-enthalpy transfer of SPTR is less than that of DIPTR, MMPTR and MMDIPTR.
Also, its elemental cyclic-temperature reduction is more than the others, because the mass

ow rate upon the cold end of the SPTR is less than the others. Regarding the reduction of
losses in DIPTR and MMPTR, their cold end mean pressure and density increase, and this,
consequently, leads the cold end mass 
ow rate and cyclic-enthalpy transfer to increase.
Increase in the enthalpy transfer of MM-PTR, MM-DIPTR and DIPTR consequently
improves their cooling performance.

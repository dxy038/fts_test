Objective
 warning signs of aggression‚Äù refers to recurring changes in behaviors, thoughts, perceptions, and feelings of the patient that are considered to be precursors of aggressive behavior. The early recognition of these signs offers possibilities for early intervention and prevention of aggressive behaviors in forensic patients. The Forensic Early warning Signs of Aggression Inventory (FESAI) was developed to assist nurses and patients in identifying and monitoring these early warning signs of aggression.
s
SAI was developed by means of qualitative and quantitative strategies. One hundred seventy six early detection plans were studied to construct a list of early warning signs of aggression. Inventory drafting was done by merging and categorizing early warning signs. Forensic nursing professionals assessed face validity, and interrater agreement was tested.
s
vestigation of early detection plans resulted in the FESAI, which contains 44 early warning signs of aggression subdivided into 15 main categories. The face validity of the form was very good, and the interrater agreement was satisfactory.
sions
inary findings indicate that the FESAI provides a useful listing of early warning signs of aggression in forensic patients. It may facilitate the construction of early detection plans for the prevention of aggressive behaviors in forensic psychiatry.

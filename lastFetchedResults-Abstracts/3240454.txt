Gestures and postures are a non-verbal communication because it is translated through humanÂ´s physical gestures and not through oral communication. This research focuses on creating a variety of human gestures and postures that are applied into a robotic form. The objective is to apply elements of human gestures and postures to robotic form and create an industrial ceramic art ware hence produce the art ware with an innovated approach. Through the typical design development process and basic manufacturing work, the robotic gestures are successfully produced.

The objective of the paper is to present the performance of the single phase power electronic inverter-based Photovoltaic (PV) system connected to the low voltage grid. The PV model has been developed in PSCAD. The designed system uses PV panel as the main source of energy, single phase voltage source inverter (VSI) and low voltage power system network. In this paper, a common independently P &amp; Q control inverter circuit at near unit power factor. The impact of PV resources on LV network voltage has been analyzed. Furthermore, impact of network fault on PV system has also been investigated and discussed.

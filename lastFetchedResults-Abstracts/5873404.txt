Every software manufacturing company wants to gain higher market share with the development of their products. Evolving high quality software products will decrease the cost of R&amp;D and increase productivity. In this aspect, proper project selection in consideration with multiple factors is very vital step. There are many mutually inclusive and exclusive factors-in combinations with vagueness. The authors have tried to depict one of such situation from analytical point of view. The main objective of this paper is to explain how quality function deployment (QFD) model is used in combining with AHP under fuzziness. The authors have proposed an integrated model determines project selection system from a economic point of view also. The proposed integrated approach identifies technical requirements followed by customer requirements.

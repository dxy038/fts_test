A previously developed paradigm for probabilistic robustness analysis does not require a priori information about the underlying distribution function for the uncertain parameters; only a mild monotonicity and symmetry assumption is involved. The starting point is exactly the same as in classical robustness theory-a system with uncertain parameters which are only known within given bounds. However, instead of calculating the classical robustness margin for such a system, a risk-adjusted margin is sought. The theory suggests that the &#8220;best&#8221; way to sample the uncertain parameters is not necessarily the most intuitive way. That is, the sampling distribution to use is not something obvious such as a normal or uniform distribution. The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate that these &#8220;counterintuitive&#8221; predictions of the theory are not just mathematical possibilities but actually admit physical realizations. To this end we consider a two stage RLC amplifier with random parameters corresponding to independent uncertainties in the capacitors

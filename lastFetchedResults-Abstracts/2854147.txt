This paper presents the development of a multifunctional DC-DC converter which combines the function of two, normally separate converters, for use in Plug-in electrical-or hybrid electrical vehicles. A bidirectional high power DC-DC converter connects the traction battery and the DC-Link. The same hardware is able to load the traction battery from a single phase power grid, with a Power Factor Correction (PFC) to ensure the compliance of standards. In case of reduced hardware components cost and construction volume can be decreased.

Design of Low power All-pass filters using second generation current conveyor(CCII) is the main objective of the paper. The transfer function expressions of first order and second order all-pass filters for various possible topologies is derived and these circuits are simulated using TANNER tools for various values of W/L ratios. A comparative analysis is carried out in terms of Bandwidth and power consumption.

In this paper, optimal control problems for switched discrete systems are studied and compared to the same optimal problem for a continuous system; in particular we focus on problems in which a prespecified sequence of active subsystems is given and propose a metaheuristic approach to find the optimal switching instants. This approach is based on Particle swarm Algorithm. The objective is to minimize the performance index, depending on these instants, over a finite time horizon. We assume that a pre-assigned modal sequence is given.

Objective: There are several factors, like environmental agents, neurotrophic factors,
serotonin and some hormones such as estrogen, affecting neurogenesis and neural differentiation.
Regarding to importance of proliferation and regeneration in central nervous
system, and a progressive increase in neurodegenerative diseases, cell therapy is an
attractive approach in neuroscience. The aim of the present study was to investigate the
effects of sex steroid hormones and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on neuronal differentiation
of mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs).
Materials and Methods: This experimental study was established in Kharazmi University.
BM was isolated from the bones of femur and tibia of 4-6-week old Naval Medical
Research Institute (NMRI) mice, and the cells were cultured. The cells were divided into
following 4 groups based on the applied treatments: I. control (no treatment), II. steroid
hormones (B-estradiol, progesterone and testosterone), III. bFGF and IV. combination of
steroid hormones and bFGF. Immunocytochemistry and flow cytometery analyses were
applied for beta III-tubulin (B-III tubulin) and microtubule-associated proteins-2 (MAP-2) in
4 days of treatment for all groups.
Results: The cells treated with combination of bFGF and steroid hormones represented
more expressions of neural markers as compared to control and to other two groups
treated with either bFGF or steroid hormones.
Conclusion: This study showed that BM-MSCs can express specific neural markers after
receiving bFGF pretreatment that was followed by sex steroid hormones treatment. More
investigations are necessary to specify whether steroid hormones and bFGF can be considered
for treatment of CNS diseases and disorders.

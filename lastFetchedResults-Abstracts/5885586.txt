Routing in low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite systems involves the choice of intersatellite links (ISL) that connect two home satellites of the mobile terminals. We use a mesh model to formulate the LEO system and proposed a mesh-based routing scheme in order to reduce the new call blocking probability and the forced termination probability. Also, due to the dynamic topology of the LEO system, the route is subject to disconnection because of a route breaking event, such as a connection handover event or a link handover event. We propose a channel reservation strategy in order to safeguard the continuity of a route. The objective is to reduce the forced termination rate. Simulation is carried out to show the effectiveness of the routing scheme and the reservation strategy

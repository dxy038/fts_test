Independent studies have shown that mobile commerce (m-commerce) can have an important influence on business and society in the future. Hence, network designers, service providers, vendors and application developers must carefully take the needs and considerations of various users into account to provide better services and attract them to m-commerce. Consequently, maximizing the m-commerce user requirements and their significance becomes an essential and crucial process for the standardization and improvement of associated systems. On this line, the objective of this paper is to propose a multi-objective optimization model of location based services(LBS) network. The process of modeling focuses on customer satisfaction to provide practitioners a more effective and efficient model for enhancing m-commerce service level and prioritizing m-commerce requirements.

Optimization of communication among sensors to serve data in short latency and minimal energy is necessitated for some of the wireless sensor network applications. For a self-organizing wireless sensor network Genetic Algorithm based multi-objective methodology is developed and is used as a technique in the selection of sensor nodes which play special roles in running caching and request forwarding decisions. For developing the fitness function design parameters such as network density, connectivity and energy consumption are considered. The algorithm is implemented in MATLAB using Genetic Algorithm toolbox. The optimized network obtained using Genetic Algorithm is deployed in the same manner using network simulator and the cooperative caching algorithm is run on it. The algorithm is checked for short latency and minimum energy consumption and compared with the previous cooperative caching scheme and Scaled power community index cooperative caching scheme.

OBJECTIVE: We determine the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in an urban population of Jahrom, a city located in the south of Iran. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomly selected subjects ?30 years-old were studied using stratified sampling. Target study sample was 892 (405 men and 487 women). Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed using modified Adult Treatment Panel guidelines when any three of the following were present: central obesity, raised triglyceride ?150 mg/dl, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ( < 40mg/dl in men and  < 50mg/dl in women), blood pressure ? 130/85mm Hg, and diabetes or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ? 100 mg/dl. We used body mass index instead of central obesity.
RESULTS: Metabolic syndrome was present in 257 (28.8%; CI 95%: %) subjects, 24.7% in men and 32.2% in women (P= 0.013). This prevalence increased with age in both men and women (p < 0.05). The most common component of metabolic syndrome was high blood pressure (51.2%) and low HDL cholesterol (51.3%) in men and women, respectively. 
CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome in this urban population. Method of cardiovascular prevention should be focused on this issue

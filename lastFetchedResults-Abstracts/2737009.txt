This paper presents a novel multidirectional weighted interpolation algorithm for color filter array interpolation. Our proposed method has two contributions to demosaicking. First, different from conventional interpolation methods based on two directions or four directions, the proposed method exploits to greater degree correlations among neighboring pixels along eight directions to improve the interpolation performance. Second, we propose an efficient postprocessing method to reduce interpolation artifacts based on the color difference planes. Compared with conventional state-of-the-art demosaicking algorithms, our experimental results show the proposed algorithm provides superior performance in both objective and subjective image quality. Furthermore, this implementation has moderate computational complexity.

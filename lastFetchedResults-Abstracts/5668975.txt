Background: Studies show that rapid access to high altitude, the body inevitably will be different degrees of injury, more significant damage to heart and lung [1 ~ 3]. The high altitude hypo-xia on the heart and lungs to adapt to structural changes of the early rarely been reported so far. From near sea level on the test area to a higher altitude within a short time to bring the heart and lung of rats by light and electron microscopy. Objective: To evaluate hypoxic altitude hypoxia on the ultrastructure of rat heart and lung. Methods: SD rats were randomly divided into 4 groups, namely the plateau 1 d (A group), 3 d (B group), 30 d (C group), the control group (D group in Xi´an area, elevation 5m). Three experimental animals brought by the Golmud, Qinghai, Xi´an time -consuming 1d (elevation 2700m), 3d to the Naqu (elevation 4500m) and 30d Nagqu (elevation 4500m), were sacrificed at different time points, the light and electron microscope cardiopulmonary specimens. Results: Acute hypoxia A, B microstructure and ultrastructure of lung tissue apparent interstitial pulmonary edema and alveolar pulmonary edema, and after hypoxic interstitial pulmonary edema after the C group were significantly reduced; acute hypoxia A, B light microscopy of heart tissue in rats ventricular myocytes were all seen varying degrees of cloudy swelling, vacuolar degeneration, necrosis and interstitial dissolved edema, electron microscope, mitochondria swelling, sarcoplasmic reticulum, myofibril dissolution, intracellular and extracellular edema, acute hypoxia group B compared with the change in left ventricular wall was the right, and after hypoxic interstitial edema after the C group was significantly reduced. Conclusion: SD rats caused by acute hypoxia altitude pulmonary edema and alveolar interstitial pulmonary edema, caused by SD rat heart with right ventricular-based injury, after acclimatization altitude hypoxia significantly reduced after the heart and lung disease.

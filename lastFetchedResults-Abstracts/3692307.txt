Cognitive radio technology has been proposed to improve spectrum efficiency by having the cognitive radios act as secondary users to opportunistically access under-utilized frequency bands. Spectrum sensing, as a key enabling functionality in cognitive radio networks, needs to reliably detect signals from licensed primary radios to avoid harmful interference. However, due to the effects of channel fading/shadowing, individual cognitive radios may not be able to reliably detect the existence of a primary radio. In this paper, we propose an optimal linear cooperation framework for spectrum sensing in order to accurately detect the weak primary signal. Within this framework, spectrum sensing is based on the linear combination of local statistics from individual cognitive radios. Our objective is to minimize the interference to the primary radio while meeting the requirement of opportunistic spectrum utilization. We formulate the sensing problem as a nonlinear optimization problem. By exploiting the inherent structures in the problem formulation, we develop efficient algorithms to solve for the optimal solutions. To further reduce the computational complexity and obtain solutions for more general cases, we finally propose a heuristic approach, where we instead optimize a modified <i>deflection</i> coefficient that characterizes the probability distribution function of the global test statistics at the fusion center. Simulation results illustrate significant cooperative gain achieved by the proposed strategies. The insights obtained in this paper are useful for the design of optimal spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks.

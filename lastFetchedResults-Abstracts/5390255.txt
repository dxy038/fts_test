In this paper we present a simple scheme for subchannel allocation in OFDM multiuser networks in the presence of limited feedback, in particular, when only one bit of information per subchannel is available at the base station. Our objective is to maximize the sum rate capacity of the network in the downlink transmission. We show that even with very limited feedback the sum rate capacity growth is the same as the fully informed transmission. We also extend this result to the case when subchannels are correlated.

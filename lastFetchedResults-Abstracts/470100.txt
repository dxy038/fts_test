Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine if clinical findings and sociodemographic variables among bacterial vaginosis (BV)-positive pregnant women are associated with different microbiologic profiles.
Study design
Pregnant women were assessed for BV by Nugent criteria. BV+ women were separated into 6 mutually exclusive microbiologic groups. In unadjusted analyses, we compared (1) sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics, and (2) 3 clinical characteristics among BV+ women with and without Mobiluncus (M+ vs M−). Unadjusted data were analyzed using the chi-square test. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the likelihood of having clinical signs of BV in women with and without Mobiluncus spp while controlling for confounders.
Results
A total of 1756 BV+ pregnant women were followed. The M+ group (n = 702) was significantly more likely than the M− group (n = 1054) to be non-Hispanic black (80.9% vs 66.2%; P< .0001), older than 21 years (61.7% vs 48.7%; P< .0001), and to have had more than 3 lifetime sexual partners (66.4% vs 54.9%; P< .0001). The M+ group was also more likely to have clue cells on wet mount (63.9% vs 47.2%; P< .0001) and a positive amine odor after addition of KOH (57.2% vs 45.0%; P = .001). There was no difference in other demographic variables or physician diagnosis of abnormal vaginal discharge. In the adjusted analyses for each clinical outcome, all findings were consistent with the unadjusted analyses.
Conclusion
BV+ pregnant women with Mobiluncus spp are more likely to have clue cells present on wet mount, a positive amine odor after KOH preparation, and to be older, non-Hispanic black, and have had more lifetime sexual partners compared to BV+ women without any Mobiluncus species.

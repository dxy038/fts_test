This paper presents optimization models for selecting a subset of software libraries, viz, collections of programs, residing on floppy disks or compact disks, available on the market. Each library contains a variety of programs whose reliabilities are assumed to be known. The objective is to maximize the reliability of the computer system subject to a budget constraint on the total cost of the libraries selected. The paper includes six models, each of which applies to a different software structure and assumptions. A detailed branch and bound algorithm for solving one of the six models is described; it contains a simple greedy-procedure for generating an initial solution

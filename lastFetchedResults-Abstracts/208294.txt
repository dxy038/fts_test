Introduction & Objective: Survivin is one of the new characterized members of the inhibitor of
apoptosis proteins that shows widespread expression in embryonic and tumoric tissues. The
aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of Survivin variants in different stages of
follicular development in mouse ovary.
Materials & Methods: This experimental study was carried out on immature female mice
(NMRI). Preantral, large preantral and antral follicles were mechanically isolated from
ovaries from 12, 16 and 21-day old mice respectively. Total RNA from all above mentioned
groups was extracted and cDNA synthesis was done using oligo dt primers and M-MuLV
enzyme. peR amplification of the cDNA samples was done using specific Survivin primers.
The semi-quantitative expression of Survivin mRNA in cDNA samples were compared with
that of 132m as an internal control, using post-hoc LSD test.
Results: Data showed the expression of two Survivin variants (140, 40) in different stages of
follicles. The maximum expression of Survivinl40 was observed in the preantral follicles and
decreased towards antral stage (P<0.05). The level of Survivin 40 did not change significantly
in three stages of follicles. The third variant, Survivin 121 mRNA was not expressed in any of
follicular stages examined here.
Conclusion: Since the highest level of apoptosis is detected in antral follicles, the lowest
levels of Survivin140 mRNA in this stage might be related to a possible role in follicular
atresia. Further studies at protein level are needed to confirm this role for Survivin 140 in
ovarian follicles.

We present the design and implementation of a color correction system for images captured by digital camera. In general, photographing is affected by various factors such as objective camera settings and many environmental contents as well as individual userÂ´s skill. So it is not unusual for common users to take unnatural photographs which have inaccurate colors. Although there have been considerable research efforts for the color correction/reproduction, accurate handling of the color characteristics is still not a trivial task for the common users because it often requires specialized device, data format, and professional knowledge on the color science. Our goal in this paper is to develop an easy-to-use color correction system which is friendly to the average digital camera users. The experimental results show that the color correction problem can be greatly simplified by using the proposed system. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed system are also verified on the experimental results of several indoor and outdoor images.

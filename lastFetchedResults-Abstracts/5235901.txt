The main objective of this paper is to give system dynamics model of innovation talent development, which involves the computer simulation models that portray processes of accumulation and feedback. A model of the issues covering technologic investment during 2000-2008, economic growth and patent application is constructed according to the theory and method of SD, and the conclusion that the model is stable and reliable is reached through positivistic simulation.

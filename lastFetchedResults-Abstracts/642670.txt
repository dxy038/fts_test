Objective
We examined the influence of zinc on T-helper type 1 (Th1)/T-helper type 2 (Th2) balance in human lymphocytes.
Methods

Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells or diluted whole blood were cultured for 8 d in the presence of zinc (30 or 60 μM) or 1 μM of N, N, N′, N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) (a zinc-specific chelator). Phytohemagglutinin-induced cytokine release was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and expression of CD56/CD69, CCR4/CD3, and CCR5/CD3 and intracellular labile zinc were detected by flow cytometry.
Results

We found that our in vitro supplementation resulted in an increase of intracellular labile zinc comparable to that of a 7-wk administration of 10 mg of zinc per day in vivo. Zinc triggered interferon-γ release and impaired interleukin-10 release. Phenotypically, a Th2/Th1 shift could not be confirmed after detecting the Th1-specific chemokine receptor CCR5 or CCR4 for Th2 cells. Surprisingly, we detected a larger amount of CD56+ cells after zinc stimulation, leading us to the conclusion that the amount of interferon-γ release after zinc supplementation might be attributed to the upregulation of natural killer cells after in vitro zinc supplementation rather than to a Th2/Th1 shift.
Conclusion

We suggest that a nutritional intake of 10 mg of zinc increases the quantity of interferon-γ–producing natural killer cells and strengthens the immune system against neoplasms and viral infections.

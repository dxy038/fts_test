A Self-Affine fractal antenna using multifractal concept is proposed. Space-filling cantors and self-similarity properties of fractal geometry have been adopted in the proposed antenna to reduce its size. The antenna, so designed to operate at MICS band (Medical Implant communication Service) for wireless telemedicine application. The prototype antenna exhibits wideband characteristics and provides a good agreement of returnloss(S11). Experimental returnloss has been compared with that obtained using method of moments. The objective of using self-affinity concept in antenna design makes it flexible in terms of controlling the resonance and bandwidth.

Increased penetration of distributed generators (DGs) is one of the characteristics of smart grids. Distribution grid reconfiguration is one of the methods of accommodating more DG into the electric grid, which is illustrated with the help of a 16 node test network in this paper. The reconfiguration of the distribution grid involves changing the grid topology thereby optimizing a few objectives. In addition to the inclusion of DGs, grid reconfiguration also helps in achieving minimal power loss, minimal voltage deviation etc. In this paper the grid reconfiguration problem is formulated as an optimization problem. Simple genetic algorithm (GA) and its variant NSGA-II are used for solving the optimization problem. For a simple test system like the 16 node system discussed in this paper, simple GA is efficient enough to find the global optimum for a single objective optimization. The paper also illustrates the advantage of NSGA-II compared to simple GA when multiple objectives are considered.

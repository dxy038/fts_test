A high efficiency bidirectional dc-dc converter is proposed for energy storage systems. In the proposed bidirectional converter, a simple auxiliary circuit has been applied to provide soft switching at both modes of operation. By added a resonant cell, the converter can realize zero-voltage-transition (ZVT) where both the switch and the rectifier diode achieve soft condition without increasing their voltage and current stresses. The proposed converter has the advantages of simple circuitry, reduced size, low cost and high efficiency because of a single resonant inductor. The operation principle of the converter is analyzed and described. Simulation results of the proposed bidirectional ZVT dc-dc converter are shown to verify its feasibility.

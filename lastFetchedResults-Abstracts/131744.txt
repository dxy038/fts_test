Objective: The goal of this study was to investigate the efficacy and outcome of patients with spondylolisthesis who were treated via a posterior surgical approach with pedicle screw fixation.
Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, 48 patients with a diagnosis of spondylolisthesis who underwent pedicle screw fixation with a Cotrel-Dubousset (C.D) screw at the Neurosurgery Department of Baqiyatallah (a.s.) Hospital between 2000-2003, were evaluated to relieve their symptoms after surgery (e.g. back pain, radicular pain and claudication) and surgical complications (e.g. screw fracture, malpositioned screw, wound infection and need for re operation) with a of 3 -year follow-up.
Results: All cases were managed according to the same protocol. Back pain, radicular pain and claudication were relieved in 68.8%, 75% and 77.1% of patients respectively. Screw fracture was seen in three patients (6.3%), one screw (2.1%) was malpositioned and one patient (2.1%) needed re operation. None patient had postoperative infection. Most listheses were degenerative in L4-L5 region in women between 31-50.
Conclusion: These results support the use of pedicle screw fixation with CD. as an effective and safe procedure for spinal fusion with minimal complications and good outcomes.

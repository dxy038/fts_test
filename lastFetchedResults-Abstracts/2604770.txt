This paper presents a methodology for transmission expansion planning using AC optimal power flow. A multiobjective framework has been considered in which threeobjectives are represented. The objectives are to minimize the investment cost (IC), minimize the operation cost (OC) and alsoto minimize the power losses (PL). The augmented ε-constraint method was used so as to solve the proposed multi-objective mathematical programming (MMP) problem usinglexicographic optimization for every objective function in order to construct the payoff table. The method used can create allPareto optimal solutions in which the decision maker can select the best optimal solution based on his/her preferences. Theproposed model has been applied to Garver’s six bus test system and also to a real system of north-eastern part of the Iranian national 400-kV transmission grid. The detailed resultsof the case study are presented and analyzed

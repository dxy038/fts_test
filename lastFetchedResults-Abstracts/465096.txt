Objective: Our purpose was to determine whether office deep loop excision should replace cone biopsy for frozen-section endocervical evaluation before planned hysterectomy.
Study Design: This cohort study comprised 31 patients who underwent office deep loop excision with frozen-section analysis followed by hysterectomy and 50 historic controls who underwent cone biopsy with frozen-section analysis followed by hysterectomy. Diagnostic accuracy, margin status, presence of residual disease, morbidity, and cost were compared.
Results: Loop excision frozen sections had sensitivity (ectocervical specimen, 96%; deepest endocervical specimen, 93%), specificity (100%, 86%), and positive (100%, 88%) and negative (75%, 92%) predictive values similar to those of frozen cone biopsy (95%, 80%, 98%, and 67%, respectively). No differences in margin status, presence of residual dysplasia, or morbidity were observed. The shorter operating room time for vaginal hysterectomy after loop excision (p<0.01) resulted in an approximate $2000 savings.
Conclusion: Office loop excision is a cost-effective option for endocervical evaluation before planned hysterectomy.

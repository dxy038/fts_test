Objective: The study obtains gait feature of children with spastic cerebral palsy (SCP) by analysis of temporal and spatial parameters in stable walking and gait initiation (GI). Method: 24 children with SCP and 18 normally-developing (ND) children were tested by three-dimensional gait analysis system with normal walking speed. Velocity, duration, single support phase (SSP), double support phase (DSP), stride length, step length, first step length, first step time, first step velocity, first step DSP were selected as spatial and temporal parameters. Results: There was significant difference between SCP group and ND group in velocity, stride length, step length, DSP, first step length, first step velocity, first step DSP (P&lt;0.05). Conclusions: Velocity, stride length, step length, DSP in stable walking and first step length, first step velocity, first step DSP in GI can be used to evaluate walking ability of children with SCP.ere was significant difference between SCP group and ND group in velocity, stride length, step length, DSP, first step length, first step velocity, first step DSP (P&lt;0.05).

Background and Objective: Studies have shown that there is a connection between psychological disorders symptoms and sexual dysfunctions. The aim of this study was to examine the connection between psychological disorders symptoms and sexual dysfunction and also to determine the role of psychological disorders symptoms in the development of sexual dysfunctions.  

Materials and Methods: In this study, 200 individuals (115 females and 75 males) who referred to psychological clinics in Tehran and Karaj (from 2011 till 2012) were included with a convenient sampling method. All individuals were asked to complete FSFI (for females), IIEF (for males) and SCL-90 scales. Correlation and hierarchical regression were used to analyze the data.  

Results: The findings revealed that there is a significant correlation between psychological disorders symptoms and sexual dysfunctions. Hierarchical regression showed that psychological disorders symptoms (especially phobia, depression, OCD, somatic problems and paranoia symptoms) can remarkably predict sexual dysfunctions. 

Conclusion: There is a significant relationship between psychological disorders symptoms and sexual dysfunctions. Symptoms of some of psychological disorders can explain sexual dysfunctions. Findings of this study are consistent with some other previous researches.

Summary form only given. With the decreased lifetime of new technologies and increased cost of new facilities, there is increased pressure to ramp successfully, and as efficiently as possibly. At Fab 10, Intel´s European Semiconductor Manufacturing site, this continuously challenging environment dictated a need for flexible cross-functional teams to take ownership of problems and solutions real-time. Focusing on the support team involved with the Amat 5000 dielectric by equipment set, a Station Improvement Team (SIT) was setup who´s charter was to continuous improvement performance as measured by objective indicators measurable at the station. This paper details how the team coordinated Bay layout, improved operating logistics producing 30% utilization increase, reduced scrap by 2X and achieved synergy across shifts resulting in improved procedures on the floor.

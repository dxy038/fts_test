This paper presents a Sliding Mode Control for a wound rotor synchronous machine acting as an isolated generator connected to an unbalanced load. In order to simplify the control methodology, the standard dq-model of the machine is connected to a balanced resistive load. A switching function is defined in order to fulfill the control objective. From the desired surface, the standard sliding methodology is applied to obtain a robust and very simple controller. Then, the actual measured voltage of the machines is acquired and treated trough a frequency locked loop algorithm in order to extract the positive sequence and control it to guarantee a good definition of the park transformation. A phase locked loop algorithm is also used to avoid speed sensors. Numerical simulations a validate the control law and show good performance and a fast response to load and reference changes.

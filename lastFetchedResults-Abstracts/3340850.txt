The quality of the biometric input has a direct impact on the recognition accuracy of the biometric system. Captured biometric images usually suffer from low contrast and noise, which can reduce the Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR) of the biometric system. In this work, a Genetic Algorithm based Histogram Hyperbolization (GA_HH) technique is proposed for enhancing the low contrast biometric images. Objective evaluation from the results obtained shows the superiority of our method.

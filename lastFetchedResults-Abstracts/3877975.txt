This work is concerned with the design of feedback control laws that guarantee satisfaction of hard output constraints. A recursive procedure is used to derive sufficient conditions for robust constraint satisfaction in input affine nonlinear systems with bounded disturbances or parametric uncertainties. The control objective is achieved by a suitable switching between two control modes, one responsible for stabilization and one for constraint satisfaction.

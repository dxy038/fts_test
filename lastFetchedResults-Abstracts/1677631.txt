The objective of this study was to develop a spectrofluorimetric method for the quantitative determination of melamine. The method was based on the complexation of melamine with a mixture of formaldehyde and chemicals including a ketone group, as described by the Mannich reaction. The complex was determined by spectrofluorimetric measurement as it is characterized by specific spectroscopic properties that are related to the chromophore of the ketone compounds. 1,3-Diphenylpropane-1,3-dione (DPPD) was tested as a ketone compound. The fluorescence spectrum of the complex presented a maximum of absorption at 325 nm.A quenching of the fluorescence occurred when melamine was added into the solution. The kinetic of fluorescence quenching was followed to determine quantitatively the melamine concentration. An internal standard was added to quantify melamine. The method was tested to determine the level of melamine in contaminated milk powder. The recovery value was 97% and the limit of detection was 0.007 μg mL−1.

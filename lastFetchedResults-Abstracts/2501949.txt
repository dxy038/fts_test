Background and Objective: Despite developing use of fiber reinforced composite posts (FRC), some studies disputed the effect of this kind of posts on fracture resistance of teeth. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of FRC posts on fracture resistance of teeth restored with crown.

Materials and Methods: After root canal therapy and cutting the crown, forty human maxillary premolars were divided into two groups. The first group was restored using FRC post and composite core and a full metal crown, whereas in the second group, post was not used. Then, specimens were thermocycled (3500, 5-55?c) and embedded in acrylic resin, A compressive load was applied, at 90 and 45 degree until fracture occurred. Data were analyzed with 2 way ANOVA and Tukey`s test.

Results: The maximum and minimum fracture resistance were observed in np-90 and p-45 groups, respectively. ANOVA test showed that FRC post has no significant effect on the tooth fracture resistance (P value = 0.178). But, significant differences were observed between the mean failure loads in groups with different loading angles (P value = 0.01).

Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that there is no difference between fracture resistances of teeth restored with FRC posts as compared to those without it.

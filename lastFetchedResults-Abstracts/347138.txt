Objective: Little is known about the relation and sensitivity of macro-EMG (MA-EMG) compared with concentric-needle EMG (CN-EMG) in the detection of neuromuscular disorders.
Methods: CN-EMGs and MA-EMGs were recorded from the right brachial biceps muscle of 40 healthy subjects, aged 17–83 years, 20 patients with neurogenic disorders, aged 25–75 years, and 20 patients with myopathy, aged 18–76 years. Motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) were examined.
Results: In patients with neurogenic disorders CN-MUAP duration, CN-MUAP amplitude, percent polyphasia, MA-MUAP amplitude, MA-MUAP area and fibre density were significantly increased. In patients with myopathy, only fibre density was significantly increased. In patients with neurogenic disorders, the sensitivity of CN-EMG was 80%, and that of MA-EMG 85%. In myopathies, the sensitivity was 50% for each technique. Pooling the results of both EMG techniques, the sensitivity increased to 90% in patients with neurogenic disorders, and to 65% in myogenic disease.
Conclusions: MA-EMG has a similar sensitivity in the detection of neuromuscular disorders as CN-EMG. Particularly when myopathy is suspected, both techniques should be applied if one is unrevealing

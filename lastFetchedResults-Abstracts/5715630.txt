Traditional security assessment approach - based on SCADA data and off-line studies conducted long in advance of real time operations - are becoming increasingly unreliable for real time operations. New technologies, which rely on accurate, high-resolution, real-time monitoring of actual system conditions using phasor measurement technologies, are needed to support the real-time operations. The purpose of these tools and systems is to monitor, assess, enable, automatically take the necessary control action to prevent or mitigate problems in real time. The proposed applications of phasor measurements will provide the real-time operating staff with previously unavailable yet greatly needed tools to avoid voltage and dynamic instability, and monitor generator response to abnormal significant system frequency excursions. The objective of this paper is to point-out benefits of using PMUs for selected real-time applications and present ongoing pilot projects and experience worldwide, and to give short and long term roadmap for future acts.

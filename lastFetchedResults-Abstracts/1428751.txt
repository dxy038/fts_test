Objective
m of this study was to examine the relationship between self-help behaviors for sleep (SHBS) and depression among the general adult population in Japan.
s
rvey was conducted in June 2000 using self-administered questionnaires for subjects living in 300 communities randomly selected throughout Japan. A total of 24,686 responses were analyzed from individuals aged 20 years or older. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale was used to assess the prevalence of depression with two cut-off points: 16 and 25. Details of 6 types of SHBS were asked, based on given examples of actual behavior and frequency.
s
adjusting for sociodemographic variables, sleep problems and other SHBS, multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that “snacking on food and/or beverages” was independently associated with an increased odds ratio for depression, whereas “maintaining lifestyle regularity” was independently associated with a decreased odds ratio for depression. “Drinking alcoholic beverages,” “having a bath,” and “reading books or listening to music” were associated with an increased odds ratio for depression in crude analyses, but the significance of the association disappeared after adjusting for sociodemographic variables, sleep problems and other SHBS.
tion
x constructs are being correlated.
sions
results suggest that individual SHBS are differentially associated with depression, thus providing important clues for establishing sleep hygiene for treatment and prevention of depression.

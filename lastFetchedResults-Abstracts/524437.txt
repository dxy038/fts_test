Background and Objective – Visceral leishmaniasis is endemic in northwest and southern Iran and is found sporadically in other parts of the country. It manifests as the Mediterranean type of kala-azar, which mainly affects children. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of the disease could prevent its high mortality. We evaluated the rapid “Dipstick rK39” test in diagnosis and serological survey of the disease in human as well as in dogs, and compared it either with the direct agglutination test (DAT) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Methods – “Dipstick rK39” kits were used for diagnosis in suspected and confirmed kalaazar patients and for case finding among children in the endemic area of Meshkin-Shahr, Ardebil Province, in northwest Iran. The kits were also used to diagnose visceral leishmaniasis in dogs experimentally infected with Leishmania infantum as well as in dogs with clinical symptoms of infection in endemic areas. Results were evaluated based either on results with DAT, ELISA or, in a few cases, microscopic diagnosis. Results – The rapid “Dipstick rK39” test was sufficiently sensitive and quite specific in diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in human as well as in dog. Conclusion – The “Dipstick rK39” test is rapid and noninvasive. It does not require much expertise or elaborate equipment and it can be used for diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in remote endemic areas.

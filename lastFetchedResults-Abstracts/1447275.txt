Sow meat has been identified to possess objectionable atypical aromas and flavors we have termed as “sow taint”. The objective of this study was to identify optimum concentrations of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), sodium tripolyphosphate (PO4) and percentage marination solution that reduces or eliminates sow taint. Sow loins (N=20) with atypical aromas and flavors were treated with solutions containing sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium bicarbonate with concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 0.50% and 0.35 to 0.70 M, respectively. Injection levels (pump) ranged from 5 to 15% (wt./wt.). Marinated loin chops were evaluated for flavor and textural attributes by a trained sensory panel. Response surface methodology determined four optimum treatment combinations (15% pump, 0.5% PO4, 0.70 M NaHCO3; 15% pump, 0.25% PO4, 0.70 M NaHCO3; 15% pump, 0.25% PO4, 0.35 M NaHCO3; and 15% pump, 0.25% PO4, 0.35 M NaHCO3) that reduced (P&lt;0.05) metallic aroma, metallic and sour aftertastes, and detectable connective tissue while improving (P&lt;0.05) muscle fiber tenderness, juiciness, and overall tenderness.

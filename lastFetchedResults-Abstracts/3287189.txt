Generation expansion planning (GEP) is the problem of finding the optimal strategy to plan the construction of new generation while satisfying technical and economical constraints. In the deregulated and competitive environment, large-scale integration of wind generation (WG) in power system has necessitated the inclusion of more innovative and sophisticated approaches in power system investment planning. A bi-level generation expansion planning approach considering large-scale wind generation was proposed in this paper. The first phase is investment decision, while the second phase is production optimization decision. A multi-objective PSO (MOPSO) algorithm was introduced to solve this optimization problem, which can accelerate the convergence and guarantee the diversity of Pareto-optimal front set as well. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed bi-level planning approach and the MOPSO algorithm have been verified by a numerical test system.

The objective of this paper is to present the successful co-integration of Logic Ultra-Thin Body and Box (UTBB) devices and bulk-Si I/O devices on the same chip. The UTBB transistors are integrated locally on a Bulk wafer with the Localized Silicon On Insulator (LSOI) process technology with HfO<sub>2</sub>/TiN gate stack for low power applications. I/O co-integrated Bulk devices have a thicker interfacial SiO<sub>2</sub> under the HfO<sub>2</sub>/TiN stack to be compatible with the I/O higher voltage. Both performances of logic UTBB and I/O bulk devices are presented.

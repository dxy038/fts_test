A video tracking system raises a wide range of possibilities in today´s society, particularly in security, monitoring, and robotics. The most important research in tracking systems is to discover and develop an available method and algorithm for tracking an object´s motion. The objective of this paper is to propose a new method that combines a prediction method and particle filter to manage problems in a wide area of observation. The comparative study of the method is provided and its capabilities are evaluated.

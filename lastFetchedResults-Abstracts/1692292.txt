The objective of the work is to incorporate stochastic and discontinuous phenomena, that occur at the microlevel, into macroscale models of forming processes. A Cellular Automata Finite Element (CAFE) multiscale model was developed to simulate the strain localization phenomena that occur during various plastometric test, as well real industrial processes. This flexibility of the CAFE model is one of the advantages of the developed solution. Application of the proposed CAFE model to simulate strain localization during cold rolling process is the subject of the work. OFHC (Oxygen Free High Conductivity) copper was selected for the numerical and experimental analysis and samples were subjected to rolling operations on the laboratory duo rolling mill. Experimental validation of the results obtained from the CAFE simulation confirmed the predictive capability of this model. The capabilities of the CAFE model and limitations of the conventional FE method in prediction of initiation and propagation of microshear and shear bands in metals subjected to plastic deformation, are presented and discussed.

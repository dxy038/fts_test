Wavelet image denoising has been widely used in the field of image noise. After taking into account the objective and subjective results of the noise image, this paper presents a new image denosing method. Firstly, this method decomposes the noisy image in order to get different sub-band image. Secondly, we remain the low-frequency wavelet coefficients unchanged, and after taking into account the relation of horizontal, vertical and diagonal high-frequency wavelet coefficients and comparing them with Donoho threshold, we make them enlarge and narrow relatively. Thirdly, we use soft-threshold denoising method to achieve image denoising. Finally, we get the denosing image by inverse wavelet transform. According to the result of experiment, this method compared to soft-threshold denosing method has a higher PSNR and visual effects.

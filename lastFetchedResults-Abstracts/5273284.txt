This paper presents an optimal design and its realization of poly-phase induction motor using particle swarm optimization (PSO). The optimization algorithm considers the efficiency, starting torque and temperature rise as objective function (which are considered separately) and nine performance related items as constraints. The PSO algorithm was implemented on a test motor and the results are compared with the simulated annealing (SA) technique and normal design. From the test results PSO gave better results and more suitable to motorpsilas design optimization. Optimized variables are realized by PC-IMD (induction motor drives) of SPEED (Scottish Power Electronics and Electric Drives) software. C++ code is used for implementing entire algorithms.

Significant infrastructure demand will be experienced for the widespread use of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) for Vehicle to Grid (V2G) transactions. Charging stations are expected to be used in a wide array of commercial enterprises that will aid PHEV users to charge their vehicles. LEVEL 3 charging or Fast Charging is an alternative to the standard LEVEL 1 and LEVEL 2 charging topology. It has the ability to fully charge a PHEV from near zero State of Charge (SOC) levels in under an hour. This paper uses a Li-ion Battery Model to simulate the effect of the rapid increase in SOC on the overall health of the battery. Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) is used to develop strategies that help in reducing both the battery degradation and cost to the user.

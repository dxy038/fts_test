Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the effect of acute caffeine intake on total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and oxidative stress indices (MDA) in male volleyball players following one-session resistance exhaustive exercise.

Materials and Methods: Twenty male volleyball players (mean age 21.20±1.10 years, fat 10.75±2.78% and BMI 22.95±0.99 kg.m2) participated in a randomized, quasi-experimental, double-blind and repeated measured (three stages) design. Then, all subjects were allocated to two homogeneous groups (in order: 9 mg.kg-1.day caffeine or dextrose). All subjects participated in a single-session resistance weight-exercise (7 stations in 3 sets per station with 80% of 1-RM until exhausted). Blood samples were taken at three stages (baseline and 45 min after supplementation, and immediately after the exercise) were determined for changes in serum TAC and MDA. 

Results: The results showed that the acute caffeine intake has no significant effect on the basal serum TAC and MDA (p?0.05). Moreover, one-session resistance exhaustive exercise significantly reduced TAC (P?0.05) and significantly increased MDA (p?0.05). However, no significant differences in any of the measured variables between the groups were found immediately after resistance exercise (p?0.05). 

Conclusion: The present results show that acute caffeine consumption does not increase basal TAC and could not decrease the undesirable alterations of serum MDA induced by one-session of resistance exhaustive exercise in male volleyball players.

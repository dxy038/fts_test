In this paper, we address one of the wireless sensor network (WSN) management problems - optimization on the execution of multiple commands. The objective of the paper is to provide efficient support for pre-processing a set of commands before disseminating into the sensor network. It is important that only necessary work will be assigned to the sensor network by virtue of strict energy constraint. The problem is NP-hard. We divide the problem into a series of tractable sub-problems along with their solutions. We present a novel hierarchical quadrant-based field partition mechanism to virtually divide the sensor field. We also classify and model WSN management commands. We then identify merging possibilities for a given command, which results in several merging rules and constraints. Lastly, we evaluate a simulated annealing based search algorithm for finding optimal merge order. The results show that energy can be significantly saved within short time-delay while the overall effects of the final command set still satisfies the usersÂ´ requirements.

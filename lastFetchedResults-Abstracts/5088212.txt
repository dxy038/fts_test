In this paper, we propose RasID-GA (an abbreviation of adaptive random search with intensification and diversification combined with genetic algorithm) which improves the ability of diversification searching with Simplex Crossover (SPX). SPX generates the offspring based on uniform probability distribution and uses the M + 1 number of parent vectors, where M is the dimension of the vector. The RasID-GA with simplex crossover is compared with parallel RasIDs and GA with simplex crossover using 23 different objective functions having no local minima, a small number of local minima and a large number of local minima.

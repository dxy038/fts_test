Purpose
The objective of this study is to describe the computed tomography findings of peritoneal carcinomatosis of urinary bladder cancer.
Material and Method
Patients with urinary bladder cancer were reviewed from patient database of our hospital, and 384 patients with urinary bladder cancer were identified. Computed tomography scans of 105 patients with urinary bladder cancer were retrospectively reviewed. Images were reviewed for presence of peritoneal implant, ascites, solid organ metastases, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Surgical history and follow-up courses of the patients were reviewed.
Results
Computed tomography findings of peritoneal metastases were found in eight (7.6%) patients. Peritoneal involvement was diffuse in three patients and was in the form of implantation in five patients. In two patients, liver metastases were detected; additionally, one patient had accompanying pleural implants and one patient had adrenal gland metastases. Peritoneal involvement was detected in the preoperative stage in five patients.
Conclusion
Presence of peritoneal carcinomatosis in cancer patients is an indicator of poor prognosis. Detection of peritoneal involvement in urinary bladder cancer patients can alter treatment strategy and may prevent unnecessary aggressive surgical interventions.

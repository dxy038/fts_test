Objective : Study the infrared radiation characteristic of heat-sensitive acupoints in bronchial asthma. Method: Apply Thermal Texture Mapping System (TSI-21) to study the infrared radiation characteristic of heat-sensitive acupoints on the body surfaces of 54 bronchial asthma patients. Set control areas on the back of the patient and 4 separate control points, each in the width of 3cm respectively at the left, right, upper and lower section of the acupoint. Apply two observation indicators, respectively the absolute infrared radiant intensity (temperature) and relative infrared radiant intensity (differential value between the radiant intensity of the control point and the overall radiant intensity), and compare the value of infrared radiant intensity measured at heat-sensitive acupoints and control points/areas. Result: The average temperature of heat-sensitive acupoints in 54 bronchial asthma patients measured at 31.15&#176;C, which indicated that the differential value between the radiant intensity of heat-sensitive acupoints and the overall radiant intensity was significant (P&lt;;0.05); Mean whilst, the difference between the temperature of heat-sensitive acupoint and control point was not significant (P&gt;; 0.05); however, the difference between the average temperature of heat-sensitive acupoints and the average temperature of the control points on the back of the patient was significant (P&lt;;0.05). Conclusion : Heat-sensitive acupoints are featured with high-level infrared radiant intensity; therefore, a certain area of enhanced infrared radiant intensity can be formed around the heat-sensitive acupoint.

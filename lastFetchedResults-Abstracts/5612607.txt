Our main objective is to investigate the behavior of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymers when they are subjected to electric field in different temperature range. Initially, the PVDF powders were dissolved in acetone with different concentration and the PVDF films were then prepared by spin coating technique. The pyroelectric coefficients, p was calculated by using the quasi static method with different heating rates. The PVDF thin films prepared from different solution concentrations exhibit different pyroelectric coefficients. The results show that the difference solution concentrations of the sample and temperature heating rates will influence the value of pyroelectric coefficient.

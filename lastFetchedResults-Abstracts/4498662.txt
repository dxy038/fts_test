The main objective of this paper is to present a simple, general methodology for tracing the power output of each generator, on an individual basis, throughout the electrical power network. The tracing algorithm is based on power flows as given by a load flow solution of the power network. The contribution of each generator to the reactive power flowing in each element of the network becomes readily available. Accurate information as to which generator supplies which load and, in what proportion, is also part of the solution. The veracity and simplicity of the method is demonstrated by a numeric example

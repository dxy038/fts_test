The objective of the present study was to develop a new method for the simultaneous quantitation of imperatorin and its metabolite xanthotoxol in rat plasma. The samples were prepared with hollow fiber liquid phase microextraction (HF-LPME). The optimized extraction procedure was acquired by assessing extraction solvent, length of the fiber, agitation rate, extraction temperature and time. A comparison of sample pretreatment ways between HF-LPME and deproteinization with methanol was performed, which demonstrated less ion suppression and better sensitivity of HF-LPME. Analytes were separated on a C18 column with a gradient elution consisted of methanol and water containing 1 mmol/L ammonium acetate. The detection was accomplished by electrospray ionization (ESI) source operating in the positive ionization mode. Selected-multiple-reaction monitoring (SMRM) scanning was employed, which guaranteed a higher sensitivity compared with MRM mode. Calibration curves were linear over investigated ranges with correlation coefficients greater than 0.9979. Precision varied from 0.26% to 14%, and the accuracy varied within Â±5.5%. The developed method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic research of imperatorin and its metabolite xanthotoxol after oral administration of imperatorin to rats.

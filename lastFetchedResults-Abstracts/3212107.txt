The objective of this work is an extension of a quite new closed form factorizations of the centrifugal/Coriolis matrix based on Newton-Euler mechanics. The original factorization is extended for geared serial robot manipulators with ideal joints subject to kinematic constraints in joint motion due to actuators and gearboxes while preserving properties of the original factorization. Furthermore, the efficiency of the derived factorization is evaluated.

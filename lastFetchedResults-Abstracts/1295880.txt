Politics and political subject in opinion of scholars and many political scientists have somehow undergone transmutation and departure from its old and classical definition and function.  It has lost its true place and function as a mean of providing happiness and political order for humanity. Arendt argues that the economic interest of citizens has replaced the classical notion of political objectives and this replacement has been the source of much human hardship in our time. This article is a comparative study of Aristotleâ€™s political thought as a classical philosopher and Arnedt as a contemporary thinker on the meaning of what political objective ought to be. It is an attempt to have a comparison of their approach for a better understanding of what the subject of politics should be in our contemporary world.

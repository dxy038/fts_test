In this paper, we adress a Multi-objective communication nodes (e.g., antennas, relays...) placement problem for heterogeneous network infrastructure. The proposed model considers three conflicting objective functions: maximizing the communication coverage, minimizing the cost of nodes placement and communication devices and the maximizing of the total capacity bandwidth in the network. The empirical validation of the model is done in a simulation environment called &#8220;Inform Lab&#8221;. We consider a large volume of surveillance missions. To solve such an NP-Hard problem, we propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA). The empirical results show that the proposed algorithm has good performance with good qualityÂ´s result in a practicable CPU time.

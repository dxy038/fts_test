Anterior approach for cervical spine lesions is well accepted, particularly for degenerative and tubercular disease.
50 cases over a period of nine years have been evaluated and results analysed using this technique for anterior cervical lesions. There were 38 males and 12 females presented with clinical signs and symptoms of cervical myeloradiculopathy.
34 cases were due to Cervical Spondylitis, 10 cases due to Tuberculosis and three cases each of Trauma and Malignant lesions.
Bone graft fusion was done in 48 cases. Bone graft with metal plate fixation in three cases and in one case anterior fusion and posterior decompression were done in the same session.
The protocol followed, the results in terms of improvement and complications have been evaluated.
49 cases improved in their clinical and neurological functions. There has been no mortality or morbidity.
The technique of metal plate fixation and its advantages shall be discussed.

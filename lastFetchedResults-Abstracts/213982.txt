Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) is an imaging technique that maps the electrical permittivity contrast of the object. This paper studies an image and a shape reconstruction method for ECT. For image reconstruction, a regularized Gauss-Newton method has been implemented, based on the inverse finite element technique. For shape reconstruction, a narrowband level set method has been developed. Using experimental ECT data, a comparative study of these two techniques is the main objective of this paper

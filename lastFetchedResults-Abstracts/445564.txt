Background: The objective of our study was to analyze factors determining diagnostic versus cosmetic indication and postoperative results in the treatment of gynecomastia.

Patients and methods: Data from 100 patients and 141 breasts were analyzed retrospectively, and reevaluated by questionnaire (n = 81) and clinical examination (n = 33). Except for 2 patients, all underwent subcutaneous mastectomy through various incisions.

Results: Diagnostic surgery was exclusively performed in unilateral, nodular gynecomastia being preferentially of grade I. Higher grade, bilateral gynecomastia led mainly to cosmetic surgery. Minor complications (skin retraction, hypertrophic scars, hypesthesia, skin redundancy) occurred in 53% of patients and significantly more often in grade III or II gynecomastia. Each incision was preferentially associated with specific sequelae. However, 86% of patients were satisfied with surgical results.

Conclusions: Laterality, consistency, grade, and age at onset of symptoms determine surgical indication. Despite the high number of sequelae due to preoperative grade and selected incision, most patients are satisfied with postoperative results.

The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of shrimp aquaculture from the perspectives of economics. It is offered as a contribution to the on-going policy debate on this globally important industry. The paper is organised into four sections: the benefits of shrimp aquaculture, the problems of shrimp aquaculture, economic development perspectives on shrimp aquaculture, and conclusions. Four main conclusions are drawn: there is a lack of independent analysis of the factors affecting the production strategies of private firms in the shrimp industry; there is a need to overcome polarisation in order to promote sustainable shrimp aquaculture; wider perspectives on shrimp aquaculture will be beneficial to policy formation; and it is in the long-run self-interest of shrimp producers to incorporate the external costs of production into planning decisions. The paper includes a review of the international literature which provides a valuable resource for policy-makers.

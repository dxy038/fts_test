Objective: Comparison the ratio of live and dead sperm cells and investigation protoplasmic droplets of sperm cells collected from different parts of epididymis of Zell rams in autumn and winter. Design: Descriptive study.
Animals: Zell rams.
Procedure: Zell ram testicles (n=100) were obtained from slaughter-house, different parts of epididymis (caput, corpus and cauda) were incised.The sperm samples derived from each part were put onto the slide glass. Samples were stained using eosin - nigrosin procedure and examined under an optic microscope.
Statistical analysis:Descriptive statistics, x--test.
Results: Totally, 71% of sperm cells were alive. The proportion of live sperms in right and left testicles were not significantly different. Protoplasmic droplets were observed in 57% of sperm cells, of which no significant different was seen among different parts of epididymis (caput, corpus and cauda) and among left and right testicles in autumn or winter.
Conclusion: A considerable part of Zell rams epididymal sperm cells are alive m autumn and winter and could be considered as a sperm reservoir for further use. J. Fac. Vet. Med. Univ. Tehran. 58, I: 25-28, 2003.

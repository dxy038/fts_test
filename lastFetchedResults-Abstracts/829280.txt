Objective: Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a cytokine involved in angiogenesis, tissue
remodeling
and
stimulation
of
osteoblasts
and
osteoclasts.
The
present
study
assesses

the
effects
of a local injection of bFGF on the rate of orthodontic tooth
movement.


Materials and Methods: In this laboratory animal study, we randomly divided 50 rats into 
5 groups of 10 rats each. Rats received 0.02 cc injections of the following doses of bFGF:
group A (10 ng), group B (100 ng) and group C (1000 ng). Group D (positive control) received

an orthodontic force and injection of 0.02 cc phosphate buffered saline whereas
group E (negative control) received only the anesthetic drug. A nickel titanium spring was
bonded to the right maxillary first molar and incisor. After 21 days, the rats were sacrificed
and the distance between the first and second right molars was measured by a leaf gauge
with 0.05 mm accuracy. ANOVA and Tukeyâ€™s HSD statistical tests were used for data
analysis.   
Results: The greatest mean value of orthodontic tooth movement was 0.7700 mm observed
in
group
C
followed
by
0.6633
mm
in
group
B,
0.5333
mm
in
group
A,
0.2550
mm

in
group
D
and
0.0217
mm
in
group
E.

There
was
a
significantly
higher
rate
of
tooth
movement
in
the
test
groups
compared
to
the
control
groups
(p < 0.05).
Among
the
test
groups,

the

rate of tooth movement in group C was significantly higher than group A (p < 0.05).
Weight changes after the intervention were not significant when compared to the baseline
values, with the exception of group E (p > 0.05).
Conclusion: The effect of bFGF on the rate of tooth movement was dose-dependent.
Injection of 1000 ng bFGF in rats showed the most efficacy.

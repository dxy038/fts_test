Weight flexibility is the main reason why the traditional DEA models canÂ´ t be directly used in ranking. The current paper proposes a multi-objective DEA model to derive common weights to weaken or eliminate the weight flexibility. In out proposed approach the obtained common weights can be accepted by at least half of all decision making units. The proposed technique is used in the university evaluation in China.

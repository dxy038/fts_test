The paper presents an accurate evaluation to the damping and synchronizing torques of a saturated salient pole generator. This objective is achieved by improving the accuracy of saturation representation and the method of computing damping and synchronizing torques. The alternator is represented by using a detailed circuit model which incorporates, properly, the saturation effects under steady-state and dynamic conditions. Based on this detailed model, the damping and synchronizing torque coefficients have been calculated by a least square algorithm which is unrestricted to the degree of complexity of the system. To generalize the conclusion, the damping and synchronizing torque coefficients have been calculated over a wide range of operating conditions. Furthermore, the effect of saturation on the operating boundaries is also exhibited

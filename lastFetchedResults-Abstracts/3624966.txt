An effective technique for improving picture quality is to apply a digital signal processing technique at the receiving end of the information transmitted according to NTSC standards. Subjective assessment of the white noise effect on picture quality is carried out within the SNR range which is discussed as a performance objective for a 4 MHz band video transmission system.

According to the requirements of multisensor data fusion in real-time engine testing, a novel, fuzzy similarity-based data fusion algorithm is given in this paper. Based on fuzzy set theory, it calculates the fuzzy similarity between a certain sensor´s measurement values and the multiple sensors´ objective prediction values to determine the importance weigh of each sensor, and realize the multisensor testing parameter data fusion. According to the algorithm theory, its application software is also designed in the paper. The applied example proves that the algorithm can give priority to the high-stability and high-reliability sensors and it is laconic, efficient and feasible to real-time circumstance measure and data processing in engine condition monitoring and measurement.

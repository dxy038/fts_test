The objective of this work was to develop an aluminum powder metallurgy (P/M) alloy appropriate for industrial press-sinter technology. An entry in the 2xxx series of aluminum–copper–magnesium alloys was explored for this purpose. Designated as P/M 2324 (Al–4.4Cu–1.5Mg), the sintering response and mechanical properties of the alloy were investigated in laboratory and industrial settings. It was determined that compaction at 400 MPa and sintering at 600 °C for 20 min produced the best properties in the sintered product. Doping with a minor amount of tin (0.2w/o) was found to improve the properties whereas modifications to Cu and Mg concentration produced minimal gains. All tensile properties of P/M 2324 were significantly superior to those of the principal 2xxx series aluminum P/M alloy (AC2014) in current use. These benefits were attributed to a high sintered density (&gt;98% theoretical) that was reproducible in an industrial setting.

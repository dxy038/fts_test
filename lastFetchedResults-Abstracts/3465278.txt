A new method to reduce the numerical dispersion of the 3-D alternating-direction-implicit finite-difference time-domain method is proposed. Firstly, the numerical formulations are modified with the artificial anisotropy, and the new numerical dispersion relation is derived analytically. Moreover, theoretical proof of the unconditional stability is shown. Secondly, the relative permittivity tensor of the artificial anisotropy can be obtained by the adaptive genetic algorithm. In order to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of this new method, several examples are simulated. The numerical results and the computational requirements of the proposed method are then compared with those of the conventional method and measured data. In addition, the reduction of the numerical dispersion is investigated as the objective function of the genetic algorithm. It is found that this new method is accurate and efficient by choosing a proper objective function

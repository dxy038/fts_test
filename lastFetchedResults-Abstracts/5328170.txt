The main objective of the paper is to introduce how the concept of tensor HOSVD (higher order singular value decomposition) can be carried over to the TP (tensor product) dynamic models. We term this decomposition as HOSVD based canonical form of TP model or polytopic model form. The key idea and the basic concept of this decomposition was proposed recently with the TP model transformation based control design methodology. The novelty of this paper is to present the mathematical background of this concept. The paper shows convergency theorems how the TP model transformation is capable of reconstructing this HOSVD based canonical form numerically.

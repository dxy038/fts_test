The success of industry-based projects (capstone projects) used in computing course depends on a number of factors. These are: i) characteristics of the information system and the client perception, ii) individual student and group characteristics, iii) development methodology used, and iv) the support and supervision provided. Generally academics use a dasiatrial-by-errorpsila approach in striking the right balance between these factors for the success of capstone projects. As oppose to this approach, here we lay the foundation for a criteria-based allocation of projects, with the objective of enhancing student leaning experience. As the first step, this paper analyzes the correlation of two dimensions: a) the complexity level of the IS (one dimension of characteristics of the IS) and b) group mean Grade Point Average-GPA (one dimension of characteristics of the student group); and the success of a project. Data collected from 32 projects is presented and analyzed here in exploring the above-mentioned correlation.

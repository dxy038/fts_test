Artificial lift is defined as a system that adds energy to the wellbore fluid column with the objective of initiating and enhancing production from the well. Artificial lift is needed when reservoir drives do not sustain acceptable rates or cause fluids to flow at all in some cases. Lift processes transfer energy down hole or decrease fluid density in wellbore to reduce the hydrostatic load on formation. Artificial lift systems use a range of operating principles, including pumping and gas lifting.

ation Et Choix Traduisant la REalit√© (ELECTRE) model or method is one of the most prevalent Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods. MCDM is an approach employed to solve problems involving selection from among a finite number of criteria. An MCDM method specifies how attribute information is to be processed in order to arrive at a choice.

s paper, a novel software method based on ELECTRE model as a mathematical optimizer has been presented for artificial lift systems selection in petroleum industry validated with several certain oil fields data (such as: the Iranian Salman, Nosrat and Kuh-E-Mond (MD-6) oil fields) that finally, a considerable accordance between ELECTRE model program final results and the fields operational results has been found.

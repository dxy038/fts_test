Women are into computing and technology since computers were first envisioned. But studies have proven that women are under represented in the field of technology. Research results show that the school girls are using computers and the Internet at rates similar to their male peers. But at the same time, girls are five times less likely to consider a technology-related career or plan on taking post-secondary technology classes. Therefore efforts are being taken all around the world to attract women into Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). One such endeavour was the Digigirlz day organised at the Dubai WomenÂ´s College. This is first ever project organised in the United Arab Emirates to create awareness on the technological educational opportunities for the Emirate school girls. This paper describes the objective of the project, expected results, deployment approach, SWOT analysis and results achieved.

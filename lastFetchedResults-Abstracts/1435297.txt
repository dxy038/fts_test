The optimal operation of dam reservoirs is one of the important issues in water resources management. These systems are complex, which made it difficult and costly to use the conventional methods to find the optimal solutions. In recent years, numerous researches conducted to find the appropriate solutions for the problem; different methods, including heuristic methods, and algorithms were employed and some successes were made. The aim of this research was to maximize the revenue from the power plant as well as to increase flood storage of two reservoirs in Ghezel Ozon basin using genetic algorithm and multi-objective NSGA-II. These methods are based on the population instead of working with samples. Based on the results, NSGA-II algorithm estimated more appropriate answers in compare with the genetic algorithm. The optimized values with NSGA-II algorithm led to the 1.84 billion Rials more in revenue and controlling 1.13 MCM more flood water for two reservoirs.

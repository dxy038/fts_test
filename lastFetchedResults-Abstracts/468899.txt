Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate quality of life, sexual function, and long-term outcome in women after undergoing the McIndoe procedure for vaginal agenesis.
Study design
This was a retrospective descriptive study of patients who were treated with the McIndoe procedure for vaginal agenesis. Participants answered a structured questionnaire to describe self-reported outcomes in quality of life, sexual function and satisfaction, and body image after the McIndoe procedure. Patient characteristics along with short- and long-term findings were abstracted from the medical record.
Results
Eighty-six patients responded to the questionnaire. Average age (±SD) at surgery was 21±6 years (range, 12-49 years). The mean number of years (±SD) since surgery was 23±12 (range, 2-50 years). Seventy-nine percent of the respondents stated that the McIndoe procedure improved their quality of life. Ninety-one percent of the respondents were sexually active, with 75% able to achieve orgasm. Reported self-image was improved in 55% of the women.
Conclusion
The McIndoe procedure improves quality of life and sexual satisfaction and provides a functional vagina with minimal complications

There is increasing evidence to support the hypothesis that free radical-mediated oxidative processes contribute to atherogenesis. More recently the ability of antioxidant nutrients to affect cell response and gene expression has been reported in vitro, providing a novel mechanistic perspective for the biological activity of antioxidants. Sea buckthorn (Hippophaë rhamnoides L.) is a rich source of antioxidants both aqueous and lipophilic, as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids. The objective of the study was to characterize the antioxidant profile of Sea buckthorn juice (SBJ) and to evaluate its effect on plasma lipids, LDL oxidation, platelet aggregation and plasma soluble cell adhesion protein concentration. Twenty healthy male volunteers were given either a placebo or SBJ for 8 weeks. Additional daily intakes of vitamin C, α-tocopherol, β-carotene and flavonoids through SBJ supplementation were 462, 3.2, 1.0 and 355 mg respectively. There were no significant changes in plasma total cholesterol, LDL-C, platelet aggregation or plasma intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) levels between treatment groups. Although not significant, a 20% and 17% increase in plasma HDL-C and triacylglycerol (TAG) concentrations were observed. SBJ supplementation also resulted in a moderate decrease in the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation.

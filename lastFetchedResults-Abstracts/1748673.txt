Ensemble learning has attracted considerable attention owing to its good generalization performance. The main issues in constructing a powerful ensemble include training a set of diverse and accurate base classifiers, and effectively combining them. Ensemble margin, computed as the difference of the vote numbers received by the correct class and the another class received with the most votes, is widely used to explain the success of ensemble learning. This definition of the ensemble margin does not consider the classification confidence of base classifiers. In this work, we explore the influence of the classification confidence of the base classifiers in ensemble learning and obtain some interesting conclusions. First, we extend the definition of ensemble margin based on the classification confidence of the base classifiers. Then, an optimization objective is designed to compute the weights of the base classifiers by minimizing the margin induced classification loss. Several strategies are tried to utilize the classification confidences and the weights. It is observed that weighted voting based on classification confidence is better than simple voting if all the base classifiers are used. In addition, ensemble pruning can further improve the performance of a weighted voting ensemble. We also compare the proposed fusion technique with some classical algorithms. The experimental results also show the effectiveness of weighted voting with classification confidence.

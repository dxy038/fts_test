The comprehensive benefit evaluation system of floodwater utilization is a multi-objective multi-stage system integrating economic, ecological and social benefits as well as including quantitative and qualitative indexes. This paper deals with the application of variable fuzzy recognition model to benefit evaluations of floodwater utilization in Baicheng region, Jilin province. The result shows that variable fuzzy recognition model is validated through a problem of benefit evaluation of floodwater utilization. Through the integrated fitting curve for floodwater utilization volume and the corresponding benefit, it can be seen that the two appeared a significant relation, but the floodwater utilization can not be used unlimitedly as well as the benefit increased. To avoid the risk of floodwater utilization, for Baicheng region, the maximum volume of floodwater utilization is 1.5 billion cubic meters.

The Agaricus bisporus breeding, has always been problematic. In this mushroom, secondary homothallism causes majority of basidiospores produce the self-fertile heterokaryons, while homokaryons, which are important in the breeding, are infrequent. The main objective of this study was the utilization of variation among pure isolates and isolates generated through multi spore cultures for the Agaricus bisporus breeding. The basidiospore cultures of several commercial exotic and domestic strains were prepared. Single and multi spore cultures were isolated and subjected to spwan and fruit bodies production. Based on colony type and growth rate, variation of basidiospores in solid culture medium, spawn and in compost was examined. The relationship between classes of colony types, growth rates and the yield was examined. The results showed that isolates with low growth produced no mushroom or bad a few, but in majority of isolates with high growth, a high or moderate yield was observed.

The experiment was carried out with the objective of evaluate the effect of increasing levels of sodium-hydroxide (NaOH) and urea in the nutritive attributes of haylage Guinea grass (Panicum maximum) haylage for 36 hours in the sun. Guinea grass hay samples were randomly assigned to 7 treatments whit 10 repetitions (n=10). The treatments were: T1 - Guinea grass haylage, T2 - Guinea grass haylage plus 1.5 % NaOH, T3 - Guinea grass haylage plus 2.5 % NaOH and T4 - Guinea grass haylage plus 3.5 %  NaOH, T5 - Guinea grass haylage plus 1.5 % urea, T6 - Guinea grass haylage plus 2.5 % urea and T7 - Guinea grass haylage plus 3.5 %  urea dry matter based. The greatest crude protein (CP) values were obtained with the highest dose of NaOH and urea. Urea or NaOH addition reduced NDF, FDA and HEM values (P < 0.05). In Vitro Dry Matter Digestibility (IVDMD) was affected by the chemical treatments. with greater responses at the highest doses (P < 0.05). Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) increased whit NaOH and urea application while total carbohydrates (TC) suffer a reduction as a response to the treatments (P < 0.05). The nutritive values of Guinea grass improve with both chemical treatments. expressed as a reduction in structural carbohydrates and an increase in IVDMD. Choose the chemical method to improve forage quality would depend on management strategies and cost.

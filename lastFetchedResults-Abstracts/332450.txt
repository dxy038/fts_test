Objective
The success of dental restorations utilizing composite resin over cast alloy has been variable and affected by micro-leakage. The purpose of this study was to investigate the shear bond strength between a composite resin and cast dental alloy coated with a layer of titanium nitride (TiN).
Methods

Cast disk specimens made of Au–Pd–Ag alloy were randomly divided into four groups. The first group was left uncoated as a control while one group was coated with a metal conditioner, and the other two were coated with TiN at either 200 or 500 W with a radiofrequency magnetron sputtering system. Each group was then bonded to one of two types of light-activated composite resin material. Shear bond strengths were tested and compared for each specimen. The bond strength of each group was analyzed by 2-way ANOVA and by post hoc multiple comparison tests (Fisher's PLSD).
Results

As the interaction among groups was not significant (p=0.27) by 2-way ANOVA, TiN coated groups were found to have improved shear bond strength compared with non-coated groups without metal conditioner for both resin composite materials by multiple comparison tests. Furthermore, TiN coating is significantly stronger than non-coated groups with metal conditioner for one of the two resin composite materials examined (p<0.01).
Conclusions

The results suggested that metal surface modification by coated TiN represents a technique that may significantly improve the bond between the Au–Pd–Ag alloy and veneering resin composite.

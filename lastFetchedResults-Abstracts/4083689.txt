Verification and validation (V&amp;V) of safety control system quality and performance is required prior to installing control system hardware within nuclear power plants (NPPs). Thus, the objective of the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform introduced in this paper is to verify the functionality of these safety control systems. The developed platform provides a flexible simulated testing environment which enables synchronized coupling between the real and simulated world. Within the platform, National Instruments (NI) data acquisition (DAQ) hardware provides an interface between a programmable electronic system under test (SUT) and a simulation computer. Further, NI LabVIEW resides on this remote DAQ workstation for signal conversion and routing between Ethernet and standard industrial signals as well as for user interface. The platform is applied to the testing of a simplified implementation of Canadian Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) shutdown system no. 1 (SDS1) which monitors only the steam generator level of the simulated NPP. CANDU NPP simulation is performed on a Darlington NPP desktop training simulator provided by Ontario Power Generation (OPG). Simplified SDS1 logic is implemented on an Invensys Tricon v9 programmable logic controller (PLC) to test the performance of both the safety controller and the implemented logic. Prior to HIL simulation, platform availability of over 95% is achieved for the configuration used during the V&amp;V of the PLC. Comparison of HIL simulation results to benchmark simulations shows good operational performance of the PLC following a postulated initiating event (PIE).

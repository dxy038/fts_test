In order to realize the function of large scale photovoltaic access to the grid, and recycle the regenerative braking energy in traction system, a hybrid bidirectional interactive DC traction power supply system is proposed. Bidirectional AC-DC converters are adopted in the traction system to realize the bidirectional power flow with the grid. Solar power generation and electric vehicle (EV) charging system are connected to the traction system to form a ring DC microgrid. The voltage droop control strategy is adopted for paralleled converters. The simulation results indicate that the system is stable and effective.

As development, it is possible to evaluate the differences between the concepts of an industrial airport and the airport-cities, as complementary requirements to the national development. As a case study, the Tancredo Neves International Airport (TNIA) in Belo Horizonte, in the State of Minas Gerais, is presented as an example for the development of the sector and its conceptual evolution, with proposals for its operations.

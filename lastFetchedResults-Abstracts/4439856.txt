In this paper, the results of fog tests on eight different surface-coated 11 kV EPDM insulators were presented. The objective of tests is to examine electrical characteristics of composite insulators during degradation. Leakage currents were found to be determined by shed surface condition. The electrical test results were compared with results of chemical surface analysis, which gave two numerical indicators: oxidation index and ester/ketone ratio. Surface condition of insulator was also examined by scanning electron micrograph. The electrical and chemical analysis results give useful and related indicator of surface condition.

MDMA is a widely abused amphetamine derivative that alters serotonin (5-HT) release via the reverse serotonin re-uptake transporter (SERT) mechanism. This phenomenon leads to neurotoxicity in the synaptic clefts, especially in the striatum. As the major function of the striatum is planning and modulating movement pathways and cognitive processes, the objective of this study is to investigate the neuronal viability of chronic MDMA-influenced rats, as well as the effect of re-challenged MDMA.

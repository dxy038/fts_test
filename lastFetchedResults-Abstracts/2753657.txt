We propose a nonparametric framework for voice conversion, that is, exemplar-based sparse representation with residual compensation. In this framework, a spectrogram is reconstructed as a weighted linear combination of speech segments, called exemplars, which span multiple consecutive frames. The linear combination weights are constrained to be sparse to avoid over-smoothing, and high-resolution spectra are employed in the exemplars directly without dimensionality reduction to maintain spectral details. In addition, a spectral compression factor and a residual compensation technique are included in the framework to enhance the conversion performances. We conducted experiments on the VOICES database to compare the proposed method with a large set of state-of-the-art baseline methods, including the maximum likelihood Gaussian mixture model (ML-GMM) with dynamic feature constraint and the partial least squares (PLS) regression based methods. The experimental results show that the objective spectral distortion of ML-GMM is reduced from 5.19 dB to 4.92 dB, and both the subjective mean opinion score and the speaker identification rate are increased from 2.49 and 73.50% to 3.15 and 79.50%, respectively, by the proposed method. The results also show the superiority of our method over PLS-based methods. In addition, the subjective listening tests indicate that the naturalness of the converted speech by our proposed method is comparable with that by the ML-GMM method with global variance constraint.

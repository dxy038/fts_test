Objective: To assess the relationship between cerebellum and brain cortical activity without motor factors, we recorded the mid-latency auditory evoked responses (MLRs) with simultaneous recording of the electroencephalography (EEG) at rest in patients with ‘pure cortical cerebellar atrophy (CCA)’.
Methods: We studied 12 normal control subjects and non-demented ‘pure CCA’ patients determined by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging analysis. A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery assessed intelligence, frontal lobe function and word fluency. Spontaneous eyes-closed resting EEG and MLRs were recorded from 20 scalp electrodes and analysed with low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) to compute the 3-dimensional intracerebral distribution of electric activity.
Results: Neuropsychological tests revealed no differences between CCA and the control. Analysis of EEG and MLRs using classical methods also did not reveal any differences. LORETA analysis indicated significant decrease of alpha2 activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus in CCA. On MLRs, the most significant difference was observed at P1 component, and CCA patients showed significant decrease at the right superior frontal gyrus.
Conclusions: Our results indicated that the frontal lobe and ascending reticular activating system are inhibited in CCA patients, and suggested the involvement of the cerebellum in cortical electric activities irrespective of motor adjunct.
Significance: Quantitative EEG and MLR measurements with LORETA pointed out frontal lobe hypoactivities in pure CCA patients.

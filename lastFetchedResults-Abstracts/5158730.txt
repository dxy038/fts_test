There has been considerable research interest in the design of survivable grooming capable networks in recent years. For such networks, protection may take place at the lightpath level or at the connection level. The vast majority of the current work can be classified into one of two categories (i) static grooming, where the demands are allocated for the entire duration of the network and (ii) dynamic grooming, where the start times and durations of demands are generated randomly based on certain traffic distributions. In this paper, we propose a new technique for survivable traffic grooming under the scheduled traffic model that exploits knowledge of the connection holding times of traffic demands to lead to more efficient resource allocation. We present efficient integer linear program (ILP) formulations for the complete survivable traffic grooming problem in WDM networks. Our formulations can solve the joint problem of the topology design, traffic routing and RWA, using path protection at lightpath level. Our aim is to design a stable logical topology that can accommodate a collection of low-speed traffic demands with specified setup and teardown times. The objective function, considered in our ILP formulation, is to minimize the resource requirements. This can be easily modified to maximize the throughput under a given set of resources. We also have proposed a simplified version of our ILP formulations that can solve the problem in a way that is computationally more efficient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to address the survivable traffic grooming problem under the scheduled traffic model.

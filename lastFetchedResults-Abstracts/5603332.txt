This paper describes a fast algorithm for space vector modulation (SVM) in Three-phase pulse width modulation (PWM) rectifier. The objective of Space Vector PWM technique is to approximate a given reference voltage vector U<sub>ref</sub> by combination of the switching pattern corresponding to the basic space vectors, without looking up sinusoidal and tangential tables. With the fast algorithm, the running speed and control precise of the program can be improved greatly. Both PC simulations and experiments are provided to verify the proposed algorithm in the end of the paper.

Software that facilitates the calculation of pharmacokinetic variables for studies of drugs with linear elimination characteristics is described. The operator enters patient demographics and serum concentration-time points following a single dose through an easily operated interface. The program generates a report that includes a graph, calculated variables, and measures of confidence in the results of the study. It provides objective, repeatable computation of pharmacokinetic variables and allows easy access to analysis that formerly took up to two hours to calculate by hand. The program is portable and terminal-independent

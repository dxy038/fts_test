Optimization of reactive power flow is one of the problems of optimal power flow in a power system. Solution of that problem has positive impact on economic and safe power system operation. Aim of the paper is to present the investigation of results of optimization of reactive power flow in a power system with the use of genetic algorithms for two different objective functions from the voltage-stability view point. One of these functions represents system active power losses and the second one is a voltage-stability-oriented index. The stability features of the optimized power system state are examined using two line stability indices and contingency analysis. At the end of the paper, a discussion of the obtained results of investigation is given.

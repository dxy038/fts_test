Based on the past experiences for educational and research system, we can affirm that making human sciences applicable and conforming to the market and to the objective needs of society is considered an important factor for the scientific development of the country. The large number of the students who study Political Sciences in state and private universities in comparison with the actual situation of employment and unemployment in the country, leads us to the necessity of some basic revision in the educational program.
The present article aims at studying and evaluating the possible methods for making the educational program of Political Sciences more applicable and closer to the objective needs of job market. With a positivistic approach, the article seek to observe the contexts of employment through examining the expectations and the needs of organizations and centers which have employed the graduate students of political sciences during the past 30 years.
Having analyzed the significance of making humanities applicable, I studied the actual situation by distributing questionnaires among under and post- graduate students. The article concludes with my suggestions in this field.

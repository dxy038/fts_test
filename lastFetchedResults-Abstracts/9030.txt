This paper develops a software package to calculate the optimal contract capacities for industrial customers. Based on the time-of-use (TOU) rates employed by the Taiwan Power Company, the objective function is formulated, to minimize the electricity bill of industrial customers during the whole year period. Evolutionary programming (EP) was adopted to solve this problem. Users can get the optimal contract capacities for the peak load, semi-peak load, and off-peak load, respectively. Practical load consumption data were used to prove the validity of this program. Results show that the software developed in this paper can be used as a useful tool for industrial customers in selecting contract capacities to curtail the electricity bill.

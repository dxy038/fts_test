Due to fundamental changes in the power sector, interest in the flexibility available at (future) residential areas is increasing. In the smart grid pilot Your Energy Moment, taking place in The Netherlands, consumers are stimulated to change their energy consumption behavior. Central and home energy management systems are used to send price signals to the participants. Since March 2014, heat pumps are integrated into the pilot. The heat pumps are now able to take into account both the household´s heating demand and the applied dynamic tariff to schedule their load. The objective is to decrease costs, while maintaining the occupants´ comfort. This paper describes the developed algorithm to control the heat pumps and integrate them into the pilot Your Energy Moment. To assess the flexibility of the HPs and the effects of smart control, a model is built to simulate the load, with and without smart control. The model is aligned to the practical data retrieved during the first year of the pilot.

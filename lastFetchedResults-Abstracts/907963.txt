Objectives: the objective was to study determinants and nutritional implications associated with low-fat food consumption. Methods: a cross-sectional design was used, 5,000 military men were contacted and 1,852 participated. Using mailed questionnaires, the low-fat food consumption frequency was recorded and stratified in number of portions a day. The following low-fat food items were included: mayonnaise, yoghurt, milk, cheese, cottage cheese and meat. Results: the two most daily consumed low-fat foods were meat and yoghurt by, respectively, 21.7% and 17.3% of the participants. Only 3.5% consumed a daily portion of low-fat cheese, and 7.4% consumed one or more daily portions of low-fat milk. After adjustment, Body Mass Index (BMI), physical activity and non-smoking were associated with an increasing consumption of low-fat foods. Consumption of low-fat foods was associated with a decreased daily total and saturated fat intake, from respectively, 37.9 and 14.7 energy-percent for low consumption to 30.5 and 11.6 energy-percent for high consumption. This decrease was compensated by an increased intake in carbohydrates and sugar, respectively, 42.5 and 16.7 energy-percent to 46.5 and 22.6 energy-percent. Conclusions: age, BMI, physical activity and non-smoking were associated with an increasing consumption of low-fat foods. The fact that low-fat foods consumers had a higher intake of carbohydrates and proteins question the efficacy of these items in energy reducing programs.

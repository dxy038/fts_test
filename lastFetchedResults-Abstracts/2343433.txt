In this paper, a novel approach for modeling the adaptability of a manufacturing system is introduced. A mathematical model for quantifying the adaptability of a manufacturing system is discussed and real manufacturing data are used for its evaluation. A set of tools, including maximal Lyapunov exponents and bifurcation diagrams are then presented and applied in order to analyze the behavior of a manufacturing system under different operational policies and parameters. The objective of this work is twofold: a) to quantify the ability of a manufacturing system to adapt to demand by using minimal manufacturing data and b) to demonstrate that different operational policies for adaptability in a manufacturing system may be analyzed, by using non-linear and chaotic dynamics tools.

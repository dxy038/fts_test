FACTS technology was introduced into the distribution system (then called FACDS) to improve the distribution system performance. UPFC (Unified Power Flow Controller) is considered to be one of the best suited for power flow control as it controls all the three parameters of distribution line (i.e. impedance, voltage and phase angle). This paper presents a method for minimizing the distribution losses and improving the node voltage profile using UPFC. MATLab program was developed for power flow analysis using Newton-Raphson algorithms and to obtain the optimal location of UPFC using minimum loss as objective function. The proposed method is tested on the IEEE 33 RDS (radial distribution system) standard network.

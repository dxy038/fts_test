Objective
We investigated whether levels of annexin A5, evidence for resistance to annexin A5 activity, and levels anti–annexin A5 antibodies might be altered in women with a history of recurrent spontaneous pregnancy losses.
Study design
These annexin A5 parameters were assayed in 70 nonpregnant women with a history of ≥3 recurrent spontaneous pregnancy losses (cases) and 50 women without adverse pregnancy history (control subjects).
Results
Cases had significantly lower plasma annexin A5 levels than control subjects (median, 4.7 ng/mL [range, 0.3-40.4 ng/mL] vs 6.7 ng/mL [range, 0.7-56.0]; P = .01), significantly reduced anticoagulant ratios (188% [range, 119%-279%] vs 238% [range, 159%-286%]; P< .0001), and reduced binding of annexin A5 to phospholipid (6.3 ng/aliquot phospholipid [range, 1.5-16.4 ng/aliquot phospholipid] vs 9.7 ng/aliquot phospholipid (range, 3.5-17.0 ng/aliquot phospholipid]; P = .0002). There were no significant differences in anti–annexin A5 antibody levels.
Conclusion
Reduction of annexin A5 and interference with its anticoagulant and binding activities are associated significantly with a history of recurrent spontaneous pregnancy losses. These data support the concept of a significant role for annexin A5 in the maintenance of pregnancy.

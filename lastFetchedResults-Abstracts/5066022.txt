In precision missile guidance systems, the objective is not only to minimize the miss distance of missile-target, but also to satisfy the terminal constraint on the interceptor body attitude relative to the target. Together with an effective guidance law, precise information of the targetÂ´s trajectory is a crucial part of the guidance systems. In this work, a precision guidance law is implemented based primarily on the information from a video camera mounted on board the missile. To enhance the precision, we propose a sensor fusion scheme that is the fused information from multiple video cameras mounted on board the missile and unmanned aerial vehicles. The communication channels between the missile and unmanned aerial vehicles suffer very restrictive bit-rate constraints. The coder-decoder pair is implemented to transmit the information between missile and unmanned aerial vehicles. Simulations are run to compare the performance with and without sensor fusion schemes. The simulations show that smaller miss distances and angle errors result in using sensor fusion.

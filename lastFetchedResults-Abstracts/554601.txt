This paper establishes the linearized Phillips-
Heffron model of a power system equipped with unified
power flow controller (UPFC) and designs the UPFC
damping stabilizer to improve power system oscillation
stability. The design problem is converted to an
optimization problem with the eigenvalue-based objective
function which is solved by the new and simple strategy
of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm called ?-
PSO technique. Damping controller is tuned to
simultaneously shift the undamped electromechanical
modes to a prescribed zone in the s-plane. The
effectiveness and performance of the proposed controller
is demonstrated through eigenvalue analysis, nonlinear
time-domain simulation and some performance indices
studies. The results analysis reveals that the designed ?-
PSO based UPFC controller tuned has an excellent
capability in damping power system low frequency
oscillations under different operating conditions.

Autoantibodies to topoisomerase I (topo-I, also referred to as Scl-70, ATA) have historically been considered a specific marker for systemic sclerosis (SSc). Although found in not, vert, similar 20% of SSc sera, other evidence indicated that ATA also occur in up to 25% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Given that SLE is approximately 100 times more prevalent than SSc, the number of ATA positive SLE patients is at least 2â€“3 orders of magnitude greater than the prevalence of ATA in SSc. These observations have raised questions about the disease specificity and clinical value of ATA. Therefore, our objective was to analyse the prevalence of ATA in different disease conditions with a special focus on SLE employing a systematic literature review (meta-analysis) in combination with our experimental investigations.

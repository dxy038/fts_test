Line planning problem is a strategic and long-term decision in passenger railway planning. A line
is a direct railway connection between two stations and is characterized by its origin and destination
station, its frequency/day, the route between these two stations and the intermediate stops at
passing railway stations. The line plan is the collection of all lines and, finding it, is a very complex
problem. Researchers have used linear and non-linear mathematical programming for this
problem. In this paper a new multi objective mixed integer linear mathematical model (MOMILP)
for line planning problem is presented, in which two conflict objective functions, minimizing total
operation costs and maximizing total number of direct passengers, are considered. Total operation
costs consist of fixed cost, variable cost and direct passengers are the passengers that can travel
from their origin station to their destination station without having to change trains. This model is
solved by using goal-programming method. The companies of passenger trains use several kinds
of rolling stocks that are different in speed and capacity, and the number of each kind of them is
limited. Therefore, in the proposed model, the total number of existing rolling stock is limited by
adding a new constraint, and more than one kind of rolling stock can be used for each line. Finally,
a numerical example is presented to evaluate the performance of proposed model. The results
show that by using goal programming, according to planning conditions and organizational priorities,
both objective functions may be optimized simultaneously.

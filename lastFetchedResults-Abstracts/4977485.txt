The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of various biomedical polymers on the adhesion rate of HeLa cells as a model. The HeLa cells used in this study seeded by following our standard laboratory procedure. A total of 1&#215;10<sup>5</sup> cells were plated in each of the pretreated wells with various concentrations of (0.01, 0.1, and 1% wt/vol) polyvaline (P-Val), polyalanine (p-Ala), polytryptophan (P-Trp) and buffered control. At the end of 1,4, and 24 hours the assay was developed by following standard lab procedure. The final determination was achieved by means of ELIZA. The data obtained from this study suggest that (i) the rate of HeLa spreading was strongly influenced by both incubation time and the polymer concentration, (ii) it is apparent that polymer treated wells within the first hour facilitated attachment of HeLa cells to their surfaces for all concentrations tested with the exception of 1% alanine. This observation confirms our previous results using different cell lines and provides a valuable information for experiments that need to be performed in a short period of time with the maximum amount of cells attached, (iii) the surface attachment of HeLa to P-Ala, P-Val, and P-Trp were demonstrated to vary depending on their chemical structure and level of microporosity. Thus, overall observation led us to conclude that the surface reactivity of P-Ala, P-Val, and P-Trp be always taken into account in discussing their biocompatibility using transformed cells such as HeLa cells as a model

Objective: Exposure to the sunlight can have harmful effects on the human skin; such as, skin cancers, hyperpigmentation and photoaging. Therefore, it is essential to use sunscreen products to prevent these adverse effects. The photoprotection provided by a sunscreen product is assessed in terms of its sun protection factor (SPF). There are in vivo and in vitro methods for the SPF determination. In vivo methods have some problems; therefore, in vitro methods are used more often.
Materials and Methods: In this study we compared 3 in vitro methods for the determination of SPF of homosalte FDA standard sunscreen lotion.
Results: The SPF of the homosalte standard lotion by the method of solution in ethanol was 8.23±0.13, by the method of solution in methanol method was 6.17±1.02 and by transpore tape method was 5.88±0.12..
Conclusion: According to these results and statistical tests, transpore tape was the best method.

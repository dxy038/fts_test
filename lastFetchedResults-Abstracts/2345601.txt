Although sharing of products and components is crucial for the increase of the efficiency of product utilization from a life cycle perspective, it is quite difficult to find out promising combinations of components and users among which the components to be shared because various factors (e.g., usage condition and product structure, etc.) are complicatedly interrelated one another. The objective of this study is to propose a user classification method for shared-business that is suitable for a given product architecture, considering the difference in usage conditions and users locations. A simplified case study of a photocopier is also provided.

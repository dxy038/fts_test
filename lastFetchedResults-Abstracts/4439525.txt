Bidirectional associative memory (BAM) is generally considered as a generalization of the Hopfield model. In the present work, it is shown that the equations depicting the continuous Hopfield model and the continuous BAM are the same, suggesting that the two models share common features in their analysis and design, though the functions and the structures of the two seem different. Several results of the Hopfield model are extended to the BAM, including the equilibrium characterization and the asymptotical stability, which are of practical importance in BAM design

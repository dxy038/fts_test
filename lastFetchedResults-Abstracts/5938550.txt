This workshop will provide a forum to discuss the role of design in wearable computing. Wearable computing spans a broad range of interests and expertise, not all of which can be adequately represented by a technical paper in an IEEE Computer Society proceedings. As wearable computing becomes more mainstream and if it is to continue becoming more mainstream, it is important for ISWC to provide appropriate venues for presenting the latest advances in textile, fashion, and industrial design. The objective of this workshop is to come up with a set of recommendations on what the appropriate venues should be and to discuss what the important design issues are for wearable computing.

Decentralized control strategies for multirobot systems have been extensively studied over the past few years. Typically, these strategies aim at exploiting local interaction rules to regulate the overall state of the multirobot system toward a desired configuration, thus generating some desired coordinated behaviors, such as synchronization, swarming, deployment, or formation control. However, when considering the real-world application of multirobot systems, more complex cooperative dynamic behaviors are desirable. Along these lines, in this paper, we propose a methodology to control a multirobot system for cooperatively tracking arbitrarily defined periodic setpoint trajectories. This objective is fulfilled partitioning the multirobot system into independent robots (that can provide control inputs) and dependent robots (that are controlled through local interaction). The motion of the independent robots is then defined in such a way that, exploiting local interactions, the dependent robots are controlled to track the desired trajectories. The proposed control strategy is validated by means of simulations and experiments on real robots.

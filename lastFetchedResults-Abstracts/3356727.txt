This article deals with the evolution of voltage and reactive power control strategies in distribution networks with distributed generation. First a comprehensive review of voltage control and reactive power management techniques is given. The gap between actual or short-term industrial possibilities of distribution grids and techniques proposed in literature is highlighted. A realistic control based on local rules using the reactive power capabilities of distributed generators, capacitor banks and on load tap changer (OLTC) voltage setpoint is then presented. Its objective is to control both distribution network voltages and reactive power flows at the Transport System Operator (TSO) - Distribution System Operator (DSO) interface. The proposed control allows limiting OLTC bounds and conflicts between local rules. At last, this paper presents simulations results based on French MV distribution network in order to depict the efficiency of such a control.

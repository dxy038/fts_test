Background
rug resistance (MDR) mediated by membrane transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (MDR-1) and MDR-associated protein (MRP), remains a challenge in the therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Chemotherapy targeted to hormone receptors may provide a new approach to overcome chemoresistance. The cytotoxic analogue of bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), AN-215, consists of a superactive derivative of doxorubicin, AN-201, which is linked to a bombesin analogue carrier: RC-3094.
s
thors examined the expression of bombesin/GRP receptors in 3 human RCC cell lines (A-498, ACHN. and 786–0) by using reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and radioligand-binding assays. They also evaluated the effects of AN-215 and its cytotoxic radical AN-201 in the same RCC models in vivo, and they studied the effects of AN-215 and AN-201 on the expression levels of MDR-1 and subtype 1 of MRP (MRP-1) by using real-time PCR.
s
5 significantly (P &lt; 0.05) inhibited the growth of A-498, ACHN, and 786–0 RCC xenografted into nude mice by 59.2–67.6%, whereas the cytotoxic radical AN-201 alone had no significant antitumor effects. The efficacy of AN-215 was independent of the expression patterns of MDR-1 and MRP-1 in these RCC cell lines. The induction of MDR-1 by AN-215 was similar (Experiment 2) or weaker (Experiment 1) compared with AN-201. Both AN-215 and AN-201 caused only a minor induction of MRP-1.
sions
rrent findings indicated that targeted chemotherapy with cytotoxic bombesin/GRP analogue AN-215 can inhibit the growth of RCC, providing a new treatment modality for patients with advanced RCC.

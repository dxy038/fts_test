Along with the quick development of highway passenger transportation, the division of the transport course leads to the low efficiency and poor service quality. And the research of theory and method on highway passenger transportation management evolves slowly, which need study specially. Under the consideration of Whole Trip Course and the concept of the relative inefficient fare, the paper establishes the multi-objective optimization model, and puts forward some specific measures and example practice to follow. The study has been used in the transport line regulation in a main hub effectively, which exerts a non-replaceable role for the rapid and smoothly transport service as a part of the public transportation management

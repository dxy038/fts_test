Abstract
Introduction: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a multisystem disease that is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia resulting in both acute and chronic biochemical and anatomical sequel. The prevalence of connective tissue disorders in the diabetic patients has increased in recent years, affecting significantly their quality of life
Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in upper limbs of diabetic patients in Razi hospital and finding the association between the sex ,gender, duration of DM ,HBA1C level and vascular complication of DM 
Materials and Methods: Totally, 535 diabetic patients referred to Razi hospital (rasht) have been examined for limited joint mobility (LJM), shoulder adhesive capsulitis (SAC), carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), Dupuytrenâ€™s contracture (DC), and trigger finger (TF). We recorded information about age, gender, HBAIC, duration of the DM and its complications
Result: The samples were 124 men and 411 women with mean age 56.75 and 53/65 years, respectively. Prevalence of LJM, SAC, CTS, DC and TF in women was 31.9%, 17.3%, 25.1%, 4.4%, 3.2% and in men was 24.2%, 17.7%, 8.9%, 2.4%, 1.6%, respectively. Prevalence of these complications in patients over sixty years old was 42.18%,29.63%,29.96%,5.18%,3.7% and in Hba1c  > 7was 35.1,18.6%,22.9%,3.7%, and in patients with over 10 years of DM duration was 46%,25.7%,31.6%,6.8%and 4.6%, respectively.
Conclusion: As revealed, there was a high prevalence of musculoskeletal complications in diabetic patients, which was higher in patients over sixty years old, those with more than 10 year duration and those with HBA1C level more than seven.

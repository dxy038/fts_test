Background: Low intensity ultrasound (US) has some well-known bio-effects
which are of great importance to be considered.
Objective: We conducted the present study to investigate the effects of low intensity continuous ultrasound on blood cells count in rat.
Methods: Rats were anesthetized and blood samples were collected before US exposure. Then, they were exposed to US with nominal intensity of 0.2 W/cm2 at frequency of 3 MHz for a period of 10 minutes and this protocol was repeated for 7 days.
Twenty four hours after the last US exposure, secondary blood samples were collected
and the changes in blood parameters were evaluated.
Results: Analysis revealed that platelets, hematocrit (HCT) and hemoglobin
(HGB) were signifcantly different between experimental and sham groups but no difference between sham and control groups was observed. The results show that HCT
and HGB of exposed rats were signifcantly reduced.
Conclusion: This study shows that low intensity US may lead to side effects for
hematological parameters such as reduction in the levels of HGB and HCT.

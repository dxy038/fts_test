In this paper, the problem of determining the optimum number and locations of banking automatic teller
machines (ATMs) is considered. The objective is to minimize the total number of ATMs to cover all customer
demands within a given geographical area. First, a mathematical model of this optimization problem
is formulated. A novel heuristic algorithm with unique features is then developed to efficiently solve
this problem. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of this algorithm in solving the ATM
placement problem.

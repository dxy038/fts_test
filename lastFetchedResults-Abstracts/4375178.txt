For more efficient use of wireless sensor networks, the article using the Bayesian formula to revise the subjective weights base on the fuzzy multiple attribute decision making (MADMR) of WSN routing algorithm which making the subjective weight more theoretical, at the same time using the entropy coefficient model to avoid too much deviation with the objective weights. The simulation results show that the improved algorithm shows a more excellent performance in increase network coverage, balance the network energy consumption and so on.

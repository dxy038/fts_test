We consider a class of optimization problems concerned with finding an optimal subset of a given measurable space. The objective and constraints are set functions which may be nonadditive. After defining the properties of differentiability and convexity for set functions we develop some results concerning locally and globally optimal subsets. Numerical techniques for finding the optimal subset are described.

Objective: Reduction of attentional resources is readi ly apparen t in
cases of reduced or conflicti ng sensory informa tion. The purpose of
this stu dy is to com pare at tentio nal demands of postural control
between ath letes with func tiona l ankle instability (FAI) and heal thy
matched individuals .
Ma ter ials & Methods : 15 func tional unstable ankles college athlete s
and 15 healthy matched athlete s were selec ted conveniently. This case
control, dua l-task study was conducted usi ng Biodex Balance System
(BBS) . To measure overall stability index while subjects experiencing 2
postural task difficu ltie s (stability levels of 5 and 7 of BBS) and 2 cognitive
loadings (no load and counting backward). In order to investigate the
inte raction s of independent varia bles (pos tural task diffic ulty, cognitive
task difficulty and health status) multi fac toria l mixed ANOYAs were used.
'l-'Iest was conducted to compare means in groups .
Results: Mixed ANOYA showed interaction effects of health status with
postura l task di fficulty and cog nitive task diffic ulty on overall stabi lity
ind ex are signi ficant. Patients had significantly more increase in overall
stability ind ex whe n co nfron ting cogn itive task and less stable support
surface than healthy subjec ts. (P=O.O1, P=0.03).
Conclusion : It seems that functional ankle instability (FA!) is associated
with increased attentional demands to senti -dynamic pos tural co ntrol.
Cognitive loading may be considere d in any exercise program for FAI
pat ients as an effecti ve stra tegy.

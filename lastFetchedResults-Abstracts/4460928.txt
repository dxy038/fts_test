In this work, a Back to Back converter based on a Diode Clamped Multilevel topology is presented. Both converters are controlled using model predictive approach. The control objective of the front-end converter is the DC bus voltage regulation with sinusoidal current and unity power factor, while the load converter drives an induction motor through predictive direct torque control. Both algorithms search for the best switching combination in order to optimize their corresponding control targets and also the voltage balance issue. Both switching sequence controllers are carried out autonomously with no need of information exchange about converter states. The performance of the conversion system is evaluated by means of computer simulations.

Artificial neural network (ANN) models, correlating the mechanical properties (yield strength, tensile strength, %elongation and r Â¯ ) of the cold rolled interstitial free (IF) steel sheets with compositional and processing parameters, are used to find the importance of different variables. Further the above models are used as objective functions for the evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms by evolving tradeoffs, which gives a range of combination of strength and ductility. The optimal solutions are also analysed to extract further knowledge on the role of various parameters, which could be used for designing the chemistry of the alloy as well as process parameters for producing cold rolled strips of IF steel with tailor made property.

This paper discusses several ways in which a community of volunteers can be put together to generate good quality geographical information by the use of remote sensing image analysis tools. Three different scenarios are proposed and a system architecture, based on existing open source solutions, is suggested and discussed. The main objective of this paper is to motivate contributions to build such a system.

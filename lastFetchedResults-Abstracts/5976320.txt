To meet the current and future needs of the increasing bandwidth demand in wireless communications, base-to-base communication requires fast, reliable, secure and elastic bandwidth. One communication technology that meets these challenges is the fiber with wavelength division multiplexing. This technology multiplexes in a single fiber several wavelengths, each sourced by individual lasers thus adding to cost, complexity and fault management. An alternative, is a single laser source at higher power which when coupled onto a highly dispersive medium generates a wide spectral band known as supercontinuum. When this is appropriately sliced, multiple wavelength/channels are generated. In this paper, we develop a supercontinuum model, the spectrum of which is sliced The using FBGs to generate optical channels as recommended by ITU-T standards. We simulate our model at OC-48, selected for being popular in low cost applications. We also determine the longest link without amplification at performance objective 10-12 bit error rate.

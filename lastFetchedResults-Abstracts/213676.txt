Background and Objective: Glumerular diseases are among the most prevalent causes of renal chronic insufficiencies. This study aimed to analyze the prevalence of various kinds of glumerulonephritis based on the findings of electron microscope.
Materials and Methods: This study had a descriptive retrospective and cross sectional strategy.
Slides of patients (124 cases) who had undergone kidney biopsy during a one-year period due to renal diseases were reviewed and compared. The required data were collected and analyzed using SPSS software.
Results: It was found out that 52.4% of the patients were female and 47.6% were male. The average age of the female patients was 28.26 and of the male ones was 29.8 years old. The most prevalent type of glumerulonephritis was membranous and the most prevalent stage was stage II.
The prevalent fluorescence pattern of the IgG deposits in the basal membrane of glomerulus.
Conclusion: Regarding the variety in the prevalence of different kinds of glumerulonephritis fond within different ages and sex, all cases should be taken into consideration while dealing with the patients. It should also be noticed that immunofluorscence is a complementary diagnosis method
and does not have much use without electron and light microscope. In those cases where several contradictory diagnoses have been suggested in light microscope or a particular change has not
been observed or the sample has not been sufficient to be analyzed, electron microscope has a final and significant role.

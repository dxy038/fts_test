The use of computerized techniques for the automatic interpretation of satellite images may be a solution to the problem of analyzing large databases. The authors give special consideration to AVHRR images of the northeastern North Atlantic coast. The objective of the system is the automatic recognition of satellite images of mesoscale oceanic structures in AVHRR infrared images taken near the northeastern coasts of Africa, Canary Islands, western Mediterranean Sea, Portugal and Galicia and the Cantabrian coast in NW Spain. Important dynamical structures are upwellings, eddies and wakes. The images of these zones are found also to be affected by atmospheric phenomena, such as cloud formations or concentrations of dust from the Sahara Desert that limit and impede interpretation

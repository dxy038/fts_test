The size of sample was 340 calculated on the basis of Kukran formula with maximum dispersion and 5 percent error. The sampling method was multiple cluster sampling. 
The descriptive results of the research indicate that condition of variables of research, particularly its dependent variable, that is, cultural intelligence and its dimensions is desirable. The analytical results of the research indicate that the independent variables, that is, cultural empathy, social initiative and ethnicism have a significantimpact on cultural intelligence.

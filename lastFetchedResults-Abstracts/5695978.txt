An interactive CAD methodology is presented for designing digital filters with optimised discrete coefficients. The objective is to minimise the cost of integration <img src="/images/tex/14578.gif" alt="C(under\\tilde{a})"/> subject to the constraint that the desired specifications on the complex frequency transfer function <img src="/images/tex/14579.gif" alt="H(w,under\\tilde{a})"/> are satisfied. The vector a represents the fixed coefficients in the filter network. For VLSI DSP architectures, where multiplication is implemented using software controlled or hardwired shift-and-add operations, <img src="/images/tex/14578.gif" alt="C(under\\tilde{a})"/> is defined as the total number of non-zero bits in the discrete representation of <img src="/images/tex/14580.gif" alt="under\\tilde{a}"/> . An accurate multiparameter analysis technique, based on the bilinear property of <img src="/images/tex/14579.gif" alt="H(w,under\\tilde{a})"/> , is exploited to develop numerically reliable and computationally efficient tools for function evaluation and feasible region determination. These are built into a CAD framework together with tools for computing <img src="/images/tex/14578.gif" alt="C(under\\tilde{a})"/> and predicting the location of the minima of <img src="/images/tex/14578.gif" alt="C(under\\tilde{a})"/> Extremely fast optimisation strategies using this framework are demonstrated, for different filter topologies with up to 10 coefficients.

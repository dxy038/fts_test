Diabetes is a chronic disease. Diabetics must keep blood glucose between 70 and 160 mg / dl. To do this, he/she must test the blood glucose several times a day, take drug, inject insulin, follow a diet plan, practice activities, etc. Since, diabetes management is very difficult task, especially for dependent patients (old, blind, etc.) and it requires the use of various devices, it is necessary to have assistant system to help diabetics. So, the aim of this work is to propose a system to help diabetics in diabetes management. This system is based on a new middleware called tinyUPnP. tinyUPnP works in combination with other proposed underlying protocols: tinyHTTP, tinySSDP, tinyGENA and tinySOAP). The main objective is to enable the control of services turned in devices used to manage diabetes. A test-bed to calculate insulin dose for pre-16H00 meal is proposed.

This paper presents the concept of the evaluation line - a posteriori preference articulation approach for evaluating Pareto-optimal solutions using high level preference criteria. The evaluation line is an approach based on analytical geometry. It is sketched using a weighted function that prioritizes the different objectives by assigning unique weights. It then evaluates each Pareto-optimal solution based on its point-line distance from the line. Based on its function, the evaluation line leans appropriately to demonstrate preference towards one or more objectives and its function is extended to the n-objective space. The evaluation line is compared with the classical weighted sum approach. The comparison demonstrates the relativity of the two approaches but also highlights the strength of the evaluation line in the cases of non convex Pareto-optimal fronts.

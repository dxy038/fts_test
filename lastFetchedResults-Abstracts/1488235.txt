The objective was to study prediction of pork quality by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology in the laboratory. A total of 131 commercial pork loin samples were measured with NIRS. Predictive equations were developed for drip loss %, colour L*, a*, b* and pH ultimate (pHu). Equations with R2 &gt; 0.70 and residual prediction deviation (RPD) â‰¥ 1.9 were considered as applicable to predict pork quality. For drip loss% the prediction equation was developed (R2 0.73, RPD 1.9) and 76% of those grouped superior and inferior samples were predicted within the groups. For colour L*, test-set samples were predicted with R2 0.75, RPD 2.0, colour a* R2 0.51, RPD 1.4, colour b* R2 0.55, RPD 1.5 and pHu R2 0.36, RPD 1.3. It is concluded that NIRS prediction equations could be developed to predict drip loss% and L*, of pork samples. NIRS equations for colour a*, b* and pHu were not applicable for the prediction of pork quality on commercially slaughtered pigs.

In industry, many applications of planar mechanisms such as slider-crank mechanisms have been found in thousands of devices. Typically due to the effect of inertia, these elastic links are subject to axial and transverse periodic forces. Vibrations of these mechanisms are the main source of noise and fatigue that lead to short useful life and failure. Hence, avoiding the occurrence of large amplitude vibration of such systems is of great importance. Recently, the use of specified materials, which are periodically embedded into structures, to satisfy designing requirement has been the subject of many interests. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to present analytical and numerical methodologies to study the dynamics of a slider-crank mechanism with an axially periodic array non-homogeneous coupler; the proposed passive system is introduced to reduce the region of parametric resonance of the mechanism. The Fourier-series based approach and Newtonian mechanics are employed in the analysis. An attention is given to the influence produced by the in-homogeneity of materials of the periodic array to the primary region of dynamic instability of the system.

 of present study indicates that under the same operational condition, the commensurability between the natural frequency of the mechanism and the excitation frequency can be weakened by varying the material properties of the periodic array. The in-homogeneity of materials of the periodic array can be treated as a tuning parameter of the natural frequency of the slider-crank mechanism. With proper choice of the material properties and thickness of the embedded laminas of the periodic array, the occurrence of parametric resonance can be suppressed such that the growth of small amplitude vibration into large motion regime is attenuated.

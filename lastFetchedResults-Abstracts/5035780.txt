In this paper the authors will present an overview of the recent development of squarewave AC power supplies within the European Space Agency (ESA). The objective of this development was to use an AC inverter concept to provide a standard power "adapter" function between varying power bus standards.(dictated by satellite type and payload) and service functions of the various spacecraft (e.g. Attitude Control Electronics, Data Handling Equipment and other Auxiliary power functions of a spacecraft). The paper shall endeavour to explain in more detail the rationale behind the chosen concept, the system approach to the powering of essential spacecraft loads (no single point failure allowed) the specific interface specifications required and finally the detailed design and performance of the AC inverter chosen.

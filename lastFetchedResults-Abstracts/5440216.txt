To objectively display myocardial opacification following intravenous injection of ultrasound contrast agents, we applied a first harmonic Fourier transformation to precordial harmonic Power-Doppler images in 21 patients undergoing Tl-201-SPECT, in 13 control subjects, and to epicardial second harmonic B-mode images in 10 patients undergoing CABG. Temporal and spatial distribution of myocardial intensities were analyzed. Marked temporal delays (phase shift 106&#177;90&#176;), and low intensities (30&#177;20) were found in 13/14 perfusion defects. Epicardial imaging showed higher intensity increases in septal (&#916; 40&#177;22) than in posterolateral segments (&#916; 20&#177;10, p&lt;0.005) but regional phase angles were not different (&#916; 47&#177;11&#176;, n.s.), indicating homogenous resting perfusion. Thus, Fourier analysis can be applied to Power-Doppler- and epicardial harmonic B-mode images to display myocardial opacification in a simple objective format

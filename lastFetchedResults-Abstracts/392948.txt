Objective
This study evaluated the results of laryngeal collagen injection.
Study design
Retrospective study of patients who had undergone laryngeal collagen injection.
Materials and methods
A retrospective review of 275 patients treated with collagen injection and a review of the relevant literature on the results of treatment were presented. Follow-up studies were performed for at least 3 months on 155 patients. The patientsâ€™ voice quality was assessed by perceptual voice analysis using the GRBAS scale, and their vocal function was assessed by acoustic and aerodynamic measures (maximal phonation time and mean flow rate). Assessments were performed before and after collagen injection.
Results
Mean objective measures and clinician's perceptual ratings demonstrated measurable improvement in vocal function and voice quality after collagen injection. There were no major complications and no hypersensitivity reactions.
Conclusion
As an outpatient office procedure, collagen injection offers a simple, efficient and effective treatment for dysphonia. Various aspects of the procedure for anesthesia, injection techniques, and patient selection are discussed

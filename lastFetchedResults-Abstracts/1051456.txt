Background: Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Enterobacter spp. containing class 1 integrons are considered as one of the major concerns of clinicians and infection control specialists. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the association between class 1 integrons and the multidrug resistance pattern among Enterobacter spp. 
Methods: In this analytical study, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern were determined among 137 isolates of Enterobacter from Qazvin and Tehran hospitals during May 2011-September 2012. Then all isolates were screened for class 1 integrons using PCR assay. Data were analyzed using chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. 
Findings: The MDR pattern was found in 83 isolates (61%) and class 1 integrons were detected in 52 (63%) of these isolates. There was a significant association between the presence of class 1 integrons and the MDR pattern. 
Conclusion: With regards to the results, use of proper equipment for infection control and appropriate treatment strategies are necessary.

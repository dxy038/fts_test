The feature subset selection is critical for the real-time detection of the stored-grain insects based on image recognition technology. This study proposed a feature selection method based on artificial immune algorithm Immune (AIA). The single objective affinity evaluation function was developed to evaluate the feature subset by introducing the v-fold cross-validation training model accuracy and the number of the selected features. The feature subset selection for the nine species of the insects of wheat was conducted from the 17 morphological features by using AIA. Compared with the feature selection method based on genetic algorithm, AIA can further decrease the size of the feature subset and improve the classification accuracy. By using the 7 features selected based on AIA, the SVM classifier whose parameters had been optimized classified over 95.5% of the ninety image samples of the insects. The results show that it is practical and feasible.

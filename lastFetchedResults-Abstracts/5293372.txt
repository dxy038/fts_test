Based on load balance ideas, this paper constructs an integer programming model for the order planning of the steel-iron enterprise, whose objective is to minimize the total cost including earliness-tardiness penalty, load imbalance penalty, order cancellation penalty. According to the characteristics of the model, a scatter search algorithm with heuristic repaired strategy for infeasible solutions is designed. To examine algorithm´s efficiency and effectiveness, this paper also uses genetic algorithm to solve the model. Using several sets of practical order data as instances, this paper analyzes the two algorithms´ results. The numerical analysis shows that the model and the scatter search algorithm are valid.

A reactor is an important unit operation in the process industries. A sequences of a first order of an isothermal reactor are used at constant volume. The reactor is a system which faces instability due to its dynamic behaviors. The reactor might plays a significant role especially when it involves a process that is hazardous to the environment. The objective of this paper is to study different types of control strategy applications for the reactor which are feedback control, feed forward control, cascade control, constant gain feedback control, classical control, decoupling control, robustness analysis and plant uncertainty. MATLAB and SIMULINK are the essential tools to study the dynamic behavior of the reactor.

Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines derived from skin fibroblasts of patients suffering from cardiac disorders were differentiated to cardiomyocytes and used to generate a data set of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients of 136 recordings. The objective was to separate normal signals for later medical research from abnormal signals. We constructed a signal analysis procedure to detect peaks representing calcium cycling in signals and another procedure to classify them into either normal or abnormal peaks. Using machine learning methods we classified signals into normal or abnormal signals on the basis of peak findings in them. We compared classification results obtained to those made visually by an expert biotechnologist who assessed the signals independent of the computer method. Classification accuracies of around 85% indicated high congruence between two modes denoting the high capability and usefulness of computer based processing for the present data.

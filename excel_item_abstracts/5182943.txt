The information visualization results are retrieving lack of information to meet userÂ´s speech query even though there is presenting information and results in visualization. Hence, in this study, visualization of retrieving relevant documents through cross language information retrieval (CLIR) system needs to across language boundaries, a mechanism for query translation with semantic and stemmers are required well-known as stemming semantic query (SSQ). Therefore, this study is conducted with the purposes to investigate visualization approach against the queries and vice versa using SpaceTree. Furthermore, it is also conducted to investigate the performance of visualization to present normal listing results. The retrieval results however, focus on how SpaceTree is beneficial to represent them in a good manner. Results from the experiments suggest that SpaceTree is most friendly to display results to the users in CLIR. It also found that semantic approach with stemmers contributes to better performance in visualizing more relevant and related Quran document results.

The objective of this paper is to present two modal identification methods that extract dynamic characteristics from output-only data sets collected by a low-cost and rapid-to-deploy wireless structural monitoring system installed upon a long-span cable-stayed bridge. Specifically, an extensive program of full-scale ambient vibration testing has been conducted to measure the dynamic response of the 240 m Gi-Lu cable-stayed bridge located in Nantou County, Taiwan. Two different output-only identification methods are used to analyze the set of ambient vibration data: the stochastic subspace identification method (SSI) and the frequency domain decomposition method (FDD). A total of 10 modal frequencies and their associated mode shapes are identified from the dynamic interaction between the bridge’s cables and deck vibrations within the frequency range of 0–7 Hz. The majority of the modal frequencies observed from recording cable vibrations are also found to be associated with the deck vibrations, implying considerable interaction between the deck and cables.

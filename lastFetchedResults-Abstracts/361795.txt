Dizziness is a frequent presenting complaint in emergency department patients. Although seen in patients of all ages, it is more prevalent in patients older than 50 years of age. Vertigo represents a subset of dizziness and is defined as an illusion of movement, usually rotational, of the patient or the patient’s surroundings. The illusion of motion may be of oneself (subjective vertigo) or of external objects (objective vertigo). The emergency physician should consider a large differential in the evaluation of vertigo with special attention to whether the vertigo is central or peripheral in origin.

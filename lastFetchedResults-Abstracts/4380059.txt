An experiment named AMMON is dedicated to the analysis of the neutron and photon physics of the Jules Horowitz Reactor (JHR). AMMON, performed in the EOLE zero-power experimental reactor at CEA Cadarache, is finished since April 2013. Photon heating measurements were performed with both Thermoluminescent Dosimeters (TLD-400s) and Optically-Stimulated Dosimeters (OSLDs) in three AMMON configurations. The objective is to provide data for the experimental validation of the JHR photon calculation tool. The first analysis of the photon heating measurements of the reference configuration (AMMON/REF) is presented in this paper. The reference configuration consists of an experimental zone of 7 JHR assemblies with U<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>2</sub> - Al 27% <sup>235</sup>U enriched fuel curved plates surrounded by a driver zone with 623 standard PWR UOx fuel pins. The photon heating has been measured in the aluminum follower of the central and peripheral assemblies, and in aluminum fillers in the rack between assemblies. The measurement analysis is based on Monte Carlo TRIPOLI-4 &#174; version 8.1 calculations modeling the core exact three-dimensional geometry. The JEFF nuclear data library is used for the calculation of the neutron transport and the photon emission in the AMMON/REF experiment. The photon transport is made on the basis of the EPDL97 photo-atomic library. The prompt and delayed doses deposited in dosimeters have been estimated separately. The transport of 4 (neutrons, photons, electrons and positrons) or 3 particles (photons, electrons and positrons) is simulated in the calculations for the AMMON/REF analysis, depending whether the prompt or delayed dose is calculated. The TRIPOLI-4.8.1 &#174; calculations makes it possible the modeling of the electromagnetic cascade shower with both electrons and positrons. The delayed dose represents about 25% of the total photon energy deposition in the dosimeters. The comparison between Calculation and Experiment brings i- to relief a slight systematic underestimation of the calculated global photon energy deposition: (C - E)/E = - 8% &#177;4.5% (1&#963;). A special care has been directed towards the determination of the uncertainty associated with the (C-E)/E values. The slight underestimation could be probably explained by an underestimation in the photon emission with the JEFF library.

A decision control system for picking optimal speech from multi-channels based on quality assessment is presented. First, the feature parameters which are used to describe speech quality are extracted on the basis of analyzing the properties of remote speech communication channels. Second, an objective assessment model of speech quality is founded. Finally, a decision control system has been developed combined with properties of human beings. This decision control system can ensure that communication should be carried on the best speech channel, as well as it can also keep a good audio performance during switching. This system has been applied in practice successfully and the performance of it is very satisfactory

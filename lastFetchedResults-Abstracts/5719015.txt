The referees of gymnastics give objective evaluation of performance subjectively according to the competition rules. Due to their differences of aesthetic value and understanding of competition rules, it may easily cause the error of evaluation. Take 16th University Games Gymnastics Competition Group 1 as example, we use range analysis, variance analysis, consistency test, correlation coefficient and other methods to conduct empirical analysis on Objectivity of Athleticism evaluation. The data shows the business level of art referee is low. We build the Computer Application Template of objective evaluation. This inspection procedure saves time and effort and give results right after the referee make the individual grading. With its strong availability and operability, the inspection procedure provides data support for Objective score, appeal and arbitration complaint with the Competition. This research has some limitation on special issues of data show. We should consider regional characteristics and the actual situation of referee evaluation with analysis of data as the auxiliary reference of objectivity of Athleticism evaluation.

The objective was to determine the sire effect on the pregnancy outcome in beef cows in which stage of estrus was synchronized with progesterone based fixed-time artificial insemination (AI) protocols. Three Angus sires with more than 300 breedings were evaluated for differences in pregnancy outcome from 1868 inseminations. Angus cross beef cows (N = 1868) were synchronized with Ovsynch-CIDR or CO-Synch-CIDR protocols for fixed-time AI. Cows in both groups that showed estrus on day 9 before 1500 h were designated to Selectsynch-CIDR group and were inseminated according to AM-PM rule. Results indicated that Sire 2 had lower fixed-time AI pregnancy rate compared to Sire 3 (48.1% versus 58.7%; P = 0.01). Significant sire × synchronization program and sire × location interactions were observed for fixed-time AI (P &lt; 0.05). Sire 2 had a lesser fixed-time AI pregnancy in both Ovsynch-CIDR and CO-Synch-CIDR groups compared to Sire 3. In two of four locations, Sire 2 had a lesser fixed-time pregnancy rate compared to Sire 3. No sire differences were observed in AI pregnancy for cows in Selectsynch-CIDR group. In conclusion, evidence in this study suggest that there are differences in sire fertility when they were used in fixed-time AI protocols, possibly due to the sire differences in sperm capacitation process. Further studies are needed to investigate association of the sire differences in fixed-time AI protocols with sire differences in the sperm capacitation process.

There are many issues to be considered in the design of distance-based fuzzy semi-supervised clustering (FSSC) algorithms. To identify these issues, we compare the performance of four such algorithms. We describe the properties of these algorithms, highlighting their key differences, and then experimentally compare their performance on common datasets. Several experimental conditions are investigated. Firstly, two forms of initialisation of the membership values of unlabelled patterns are used; 1/c and 0. Secondly, the algorithms are run with varying proportions of labelled patterns in the datasets, ranging from 2% to 40%. We find that no algorithm outperforms the others in all the datasets. We also observe that small modifications in similar objective functions can improve clustering, and that most of the algorithms perform slightly better with zero initialisation of unlabelled patterns. An interesting observation is that the increase in labelled patterns does not always improve clustering. From these results, we conclude that the number and scale of dimensions in the data set, initial partition matrix, distance metrics and objective functions, together, affect clustering results. In addition, we conclude that not all initially labelled patterns are good candidates for supervision.

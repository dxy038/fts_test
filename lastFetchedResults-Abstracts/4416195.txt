The novel method of multi-objective optimization of reentry trajectory planning for hypersonic aircraft based on ant colony algorithm is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the reentry corridor is determined in terms of different constraint conditions during reentry process. In the reentry corridor, different optimal reentry trajectories are decided by objectives. To solve the multi-objective optimization of reentry trajectory planning, ant colony algorithm is utilized which would plan an optimal trajectory satisfying a certain demand according to different weight allocation among multi-objective. Simulation results of three cases with different weight allocation between two objectives indicate that this algorithm can plan different optimal trajectories according to weight allocation between two objectives in order to satisfy diverse mission requirement.

We present a method to compress digital ink based on piecewise-linear approximation within a given error threshold. The objective is to achieve good compression ratio with very fast execution. The method is especially effective on types of handwriting that have large portions with nearly linear parts, e.g. hand drawn geometric objects. We compare this method with an enhanced version of our earlier functional approximation method, finding the new technique to give slightly worse compression while performing significantly faster. This suggests the presented method can be used in applications where speed of processing is of higher priority than the compression ratio.

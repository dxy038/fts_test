This paper proposes a multi-objective evolutionary method for a Japanese domestic airline network using socioeconomic-environmental data obtained from Japanese governmental bureaus and NOAA Tsunami Data and Information. Japanese domestic air transportation information is extracted to construct an airline network constituting of airports and flights. When we define three kinds of metrics such as Risk (R), Economy (E) and Convenience (C) for an airline network based on several statistics and evaluate them, we find that there exists a tradeoff relationship between these metrics. In order to decrease the Risk (R) metric while simultaneously increasing the Economy (E) and Convenience (C) metrics, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary method for reorganizing the airline network, and evaluate the resultant networks from the viewpoints of changes in three metrics.

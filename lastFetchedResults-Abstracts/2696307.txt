This paper presents two-phase modulated digital control for a three-phase bidirectional inverter with wide inductance variation in dc distribution systems. The bidirectional inverter can fulfill both grid connection and rectification with power factor correction. With the proposed control, the inverter can track its sinusoidal reference currents, and it is allowed to have wide inductance variation, reducing core size significantly. The control laws based on space-vector pulsewidth modulation are first derived with either an accurate approach or an approximated one, and the gate signals were then derived based on two-phase modulation for lower switching loss and switching noise spectra. Determination of control parameters and stability analysis are also presented. In the design and implementation, the inductances corresponding to various inductor currents were measured and tabulated into a single-chip microcontroller for tuning loop gain cycle by cycle, ensuring system stability. Measured results from a 10 kVA 3&#966; bidirectional inverter have been presented to confirm the feasibility of the discussed control approaches.

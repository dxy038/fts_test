Matrix Converters (MCs) are popular due to direct AC/AC conversion applications without the need of bulky, lifetime limited DC links capacitors. In this paper the mostly used MC topologies are explained. Each topology is also modeled and described as well. Moreover, various types of bidirectional switches required for building a MC are studied and compared to show their advantages and drawbacks. As well, some controlling methods associated to MCs are also discussed.

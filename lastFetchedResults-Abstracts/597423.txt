The objective of this study is to examine the perception differences of TQM in Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) region and find the relationship between education, experience, gender and TQM perceptions. Gap is a project aimed at removing the development differences between west and east regions of Turkey. In a developing region such as Southeastern Anatolia, it is important to determine how TQM, perceived by businesses, help to conduct and better implement the TQM philosophy. With an understanding of the perception differences between businesses, it is of the study's view that TQM efforts will be more useful and practical. In this study, we used factor analysis and regression analysis to determine the differences between industries. Then regression analysis was used with dummy variables to compare the business groups. Results indicate that in GAP region, different industries perceive TQM efforts differently and as such, textile business is the most pessimistic sector about TQM efforts, while iron-steel industry is the most optimistic one. Moreover, education and experience have an effect on TQM perception in a positive manner. TQM practitioners who try to implement TQM efforts in GAP region must consider these findings and should behave accordingly.

The objective of this paper is to provide an efficient method to reduce the attributes of an incomplete decision table. By introducing a rough set-based measure into the fitness function of genetic algorithm, a new reduct method is proposed. Experiments show that the proposed method can dealing with the attribute uncertainty more accurately and get the accurate reducts in a fast time.

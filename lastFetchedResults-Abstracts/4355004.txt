Summary form only given, as follows. High-voltage pulsed power techniques are the enabling know-how for industrial applications. The objective of the present work is the development of a 30 kW pilot plant corona-induced plasma system for industrial applications. The parameters of the system are in the range of 100 kV peak voltage, 20 ns rise time, 100 ns pulse width and 1000 pulses per second repetition rate. The total electrical conversion efficiency that we can reach is near 90%. The design of the pulse source is based on a modified resonant charging system, a newly designed heavy duty spark gap switch, a highly efficient transmission line transformer and a well matched plasma reactor. In addition the source combines the pulses with a DC bias level to increase and control the output to the plasma reactor. The pulse source is presently under construction. Important operational conditions have already been tested. Details will be reported together with industrial application of subsystems for biogas plasma treatment.

The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of percutaneous catheter drainage, of early infected pancreatic fluid collections, in critically ill patients with severe acute pancreatitis. The patients in our series had a mean Ranson's score of 5.4. Nineteen (63.3%) of the 30 patients were cured with percutaneous drainage. In this group, the mean C-reactive protein value at the beginning of treatment was 172.8 U/l and 102.5 U/l at the end (P<.001). Cultures yielded multiple organisms in 23 patients (76.7%). The most frequently seen organisms were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium.

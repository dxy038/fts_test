For the design of large dipole switched array antennas, an approximate input impedance model for a dipole in an array environment is extended. The objective of the model is to generate reasonably accurate results in a minimum of time. The extension allows for the application of thick dipoles. The extended approximate model is compared to a three-term dipole-dipole coupling model and full-wave analysis results. The extended approximate model gives reasonably accurate results for dipole distances down to 0.20&#955; for unequal length dipole elements and down to 0.35&#955; for equal length dipole elements. The three-term model improves the accuracy further at the expense of a more complex model. Both models generate results in times that are orders of magnitude smaller than when a full wave analysis program is being employed.

Background: Pentoxifylline (PTX) is used in human for intermittent
claudication and cerebral vascular disorders including
cerebrovascular dementia . It also inhibits the synthesis of tumor
necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), which is believed to be neurotox ic in
animal models of cere bral ischemia. The objective of this study
was to examine the role of PTX on ischemi a/reperfusion inj ures
in rat model of transient focal cerebral ischemia induced by
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) .
Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats (n=3 I) were assigned to
sham, saline or PTX (30 or 60 mg/kg)-treated groups. Ischemia
was induced by MCAO, followed by 24-hrs reperfusion.
Intraperiton eal sa line or PTX was administered at 30 min before
ischemia. Neurological deficit score test (NOS) was performed
after 24-hrs, and the animals was sacrificed for evaluation
of cortic al and striata l infarct volumes using triphen yltetr azolium
chloride staining.
Results: The sham group did not have neural dysfunction or
ce rebral infarction. Cortica l infar ct volumes in 30 or 60 mg/kg
PTX-treated groups, 149(PLUS-MINUS)12 and 129(PLUS-MINUS) 19 mm] respect ively,
were signific antly lower than that of sa line-trea ted group (20 8
(PLUS-MINUS) 12 mrrr'). Similar result s were also obtained about the striatal
infarct volumes (39(PLUS-MINUS)5 and 40(PLUS-MINUS)6 vs. 58(PLUS-MINUS)5 rnm') . However,
there was no significant difference among the neurol ogical
dysfun ctions from sa line and PTX-t reated rats.
Conclusion: the results of this study indicate that pentoxifylline
reduced cerebral infarctions, possibl y by diminishing the
TN F-a-induced neurotoxic ity in tran sient focal cerebral
ischemia. This finding also suggests that pentoxifylline might
be suitable for clinical trials.

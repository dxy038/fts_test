The objective of this randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the value of allopurinol treatment on reduction of oxidative stress in patients with diabetes type II patients. Forty-one diabetic type II subjects were randomly assigned to two groups. One group (n = 20) received 100 mg allopurinol three times a day for 14 days and the other group (n = 21) received a placebo. Blood and saliva samples were collected before and after intervention for analysis of lipid peroxidation level and total antioxidant power as indices of oxidative stress. At the beginning of the study, the groups were similar based upon age, duration of diabetes, fasting glucose, and HbA1c. Both allopurinol and placebo were effective in reduction of lipid peroxidation and total antioxidant power whether in saliva or plasma in a similar extent. HbA1c and FBS levels did not change through the study neither in case or placebo group. It is concluded that allopurinol therapy is not more effective than placebo in reduction of oxidative stress in diabetic patients. The same trend of changes in blood and saliva shown for oxidative stress indices was interesting and suggests a chance for saliva to be valuable in diagnosis of oxidative stress. However, to elaborate the exact role of allopurinol in diabetes, further large randomized clinical trials are needed.

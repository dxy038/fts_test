The main objective of the present paper is to discuss the blood flow analysis through inclined arteries by treating its nature as viscous fluid. The effects of both dilatation and constriction are considered to investigate the behavior of the both abnormal wall segments with variable nanofluid viscosity. The nonlinear momentum equation for proposed model is simplified by considering the nondimensionless parameters to find the exact solutions of the formulated problem. The main hemodynamic effects of stenosis and aneurysm are discussed for different values of the interest by plotting the graphs of wall shear stress and resistance impedance to flow and opposite behavior is observed for both cases. The results also reveal that the nanoparticles with high concentration are important to reduce the resistance impedance to blood flow. The graphs of stream lines show the formation of bolus appears in the aneurysm segment but no formation is observed or seen in the stenotic segment.

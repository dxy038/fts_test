Biogas production technology has led to the growth of a number of biogas appliances for lighting, cooking, heating, incubating and electricity generation. The most commonly used appliance for cooking purposes in both households and institutions is the biogas stove. However, some households are using biogas lamps for lighting their homes. The overall objective of this paper is to review biogas appliances being used in the different National Biogas Support Programmes in Sub-Saharan Africa.

l locally available biogas stoves were tested, but were found to have lower efficiencies than were acceptable. The stoves were not made according to basic gas stove theory.

estions are: What biogas appliances are being used? What are the major areas where appliances can be developed to improve their efficiencies? What are the possible methods/mechanisms to do so?

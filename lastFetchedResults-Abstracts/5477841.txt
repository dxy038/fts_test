Water environment monitoring system based on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consists of three parts: data monitoring nodes, date video base station and remote monitoring center. For the sake of realizing to monitor large range waters such as reservoir, wetland, lake, river and ocean etc, the monitoring system has the function of perception, acquisition, processing and transmission for video-information in key areas and various water environment parameters, such as water temperature, PH, turbidity, electric conductivity, dissolved oxygen and so on. As the gateway between those data monitoring nodes and CDMA network, the data video base station is communication center in the monitoring network. Based on ARM-DSP double processors architecture, the date video base station for water environment monitoring is studied and its software and hardware is designed in this paper. Moreover, by means of ZigBee and CDMA wireless transmission technology, the base station realizes data bidirectional communication between the sensor networks and the remote monitoring center. It well meets the need of remote real time water environment monitoring system and also has wide application prospect in industrial control, smart home, medical telemetry and intelligent traffic, etc.

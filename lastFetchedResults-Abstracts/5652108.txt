In a research project a charging station for operating electric vehicles from a grid connected photovoltaic system was developed. The vehicles in this project are mainly used for home to education transports. The objective is to charge the vehicles as much as possible from the photovoltaic system. To determine the sequence for charging the vehicles, three different scheduling methods, dump charging, time controlled charging and charging based on a weather forecast, are considered. To evaluate these methods, their uses on different types of days (clear sky, rainy and mixed day) were simulated. The results are showing that with both methods the time controlled charging and charging based on weather forecast similar performances can be achieved.

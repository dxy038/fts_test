The design-informatics approach has been proposed for next-generation innovative design methodology. The multi-objective problem should be treated in a real-world engineering problem because of the various design requirements. When a multi-objective optimization is implemented, the obtained result is not a sole solution but a set of optimum solutions due to tradeoff relations among design requirements. Therefore, decision-making process is necessary as a post-process for optimization result. In the present study, the design-informatics approach, which is considered as a sequential process between an optimization and its post-process operations, is suggested and is applied to the large-scale and real-world design problem. Consequently, a compromised solution can be efficiently decided from the non-dominated solutions obtained by multidisciplinary design optimization. This approach would be a new efficient procedure for design manner, and also it would be the methodology that innovative design knowledge can be acquired.

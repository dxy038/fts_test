What we mean with chemometrics is closely connected to what we want from it, our idealized view of chemistry, data, statistics, models, and what not. Personally, I have a fairly clear opinion of what I mean with, and what I want chemometrics to be. Of course, this view is based on my experience in academic and industrial chemistry, and I shall here try to explain these views, and the chemical and practical reasons (rationalizations) thereof. These views may seem somewhat provocative, but this is not the objective. I just want to make us reflect on what we, as chemometricians, are doing.

ws will be focussed on the role of chemometrics in chemistry, on how I see statistics as partly consistent, and partly inconsistent with the framework of chemistry, and where we should aim for the future (of chemometrics).

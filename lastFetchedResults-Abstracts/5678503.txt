Ad hoc networks are characterized with frequent link failures and network topology change. These features result in a great challenge to transmit video over ad hoc networks. We propose a novel content-based layered multiple description coding scheme C-LMDC for robust video transmission over ad hoc networks. First determine the region of interest (ROI) of the video image before actual coding. Then divide the video sequence into ROI group and regular group using dynamic flexible macro block ordering (FMO) technology. After that, carry out layered multiple description coding scheme and protect ROI slices by redundant slices technology. Finally transmit the bit-stream using multi-path transmission. The simulation results show that our method improves the objective and subjective quality of the reconstructed video sequence obviously and ensure a robust video transmission over ad hoc networks.

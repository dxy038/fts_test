This paper suggests a method for finding efficient hyperplanes with variable returns to scale the technology in data envelopment analysis (DEA) by using the multiple objective linear programming (MOLP) structure. By presenting an MOLP problem for finding the gradient of efficient hyperplanes, We characterize the efficient faces. Thus, without finding the extreme efficient points of the MOLP problem and only by identifying the efficient faces of the MOLP problem, we characterize the efficient hyperplanes which make up the DEA efficient frontier. Finally, we provide an algorithm for finding the efficient supporting hyperplanes and efficient defining hyperplanes, which uses only one linear programming problem.

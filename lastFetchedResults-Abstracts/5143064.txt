The objective of the general packet radio service (GPRS) network simulation is to obtain accurate enough implementation of GPRS network in Network Simulation 2 (NS-2), so that IP optimization features can be tested. In this paper, we try to afford such a model The simulation model concentrates on the Um Interface, Gb Interface, Gn Interface and Gi Interface respectively. Each part is represented as node, agent, queue or link in NS-2. At last, a simple analysis of one scenario is given to demonstrate how to use this model.

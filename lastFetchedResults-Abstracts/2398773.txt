Abstract
Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been shown to cause a reduction in health-related quality of life (HRQOL). However, the relative degree of impairment in each domain differed among samples, and it was not clear which aspect of disease-specific HRQOL (modified polycystic ovary syndrome health-related quality of life questionnaire) was most negatively affected.
Objective: To systematically review the effects of PCOS on specific domains of HRQOL.
Materials and Methods: Literature search using search engine of database (PubMed, PsychInfo, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and Scopus) between 1998 to December 2013 yields 6 relevant publications. Pairs of raters used structural tools to analyze these articles, through critical appraisal and data extraction. The scores of each domain of polycystic ovarian syndrome questionnaire (PCOSQ) or modified version (MPCOSQ) of 1140 women with PCOS were used in meta-analysis.
Results: The combine mean of emotional (4.40; 95% CI 3.77-5.04), infertility (4.13; 95% CI 3.81-4.45) and weight (3.88; 95% CI 2.33-5.42) dimensions were better, but menstruation (3.84; 95% CI 3.63-4.04) and hirsutism (3.81; 95% CI 3.26-4.35) domains were lower than the mean score of PCOSQ/MPCOSQ in related dimension.
Conclusion: The meta-analysis showed that the most affected domains in specific HRQOL were hirsutism and menstruation. Based on these findings, we recommend healthcare providers to be made aware that HRQOL impairment of PCOS is mainly caused by their hirsutism and menstruation, which requires appropriate management.

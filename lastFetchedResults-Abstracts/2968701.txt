We are developing a 4.5 kV, 1 kA, 5 kHz class static induction (SI) thyristor with the objective of realizing a high-performance power device with high blocking voltage and high-speed switching ability. With the progress in development of the device, we investigated a multi-functional power line compensator (PLC) for maintaining electric power quality. The PLC has functions to stabilize line voltage and compensate for harmonic current, reactive power and unbalanced current. With these functions it can suppress voltage flicker and other phenomena. We constructed a small-scale model having these functions and conducted experiments to confirm the control method for the PLC. We also carried out simulations of the compensation performed by the PLC, using EMTDC/PSCAD. In this paper, we describe a status of development of the device and the results of our experiments and simulations

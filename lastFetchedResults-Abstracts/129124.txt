Objective: The aim of this study was to compare culture with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the prevalence of M. hominis in endocrinal specimens from infertile women.
Materials and Methods: Duplicate endocervical swab samples were taken from 312 infertile women. DNA was extracted by the Cadieux method. The specific 16S rRNA genes were amplified to detect M. hominis by PCR, and culture was done with liquid-solid methods in H broth and H agar media.
Results: M. hominis was detected in 17.3% of the specimens by both culture and PCR methods. 5.1% of the samples were PCR positive as well as culture positive, 16% were positive only by PCR, and 6.41% were positive only by culture. The PCR had a sensitivity of 92%, while that of culture was 37%. There was an association between the presence of M. hominis and cervicitis. No difference was detected regarding the incidence of M. hominis relative to age and or other clinical symptoms or signs.
Conclusion: The results indicate that PCR is a sensitive, specific, easy, and rapid method for detection of M. hominis in genital samples.

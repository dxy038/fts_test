The possibility of using the leaves of Cordia verbenacea as a new source of natural antioxidant compounds was investigated. In the present work, extracts from C. verbenacea were obtained using different extraction methods: supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), Soxhlet (SE), hydrodistillation and maceration, with the objective to evaluate the methods in terms of yield and antioxidant potential. The high-pressure technique was applied using pure CO2 and CO2 with co-solvent at different temperatures and pressures (30, 40 and 50 °C and 100, 200, and 300 bar). Organic solvents with different polarities were used to obtain extracts by low-pressure extraction processes. The extracts were evaluated according to their antioxidant activity using total phenolic content, scavenging abilities on DPPH radical, total antioxidant activities (ABTS•+), superoxide anion radical-scavenging (O2•) and protection against lipid peroxidation in vitro (LPO). Ethyl acetate fraction obtained by maceration and extract isolated by SE using 25% aqueous mixture of ethanol possessed the highest scavenger activity against DPPH radical (IC50 = 9.2 ± 0.4 μg/ml, IC50 = 27.4 ± 0.1 μg/ml, respectively). The SFE with 8% ethanol as a co-solvent produced extracts with distinguished increase in the antioxidant activity. The Soxhlet extract with ethyl acetate exhibited a strong reduction of lipid peroxidation (IC50 = 209 ± 3 μg/ml) value comparable to the standard rutin (IC50 = 203 ± 2 μg/ml). The results indicate that extracts of C. verbenacea have important potential as a source of bioactive compounds with antioxidant activity.

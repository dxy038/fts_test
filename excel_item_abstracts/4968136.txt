The FERET evaluation compared recognition rates for different semi-automated and automated face recognition algorithms. We extend FERET by considering when differences in recognition rates are statistically distinguishable subject to changes in test imagery. Nearest Neighbor classifiers using principal component and linear discriminant subspaces are compared using different choices of distance metric. Probability distributions for algorithm recognition rates and pairwise differences in recognition rates are determined using a permutation methodology. The principal component subspace with Mahalanobis distance is the best combination; using L2 is second best. Choice of distance measure for the linear discriminant subspace matters little, and performance is always worse than the principal components classifier using either Mahalanobis or L1 distance. We make the source code for the algorithms, scoring procedures and Monte Carlo study available in the hopes others will extend this comparison to newer algorithms.

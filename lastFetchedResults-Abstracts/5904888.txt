This paper discusses the principles and practices of the 3P Approach (i.e. People-Process-Product) that has been developed from experiences in product design, innovation, invention and commercialization. The 3P Approach connects the phases in product design, development and commercialization process with the identification of people-centric and objective-driven design intent, via collaborative and iterative product design and development, to the desired optimized product outcome in the market place. In the paper, a case study on a product design, development, patenting and commercialization is discussed with respect to the key concepts and methods of the 3P Approach.

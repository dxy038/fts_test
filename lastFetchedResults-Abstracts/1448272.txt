Background and Objective: Dyslipidemia has become a common problem in human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, especially in patients on combination antiretroviral therapy.
In this study we aimed to determine the prevalence of dyslipidemia and metabolic abnormalities
in 2 groups of HIV infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and
antiretroviral-naive patients.
Patients and Methods: Forty HIV infected patients treated by HAART as a case group (6 females
and 34 males) with a mean age of 40.7 ± 10 years and 15 HIV naïve as a control group (2 females and
13 males) with a mean age of 38.40 ± 8.3 enrolled in this study. The two groups were well matched in
respect to age, sex and CD4 cell counts. A standardized questionnaire with epidemiological, clinical,
and therapeutic data was completed by physicians. Blood samples were obtained for metabolic
measurements. CD4 positive cell count was measured by f lowcytometry.
Results: Levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, lactate, and FBS were elevated in
24%, 37%, 3.7%, 44.4%, 29.6% and 11% of patients respectively. There was a significant difference
regarding mean total cholesterol and LDL between treated group and controls (p < 0.05). There
was also no significant difference between treated group and controls regarding triglyceride, HDL,
lactate and FBS levels.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that metabolic abnormalities are relatively common in
HIV-infected patients receiving HAART. Therefore, it is recommended to screen the HIV infected
patients on HAART for metabolic disorders, potential of morbidity, and possible long-term
cardiovascular risk factors.

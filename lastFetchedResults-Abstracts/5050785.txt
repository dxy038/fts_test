This paper describes the ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey performed on the archaeological site of Ciavieja, El Ejido (Spain). It is part of historical studies performed in Ciavieja in order to add information to previous studies and also to analyze the extent and importance of the remains buried in this site. The objective of the GPR survey was to locate the most promising areas within the archaeological site to help the architects and archaeologists with an optimal design for the park. The time slices built with the radar data show several locations with linear and square anomalies with sizes compatible with the ones of Roman walls or roman house rooms.

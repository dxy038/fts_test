This paper presents modelling and closed loop control of bidirectional buck boost cascade inverter, which produces an ac output voltage larger than the dc input voltage. The bidirectional inverter is seen as the cascade of a buck stage and a boost stage. The function of buck stage is to maintain main inductor current as a constant value and boost stage is a Current Source Inverter (CSI), which regulates the output voltage. A decoupled analog control scheme is used for inductor current control and output voltage control.

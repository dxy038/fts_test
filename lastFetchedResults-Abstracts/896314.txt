Objective (s): Postmenopausal women are at risk for developing cardiovascular disease because metabolic changes occur after menopause. This study was performed to compare the effects of two types of surgical and natural menopause on metabolic syndrome and its components 3 to 4 years before and after menopause.
Methods: This was a retrospective study. Of 5191 women of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS), 437 postmenopausal women aged 20-60 years were selected (373 natural menopause and 64 surgically menopause) and followed up for approximately 9 years. Data was collected using the TLGS questionnaires. 
Results: During the follow-up period, changes in metabolic and biochemical profiles were compared between surgically and natural menopause women. The incidences of metabolic syndrome in surgical menopause and natural menopause were 15.6 and 9.9% respectively at follow up period. The means systolic blood pressure and serum LDL levels in natural menopause were significantly higher than in surgically menopausal women. 
Conclusion: It seems the metabolic disorders associated with menopause differ in surgically and natural menopause women, with age being the most influential factor. Postmenopausal aging women should have regular check ups.

This multiwave longitudinal study investigated potential transactional and accumulating influences among corumination, interpersonal stressors, and
internalizing symptoms among a sample of early and middle adolescents (N ¼ 350; 6th–10th graders). Youth completed self-report measures of corumination
at Times 1, 2, and 4, and negative life events, internalizing symptoms (general depressive, specific anhedonic depressive, anxious arousal, general
internalizing), and externalizing problems at all four time points (5 weeks between each assessment across 4 months). Results supported hypotheses. First,
baseline corumination predicted prospective trajectories of all forms of internalizing symptoms but not externalizing problems. Second, baseline corumination
predicted generation of interpersonal-dependent, but not interpersonal-independent or noninterpersonal stressors. Third, interpersonal-dependent events
partially mediated the longitudinal association between baseline corumination and prospective internalizing symptoms. Fourth, a transactional, bidirectional
set of associations was supported in that initial internalizing symptoms and stressors predicted later elevations in corumination, and in turn, corumination
predicted later symptoms through the mediating role of interpersonal stressors to complete both streams in the transactional chain of influence. Fifth, girls and
older adolescents exhibited higher corumination, but neither age nor sex moderated any associations. These findings are discussed within a transactional,
developmental cascade model.

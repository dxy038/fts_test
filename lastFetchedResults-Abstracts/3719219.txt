The use of grounding transformers on three-phase ungrounded governmental, industrial, and commercial distribution systems is addressed. Ground-fault protection schemes that provide selective and reasonably fast tripping are often incorporated with these grounding transformers. The authors first review the state of the art of grounding transformers to assist electric power systems engineers in the proper understanding of the use and applications of these devices and then discuss two governmental system case studies illustrating improperly applied grounding transformers and/or associated ground-fault protection systems. In addition, they describe remedial actions taken to correct these deficiencies. The objective in presenting improper grounding transformer applications is to highlight protection concerns that are often ignored. It is stressed that a single grounding transformer is not adequate for use with a multibus configuration. A unique protection scheme for use on a multibus arrangement is presented

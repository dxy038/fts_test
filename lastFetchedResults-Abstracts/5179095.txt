The multiple resource-constrained project scheduling problem is a very important issue in construction engineering. Its solution can improve the productivity of construction industry greatly. We present a genetic algorithm for solution of multi-types resource usage problems in multiple resource constrained project scheduling. The objective is to determine the starting time of all activities in a project to meet precedence and resource constraints with lower resource usage. A nonlinear integer programming model has been established. The Monte Carlo method (MCM) is compared with genetic algorithms (GAs) in solutions. The numerical examples show that genetic algorithms can achieve better performance for resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) than MCM.

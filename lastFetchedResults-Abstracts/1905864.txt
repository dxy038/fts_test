Background: Vitamin D (Vit D) level may change variously in serums of patients undergoing anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) therapy using
antibiotics such as isoniazid and rifampin. Objectives: The current study aimed to evaluate all components of calcium (Ca) regulatory agents in the six-month period of standard
anti- TB therapy. Patients and Methods: Eight adults whose pulmonary TB had been diagnosed with positive sputum test were selected for the study. For
each patient Ca, phosphate (P), albumin (Alb), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Vit D (25 OH), parathormone (PTH) levels were checked before
and after drug therapy monthly, until treatment termination. Verbal informed consent was obtained from the patients and they were free
to leave the study at any time without any restrictions, and did not have to pay for the tests. Results: Vit D levels decreased significantly after three months (P  <  0.05). On the other hand, serum levels of Alb significantly increased,
probably due to improved appetite in all of the checking times (P = 0.001). Serum levels of PTH also increased, but not significantly. Conclusions: Considering the decreasing levels of Vit D during anti-TB therapy, it seems reasonable to monitor serum Ca, Vit D and PTH
levels in patients during the anti-TB therapy especially in patients that Vit D deficiency is more probable.

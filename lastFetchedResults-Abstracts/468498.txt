Objective and STUDY DESIGN: We report for the first time an inhibitory effect on cell division and germ tube formation by Candida albicans and strains of other Candida species by putrescine and cadaverine. Results: Both bacterial amines showed a dose-dependent inhibition of germ tube formation by C albicans, as well as budding (inhibition of cell division) of strains of other Candida species (ie, C glabrata, C krusei, and C tropicalis).Conclusions: We hypothesize that the presence of these and possibly other bacterial amines produced by anaerobes in the vaginal flora and seen in bacterial vaginosis, as in the healthy gut, may explain why candidosis is rarely seen in these instances.

The traditional teaching mode of mathematical courses is dependent on the blackboard with chalks, which is one-way transporting knowledge by teachers. With the rapid development of information technology and the changes of social demand, the teaching mode needs to be changed. Network Class is a good network teaching platform. Combining the characteristics of mathematical courses, we present a diverse teaching mode based on Network Class. In this paper we describe the establishing method of this teaching mode, and analyze the effect of this teaching mode using the course of numerical analysis as an example. At last we give a comprehensive and objective evaluation about this teaching mode.

The objective of this study was to determine the distribution pattern of lipids and fatty acids in different tissues of farmed Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii).

ences in lipid content were found amongst different portions of the fillet, being lowest in the dorsal/cranial portion (P1) and highest in the more ventral/caudal portion (P8) (P &lt; 0.05). The latter also recorded the highest amount of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and the lowest in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), arachidonic acid, 20:4n − 6 (ArA), docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6n − 3, (DHA) and the n3/n6 ratio. In general, lipid content in the different fillet portions was inversely correlated to PUFA and directly to MUFA. Contents of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and eicosapentaenoic acid, 20:5n − 3 (EPA) did not show any discernible trends in the different fillet portions, while significant differences in contents of DHA and ArA were observed. This study shows that lipid deposition in Murray cod varies markedly and that different fatty acids are deposited differently throughout the fillet.

The paper provides a new approach to support verification, validation, and accreditation (VV&amp;A) of models and simulations. The need for efficient and objective methods to verify, validate and accredit models and simulations is greater than ever. More and more decisions are based on computer generated data that are derived from models and simulations. The strength of these decisions is a direct function of the validity of this data. Based on the system identification of reduced order models, this new approach approximates a complex high-dimensional model or simulation by a relatively simple mathematical model valid over a specified domain and range of interest. Verification or validation is then accomplished by the straightforward comparison of the reduced order model structure and coefficients with the baseline data or system. Well-developed identification methods and a structured procedure make this process more efficient and objective than existing methods

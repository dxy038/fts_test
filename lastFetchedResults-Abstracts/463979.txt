Objective: This study was undertaken to compare the effectiveness of fixation of the vaginal apex to the coccygeus fascia with fixation to the sacrospinous ligament during surgical repair of vaginal vault eversion with enetrocele.
Study design: The records of 121 patients with postheysterectomy vaginal vault eversion with enterocele treated by the author between 1983 and 1994 were reviewed. Preoperative and postoperative symptoms and findings on pelvic examination and postoperative recovery were compared in patients undergoing sacrospinous ligament suspensino and coccygeus fascial suspension. Statistical analysis was performed with Ï‡2 analysis and Kaplan-Meier life tables.
Results: Eighty-one patients underwent fixation to the coccygeus fascia and 30 underwent sacrospinous ligament suspension. The two groups are similar for clinical history, symptoms, and findings on pelvic examination. Ten patients, underwent an abdominal sacral colpopexy for specific indications and are not comparable. The incidence of postoperative complications and length of hospital stay were similar for the two vaginal procedures. Patients with coccygeus fascial suspension have a projected 96% cure rate at 2 years compared with an 80% cure rate for patients with a sacrospinous ligament suspension.
Consclusion: Bilateral vaginal vault suspension to the coccygeus fascia is a safe, simple, and effective technique in the management of vaginal vault eversion with eneterocele.

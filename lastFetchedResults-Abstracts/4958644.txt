An attempt of employing network resources to solve a complex and time-consuming data mining problem is presented. The CLARANS is selected as the study objective. An improved CLARANS algorithm is first developed, in which the more inherent concurrency is explored. Then its parallel implementation by using PVM mechanism and the running performance analysis are provided. The analysis results show the expected speed-up is obtained and demonstrate that some parallel data mining algorithm is more effective in a distributed network.

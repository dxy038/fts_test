Objective
This study was undertaken to determine whetehr the arcus tendineus fascia pelvis (ATFP) can be accurately identified from the paravaginal space (PVS) without entering the retropubic space (RPS).
Study design
Eight patients undergoing vaginal paravaginal repair were enrolled. The paravaginal dissection was completed to the most cephalad portion of the PVS without entering the RPS. The apex of each PVS was stained with methylene blue. The RPS was entered, the ATFP visualized, and 4 sutures were placed along its length to be used for the repair. The perpendicular distance between each suture and the most cephalad area of stain was measured.
Results
The mean distance from the perceived to actual ATFP at each suture point (1-4) was 3.5 cm, 2.75 cm, 2.0 cm, and 0.91 cm, respectively.
Conclusion
In these 8 cases, the RPS had to be entered to accurately identify the ATFP. The degree of error increases as the ischial spine is approached (P< .001).

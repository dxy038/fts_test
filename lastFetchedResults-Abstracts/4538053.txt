Information systems are developing swiftly. That is why requirements to the quality and terms of communication facilities design are increased. Nowadays communication systems are designed using CAD software [1-3]. Previously at the stages of schematic, engineering and technological design high processing speed and PC memory were used. Now the actual problem is the automation of initial design phase. It is the phase of systems engineering, which is determined by system design for the specified application area. At the same time it became necessary to introduce new technologies for systems engineering. The foundations are the theory of multi-objective optimization and probabilistic modelling of communication systems. These technologies combine two main directions. The first direction comprehends development and realization of the methods for multi-objective optimization of communication systems in order to select optimum designed system versions by vector optimality criterion. The second direction comprehends the development of probabilistic mathematical communication models and appropriate software for communication systems simulation. As a result, we have problem-oriented program complexes for computer-aided communication systems engineering. It is also important to provide methodical and technical training for the specialists in the field of automation of communication systems design. It is very important and relevant to organize remote electronic education courses.

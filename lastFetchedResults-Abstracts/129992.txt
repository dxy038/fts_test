Forty patients with hyperemesis gravidarum were compared with 40 normal pregnant females matched with case group for age, gestation time, parity and weight. Blood samples were taken and detection of IgG antibody against Helicobacter pylori was performed using ELISA technique. The data were analyzed by the chi-square and t-tests.
Findings: IgG antibody against Helicobacter pylori was positive in 85% of case group and 52. %of control group showing a significant difference statistically (P=0.002), The mean and standard deviation values for antibody in case and control groups were (42.66+38.13) IU/ml and (21.70+ 22.34) IU/ml, respectively. A significant difference was found between two groups (P=0.0026).

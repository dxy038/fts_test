The main objective followed in this study was to assess the rate of adoption of sustainable agricultural practices among extension volunteers in Qazvin Province. The study was a descriptive - correlational survey one. The population of the study was comprised of wheat farmers in province of Qazvin who acted as agricultural extension volunteers (N=365). From among these members, 185 were selected as sample of the study. Simple random sampling technique was employed to do the sampling. A questionnaire was designed for gathering the needed data. Content validity of the questionnaire was verified by a panel of experts in the fields of sustainable agriculture and agricultural extension affairs. A Cronbach's Alfa reliability coefficient of 0.78 was obtained for the dependent variable of the study. A pilot test was conducted on a similar population from a different province to gather data for verification of the questionnaire reliability. Adoption behavior of the respondents was designated as the dependent variable of the study. The results indicated that a majority of the respondents were of either "favorable" or "excellent" adoption behavior. Muti-variant regression analysis indicated that about 68% of variability in the dependent variable could be explained by respondents' education level, and as well, by the extent of their irrigated wheat farming land.

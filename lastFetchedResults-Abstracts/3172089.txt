A coupling model of flexible missile containing rigid motion and elastic vibration is derived in the pitch channel in this paper. The coming target tracking values and on-line sensor measurement values form the inputs of the controller, the first two elastic modes, together with attitude tracking error and controlled quantity, are imported into objective function, and then this two-degree-of-freedom controller synthesis problem is translated into a standard discrete H<sub>&#8734;</sub> optimization frame. The simulation results show the substantial improvement of the two-degree-of-freedom H<sub>&#8734;</sub> preview control designÂ´s performances both in rigid attitude angle tracking and vibration attenuation, compared with H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control.

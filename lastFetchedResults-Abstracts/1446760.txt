The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of two diets containing either Brussels sprouts or inulin/rape seed cake, compared with a standard diet (control) for slaughter pigs on flavour and odour attributes and sensory profile of cooked pork. Three weeks prior to slaughter 24 female pigs were allocated to three diets: (1) a standard grower-finishing diet (control) for slaughter pigs containing barley, wheat and soy-bean meal, (2) the control diet containing 11 energy percent Brussels sprouts and (3) a diet containing 25% inulin and 55% rape seed cake. The odour and flavour of the cooked meat from inulin/rape seed cake-fed pigs differed significantly from the other two diets, showing reduced meat odour, increased pig and acrid odour, increased pig flavour, reduced fresh flavour and total impression. Meat from the Brussels sprouts-fed pigs deviated only slightly from the control-fed pigs.

Objective of our study was to estimate the metabolic syndrome (MSy)' components in type 2 diabetic subjects (T2D) with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD): arterial hypertension, waist circumference, triglyceridemia and plasma level of HDL, in order to define their clinical role in angina severity status. Second objective was to compare Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) and International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria in testing of association MSy with current coronary status of population. Three hundred and twenty seven pts with T2D and manifested CAD were randomly included in a survey. Angina severity was assessed with the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS). Data relieved MSy and its components, defined by ATP III, with predictive role for advanced angina stages. Presence of MSy is predictive for CCS3 angina severity (OR 9,93, 95%CI 0,78-126,28). Increased waist is a predictor for CCS3 (OR 1,22, 95%CI 0,27-5,46) and CCS4 symptoms onset (OR 1,55, 95%CI 0,36-6,73). CCS4 severity symptom is independently associated with arterial hypertension (OR 3,72, 95%CI 1,03-13,40) and hypertriglyceridemia (OR 1,72, 95%CI 0,42- 7,00). MSy components: increased waist, arterial hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia have been found predictive for angina CCS4 stage in T2D subjects, when IDF criteria were used. These findings raise the question of importance of metabolic syndrome and its individual constellations in T2D subjects with CAD. Results indicate that both criteria ATP III and IDF are reliable to define MSy in predictive model for coronary clinical status in T2D population.

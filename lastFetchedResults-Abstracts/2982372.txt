The article presents a pretopological approach for class proximity evaluation according to cluster boundaries. This is a generic method independent of the classifier used, resulting in a neighborhood structure between objects for each class. This proximity measure of classes also gives an objective quality measure of a given training set and an evaluation of class separability. The theoretical context of the method is presented, followed by an application featuring evaluation for printed character recognition and an example of prototype selection for an improved training set selection

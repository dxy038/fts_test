Background and Objectives The mu-Opioid receptor (MOR) exerts a critical role on effects of opiodis. The objective of this study is to find a peripheral bio-marker in addiction studies through quantization of the expression of two MOR splice variants mRNA (hMOR-1A and hMOR-1O) in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of long-term abstinent former opioids addicts. Methods In this case-control study case and control people were male and divided in two groups: people who gave up addiction to opioids (case) and healthy individuals without history of addiction (control). The mRNA expression in PBLs of participants was detected and measured by real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using SYBR Green Dye. Results The hMOR-1A mRNA expression in PBLs of abstinent group was significantly reduced and reached to 0.33 of the control group (p

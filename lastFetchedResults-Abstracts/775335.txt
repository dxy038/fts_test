By the newly emerging radio access technologies, we face the new
heterogeneous network environment. Focusing on the co-existence of multiple
access networks and the complex service combinations, the wireless service operators
should guarantee good quality of services for every user. Thus, the service
operators build a new operation framework which combines the existing networks
and newly adopted ones. Our objective is finding the optimal heterogeneous network
operation framework. We suggest the market-based marginal cost function for
evaluating the relative value of resources for each network and develop a whole new
heterogeneous network operation framework. To prove the applicability of the
proposed operation framework, we build a large-scale JAVA simulator. We can
easily test the various service scenarios in heterogeneous network environment by
the simulator

An unequal error protection approach for the reliable communication of visual information over additive white Gaussian noise channels is proposed and studied. This method relies on a bandwidth-efficient coded modulation scheme that employs selective channel coding and transmission energy allocation in conjunction with sequence maximum a posteriori soft-decision detection. Experimental results indicate that this scheme exhibits graceful performance degradation as the channel conditions deteriorate and provides substantial objective and subjective improvements over uncoded and equal-error protection systems. Coding gains of up to 4 dB in E<sub>b </sub>/N<sub>o</sub> are achieved

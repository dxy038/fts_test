A bidirectional metamaterial spacer composed by Spiral Resonators (SRs) and metal strips has been designed, simulated, fabricated, and tested to operate like an artificial magnetic conductor (AMC) reflector at 2.45 GHz. A prototype of the new metamaterial spacer has been used to decorrelate two closely spaced monopole antennas achieving a good isolation and matching over a wide frequency range. This design could be used to develop a more compact multi-antenna Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.llb/g) router.

An expert system is described which has been designed to provide a prototype system for the development and management of mechanical ventilator settings, by using the system more effectively to support human knowledge processing. The principal objective is to build and implement an expert system for a mechanically controlled ventilator used on patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), and to assist the clinician by adding a measurement interpretation and evaluation capability to the existing monitoring system

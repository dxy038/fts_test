The objective of the paper is twofold: (i) to present a new statistical model for predicting the transport and heat transfer of arbitrary-density particles suspended in turbulent flows and (ii) to examine the performance of this model in an isotropic velocity flow field without and with a mean temperature gradient as well as in a near-wall turbulent flow. The model presented is based on a kinetic equation for the probability density function (PDF) of velocity and temperature distributions and coves the entire range of the particle-to-fluid density ratio (from heavy particles in a gas to bubbles in a liquid).

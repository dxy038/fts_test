Objectives
The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of the second component of local virtual unipolar electrograms recorded at the ablation line during coronary sinus (CS) pacing after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) for typical atrial flutter (AFL).
Background

Radiofrequency ablation of the CTI can produce local double potentials at the ablation line. The second component of unipolar electrograms represents the approaching wavefront in the right atrium opposite the pacing site. We hypothesized that the morphologic characteristics of the second component of double potentials would be useful in detecting complete CTI block.
Methods

Radiofrequency ablation of the CTI was performed in 52 patients (males = 37, females = 15, 62 Â± 12 years) with typical AFL. The noncontact mapping system (Ensite 3000, Endocardial Solutions, St. Paul, Minnesota) was used to guide RFA. Virtual unipolar electrograms along the ablation line during CS pacing after RFA were analyzed. Complete or incomplete CTI block was confirmed by the activation sequence on the halo catheter and noncontact mapping.
Results

Three groups were classified after ablation. Group I (n = 37) had complete bidirectional CTI block. During CS pacing, the second component of unipolar electrograms showed an R or Rs pattern. Group II (n = 12) had incomplete CTI block. The second component of unipolar electrograms showed an rS pattern. Group III (n = 3) had complete CTI block with transcristal conduction. The second component of unipolar electrograms showed an rSR pattern.
Conclusions

A predominant R-wave pattern in the second component of unipolar double potentials at the ablation line indicates complete CTI block, even in the presence of transcristal conduction.

This paper is concerned with the design and simulation of a pulse width modulation (PWM) rectifier for three-phase Permanent Magnetic motor drive. Based on the mathematical model of PWM rectifier, the dual-close-loop engineering design with decoupled feed-forward control is applied in the 3-phase voltage source rectifier. The objective to be reached is to realize unity power factor at the input ac mains and regulate output voltage. The paper presents the MATLAB/SIMULINK simulation model. The results confirm the validity of the model and its control method.

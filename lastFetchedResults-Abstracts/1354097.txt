Two irradiation capsules have been designed for the target region of the high flux isotope reactor (HFIR). The objective is to provide dimensional change and physical property data for four candidate next generation nuclear plant (NGNP) graphites. The capsules will reach peak doses of ∼1.59 and ∼4.76 dpa, respectively, at temperatures of 900, 1200, and 1500 °C.

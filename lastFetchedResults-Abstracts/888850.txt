Methods: This is a correlationalstudy and samples were chosen by simple sampling. For this purpose, 125 eligible CHF patients who referred to hospitals in city of Maragheh, and 125 healthy people were selected simultaneously during a period of ten months. Data were collected using an integrated three part questionnaire including demographics, quality of  life, and social support completed by interview.

Results: Findings indicated that quality of life was undesirable in 49.6% and had significant difference with QOL of healthy people(P < 0.0001). In subsectors of quality of life, social dimension was desirable in 83.2% of patients and showed no significant difference with healthy people, while in physical dimension (63.2%) and psychological dimension (63.2%) in most of the patients were undesirable and in most of the healthy people were desirable. Social support in 51.2% of CHF patients were desirable, and there was a direct and significant relationship between these two variables (p < 0.03, r = 0.2).

Due to the limited availability of Phosphorus in soil especially calcareous soils, it is important to investigate strategies to increase ability of Phosphorus uptake by plant. Evaluating the effect of Zeolite (Clinoptilolite), irrigation levels and preferential flows, simultaneously and independently, on increasing Phosphorus uptake by corn was objective of this study. Potted study was done in completely randomize design with 3 replications. Factors include existence and nonexistence of Zeolite, existence and nonexistence of artificial thin plastic pieces as macro pores for facilitation of preferential flows and two levels of moisture allowable deficiency (40 and 50 percent). Also the effect of treatments on uptake of soil extractable Potassium by plant was investigated in this study. Plant Phosphorus concentration on treatments with and without Zeolite was measured 1593.3 and 1545.2 milligram per kilogram respectively. Also this amount on treatments of MAD40, MAD50, with and without artificially created macro pores was 1557.3, 1581.2, 1561.8 and 1576.6 mg/kg respectively. Results have demonstrated that treatments had not significant effects on increase of phosphorus uptake. Also the factors had not significant effect on increase of soil extractable Potassium uptake by plant. Among agronomic traits, weight of Bilal (Corn Crop) was increased in existence of Zeolite but others have not influenced significantly (P&lt;0.05).

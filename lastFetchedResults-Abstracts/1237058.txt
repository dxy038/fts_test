Management of watershed basins of the country as one of the most important ways by optimal use of water resources is considered. In this regard, it is believed that a simulation of hydrological phenomenon of basin seems to be the way is the optimal solution. In this research, SWAT model, for the simulation of the hydrological basin of Firoozabad in Fars Province were used. The first statistical runoff during 1994-2010 simulated by SWAT model. Then the results by using discharge measurement of at Dehrood station and method of SUFI-2 in SWAT-CUP software, sensitivity analysis, calibration, validation and uncertainty analysis were done. The years 1998-2006 model years of calibration and 2010-2007 for validation were used. Ability of the SWAT model to simulate runoff modeling by using parameters P-factor, d-factor, Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) factor, coefficient of determination (R2) and the objective function  was studied. The results showed that the SWAT model is a suitable simulation tool in discharge simulation of river.

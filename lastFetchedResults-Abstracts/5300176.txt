An extension of the iterated constrained endmembers (ICE) that incorporates sparsity promoting priors to find the correct number of endmembers and simultaneously select informative spectral bands is presented. In addition to solving for endmembers and endmember fractional maps, this algorithm attempts to autonomously determine the number of endmembers required for a particular scene. The number of endmembers is found by adding a sparsity-promoting term to ICEÂ´s objective function. Additionally, hyperspectral band selection is performed by incorporating weights associated with each hyperspectral band. A sparsity promoting term for the band weights is added to the objective function to perform band selection.

Efficacy of laboratory medicine in assisting attending physicians in their diagnostic and follow-up endeavors is intimately linked to an access to meaningful and reliable reference values. Pediatrics is particularly sensitive to this problem as the processes, associated with growth and development, are imposing rapid discontinuous changes on the physiology of the individuals. Some developmental stages are more critical than others. The neonatal and the pubertal periods, for which we lack reference ranges, are two such examples. Beyond biological considerations, we realize that, over the last 2 decades, technology has evolved, both at the analytical and reagent levels. This technological evolution inexorably leads to the need in redefining reference values. It is for this reason that a group of clinical and medical biochemists have joined their efforts in creating the Canadian Laboratory Initiative in Paediatric Reference (CALIPER) which objective is to define a pan-Canadian set of reference values from birth to late adolescence. To illustrate the need of such a venture, a brief gap analysis for biochemical variables related to the thyroid function, and the growth hormoneâ€“insulin-like growth factors axis follows.

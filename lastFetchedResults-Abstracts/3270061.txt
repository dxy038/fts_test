Image segmentation plays an important role in a pre-processing phase of images having as objective a partition of the image into components or regions of interest for a more detailed analysis of one or more of these regions. Image segmentation may also be used as a pre-processing phase for a better image de-noising or de-blurring that will be done in a separate image processing phase. In this article we study mostly theoretical concepts and some experimental results for evaluation of some image segmentation techniques and their role for a better analysis of image details.

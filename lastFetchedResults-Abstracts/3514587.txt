The paper reviews the current state of development of a CAD facility for the design and evaluation of industrial process control systems. The facility is generalised to support multiple control systems and to coordinate their operations. The individual control systems may involve compensation for interaction, disturbance and time delay. The design procedures use least-squares analysis for identification, dynamic programming for control system design and simulation for evaluation of performance. The facility permits a systematic approach for building sets of hierarchical controllers with the objective of supervising the operation of complex processes. Design studies relating to real plant data are presented.

The objective of this study was to compare the ability of three commercially available extenders to promote poststorage motility of stallion spermatozoa stored at 5°C with and without centrifugation to remove the seminal plasma. Diluents tested included skim milk glucose (SKMG), INRA 96, and VMD-Z. All diluents were tested with (-SP) and without (+SP) centrifugation to remove most of the seminal plasma. In experiment I, after 48 and 72 hours of storage, total (TM) and progressive (PM) motility values were higher (P ≤.05) for those aliquots subjected to the INRA 96-SP as compared with either SKMG treatment. After 72 hours of storage, PM of spermatozoa stored in VMD-Z-SP was superior to that of spermatozoa stored in SKMG regardless of the presence of seminal plasma (P ≤.05). In the second experiment, after 48 hours of storage, PM of spermatozoa subjected to the INRA 96-SP and VMD-Z-SP treatments were superior (P ≤.05) to those for all treatments that had been stored without removal of seminal plasma. Removal of the seminal plasma and resuspension of the sperm pellet with either INRA 96 or VMD-Z resulted in TM after 48 hours of storage that were similar to those obtained after 24 hours of storage.

Chunk-based resource allocation can effectively reduce the complexity of resource allocation in multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems by grouping a number of neighboring subcarriers into a chunk and being carried out chunk by chunk. To ensure the bit error rate (BER) constraint within a chunk, an adaptive BER-based chunk allocation scheme is proposed and analyzed in this paper with the objective of maximizing the average throughput under a limited total transmit power. Numerical results illustrate that under the same power constraint, the average throughput of the adaptive chunk allocation is very close to that of the subcarrier-based allocation in the multiuser OFDM system.

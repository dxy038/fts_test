An erosion prediction method with the objective of determining wear profiles on various geometries due to slurry erosion, based on material wear data acquired from a minimum set of carefully selected laboratory tests and CFD (computational fluid dynamic) simulations has been developed. Data from a single standard laboratory test [Jet Impingement Test on a flat specimen oriented at 90° to an impinging solid suspension (water and sand)] is characterised using CFD to acquire wear data for a range of erosion parameters as a function of position. This data is used to build a wear map for that specific material–abrasive (316L steel-AFS50/70 sand) combination. The accuracy of this method is assessed by predicting wear from further jet impingement tests at 90° but under different flow velocities to that used to build the map and subsequently assessing against experiments. A good correlation between predicted and measured wear was observed.

An assessment of two phenomenological wear models (which profess to capture wear characteristics as a function of material properties) and one wear model that captures the above wear map statistically through the use of appropriate fitting functions is made.

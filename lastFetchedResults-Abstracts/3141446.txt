The novel design of reconfigurable random interleavers is considered here. Our objective is not only to alleviate the effect of Rician block-fading channels but also to be able to efficiently reduce the complexity of the interleavers. Again, we insert the variable length of MPEG-4 packets into the adjustable interleavers and then pass through the rate 1/2 ring convolutional channel encoder. At the receiver the priori probability of the source image is applied at MAP decoding to enhance the quality of the received image. The simulation results illustrate the improvement in PSNR up to 12 dB.

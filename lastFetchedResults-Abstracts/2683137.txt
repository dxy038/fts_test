Besides employing the imperative mode, God has used a collection of declarative structures in the Qur’an to express His intention. The experts of principles of jurisprudence have not seriously talked about these structures and have more than anything paid attention to the meaning and designation of the imperative; but the experts of jurisprudence have in a more widespread and of course scattered way  
alluded to them and have talked about the designation of these structures to obligatoriness and preference (istiḥbāb) or emphasis on the obligatory ordinance obtained from other structures. Many of the verses of the Qur’an contain demanding structures based on phrases of wa‘ẓ (preach), farḍ (obligate), katb (decree), ḥaqq (prove), and waṣyy (entrust). Also, declaration of the occurrence of actions; declaration of actions pertaining to people’s undertaking; demanding actions in inquiry, condition, optative, and instigation moods; threat from God; praising the action or its actor; condemning the abandonment of an action are among other structures of intentionality of an action. In order to develop jurisprudential inference from the Qur’an, this writing has described and analyzed the structures suggesting obligatoriness and preference in the verses of ordinances based on the practical approach of the Imāmī jurists and has made the conclusion that the main objective has been instigating and encouraging the religiously accountable (mukallaf) to take action.

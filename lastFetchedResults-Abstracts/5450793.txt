The optimization of the quality costs is the important content of quality management. In this paper, we studied the relationship between the quality level and the quality costs, and we found that the traditional curve of quality costs only concerned about the relationship of the internal factors of quality costs, and neglected the external factors of the quality costs which decide the entire costs of quality. We had proposed a framework for addressing the optimal COQ (cost of quality) within the context of strategic coordination. And then we developed the quality costs model based on strategic coordination. We described an operation mechanism about how the strategic objective decides quality costs through intermediate variable`customer satisfactionÂ´. Besides we developed a new mathematics model of quality costs optimization, and adopted the PSO (particle swarm optimization) algorithm to get the solution. The example showed that the method is rational and effective.

This paper presents a statistical study for rubber seed clones classification. There are five types of clones from the same series of rubber seed being used as samples in this work which are the PB360, RRIM2009, RRIM2011, RRIM2016 and RRIM2025. The main objective is to identify significant features based on reflectance indices of both lateral and dorsal of the rubber seed surfaces from the application of ZEISS spectrometer instrument. The instrument measures the percentage of reflectance with respect to intensity of safe radiation light being reflected from the seed surface. Empirical analysis is done using SPSS software in order to identify discrimination between the clones. From the observed error plots and one-way ANOVA measurements, it is shown that reflectance indices of lateral surface can be used to recognize significantly the RRIM2009 from the other rubber seed clones.

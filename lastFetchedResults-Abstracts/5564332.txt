The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effect has been one of the most important factors in correcting the reflectance obtained from remotely sensed data, especially the data having wide swath, e.g. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. For the BRDF effect correction, it is one of the most effective approaches to estimate the reflectance at nadir based on the estimated BRDF. While the estimation of BRDF model parameter requires a set of several data, such data are not always available in fact. In the present research, temporal MODIS reflectance data were corrected to the reflectance at nadir by the following procedure. If sufficient data are available, parameters of kernel-driven BRDF model, a semi-empirical BRDF model, were estimated to calculate the reflectance at nadir. If not, BRDF model parameters were interpolated using the estimated parameters. In the present paper, the preliminary experimental results are reported.

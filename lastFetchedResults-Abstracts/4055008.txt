We consider the problem of simultaneous power and code-channel allocation for a secondary transmitter/receiver pair coexisting with a primary code-division multiple-access (CDMA) system. Our objective is to find the optimum transmitting power and code sequence of the secondary channel that maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the output of the maximum SINR linear receiver, while at the same time the SINR of all primary channels at the output of their max-SINR receiver is maintained above a certain threshold. This is a non-convex NP-hard optimization problem. We propose a novel feasible suboptimum solution using semidefinite programming. Simulation studies illustrate the theoretical developments.

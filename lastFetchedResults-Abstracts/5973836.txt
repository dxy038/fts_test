Summary form only given. The Management of Technology (MOT) field has emerged from its relative obscurity of the 1970s and 1980s to the mainstream of business management. The rapid emergence of powerful and innovative technologies in the manufacturing, computing, and telecommunications areas have made the strategic management of technological assets a crucial task in organizations. Several universities now offer graduate programs in the Management of Technology (MOT). These MOT programs have originated from different academic schools and hence, there is considerable diversity in terms of focus, key themes emphasized, courses taught, student backgrounds, etc. It is critical that we take frequent snapshots of the educational programs so that we build on each others strengths and identify common frameworks that unify the diversity of interests and themes and provide a sharper focus to graduate MOT education. The objective of this study is to provide a status report on graduate MOT education worldwide and to highlight the emerging trends in terms of program themes, technologies, and management issues addressed. An international survey of graduate MOT programs was conducted covering schools in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific regions. The survey was complemented by interviews with practitioners in various industries and countries to gain insights on critical technology management skills and knowledge. In this paper, we report the preliminary results of our study

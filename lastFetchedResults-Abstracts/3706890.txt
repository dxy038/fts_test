Efficient and deadlock-free routing is critical to the performance of networks-on-chip. The effectiveness of any adaptive routing algorithm strongly depends on the underlying selection strategy. A selection function is used to select the output channel where the packet will be forwarded on. In this paper we present a novel selection strategy that can be coupled with any adaptive routing algorithm. The proposed selection strategy is based on the concept of Neighbors-on-Path the aims of which is to exploit the situations of indecision occurring when the routing function returns several admissible output channels. The overall objective is to choose the channel that will allow the packet to be routed to its destination along a path that is as free as possible of congested nodes. Performance evaluation is carried out by using a flit-accurate simulator under traffic scenarios generated by both synthetic and real applications. Results obtained show how the proposed selection strategy applied to the Odd-Even routing algorithm yields an improvement in both average delay and saturation point up to 20% and 30% on average respectively, with a minimal overhead in terms of area occupation. In addition, a positive effect on total energy consumption is also observed under near-congestion packet injection rates.

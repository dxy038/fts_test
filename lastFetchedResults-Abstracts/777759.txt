Objective: Monitoring of influenza virus shedding and optimization of multiplicities of in-
fection (MOI) is important in the investigation of a virus one step growth cycle and for 
obtaining a high yield of virus in vaccine development and conventional basic diagnostic
methods. However, eluted infectious viruses may still be present immediately after virus
inoculation and when cells are washed following virus cultivation which may lead to a false
positive virus infectivity assay. 
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we investigated influenza virus progeny
production
in
Madin-Darby
canine
kidney
(MDCK)
cells
with
five
different
MOI
at
determined
time
points.
The
results
were
analyzed
by
end
point
titration
tests
and
immunofluorescence
assay.
Results: Higher titers of eluted virus were observed following a high MOI inoculation of
virus in cell culture. Most probably, this was the result of sialic acid residues from viral
hemagglutin in proteins that were cleaved by neuraminidase glycoproteins on the surface

of the influenza virus, which promoted viral spread from the host cell to the culture
supernatant or during endocytosis, where viruses recycle to the cell surface by recycling
endosomes which culminated in virus shedding without replication.
Conclusion: We demonstrated that the pattern of influenza virus progeny production was
dose-dependent and not uniform. This production was influenced by several factors, particularly

MOI. Understanding the exact features of viral particle propagation has a major
impact in producing high virus yields in the development of vaccines. Use of lower MOI
(0.01) could result in accurate, precise quantitative assays in virus diagnosis and titration
methods.

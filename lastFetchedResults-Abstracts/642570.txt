Objective
Iron and vitamin A deficiencies are among the most prevalent nutritional problems. There are no data on iron bioavailability in Iran. In addition, interaction of vitamin A with iron bioavailability is not well documented, so we determined iron bioavailability from the most widely consumed food in Iran, lavash bread, and the effect of vitamin A on this bioavailability.
Methods

In vivo human studies for determining iron bioavailability are cumbersome, time consuming, and costly to perform, so we used an in vitro model in Caco-2 cells. Bread samples were digested with or without vitamin A (10 μg/1.0 g of dried bread). We used an iron solution containing vitamin C as a positive control. Iron absorption was measured using 59FeCl3. Bioavailability was defined as the percentage of radiolabeled iron taken up and transferred by Caco-2 cells after 1.5 h of incubation. Experiments were carried out two to four times.
Results

Mean ± standard deviations for iron bioavailability in bread samples digested without or with additional vitamin A and in controls were 2.53 ± 1.55%, 6.62 ± 3.40%, and 20.80 ± 2.30%, respectively (P < 0.001). Vitamin A caused a 2.62-fold increase in iron absorption from bread samples.
Conclusions

Iranian lavash bread has low iron bioavailability, but this can be increased by vitamin A supplementation. Increasing vitamin A intake can be considered as a method for increasing iron bioavailability, thus combating iron and vitamin A deficiencies simultaneously.

The objective of the work describes the observation and construction of a low cost temperature monitor with controller for laboratory uses. In a reaction monitoring lab, a temperature controller monitors and maintains the temperature in a closed loop. In this paper a low cost embedded temperature monitor with controller is built using AVR ATmega8 microcontroller. A thermistor, a thermocouple and an LM35 transistor are the temperature sensors used in the model. The model uses three different sensor types for the absolute comparisons of their sensitivity, range, error and durability. The variations in these attributes are also discussed. The model is electronic; its sensitivity is found to be high with less error probability.

The use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to solve problems with multiple objectives (known as multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs)) has attracted much attention recently. Population based approaches, such as EAs, offer a means to find a group of Pareto-optimal solutions in a single run. However, most studies are undertaken on unconstrained MOPs. Recently, we developed the co-evolutionary algorithms for unconstrained MOPs. The objective of this paper is to introduce a modification to co-evolutionary algorithms for handling constraints. The solutions, provided by the proposed algorithm for one test problem, are promising when compared with an existing well-known algorithm.

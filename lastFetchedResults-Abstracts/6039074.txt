Amplification of gastric electrical signals (GEA) deserves another look when efforts are made to convert electrogastrography into an objective clinical tool. The aim of this work was to underline the requirements for proper amplification of GEA signals. The suggested computer-controlled GEA amplifier is galvanically isolated and has flexible frequency and gain ranges. Special measures were taken to provide high common-mode rejection ratio and input impedance. The amplifier was subjected to several tests using simulation software prior to implementation and conventional testing methods after that

Mobile government systems have become a very important channel of government services delivery to citizens, business, and other governmental organizations. However, the Quality in Use (QiU) of mobile systems is one of the challenges that face the usage of these systems to the maximum potential. This paper proposes a set of attributes for determining the QiU of mobile government systems. It presents Usability, user Acceptance to mobile systems, and User experience with the system as the attributes that determine the QiU of these systems. The attributes were validated based on the objective and subjective measures of the attributes. The data was collected from 75 subjects participated in experiments by performing 4 representative tasks on a high fidelity prototype for a Mobile-based Civil Registry System. The results of the analyzed data showed that Usability of the MCRS is related significantly to the Acceptance to use the system. The results also showed that User experience with the system was affected by the Usability and the Acceptance attributes. The results of the study clearly point out the important roles of QiU of mobile information systems and that designers of such systems need to focus the Usability, user Acceptance and User experience with the system in order to improve the QiU of mobile system.

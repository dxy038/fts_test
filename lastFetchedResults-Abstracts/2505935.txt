<p><strong>Background and Objectives: </strong>ESAT-6 (6-kDaearly secretory antigenic target) and CFP-10 (10-kDa culture filtrate protein) have been described as dominant antigens recognized by T-cells and considered as virulence factors in <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>. The aim of this study was to clone, express and purify recombinant ESAT-6 andCFP-10 proteins of <em>M. tuberculosis </em>in soluble form.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods: </strong>ESAT-6 andCFP-10 genes were amplified by PCR, cloned into pET32a (+) vector, and overexpress- ed using isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside in <em>E. coli </em>BL21 (DE3). ESAT-6 andCFP-10 proteins were purified by Ni- NTA affinity chromatography and were detected by anti- ESAT-6 and anti -CFP10 antibodies.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>ESAT-6 andCFP-10 genes were successfully expressed and purified. Anti- ESAT-6 and anti-CFP-10 antibodies were produced after induction of immunization against purified ESAT-6 andCFP-10 proteins in rabbit.<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>In this study, we cloned, expressed and purified sufficient amounts of ESAT-6 andCFP-10 and it would be tested for the development of diagnostic kit for <em>M. tuberculosis </em>in future.</p>

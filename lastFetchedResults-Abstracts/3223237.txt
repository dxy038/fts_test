In this paper, a type of high power DC-DC converter based on IGBT switches is proposed. Basically, the converter consists of two bidirectional IGBT bridges linked by a pair of energy storage capacitors. It is capable of MW power transfer and can achieve very high voltage ratios. Moreover, the converter can alleviate the overvoltage and overcurrent problems when a DC fault happens on either side. Both the theoretical analysis and control strategy are discussed. Besides, comparisons between the two types of high power DC-DC converters, which is IGBT based and thyristor based respectively, are made through comprehensive simulations.

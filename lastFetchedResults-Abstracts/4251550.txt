Describes the metamodelling approach towards evaluating the fit of object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) methodologies to object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. Metamodelling has been applied successfully to evaluate and integrate OOAD methodologies. In this paper, the use of metamodelling is extended to describe OOP languages. This paper describes an approach to use OOAD and OOP metamodels to analyse the fit of OOAD methods to OOP languages. The approach is illustrated by evaluating the fit of Booch OOAD on Smalltalk, Eiffel and C++. It is concluded that using metamodelling an objective assessment of the match of an OOAD methodology to an OOP language can be made

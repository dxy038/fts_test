As the scale of complex system is growing larger and larger, a small interference from internal and outer system can disturb the subsystem. Urban village reform system is an automatic, non-linear, complex system. In this paper, we evaluating the urban village reform system based on catastrophe progression method. Dividing complicated target into small events, then recursion operation is found with the unitary formula and the assessed value is obtained. The problem of complex systemÂ´s evaluation is resolved. In contrast the actual situation shows that the catastrophe progression method is objective and effect. The new idea is provided for assessing urban village reform system.

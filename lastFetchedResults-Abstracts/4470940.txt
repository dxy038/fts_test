The main objective of the next generation network (NGN) is enabling the provisioning of multimedia services over fixed and mobile networks with quality of service and mobile support, whereas the NGN framework leverages the IP Multimedia Subsystem an overlay control, which is standardized by 3 GPP. The NGN framework will enable new innovative multimedia services covering telephony and interactive multimedia services. Currently the ITU-T is working on standardizing an IPTV functional architecture for supporting TV services over NGN. This paper follows the IMS-based IPTV approach and proposes a converged end-to-end solution that enables the cross-fertilization of IMS services and IPTV services. Furthermore, the paper presents the Fraunhofer Institute FOKUS media interoperability lab (MIL), which is represented as a reference implementation of such framework as an open environment gathering all major IMS core and IPTV components as prototyping. Finally the paper presents the end-to-end signaling delay of an IPTV session setup and the performance measurement results of several IPTV application servers.

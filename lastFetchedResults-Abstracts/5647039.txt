The objective of this paper is to model and simulate a three-phase Voltage Source Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Rectifier Based on Direct Current Control feeding an indirect vector controlled Induction Motor Drive (VCIM) and 3-Level SVM based PMSM Drive. Based on the mathematical model of PWM rectifier, the dual close loop engineering design with decoupled feed-forward control is applied in the three phase voltage source rectifier. The first objective is to realize unity power factor at the input ac mains and regulate output voltage. The second one is to realize that the above designed PWM rectifier will always give its objectives of stiff dc voltage and unity power factor irrespective of the load and its controlling methods. The types of loads, considered in this paper are to check the performance of the PWM rectifier with direct current control are resistive, VCIM and 3-Level SVM based PMSM Drive. The induction motor is taken with indirect vector control and PMSM is taken with 3-Level SVM based vector control so as to reflect the most practical aspect of the load for checking the viability of the rectifier design. The operation of Induction machine and PMSM is not disturbed the PWM rectifier objectives and operation of PWM rectifier is not interfered in to the independent operation of the vector controlled machine. Hence, the designed PWM rectifier is considered as capable of feeding the Common DC coupling point (dc bus).

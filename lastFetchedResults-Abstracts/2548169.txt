Cashmere is only produced from Maraz (Kurdi) goat breed in Iraqi Kurdistan Region. The objective of this study was to assess the genetic diversity of different Maraz color types, black goat and Shami breeds using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Fourteen primers were used and nine out of them were selected based on their number of bands (NB) and polymorphic characteristics. These primers generated a total of 154 bands ranged from 100 to 2800 bp. Out of the total bands detected only 50 bands were found to be polymorphic. Thirteen unique bands were found in Maraz goat, whereas the highest unique band was obtained in primer 7-MO2 locus. The overall Neiâ€™s gene diversity (gene diversity/heterozygosity) averaged 0.40, while the Shannon diversity index value was 0.58 ranged from 0.45 to 0.69. Phylogenetic dendrograms showed that three clusters, the 1^st cluster branch consisted of the black goat breed, the 2^nd cluster includes Shami goat with both black and light brown Maraz goat. The 3^rd cluster includes both white and dark brown Maraz goats. Maraz color types grouped in one cluster that contains white and dark brown types and the black with light brown types were included in another cluster. It was concluded that the Maraz goat breed was closer to Shami goat than to the black goat breed.

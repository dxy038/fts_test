This paper presents a brief introduction to multi-objective genetic algorithms and FPGAs[5][9]. In this paper we have discussed that how test pattern generation method can be formulated in terms of CNF form [2]and this CNF form can be used to generate test patterns using genetic algorithm. We have proposed that by applying a multi-objective genetic algorithm on this CNF form we can increase number of instances to satisfy boolean equation.

The lifetime of a wireless sensor network (WSN) is generally limited by the battery lifetime of the sensor nodes. In this respect, efficient monitoring of the entire networkÂ´s available energy is of great importance to take appropriate preventive actions. However, the physical limitations of WSNs, such as limited memory and energy resources, mandate such a monitoring mechanism to have low complexity and minimum energy dissipation. In this paper, a forecasting-based monitoring and tomography (FMT) framework is presented for WSNs. The objective of the FMT framework is to achieve overall monitoring and to capture the tomography of the available energy in WSNs with minimum energy expenditure. To reduce the amount of energy consumed for monitoring purposes, the FMT framework incorporates available energy forecasting and network aggregation mechanisms. Comparative performance evaluations show that the FMT framework achieves accurate energy monitoring and obtains the network energy tomography of large scale WSNs with minimum energy consumption.

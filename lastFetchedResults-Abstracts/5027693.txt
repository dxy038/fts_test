The objective of this study was to design a calibration phantom for a surgical navigator used in a hospital environment. It addresses two major issues: the design of an accuracy phantom and the accuracy analysis of the surgical navigator in a hospital setting. The designed phantom was used to assess the accuracy of the optical tracking modality of the surgical navigator used at Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland. The phantom functioned according to the design criteria, it was easy to use and it had enough calibration points that were localized by the navigator according to the accuracy assessment protocol to assess the accuracy error. The distances measured from a fixed origin with the surgical navigator were compared to the known phantom calibration point coordinates. The mean error was within the manufacturer specifications of 1.00 mm. The analysis done using the designed phantom and accuracy assessment protocol showed that the error increased with the distance from the center of the phantom. The accuracy assessment protocol using the present phantom proved to be a suitable method for accuracy analysis of a surgical navigator in a hospital setting.

Introduction & Objective: The mental foramen is a part of lower jaw which has neurovascular bundles and also is important in biology. 3D imaging of this area by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) before surgery can prevent some problems. This study aims to evaluate the anatomic position and geometrical shape of the mental foramen by CBCT images
Materials & Methods: In this research, the CBCT images (by NewTom and Planmeca promax 3D set) of 85 patients referred to dentistry school clinic or other clinics in Hamadan city were studied. These patients did not have their first and second premolar teeth extracted in both right and left sides. The geometrical shape of mental foramen, the canal angle connecting to mental foramen compared to the buccal plate of lower jaw, distance from the lower border of mental foramen to the lower border of lower jaw, position of mental foramen relating to the root of adjacent tooth and the incidence of accessory mental foramen were studied.
Results: The means of canal angle connecting to mental foramen in the right side in men and women were 123.3 and 130.1 and in the left side were 123.8 and 133.7, respectively. The mean distance from the lower border of mental foramen to the lower border of lower jaw in the right side in men and women were: 12.4 and 13.3 mm and in the left side were: 12.7 and 13.6 mm, respectively. Also, there is a meaningful statistical relation between gender and the angle of canal of mental foramen, regarding to the buccal plate in both sides.
Conclusion: Regarding to the variations in the position and shape of mental foramen and the angle connecting to the mental foramen related to the buccal plate and accessory mental foramen, investigation of CBCT images before placement of implants is necessary.

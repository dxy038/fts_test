ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Obtaining information regarding pathogenesis and prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing genes seems to be necessary, since it can promote prevention modalities and treatment of the infections caused by bacterias such as Klebsiella. The aim of this study was early identification of the blaTEM gene in Klebsiella, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, conducted form April to September 2013, 70 Klebsiella isolates were extracted from clinical samples (i.e., wound, urine, sputum and blood) using biochemical tests, including non-state fermentation and triple sugar iron, negative indole, motile and methyl red, as well as positive Vogesâ€“Proskauer and urease tests. Subsequently, the frequency of ESBL producing strains was determined by means of combined disk method. DNA was extracted by boiling and was investigated for the presence of TEM gene using the PCR approach.
FINDINGS: In the 70 Klebsiella isolates, 11 cases of ESBL phenotype were observed, of which 10 cases contained TEM beta-lactamase resistance gene. In addition, 9 out of 59 samples (26%) of negative ESBL in antibiogram, were determined positive in terms of blaTEM gene using PCR method.
CONCLUSION: Given the increasing prevalence of ESBL producing strains and poor diagnosis rate of antibiotic resistance through antibiogram method, applying more accurate techniques such as PCR is highly recommended.
KEY WORDS: BlaTEM Resistance Gene, Extended Spectrum Beta-lactamases, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Antibiogram.

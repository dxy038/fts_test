[Summary form only given]. There has been a growing interest in reversible integer-to-integer wavelet transforms for image coding applications. In this paper, a number of such transforms are compared on the basis of their objective and subjective lossy compression performance, lossless compression performance, and computational complexity. Of the transforms considered, several were found to perform particularly well, with the best choice for a given application depending on the relative importance of lossless compression performance, lossy compression performance, and computational complexity. Reversible integer-to-integer versions of numerous transforms are also compared to their conventional (i.e., nonreversible real-valued) counterparts for lossy compression. In many cases, the reversible integer-to-integer and conventional versions of a transform were found to yield results with comparable image quality

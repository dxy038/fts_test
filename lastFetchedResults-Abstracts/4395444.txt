The objective of this project is elimination of electrolytic capacitor in LED driver in order to enhance the operating time. In this paper, a novel circuit of LED driver is proposed using neutral point type buck-boost converter incorporating valley fill circuit, which can reduce the capacitance of smoothing capacitor. Thus, film capacitor can replace electrolytic capacitor as the smoothing capacitor. 80W prototype of LED driver has been built to confirm the validity of the proposal.

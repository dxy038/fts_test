We have measured concentrations of 26 serum amino acids in 46 subjects (aged 17â€“75 years), with the following neurological diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, n=7; peripheral neuropathy, n=5; muscular dystrophy, n=7; mitochondriopathy, n=3; metabolic myopathy (others), n=2; inflammatory myopathy, n=4; mononeuropathy, n=3; controls (patients with symptoms suggesting neuromuscular system dysfunction without objective evidence of neuromuscular disease), n=15, before and after prolonged muscular effort. Tests were done on a bicycle ergometer at the individual aerobic/anaerobic threshold determined for each subject in preliminary tests. Using a stepwise multiple linear regression model, age emerged as a significant negative predictor (P&lt;0.05) of the post/before ratio of the levels of five amino acids. We conclude that an increase in recovery time and a reduction in training capacity with aging could be linked to these changes. The cause is assumed to be principally a reduction in glycogen storage in muscle with increasing age; this situation could possibly be improved by consumption of carbohydrate before or during exercise, or also during rehabilitation exercise or training in neuromuscular or other diseases.

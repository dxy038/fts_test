Objective: To determine anthropometric profile and hematological characteristics of patients for elective cardiac surgery. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in Iran, during June- November 2006, on 252patients undergoing elective CABG and valve surgery (VS) and 131 normal subject age and sex matched without clinical evidence of any disease. Data about family background, personal information, anthropometric parameters, hematological and biochemical examination were obtained. Results: Weight, shoulder width, waist circumference, hip circumference, mid upper arm circumference ofpatients for CABG were similar to those of normal while fat fold at triceps and biceps were significantly higher. However, values obtained from VS patients were significantly lower (P<0.5). Mean BMI was highest (28.7±4.575 and 26.5 ± 4.04) for CABG and lowest for VS patients (22.6 ± 4.395 and 23.7 ± 4.114). Percent body fat, waist hip ratio (WHR), shoulder height (S/Ht) ratio, shoulder weight (S/Wt) ratio and waist height (W/Ht) ratio also exhibited similar trend. Mean arm muscle area was lower significantly in cardiac patients as compared to normal. Hematological parameters such as cell count; differential counts were within the normal range in both the groups. Biochemical profile was different wherein CABG patients exhibited hyperglycemia, hypercholeterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Conclusions: Obesity in population was rampant (including normal). WHR was found to be independent risk indicator for coronary artery diseases; other indices that may be indicative are S/Ht and S/Wt ratios. Lipid profile is an important marker since total cholesterol and triglyceride values were significantly higher in CABG than VS patients.

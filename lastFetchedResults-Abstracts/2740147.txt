The main objective of this paper is to present parametric studies and an improved hypothesis on the booster shed (BS) effects on the electrical performance of post station insulators in heavy icing conditions. It is fundamental to optimize the BS parameters (i.e. number, position, inclination angle, and diameter). Numerical simulations using the finite element method (FEM), implemented by Comsol Multiphysics&lt;;sup&gt;TM&lt;;sup&gt;, were carried out to calculate the influence of BS parameters and icing conditions on the potential distribution of the insulator. Simulation results of various BS configurations show that during the melting period, around 99% of the applied voltage is distributed along the air gaps. Moreover, based on the improved hypothesis, the major effect of BSs is the creation of air gaps and their minor effect is to increase the dry arcing distance. Also, among air gap length, dry arcing distance, and total ice-free leakage distance (IFLD&lt;;sub&gt;tot&lt;;/sub&gt;), IFLDtot is the best indicator to quantify the effect of BSs on standard post insulators.

A new tuning rule is proposed for PI controllers and first-order plants with time delay. The tuning presents a set of equations based on a multi-objective optimization with a closed-loop robustness criterion for both input and output disturbances rejection. The equations allow the control engineer to select the weight given to each response in order to cope with the compromise between input and output disturbance rejection optimality.

This paper describes the parameter optimization of fuzzy logic control (FLC) of FES-assisted indoor rowing exercise (FES-rowing) using multi objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). The indoor rowing exercise is introduced as a total body exercise for rehabilitation of function of lower extremities through the application of functional electrical stimulation (FES). FLC is used to control the knee and elbow trajectories for smooth rowing manoeuvre. MOGA is implemented in Matlab with a dynamic simulation model of indoor rowing exercise is developed using Visual Nastran (vN4D) software environment. MOGA is used to optimize the FES-rowing with two objective functions specified that are i) to minimize the mean squared error of knee angle trajectory and ii) to minimize the total electrical stimulation required by the muscles. In view of good results obtained, it is concluded that MOGA is able to obtain the optimal design of FLC for FES-rowing with two conflicting objectives.

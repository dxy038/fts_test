Early detection on any abnormality on the pipeline such as leakage is essential for efficient management. As to date, wireless sensors have been widely used to gather information in monitoring reliability of the pipeline. The commonly used sensors are temperature and pressure sensors. One of the issues that relate to pipeline monitoring is the reactive rather than proactive maintenance approach to leakage and abnormality. The objective of this research is to develop a method for early detection of corrosion, which the buried pipeline is exposed to changing temperatures and gas flow pressures. This will ensure that maintenance works can be done quickly to prevent pipe burst, as well as to minimize operational cost. The Norsk Sokkels Konkuranseposisjon (NORSOK) CO2 corrosion rate model is used as a basic reference model and the devices that will measure the value of pressure and temperature is wireless sensor. Simulation will be developed to see the performance of the model.

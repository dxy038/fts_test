This paper presents a new formulation of the regularized
image up-sampling problem that incorporates models of
the image acquisition and display processes. We give a new analytic
perspective that justifies the use of total-variation regularization
from a signal processing perspective, based on an analysis that
specifies the requirements of edge-directed filtering. This approach
leads to a new data fidelity term that has been coupled with a
total-variation regularizer to yield our objective function. This objective
function is minimized using a level-sets motion that is based
on the level-set method, with two types of motion that interact simultaneously.
A new choice of these motions leads to a stable solution
scheme that has a unique minimum. One aspect of the human
visual system, perceptual uniformity, is treated in accordance with
the linear nature of the data fidelity term. The method was implemented
and has been verified to provide improved results, yielding
crisp edges without introducing ringing or other artifacts.

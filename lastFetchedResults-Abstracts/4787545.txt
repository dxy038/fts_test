This paper presents a supermarket refrigeration system as a benchmark for development of new ideas and a comparison of methods for hybrid systemsÂ´ modeling and control. The benchmark features switch dynamics and discrete valued input making it a hybrid system, furthermore the outputs are subjected to a number of constrains. The objective is to develop an efficient and optimal control strategy.

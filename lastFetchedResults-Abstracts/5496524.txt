Driving through streets of an inner city such as a downtown area sometimes can be frustrating. One might have to wait for a traffic light to turn green at an intersection where there is no car on the cross street. Or, there may be a lot of cars on the cross street that must be cleared in order to make the traffic flowing. The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent traffic controller model to coordinate a network of traffic lights such that the flow of the traffic is maximized and the time of the traffic flow is minimized. We proposed to develop a model that implements multi-agents and fuzzy controllers on a network of computers. In the model, we created two types of agents, communication and computation agents for each traffic light at an intersection. In order to validate our model, we created a simulation test bed utilizing a cluster of computers where each node on the cluster represents traffic lights at an intersection. The simulation test bed also allows us to perform comparisons of our model to the other models.

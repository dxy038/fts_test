Objective
Identification of plasma markers indicative for atrial fibrillation-associated silent brain lesions.
Design and methods
1. Comparative determination of the plasma concentrations of secretagogin, S100B, neuropeptide Y, brain fatty acid binding protein, matrix metalloprotease 9, brain natriuretic peptide, and of D-Dimer in 222 patients with atrial fibrillation and 28 controls by immunoassays. 2. Correlation of the biochemical marker plasma concentration with the extent of silent white matter brain lesions, as determined by the Fazekas score and N-acetylaspartate-spectroscopy.
Results
1. Plasma concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide, of neuropeptide Y, and of matrix metalloprotease 9 were significantly higher (all with a p < 0.05) in patients suffering from atrial fibrillation than in control subjects. 2. Brain natriuretic peptide correlated significantly with the Fazekas score (R = 0.41; p < 0.005). 3. Brain natriuretic peptide plasma concentrations were significantly higher in patients with a pathological N-acetylaspartate magnetic resonance-spectrometry (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
Brain natriuretic peptide plasma concentrations correlate with the extent of atrial fibrillation-associated silent brain lesions.

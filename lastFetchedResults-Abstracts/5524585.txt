This paper proposes a strategy of urban bimodal traffic regulation based on multi-agent modelization. The objective of this strategy is to work on the duration of the traffic lights to regulate traffic for transport modes that include private and public transport vehicles, principally the bus. The model respects the method of bus regulation with a route agent, who supervises all the vehicles on the route while ensuring that they respect the regular time intervals between them. Bus priority is granted by reserving a green stage for buses as soon as they enter the route in question. This stage is prioritised for those buses running late, and whose priority does not lead to deterioration in the regularity of the time intervals between them and the preceding vehicle; an interval they must respect at bus stops. Regulation is obtained thanks to communication, collaboration and negotiation between the agents; the programming is developed under the JADE (Java Agent Development Framework) platform.

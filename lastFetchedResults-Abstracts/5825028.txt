Two integral components that accompany an FCG in an explosively driven system is the prime power source and the trigger set. The objective of the prime power source or seed source is to provide the initial seed current/energy into the primary stage of an FCG. Another integral component in an FCG based pulsed power system is the trigger set. The trigger set is used to detonate an exploding bridge wire (EBW) which triggers the high explosives (HEÂ´s) in an FCG. This paper will discuss a recent design of a stand-alone apparatus that implements a self-contained (battery powered with full charge time less than 40 sec), single-use Compact Seed Source (CSS) using solid state components for the switching scheme along with a single-use Compact Trigger Set (CTS) that also implements a similar switching technique. The CSS and CTS stand-alone apparatus developed is a system (0.005-m<sup>3</sup> volume and weighing 3.9 kg) capable of delivering over 360-J (~12 kA) into a 5.20-&#194;&#191;H FCG load and approximately 2-mJ (~600 A) into the EBW. Both the CSS and CTS have trigger energies of micro-Joules at the TTL triggering level.

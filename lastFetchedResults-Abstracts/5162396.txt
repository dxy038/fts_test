The current-voltage-fed bidirectional DC-DC converter can realize ZVS for the switches with the use of the phase-shift (PS) technology, however the current-fed switches suffer from high voltage spike and high circulating conduction losses. In order to solve these problems, a novel phase-shift plus PWM (PSP) control ZVS bi-directional DC-DC converter is proposed, which adopts active clamping branch and PWM technology. The novel converter can realize ZVS for all power switches from no load to full load. The operation principle is analyzed and verified by a 28V/270V conversion prototype rated at 1.5kW.

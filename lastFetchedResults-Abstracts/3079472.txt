The objective of this paper is to study the integration of IT certification goals into a course in Information Systems (IS). A popular IT certificate (CompTIA A+) goals are examined then mapped into the IT hardware and system software course. The A+ certificate objectives are studied from several view points, including lab requirement, faculty certification needs, certificate completion time, and certification exam requirements. IT hardware and software textbooks are also reviewed to select the best textbook that covers both course and certification objectives. Finally, a course syllabus is developed to combine course topics with certification objectives. The syllabus shows all course assessments and makes passing the certification exam a requirement for course completion. Integrating IT certification in computing curricula gives an edge to IS programs as students are looking to increase their skills and thus potential for employment

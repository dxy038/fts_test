Summary form only given. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of two hypervisors Xen and VMware´s Esxi when a Debian guest was running on them as a guest OS. Both products meet their design goals; Xen was mainly designed to host Paravirtualized guest operating systems with less support to fully virtualized guests and VMware´s Esxi was designed to host Fully Virtualized guest operating systems. It was the main reason to show poor performance by fully virtualized guests running on Xen. If we compare the two hypervisors regardless the support for Paravirtualization or Full virtualization, Xen is slightly ahead of Esxi. It exhibits near native performance most of the time.

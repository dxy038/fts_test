Spherical 316L stainless steel powder was deposited onto light alloys by Cold Gas Spray (CGS). The main objective was to obtain thick coatings and thus improve the wear resistance of the light alloy substrates while maintaining the high oxidation resistance that characterizes 316L stainless steel. To optimize the coatings, the pressure and temperature of the streaming gas were varied in an experimental design matrix. The physico-chemical properties and deposition efficiency of cold-sprayed 316L stainless steel coatings were studied. Deposition efficiency, porosity and wear resistance properties of the coatings were analyzed. The coatings achieved under the highest pressure and temperature+ were denser, thicker and with a higher wear resistance than those obtained under lower energy. The hardness and wear resistance of the light alloy substrate were improved over those obtained by conventional spraying techniques.

In this report, beta-tubulin gene polymorphism was investigated in Haemonchus contortus populations isolated from sheep flocks in different regions of Khouzestan province, southwestern Iran. The samples were chosen on the basis of regional variation in benzimidazole treatment background of sheep flocks. Our objective was to study the relationship between treatment background and beta-tubulin gene polymorphism of H. contortus isolated from the selected regions. H. contortus isolated from Shooshtar revealed reduction in beta-tubulin
gene polymorphism restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in respect to other isolates indicating that benzimidazole-resistant isolates of H. contortus developed in some sheep flock of Shooshtar region.

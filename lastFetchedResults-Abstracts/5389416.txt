We introduce the use of team algorithms using piecewise quadratic simultaneous Lyapunov functions for robust stability analysis and control design problems involving uncertain time-varying linear systems. The objective is to employ robust stability criteria that are less conservative than the well-known quadratic stability approach. The use of piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions leads to a non-convex optimization problem, which is solved by a team algorithm that is a combination of a genetic algorithm with an interior-point method for linear matrix inequalities. Numerical examples are given, showing the advantages of the proposed solution

Plate spacing is an important parameter in passive electromagnetic armor systems. Its value directly influences the effect of the passive electromagnetic armor on the metal jet. The parameter optimization is important for structural design for the passive electromagnetic armor system. The action time and the complete action time of current on the metal jet and the armor plate inductance are associated with armor plate spacing. To reduce the armor plate inductance, and prolong the action time and the complete action time, armor plate spacing is taken as the optimization variable for objective function. Through LINGO solution to the objective function and the verification of MATLAB, LINGO solution results are found in line with the trend of the objective function image. Through the analysis of the impact of different weights on the objective function and optimal plate spacing, the weight coefficients of complete action time and action time should be increased, and the weight coefficient of armor plate inductance should be decreased to make the object function to get a smaller value, c<sub>1</sub> &#8805; 0.5, 0.3 &#8804; c<sub>2</sub> &lt;; 0.4, and c<sub>3</sub> &lt;; 0.35. When the three weight coefficients are 0.5, 0.3, and 0.2, the optimal plate spacing is about 63 mm.

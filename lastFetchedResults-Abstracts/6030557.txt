The Web services technology is now widely used in support of interoperability between distributed and heterogeneous applications. With the evolution of Semantic Web services (SWs) within organizations and their uses in a large-scale, composition of services in a distributed setting has become a real challenge. A mechanism for automatic composition of SWs according to their functionality is necessary, since the features are the most important thing that partners seek. In this paper, we describe a distributed approach to automatic composition of SWs, which supports the complexity of both SWs and the task at hand. The approach is based on the notion of alignment of OWL-S, in order to achieve semantic interoperability in a heterogeneous, and distributed architecture, to ensure correct operation of Web services provided, and meet the needs and usersÂ´ preferences. The objective is to optimize the time of the completion of the automatic composition of SWs, and to overcome the problem of communication within and between SWs and network saturation.

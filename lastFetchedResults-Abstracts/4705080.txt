Assessment of vascularity of conjunctival has many diagnostic and prognostic applications, thus creation of computational methods for its fast and objective assessment is of importance. Here we provide two different methods for estimation of conjunctivaÂ´s vascularity from color digital images, with our best results showing a correlation coefficient of 0.89 between the predicted and ground truth values using a committee of artificial neural networks.

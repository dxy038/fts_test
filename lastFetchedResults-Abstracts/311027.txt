Objective.  To determine the maximal isometric strength of neck muscles across different anatomical positions in the body sagittal and coronal planes.

Design. A descriptive study involving maximal isometric strength measurements of the cervical musculature in extension, flexion, and left and right lateral bending. Before measurements, the new device was tested for reliability.

Background. The literature contains only a few studies on cervical musculature strength assessment. Of these, measurement methods have displayed weak reliability. No studies existed reporting neck strength at various positions in the body coronal plane.

Methods. A new device incorporating local population anthropometry was developed for neck strength assessment on an isokinetic dynamometer. The device's repeatability attributes at measuring the strength of functionally different groups of neck muscles were first evaluated. The isometric apparatus was next used to determine the maximal strength of the cervical musculature of 17 healthy volunteers at different anatomical positions across the body sagittal and coronal motion planes.

Results. The results showed good intratester repeatability for intraday and day-to-day studies for all measured parameters. Strength values demonstrated that extensor muscles yielded the greatest torque and that flexor muscles provided the least torque. Linear regression analyses showed strong association of isometric strength with anatomical positions in the two body planes.

Conclusions. Maximal isometric strength of neck muscles in four directions was quantified. Cervical musculature strength levels vary in discernible patterns with headâ€“neck positions and contraction directions.

Abstract
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of aerobic-resistance training on visceral adipose tissue, serum omentin-1 and insulin resistance in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. 
Methodology: Fifty Female Wistar rats (weight, 180Â±5g) were divided accidental and according body weight into five groups: SHAM (n=20)  and OVX (n=30) groups. OVX rats were subdivided into 2 Ovx+sedentary (Sedentary; n=20) groups and one aerobic-resistance training (Ovx+Exe; n=10) group. Two weeks after surgery, one group of OVX rats and one group of SHAM rats were sacrificed and omentin-1, insulin resistance and visceral fat were measured. The other OVX rats were randomly divided into the following subgroups: 1) OVX and sedentary (Sedentary); 2) OVX and Exercise (Ovx+Exe). The exercise consisted of 8 weeks of aerobic-resistance exercise (3 days/week, 20 m/min, 60 min/day, 10% slope, Load; 3% body weight, attached to tail), three days a week. After complete anesthesia, the abdominal cavity was rapidly opened and blood samples were collected. All intraabdominal fat were dissected out and weighed immediately. Omentin-1 was measured by rat omentin ELISA kit. HOMA-IR was used to estimate the insulin resistance.
Results: There was no significant differences between weights means all groups. After two weeks of surgery, there was no significant difference between visceral fat, omentin-1 and HOMA-IR in SHAM2 compared to OVX2. After eight weeks, combined aerobic-resistance training in Ovx+Exe significantly decreased visceral fat gain induced via ovariectomy by 21/4% compared to the level observed in Sedentary; whereas, visceral fat significantly increased by 92.5% in OVX2 compared to SHAM2 (p < 0.05). Omentin-1 increased in Ovx+Exe compared to Sedentary and SHAM, by56/5% and51/6%, respectively; whereas it was significantly decreased by3/1% in Sedentary compared to SHAM (p < 0.05). HOMA-IR induced via ovariectomy significantly decreased by74.7% in Ovx+Exe compared to Sedentary; whereas, it significantly increased by 193.7% in OVX2 compared to SHAM2 (p < 0/05). Also, HOMA-IR decreased in Ovx+Exe compared to SHAM2, but it was n ?t significant.
Conclusion: 8 week aerobic-resistance training successfully decreased visceral fat and insulin resistance via increasing omentin-1. So, it seems that 8-week aerobic-resistance training with 70-85% Vo2max is suitable for controlling body weight gain, decreasing visceral fat and insulin resistance and increasing omentin-1 in menopause period.

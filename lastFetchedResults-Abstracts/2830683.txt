It is not easy for fuzzy model to describe the uncertainty of language, because the fuzzy model is a conventional function. The membership function of type-2 fuzzy sets(T2 FS) combines a variety of possible type-1 membership, and the primary membership function reflects the impact of uncertain factors. Online reviews are perceptive informatics, and with the time varying, the evaluation criteria also changes. In the paper, some words are used to cover the universe of online comments semantic, which are interval type-2 fuzzy sets on time-varying universe, and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation and dynamic fuzzy rules are applied to analyze online review. Finally, the linguistic dynamic orbit of the online review is achieved. Show that type-2 fuzzy sets on time-varying universe and dynamic fuzzy rules are more in line with the objective rules that people use language to describe the development of objective and provided their evaluations.

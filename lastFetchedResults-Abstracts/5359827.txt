In this paper, through an computational approach, we study mean-variance efficiency and diversification contradiction that the high concentration in a few securities in portfolio selection implicates the incompatibility of efficiency and diversification which are two corner stones of modern finance. Typical treatments include imposing portfolio constraints. Unfortunately, the existing studies usually suffer from simplified models, small-scale computation, and crude representation of efficient frontiers which are the set of nondominated solutions in the terminology of multiple objective optimization. To make thing worse, inequality constraints of portfolio optimization such as upper bounds for portfolio weights knock out the possibility of closed-form type of optima, so computational methodology based on empirical data can be the only way to study the contradiction. We sample 13, 26, 52, 125, and 326 Chinese stocks from 2003-2005 and 2006-2008 periods, jointly construct portfolio constraints of upper bounds, market values, P/E ratios, turnover ratios, and industries, and utilize parametric quadratic programming to obtain precise and complete efficient frontiers of portfolio optimization. We find that upper bounds can be effective in alleviating the contradiction, while market values, P/E ratios, turnover ratios, and industries have much dampened influence when applied separately or joints (excluding upper bounds). The conclusion is supported by all the samples of both time periods. Our research can help both individual and institutional investors balance efficiency and diversification and consequently serve portfolio theory and finance industry of our motherland, especially in the turmoil world-wide financial crises. Moreover, our methodology is based on the latest computational extensions of portfolio optimization and can be deployed to stock markets worldwide to draw more comprehensive conclusions.

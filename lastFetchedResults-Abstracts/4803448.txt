The report considers the results of a microwave technology application to increase the body resistance of laboratory animals to infectious-disease causative agents (pathogenic strains E. coli, Clostridium perfringens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and lymphotrophic oncogenic herpes virus). It was revealed that the effect of a course of microwave radiation at non-thermal levels was to increase the survivability and average life span of treated animals compared with untreated ones.

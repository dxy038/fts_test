Background Structured diagnostic interviews
include items that evaluate physical etiologies
for mood and anxiety disorders. The objective of this
article was to assess the impact of such items. Method
A mental health survey in Canada collected data
from n = 36,984 household residents. The lifetime
prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders was calculated
with and without exclusions due to physical
causes. Results Approximately 10% of subjects with a
lifetime depressive disorder reported that all of their
episodes were due to one or more physical cause.
Many of the reported etiologies were implausible given
the DSM-IV requirement that the disturbance be
a ‘‘direct physiological consequence’’ of the physical
cause. The results were similar for manic episodes
and anxiety disorders. Conclusions Structured diagnostic
interviews assess physical etiologies in ways
that are subject to inconsistency and inaccuracy.
Physical etiology items may bias estimates by introducing
etiological opinions into the assessment of
disorder frequency.

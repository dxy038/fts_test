SOA has the advantages of both architecture and object oriented program development, and provides simple design principle. Through gradual steps, IT department can reserve and reuse the existing legacy codes. However, there is no objective methodology to evaluate the new SOA because it is planned by subjective experience of IT people. This paper proposes an objective concept to evaluate the SOA that we construct in near future. It can not only integrate existing and legacy systems, but also review for the capacity of SOA through SWOT analysis and PorterÂ´s Five Forces analysis. To achieve these, we need to deploy a supportive architecture from well-evaluative SOA. That enables enterprise to obtain all-dimensional and instant business intelligence.

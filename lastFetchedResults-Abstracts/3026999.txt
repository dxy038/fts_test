This paper proposes a new approach to on-line assessment and control of poorly damped transient oscillations. It relies on combining Prony analysis and the SIME transient stability method, with the twofold objective: on one hand, to improve Prony´s, applicability, reliability and robustness, on the other hand to design generation rescheduling patterns able to enhance the damping of poorly damped oscillations and/or stabilize them. Simulations performed on two different systems illustrate the technique and shows main features: ability to uncover and assess the influence of system machines´ generation on damping, accuracy, and compatibility with real-time requirements. Additional method´s interesting by-products are also discussed.

By analyzing the reconfigure feasibility of the protocol stack, this paper design and implement a reconfigurable embedded TCP/IP protocol stack, and introduce the key technology in detail. This protocol stack can be reconstruct to a IPv4, a IPv6, a dual protocol stack and other kind of protocol stack according to the user request, it has good flexibility and transportability. The protocol stack has been successfully applied to the embedded bidirectional platform, the tests in real network conditions show that the protocol stack provides a good performance and reliability. The throughput is higher than 1.5 MB/s when run on ARM7 CPU which clock frequency is 66 MHz, the object code size is only 30% of traditional ones or so, and can meet the request of the embedded system for connect to the internet during the transitional period from IPv4 to IPv6.

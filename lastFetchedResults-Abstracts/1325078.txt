Introduction: Aquaporins (AQPs) are water channels present in the cell wall, allowing water – ‎and occasionally other molecules – to pass the cell membrane. Their function is to maintain the ‎ internal milieu cells by regulating water and ion equilibrium. The endometrium undergoes ‎structural changes during the menstrual cycle. If implantation does not occur at the end of each ‎menstrual cycle, amplified endometrium is shed in absence of hormones and leads to ‎bleeding. Excessive uterine bleeding over 80 cc in each menstrual cycle  called ‎menorrhagia, is a common gynecological disorder which causes large menstrual bleedings ‎and reduced quality of life for those affected.‎
Methods: The study included 37 patients with menorrhagia and 20 healthy ‎individuals. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and Genotypes were determined ‎by ARMS-PCR and PCR-RFLP .Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS ‎program. ‎
Results: Regarding ‏‎rs1049305, the C minor allele showed more frequency in patients' group‏ (0.47 vs.  0.37).‎‎ The results revealed that GG genotype presents less probable risk ‎for menorrhagia. ‎‎ rs10244884‎ also shows the same frequency.  
Conclusion: It can be concluded that both variants are important in pathogenesis of menorrhagia and the results confirm the important role of Aquqporin–1 channel in menstruation as well as endometrium physiology.

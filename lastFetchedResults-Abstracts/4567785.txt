There is no question that a properly implemented Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system can help an organization to transform and gain more value from its operations. But no organization should invest in ERP without understanding the risks involved. The key objective of this paper is to discuss critical factors impacting on the use of (ERP) systems usage within organizations. The paper highlights the factors that are critical but too familiar with the missteps organizations make in ERPs implementation and usage. By using textual analysis this study identified twenty seven factors that have been cited in different literatures as paramount to the successful usage of ERPs. The identified factors were incorporated in the conceptual framework that was validated using structural equation modelling (SEM). Results of the study showed that there is an increasing paradigm shift from technology to organizational factors that play a critical role in ERP systemsÂ´ usage. This paper contributes methodologically and practically to the information systems body knowledge in the domain of ERP systems.

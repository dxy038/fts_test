The route choice to supply chain is discussed, and modeling method and formalized description based on color Petri net is presented. According to model characteristic, and solution of reverse route to supply chain network is used, and capability of parallel calculation is exerted fully. It shows that the model to supply chain is calculated automatically, and total time and total cost of order channel are derived, and the objective of optimal route choice is attained

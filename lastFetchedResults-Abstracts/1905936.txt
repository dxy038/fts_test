Background & Objective: Interleukin (IL)-10 is an important anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokine. Some authors believe that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene have been associated with susceptibility to HIV infection and progression to AIDS, but its role is not clearly defined yet. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the association between HIV infection susceptibility and progression with SNP in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene. Methods: This study was carried out on 70 HIV infected patients (39 treatment na√Øve and 31 undertreatment) and 31 matched healthy controls. The biallelic polymorphisms in the IL-10 gene promoter (-592 ,-1082) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Results: At position -1082, G/A was the most common genotype and A was the most prevalent allele and at position -592, A/C was the most prevalent genotype and -592 C was the most common allele in HIV positive patients; although there was not any significant difference between cases and controls regarding genotypes and alleles of these regions. Conclusion: Genetic polymorphisms of IL-10 promoter region may not associate with HIV infection outcome and the lack of this association suggests that other genes may influence on HIV infection course.

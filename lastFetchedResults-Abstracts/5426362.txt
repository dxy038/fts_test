Through exposition on top coal caving mining method, as well as fully-mechanized top-coal mining method in the current development and prospect of ChinaÂ´s largest coal enterprises, at the same time it can bring great benefits, also raised its recycling rate is still generally low phenomenon, effect analysis of the main reasons: at the end of the early mining losses, loss of head loss, caving technology and so on. On the analysis of these factors individually, summarizes the measures to improve resources recovery. Study shows: selected scientific and reasonable exploitation of design and top-coal caving technology and equipment, increasing fragmentation and a sound management system, so as to achieve the objective of increasing resource recovery.

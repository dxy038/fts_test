The process of selecting which virtual machines will be placed (i.e. executed) in the physical machines available in a Datacenter is known as virtual machine placement problem. This work proposes for the first time a formulation of the problem, with a multi-objective approach, of the main objective functions studied so far as mono-objective in the state of the art. Also it is proposed a multi-objective memetic algorithm for solving the proposed problem. The validity of the proposed formulation is checked by comparing experimental results of the proposed algorithm with a brute force algorithm. Finally it is experimentally verified the scalability of the used meta-heuristic.

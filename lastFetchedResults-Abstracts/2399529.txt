Objective
tudy evaluated the effect of different chemical surface treatments on the surface characteristics of commercially pure titanium (cp Ti) and the adhesion of the porcelain–titanium system by means of strain energy release rate (G-value, J/m2). Surface roughness and morphology of treated cp Ti were additionally evaluated.
s
ndred and thirty specimens of machined cp Ti plates grade II were prepared. The specimens were divided into ten groups in each test according to the surface treatment used; Gr 1 (control; machined), Gr 2 (sandblasted), Gr 3 (CH2Cl2 for 5 min), Gr 4 (CH2Cl2 for 10 min), Gr 5 (10% H2O2 for 5 min), Gr 6 (10% H2O2 for 10 min), Gr 7 (30% H2O2 for 5 min), Gr 8 (30% H2O2 for 10 min), Gr 9 (9% HF for 5 min) and Gr 10 (9% HF for 10 min). Titanium–porcelain (Vita Titankeramik) was applied to each group for testing the adhesion. The G-value (J/m2) was measured with a four-point bending configuration. Following fracture testing specimens were examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Surface roughness and SEM analysis were carried out. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's test.
s
 treated with 9% HF or CH2Cl2 baths for 10 or 5 min showed the highest adhesion values (J/m2) (34.23 ± 4.31, 30.75 ± 4.91, 28.92 ± 4.33 and 22.54 ± 3.58) respectively among the groups. The machined groups demonstrated the lowest value (8.18 ± 1.95) (J/m2). SEM analysis indicated a combination of cohesive and adhesive fractures for 9% HF, CH2Cl2, sandblasted and 30% H2O2 (10 min) groups, while mainly adhesive fractures were found with the other groups. There was no direct correlation between surface roughness and adhesion.
icance
on between porcelain and cp Ti can be improved by the use of certain chemical surface treatments prior to porcelain firing as alternative techniques to sandblasting treatment.

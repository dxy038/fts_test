The objective of the Finnish Salmonella Control Programme (FSCP) is to maintain the annual prevalence of Salmonella below 1% at the national level. The programme covers meat and egg production with all the serotypes of Salmonella, not only Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium. Based on the monitoring results as well as on the economic evaluation studies, the FSCP has achieved its targets. This shows that given a low prevalence as a starting situation and a clear, well functioning control programme, high level of food safety targets can be reached without high costs.

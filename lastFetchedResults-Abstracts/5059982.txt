This paper presents an approach to optimize the zebrafish-embryo microinjection process by selecting suitable speed trajectories for the motion of the micropipette, with the objective of minimizing the risk of damaging the embryo during the microinjection process. A viscoelastic model of a zebrafish embryo is developed based on experimental data. The speed optimization problem is formulated based on this viscoelastic model. Simulation results indicate that there exists an optimal speed trajectory for the micropipette under certain conditions. The key benefit of this speed optimization approach is that the turgor pressure inside the membrane is prevented from increasing significantly during the microinjection process, thus avoiding damaging the biological components in the embryo.

Background/Objective: This study was undertaken to address
psychological health effects of dentists’ exposure to low ambient
levels of mercury.
Methods: One hundred and six dentists and 94 general
practitioners were randomly selected from clinics in Shiraz city,
Iran. Subjects were asked to complete the Persian version of
General Health Questionnaire. The data were analyzed using
?2 test, independent sample t-test and Mann-Whitney’s U test.
Results: Both groups were similar as far as all demographic
variables, except age, were concerned. No significant difference
was noted between the dentists’ mean total score of GHQ-28 (17.9)
and that of referent subjects (16.34). These scores were significantly
lower than the cut-off point of 23 (P < 0.01). The mean scores for
somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, and depression were
significantly higher in dentists than in the referent subjects. The
results also showed a significant association between GHQ-28
total scores and length of exposure to mercury (P=0.034); with
increase in the job tenure, GHQ-28 total score also increased,
indicating a decrement in psychological health status.
Conclusion: The current findings revealed that, in general,
the dentists’ psychological health status was poorer than the
referent subjects. Additionally, in all GHQ subscales, the
dentists’ scores were significantly different from those of their
counterparts. Given the fact that exposure to mercury is the most
important differentiating variable between both groups, and that
neuropsychological disorders are the most common toxic effect
of mercury, the difference between psychological health status
of the two groups is likely to be related to exposure to mercury.

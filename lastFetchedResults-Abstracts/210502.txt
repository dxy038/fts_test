Background & objective: In Iran, cutaneous leishmaniasis (Cl) as a health problem is increasing and presenting
two epidemiological forms; Zoonotic Cl (ZCl) and anthroponotic CL (ACl). The objective of the present study was
to introduce the Cl epidemic in Baft district, Kerman province.
Methods: This study was conducted in 3 villages; Soltanabad, Vakilabad and Shahmaran as a census between
spring and autumn of 1998 in Orzoeihe region, Bah district. Various epidemiological aspects of this epidemic
including prevalence and related demographic factors, diagnosis by direct smears, identification of the causative
species by immunological and biological methods were determined.
Results: Population of the 3 villages was 13721 i mean 21.8±13.9 years, 50.7% males and 49.3% females.. The
preva lence rate of 12.3% with mean age of 16.3±12 .1 years were infected. Most of the cases were in 10-20
years of age and in Soltanabad (30.6%). The mean number of lesions was 2.58, majority with ~2 lesions,
frequently located on the legs and hands. No previous history of Cl scar were observed. All 100 IFAT, 30 ELISA
tests and 18 inoculated mice showed Lmaior as the overall causative agent.
Conclusions: This is the first epidemic of CL occurred in the southern villages of Bah district with high severity in
all age and sex groups in a new agricultural region. Probably the source of infection was the new comers who
arrived the region from endemic areas for agricultural purposes and infecting the gerbils. Thus, this new
agricultural development has created an extraordinary suitable condition for propagation of rodents and sand
fly populations, then the occurrence of the new epidemic in rural residence, consequently.

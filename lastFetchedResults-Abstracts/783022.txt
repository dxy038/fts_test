Objective The phenomenon of somatization
was explored in relation to the experiences of acculturation,
stress, support, and distress. Methods A representative
community sample of 1,747 Chinese Americans
(aged 18–65 years), selected by a multi-stage household
sampling design, in the Los Angeles County was interviewed
to tap their psychiatric diagnoses, symptomatology,
level of acculturation, stress, and support. Results
Across all indices, Chinese Americans’ level of somatic
symptoms, impairment related to somatization, and
percentage of meeting the Somatic Symptom Index 5/5
(SSI 5/5) criterion were comparable to those found in
other populations. Length of residence in the U. S. and
acculturation were not related to somatization. Regression
analyses showed that anxiety, depression, gender,
age, education, stressors, and support were significantly
related to somatization, ps<0.05. Somatizers tended to
perceive themselves with poor health and utilized both
Western and indigenous Chinese medicine. Conclusion
The importance of demographics, psychological distress,
and stress was emphasized in the explanation of
somatization tendencies among immigrant Chinese
Americans. Somatization might be a stress response
with regard to increased distress severity and psychosocial
stressors rather than a cultural response to express
psychological problems in somatic terms

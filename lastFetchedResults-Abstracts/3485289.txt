A new adaptation strategy of I/O link equalizers is presented based on minimizing the bit error rate (BER) as the objective function to maximize the receiver voltage margin. The adaptation strategy is verified in a 90-nm test chip on both the transmitter finite-impulse response filter (Tx-FIR) and the receiver decision-feedback equalizer (Rx-DFE). The performance is compared with the commonly used sign-sign least mean square (SS-LMS) adaptation and demonstrates significant improvements especially in the case of the Tx-FIR. This paper also demonstrates that in a highly attenuating system that contains both a Tx-FIR and Rx-DFE, using a Tx-FIR subject to peak output power constraint to compensate pre-cursor ISI is worse than solely using an Rx-DFE. The adaptation strategy is further applied to adapt the sampling phase of the clock-and-data recovery loop (CDR). The technique enables near-optimal BER performance by substantially reducing the pre-cursor ISI and requires almost no additional hardware compared to SS-LMS adaptation.

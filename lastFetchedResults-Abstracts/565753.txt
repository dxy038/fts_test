Biomass estimation of forest trees is one of the most important factors in forest management. The main objective of this study was to establish allometric equation for estimating crown, trunk and total tree dry weight. Sampling of tree parts was done using transect with 4 Km length and 15 meter width in Khojir National Park located at east of Tehran  and 30 trees were felled down randomly with different diameter at breast height classes. Diameter at breast height, crown diameter and trees height were measured and dry weight of different parts of trees were determined. Allometric power and exponential regression models were derived. The equations were compared with each other based on the different modeling parameters. The highest significant correlation was found between crown diameters and dry weight (R2=0.93). The best equations were obtained by means of a power regression model.

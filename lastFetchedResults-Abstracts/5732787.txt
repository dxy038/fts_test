In this paper, a new direct model reference adaptive control framework based on a multiple model approach is proposed. The main objective is to synthesis a fault tolerant controller which reconfigures the faulty system with state delay. This approach provides stable adaptation for a class of linear systems with state delay in the presence of unknown actuator faults. The proof of stability is based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii function, while appropriate switching of the multiple models ensures asymptotic tracking for the system outputs, and under the proposed algorithms, the tracking errors of the reconfigured system trend to zero rapidly. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

The overall objective of the MAUVE project is to develop and validate at sea a miniaturized, reconfigurable, mobile and autonomous instrumented vehicle, dedicated to multipurpose survey, in particular in coastal waters. It will be characterized by coherent integration of a compact automatic multiparameter measurement module with a very small autonomous underwater vehicle, enabling sensor-driven navigation. Such a demonstrator, derived from an existing &#8220;torpedo-shaped&#8221; AUV (CALAS), is being developed and will be validated at sea in Mediterranean coastal waters, within &#8220;plume survey&#8221; and &#8220;bottom mapping&#8221; configurations. However, the potentialities of the &#8220;MAUVE&#8221; project open a much wider spectrum of potential applications, ranging from the monitoring of sub-ice conditions to the surveillance of various dumping sites, through the inspection of the quality of bathing waters

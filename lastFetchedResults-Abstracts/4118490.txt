The authors present a novel procedure for designing dipole magnet ends which can be applied to magnets with either cylindrical or conical bulged ends to produce integrated field multipoles which meet the constraints imposed by the SSC (Superconducting Super Collider) lattice. The method makes it possible to couple existing multiparameters optimization routines (i.e. MINUIT with suitable independent parameter constraints) with a computer code DIPEND, which describes the multiples, so that any reasonable objective (i.e. minimizing integrated sextupole and decapole) can be met. The authors describe how the computer method was used to analyze the bulged conical ends for an SSC dipole

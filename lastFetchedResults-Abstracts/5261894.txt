This paper presents an efficient receiver-aware video transcoding system that systematically chooses the optimal transcoding operation from multiple options while meeting network and user constraints. Multi-objective optimization is used to select the best transcoding method that minimizes transcoding complexity and memory usage while ensuring the client constraints of bitrate and requested quality are fulfilled.

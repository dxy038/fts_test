Objective: There is an increasing evidence that show fear of pain and fear of re-injury are fundamental mechanisms in progress of pain and disability in the patients. Cervical stabilization training is a method of exercise which is designed to improved the mechanisms by which the cervical spine maintains a stable, injury-free state . The aim of this study was to compare effectiveness of stabilization exercises with maximum Isometric exercises on fear avoidance belief in Chronic Non-Specific Neck Pain . 
Materials & Methods : In clinical trail study fifty patients with chronic neck pain were recruited. Subjects were randomly assigned to either a stabilization (n=25) or a maximum isometric exercise group (n=25). Before and after intervention ( 4,8,12 weeks) pain was assessed with visual analog scale (ordinal) , disability (ordinal ) with Neck Stability Index (NDI) , Fear Avoidance of Belief with Fear Avoidance of Belief Questionnaire (FABQ . A  48 session exercise program which 8 weeks . six session per week , and per session was performed for both groups. Repeated measurement of analysis variance , Independent t-test and paired t-test were used for comparison between pretreatment and post treatment test results between groups and within groups, respectively. 
Results : The mean neck pain decreased from 7/16±1/57 in first session to 0/92±0/70 in 12 session  in the stabilization group and from 7/12±1/67 in first session to 1/28±0/94in 12 session  in maximum isometric group  (p=0/482) . The mean disability (NDI) decreased from 22/60±3/20 in first session to 11/16±0/90 in 12 session in the stabilization group and from 21/88±2/76  in first session to 14/96±1/48 in 12 session in maximum isometric group  (p<0/001 ) . The mean FABQ-W decreased from 35/08±4/48  in first session to 9/08±1/44 in 12 session in the stabilization group and from 34/76±4/63 in first session  to 17/44±2/18 in 12 session in maximum isometric group (P<0/001)  . The mean FABQ-PA decreased from 20/12±2/26  in first session to 9/26±1/01 in 12 session  in the stabilization group and from 20/08±2/23 in first session to 11/16±1/14  in 12 session in maximum isometric group  (p= 0/938	 ) . Decreased  all variables in the stabilization group was more useful than  maximum isometric group  (p<0/05 ) . 
Conclusion : This study showed that neck specific stabilization exercises and maximum isometric exercises decrease pain , disability , fear of pain and fear of re-injury . Also specific stabilization exercises was more useful than  maximum isometric procedure  .

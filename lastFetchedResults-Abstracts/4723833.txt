Combined with the participants´ behaviors in the course of energy saving and emission reduction in Chinese power plants, the generation rights trade mechanism for energy saving and emission reduction inside power plant is given. It considers two constraint conditions of protecting investors´ interest and balancing generation quantity, and takes the minimization of coal consumption as the objective in terms of distributing profits reasonably among investors. It designs the corresponding model. Furthermore, it leads in the subsidy coefficient and sharing coefficient to establish relationship among profits, coal consumption rate and quoted prices in generation rights trade. According to the relationship, the feasible domain of the quoted prices is given. Finally, it designs efficient algorithm for the model.

Objective (s): Supporting parents has been proposed as one of the main nursing roles. This study was conducted to determine the views of mothers with premature babies in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) about nursing support.
Methods: In a cross-sectional design study, a sample of 153 mothers with premature infants in NICU was recruited through the convenient sampling method. Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, and Milesâ€™s nurse parent support tool. This Likert scaled tool contained four dimensions of emotional support, information-communication support, self-esteem support, qualitative care support.
Results: The Qualitative care support (3.38) and self-esteem support (3.05) were the most types of supports mothers have received, respectively. The least types of support were information-communication support (2.94) and emotional support (2.76), respectively. In terms of the importance of different types of supports, mothers believed that qualitative care support(3.62), information-communication support(3.5), self-esteem support(3.45), and emotional support(3.31) were the most important expected supports, respectively. A significant difference was found between the mean score of all types of supports; and the total score of received support, and the importance of the support (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: Preceived support by mothers was less than expected support.

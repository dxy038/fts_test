Dam adaptive management is an effective way to river ecosystem restoration, yet it may decrease the traditional output of hydro project. This paper developed an optimization model of dam operation based on Genetic Algorithms, with annual electricity as objective and ecological flow demands as major constraints. Through this model, an optimal operation plan on reservoir dispatching can be achieved by calculating the maximal annual electricity under all of constraints including ecological flow demands, which can benefit the ecosystem downstream and also be more acceptable for decision maker of dam operation.

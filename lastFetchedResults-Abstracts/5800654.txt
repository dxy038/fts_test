The objective of this paper is to establish mathematical models and the associated numerical techniques to calculate the transient heat transfer and fluid flow in the melt pool, and to understand the mechanisms leading to the oval shape of the melt pool during dual beam laser welding. By combining several Nd:Yag lasers one can increase the total output power to achieve deep penetration.

This paper describes the algorithm and implementation of an experimental full-digital HDTV system we have recently developed. The video compression algorithm is based on motion-compensated DCT without B (bidirectional prediction) frames and the audio compression is based on subband analysis/synthesis technique. The algorithms have commonalties with international standards such as MPEG, with some additional features. The system has been implemented using off-the-shelf ICs and programmable logic devices, and provides a fairly good video/audio quality (28-38 dB peak-to-peak signal-to-noise ratio for video) despite relatively low complexity

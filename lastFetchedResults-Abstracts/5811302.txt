Pattern recognition is characteristic to all living organisms. The object which is inspected for the "recognition" process is called a pattern. Medical diagnosis is an example of pattern recognition problem. By knowing a "KNOWN" we can eliminate all the "UNKNOWNS" in the parasitic sample. The objective of this work is to match parasites of same type but with approximately different shape. One should be able to recognize the parasites of same type even if there is slight variation in their shape. In our work we match different types of parasites by checking their pixel values and their continuity. It is often useful to have a machine perform pattern recognition. In particular, machines that can read parasites are very cost effective. A machine that reads the type of parasite can detect many more parasites than a human being at the same time. Application of this nature optimizes the time and enhances the matching accuracy. To the best of our knowledge much work is not reported in the field of matching the parasites.

The problem of sellers pricing in electronic marketplaces can be ranked as a coordination games, the paper puts forward a agentspsila belief revision model and a learning algorithm which is based on the similarity of agentspsila strategies in coordination games. By position-exchanging, each agent stands from the viewpoint of its opponent and infers opponentspsila actions,. The belief revision model combines the objective observed actions and subjective inferred actions. Coordination is assured by adjusting the belief degree to be 0 or 1. simulations results prove that our algorithm makes sellers more intelligent as to the problem of whether to cooperate or to compete, thus achieve greater profits.

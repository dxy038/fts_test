For multimedia transmission over noisy channels, the error robustness of JPEG2000 evidently outperforms that of JPEG. Since JPEG2000 is based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), traditional error concealment algorithms for still images in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain are not suitable for JPEG2000. In JPEG2000, decoding is processed bitplane by bitplane. Any data loss occurring in the bitstream will affect the consequent bitplanes and their wavelet coefficients. To solve this problem, the JPEG2000 VM7.2 program replaces the missing wavelet coefficients by zeros. However, the replacement may affect lots of significant nonzero coefficients such that some high frequency components are lost. In this paper, we present a novel error concealment algorithm for image transmission in the bitplane base. The proposed algorithm recovers the damaged bitplane data according to the cross subband and undamaged bitplane information. The recovered wavelet coefficients are similar with error-free data. The objective results show that the proposed algorithm has 3&#8764;8dB improvement than those without the error resilient mechanism. From a subjective viewpoint, the proposed algorithm can achieve much smoother edges on the reconstructed image using our concealment algorithm.

AbstractObjective
mine the role of RET in renal malignancy, in particular papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
als and methods
rt of 111 archival renal samples was used consisting of 94 renal cancers (66 papillary RCC, 18 conventional clear cell carcinoma, 10 chromophobe RCC), 4 benign oncocytomas, and 13 normal kidney tissues. RET protein expression was examined by immunohistochemistry and expression levels were correlated with clinicopathologic and patient survival data.
s
ve RET staining was seen in 34/66 (52%) papillary RCCs, 4/10 (40%) chromophobe carcinomas, 4/4 (100%) oncocytomas, and 11/13 (85%) normal kidney samples. All 18 cases of conventional clear cell carcinoma had negative RET staining. RET expression was associated with low Fuhrman nuclear grade.
sions
otein may be contributing in part to an adaptation of a papillary growth pattern in certain renal malignancies. Given the possible therapeutic benefit of small molecule inhibitors of RET activation, further work needs to be done to highlight the functional relevance of RET protein expression in papillary RCC.

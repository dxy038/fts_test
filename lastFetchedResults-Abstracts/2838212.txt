The recent advancements in computing, signal processing and communication technologies have immensely improved public health care systems. As a result, new diagnostic instruments with better precision and compatibility with machines, gadgets and databases are developed. However, many of these technical marvels are young and still at research level, and are not very well known commercially. In the present study, a cuff-less blood pressure (BP) measurement was done using correlation study of pulse transient time and heart rate. Among the various vital biomedical signals that can be collected non-invasively, Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Photoplethysmograph (PPG) were taken simultaneously to determine electrical signals of the heart (ECG), the condition of the arteries (PPG) and together can be related to the arterial pressure of the systemic circulation (BP). This promises to give a composite overview of the cardiovascular system non-invasively. The BP estimation was done using non-linear 2nd order curve fitting regression model. The final objective is to develop a portable, non-invasive, biomedical signal acquisition system which not only can monitor, store and communicate the above mentioned biomedical signals but can also predict the BP by processing these signals. The device will be used for continuous monitoring especially for patients with cardiovascular complaints, and will be reduced to a mobile attachment, that is easy to use and can be operated by a paramedical staff (ASHA workers) with minimal training.

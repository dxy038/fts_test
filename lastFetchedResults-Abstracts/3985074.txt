For subjective assessment of speech quality in codecs, a reference impairment system is required to introduce controlled degradations to calibrate subjective evaluation. A reference system provides a convenient means for making meaningful comparisons between subjective test results across laboratories and can be viewed as a scale on which mean opinion scores are projected, this scale being supposed to cover the whole range of quality. Nowadays, standardized anchor systems do not fit any more the degradations brought by the present codecs. This paper aims at offering new reference signals simulating the defaults of codecs currently used on telecommunication networks. Twenty wideband codecs are compared through dissimilarity tests. A multidimensional scaling technique allows us to define a four-dimensional perceptive space that appears stable for male and female talkers. A verbalization task suggests qualifying the degradations perceived by the listeners with the following attributes: muffle, background noise, noise on speech, and hiss, each conveyed by one dimension. These dimensions are correlated with objective measures such as spectral centroid, energy in the silent part in the high frequency sub-band, ratio of brightness between deterministic part and residual part of the signal and spectral correlation coefficient. New reference signals are produced and a phase of validation suggests a perceptive space quite coherent with the original one.

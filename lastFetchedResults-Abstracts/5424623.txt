Goal oriented methods help software engineers to model high-level systemic goals, propose and evaluate architectural solutions, and detect and resolve conflicts that occur. This paper describes a new technique, known as softgoal traceability patterns, for enabling reusable class mechanisms such as design patterns to be applied within a goal-oriented framework. Softgoal traceability patterns increase the reliability of a design in respect to its goals through the automated generation of design elements and the establishment of bidirectional traces between goals and design. These traces are used to monitor the integrity of the design in respect to architectural quality goals, and to support impact analysis when design changes are proposed. Softgoal traceability patterns are described using the well-known Observer pattern and then expanded with a more complex pattern that incorporates authentication

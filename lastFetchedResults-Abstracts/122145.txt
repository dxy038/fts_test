BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Garlic is one of the oldest plants that has been used for prevention and treatment of different diseases. Also, pseudomonas aeroginosa is the most important form of human pathogens that is resistant to many different antibiotics and makes some problems in treatment. This study was done to evaluate the effect of garlic and its extract on pseudomonas aeroginosa.
METHODS: The standard strain of pseudomonas aeroginosa was prepared and after providing cloves of garlic with different weights (0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 gr) as raw, frozen and cooked and also preparing microbial suspension from samples equal with macfarland solution (0.5), bacteria was cultured on MR agar and cloves of garlic was put on that and then incubated. Garlic extract with different concentrations (30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 mg/ml) were affected by Nathan agar well diffusion method. Disk-diffusion method was done for determining the sensitivity and resistance of bacteria.
FINDINGS: Garlic extract with 40 and 35 mg/ml concentrations had bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects on the standard strain of pseudomonas aeroginosa. Also, cloves of garlic with different weight cause the growth inhibition of bacteria but cooked cloves had the least effect on bacteria. CONCLUSION: Garlic extract with 50 mg/ml concentration cause zone of growth inhibition that is equivalent to the disk of gentamicin (10 microgram). Since, cloves of garlic especially frozen one cause to growth inhibition of bacteria, it is recommended to do more researches about the effective concentration of allicin on pathogens and use of soap, cream and ointment for disinfection of wounds.

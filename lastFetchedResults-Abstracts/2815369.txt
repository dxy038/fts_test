The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the USA is making available to anyone worldwide maps of ground albedo parameters that are derived from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument. The first parameter fiso describes the isotropic part of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF); the two other parameters fvol and fgeo are linked to the viewing and illuminating geometry and describe the anisotropic part of the BRDF. These maps exhibit missing values. This communication describes a series of 12 monthly maps of the BRDF parameters with no missing values available on the Web. In addition, a method for computing the ground albedo is proposed that does not require the a priori knowledge of the ratio of the direct to the global irradiance.

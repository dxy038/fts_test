The electromagnet is always used in stable operation, but it did not achieve the maximum efficiency. In this paper, it has proposed an electromagnetic system with double coils design methodology, which has applied Finite Element Method (FEM). The objective of design and analyses the electromagnet has achieve the desired requirements. From the instantaneous peak current of coil and the pull-in speed, it has optimized the improvement of the electromagnet. In order to energy saving and environmental protection, when the electromagnet is closed, double-coil automatically switch to single-coil. Based on these results, the validity of the proposed method has been confirmed by test.

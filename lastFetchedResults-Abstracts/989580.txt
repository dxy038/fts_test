A key objective of the present study, as a part of a PhD thesis titled “normalizing the test of characteristics and skills of independent learner measurement in e-learning system”, is the invention of a standard and normalized tool to measure the skills of independent learner in e-learning system. Considering the fact that having some skills is a necessity for independent learner in e-learning system, the present study is mainly focused on theoretical principles and required data collection as well as interview with experts and those people who are experienced in education, e-learning, and psychologists. Using the mentioned group’s opinions, we have invented and normalized a measuring tool for information and technology literacy skills and critical thinking of independent learner. To measure such skills we have used the test of critical thinking questionnaire (California B form) and measuring information literacy questionnaire (ACRL, 2000). The samples include 452 master e-learners of Payame Noor University, Iran. Descriptive and inferential statistical methods were applied for data analysis. Based on previous research, theoretical foundations and the results of the present study, we have invented a test to measure the skills of independent learner in e-learning system, and then the test was normalized based on exploratory factor analysis method. This paper, thus, introduces the test of measuring the skills of independent learner in e-learning system and the methods that apply to normalize it.

This paper proposes distributed traffic monitoring and controlling model using sensors and dedicated traffic servers. This model is described as basic role-oriented processes communicating though primitive interaction protocols. The model is aimed to provide an enabling communications framework upon which multi-agent system models can be organized and built to be used for an simulation of an road map and to estimate the traffic behavior (to provide information about the best routes). This paper presents a hierarchical routing strategy for controlling the traffic of that region. The model assists the drivers to get the desired destination taking into account the current situation of traffic characteristics. It gives the estimated arrival time and the corresponding distance between a start and an arrival point. The necessary information is obtained from current traffic position using sensors (used as dynamic information and to characterize the traffic, for example if traffic is jammed on an area, we can predict alter paths). The information given by the advisory system has the form of self generated message according to the condition of traffic using the given algorithm. The proposed algorithm uses well known searching techniques and data structures for appropriate handling of traffic in a sensor based web model for traffic management. To achieve this objective the model uses proposed algorithm on parallel communicating servers which also communicate with end users.

The objective of practical training is a major issue in students education, in many engineering disciplines. The access to specialized technological equipment for education is often limited by specific time restriction, or not provided at all. Therefore, the benefits by providing a Web-based platform for remote experimentation via LAN or Internet are evident. This paper describes the development of an e-laboratory platform intending to be used as a distance training system in the field of robotic task planning (e.g. programming of a robotic pick and place task). In prior work, this platform was evaluated by training students remotely to implement robotic tasks, using the robotpsilas Teach Pendant. This paper is focusing on the design of a training platform, aiming to make students familiar with the V<sup>+</sup> robotic operating system. The proposed platform intends to remotely provide the students with the ability of programming robotic manipulation tasks using directly V<sup>+</sup> scripts. An evaluation protocol, presented in [11], [12], is considered to be employed in the near future, in order to assess the performance of the proposed e-laboratory platform, with respect to the level of students learning and assimilating of the robotpsilas programming language (V<sup>+</sup>).

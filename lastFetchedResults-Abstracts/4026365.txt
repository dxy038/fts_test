We investigate the problem of broadcasting analog sources to several users using short codes, employing several antennas at both the transmitter and the receiver, and channel-optimized quantization. Our main objective is to minimize the sum mean-square error distortion. A joint multi-user encoder, as well as a structured encoder with separate encoders for the different users, are proposed. The first encoder outperforms the latter, which, in turn, offers large improvements compared to state-of-the-art, over a wide range of channel signal-to-noise ratios. Our proposed methods handle bandwidth expansion, i.e., usage of more channel than source dimensions, automatically. We also derive a lower bound on the distortion.

Due to paradigm shift of power systems from traditional centralized power plant based to deregulated decentralized distribution generation based system, microgrids have gained a significant interest that are foreseen as a potential alternative for economic and reliable power supply in such system. Microgrid is a small-scale power supply network associated with Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and a given load. This paper proposes a modified single phase VSC bidirectional converter based Battery Energy Storage System for microgrid applications (VSC-BESS). The proposed VSC-BESS with H-bridge AC-DC converter also offers significant DC ripple compensation and power decoupling with a DC-DC converter,. Further a detailed dynamic model of lead-acid battery often used in microgrid application is also presented. The models of all the components including single phase bidirectional VSC converter, buck boost converter and battery model have been developed in MATLAB Simulink environment.

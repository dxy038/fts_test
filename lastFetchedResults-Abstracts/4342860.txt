In this paper, a multilayer distributed multi-agent framework under the smart grid umbrella is proposed as a control structure to tackle technical challenges for distribution systems with high penetration of distributed generation. The proposed multi-agent control structure has been divided into three main layers. In the first layer, the functions of the local agents is defined according to the concept of intelligent agents and the characteristic of the individual DG and utility devices such as load tap changer, shunt capacitors and protection devices. Based on the concepts of microgrids, cells and virtual power plants, regional coordination agents are defined and chosen as a second layer. To achieve global objective(s), the distribution management system DMS is selected as the highest layer supervisor agent.

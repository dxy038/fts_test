Probes, which can be used on-line to rapidly and efficiently detect beef quality attributes (colour and tenderness), are currently being considered to predict ultimate beef quality. The contribution of the inherent sampling variability (due to factors such as muscle location) needs to be evaluated in order to optimise the sampling procedure for these measurements. The main objective of this trial was to monitor some sampling factors which may contribute to variation in pH and various quality attributes in bovine M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL). Location along the muscle did not impact on colour measurements (P⩾0.05). Location had no effect on cook loss, Warner Bratzler shear force (WBSF) and sarcomere length values (P⩾0.05). The moisture and intramuscular fat contents did vary (P⩾0.05); however, as the differences were very small this may not be of practical significance. Different models of pH meters/probes had a significant influence (P⩽0.01) on recorded pH values. However pH did not differ significantly (P⩾0.05) along the length of the LTL. The type of meter used also had a significant impact on colour readings and 1 h ‘blooming’ time was observed as optimal for measuring colour on beef.

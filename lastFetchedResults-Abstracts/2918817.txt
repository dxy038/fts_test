Surface emitting semiconductor lasers (SELD) are of great interest for utilisation in opto-electronic integrated circuits and for optical interconnects. Two main classes of device may be identified: short cavity structures and high-order grating structures. For the first class of devices, the authors develop a tractable model for SELDs which permits optimisation of the device design. The authors give early results from work leading towards that objective in respect of one specific short-cavity surface emitting laser design. As part of the simulation study they have examined a novel semiconductor/insulator material system. A case is briefly made for the wider utilisation of this material system in semiconductor optoelectronics. Of specific relevance to spectral properties of semiconductor lasers it is suggested that the cited semiconductor/insulator material is of particular interest for the control of spontaneous emission

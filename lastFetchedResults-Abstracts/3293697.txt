This paper proposes an optimization-based control approach for microgrid energy management. For exemplification of the approach consider a microgrid system connected to an external grid via a transformer and containing a local consumer, a renewable generator (wind turbine) and a storage facility (battery). The objective of minimizing the costs is achieved through a predictive control framework for scheduling the battery usage in the microgrid system. The proposed control framework takes into account cost values, power consumption, generation profiles as well as functional constraints under uncertainties in the wind speed profile. Simulation results using real numerical data are presented for a reliability test system.

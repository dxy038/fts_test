Background and Objective: Due to progressive increase in the number of cases of cancer, there is a need to develop anti- tumor compounds. Statins have a variety of different effects on proliferation, migration and survival of cells and have been suggested as proper candidates for the inhibition of this disease. The aim of this study was to determine cytotoxicity effects of Atorvastatin with variety of concentrations on the growth of MCF7 cell line.
Materials and Methods: MCF7 cell lines were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS in a humidified incubator (37 ?C & 5% CO2). Different concentrations of Atorvastatin on quantitative proliferation of the cell line were determined by Dimethyl Thiazol Tetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay and Trypan blue. The data were analyzed by SPSS version 11.5. The statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's tests.
Results: There was no statistical significance in cytotoxicity effect of 1 µmol and 0.1 µmol of Atorvastatin on survival of MCF7 cells after 24, 48 and 72 hrs comparing to control cells. But in 10 µmol concentration of Atorvastatin, a significant decrease was observed in survival of MCF7 cells at the mentioned time points.
Conclusion: Different concentrations of Atorvastatin have different effects on the growth of cultured cell lines. It seems that 10µmol concentration decreases growth of cultured human breast cancer cells. Further animal studies on this subject are suggested.

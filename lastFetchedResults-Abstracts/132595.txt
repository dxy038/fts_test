Background : Regarding the increased number of cesarean section in the recent decades, controling side effects such as postoperative infection seems necessary.
Objective: To compare the regimen of one dose Prophylactic antibiotic after cord ligation with 7-days antibiotic regimen to control infection in cesarean section.
Methods: In this clinical trial, 50 pregnant women operated due to meconium , breech presentation, repeated cesarean and ellective cesarean , were randomly selected & divided into 2 groups. In the 1st group (2 grams regimen) 2 grams intravenous antibiotic was injected after cord clamp and in the 2nd group (seven days regimen) on the first day after operation , 1 gram intravenous antibiotic was injected 6- hourly and then oral antibiotic was prescribed for seven days.
Findings: Wound infection was seen in 1 patient (4.16%) in the 1st group and 1 patient (4.3%) in the 2nd group. In seven days regimen , two patients had fever after operation with unknown origin . Hospitalization in both groups was 48-72 hours but in the 2nd group this duration was more than 72 hours in 13% of cases. No significant difference was seen.
Conclusion: Prophylactic antibiotic like multiple dose antibiotic can prevent infection after cesarean section .

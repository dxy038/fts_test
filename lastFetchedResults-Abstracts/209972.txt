Objective: In the present study, the effect of bilateral intrahippocampal administration of
histamine on anxiety-related behavior in rats was investigated. Method: The rats were first
sensitized through 3 days of morphine administration and a 5 day drug-free period. The
animals were then examined in a plus shaped maze. Results: Intra-VHC bilateral
administration of histamine decreased %OAT (Open Arm Times) and %OAE (Open Arm
Entries) but not locomotor activity, thus showing an anxiogenic response. However, the
administration of histamine to morphine-sensitized rats increased OAT and OAE in
comparison with saline administered groups, which is indicative of a decrease in anxiety in
the sensitized animals. Conclusion: Bilateral administration of histamine in ventral
hippocampus induces an anxiogenic effect, which decreases in morphine sensitized rats.
Naloxane antagonizes the effects of morphine on anxiety.

It is now quite evident that the most important investment of any
organization which constitutes its key success factor and the main reason for
its survival is the motivated, educated and powerful human capital working
in that organization. One way to identify such employees is the correct and
efficient evaluation of their performances. The current method used in many
big organizations to determine the performance evaluation is based on the
personal judgment of managers and supervisors without taking the future
course of the business into consideration. Hence, in case of any change or
replacement of the evaluator, the overall process of evaluation undergoes
major alterations. Such a situation causes individuals to have different
reactions for a single behavior and in tum leads to staff confusion and
bewilderment and reduces the organizational capabilities. Under such
conditions, not only the identification of efficient employees and the relevant
rewards are difficult, but also their weak points are not easily recognized.
On the other hand, the most important shortcoming of the current
systems of evaluation for Iranian organizations is the lack of a correct
definition of accurate indicators, and those used are the exact imitation of the
organizations in western countries. Thus, the present article has been brought
about of the applied- scientific researches with the objective of "optimizing
systems for the evaluation of the performance of the employees and
presentation of appropriate systems". In this research the "description survey
method" has been utilized. The result of the research states that the
evaluation systems in the banking system of Iran are somewhat imitational
and therefore an appropriate evaluation system with regard to the vision and
organizational strategy is designed and presented.

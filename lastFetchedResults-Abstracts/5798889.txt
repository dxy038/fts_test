In wireless systems, the radio resources are precious, and available bandwidth is shared between users in a given radio cell. Our objective is to define a resource allocation schemes, to permit an efficient sharing of uplink bandwith between different supported traffic categories. So call admission control procedure can be defined. In this work analytical Markov model was proposed, in order to define a resources allocation scheme for voice and data traffic integration in heterogeneous satellite- UMTS network (S-UMTS).

This paper describes the implementation of a neural controller to drive an axial magnetic flux switched reluctance motor (AFSRM) with only one stator. As a principal objective, the minimization of torque ripple was aimed. To verify this reduction, a machine prototype was built and a speed control system was implemented. The experimental results show that the performance of the neural controller is similar to the conventional PID controller, but with lower computational effort.

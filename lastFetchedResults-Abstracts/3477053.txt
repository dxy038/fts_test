In this paper the ripple-free deadbeat control problem for sampled-data systems is considered. This control objective is to settle the error to zero for all time after some finite settling time, in other words to eliminate the ripples between the sampling instants in deadbeat control of sampled-data systems. The necessary and sufficient conditions to solve this problem are derived and related to the system type, and a method of constructing the ripple-free deadbeat control system is presented.

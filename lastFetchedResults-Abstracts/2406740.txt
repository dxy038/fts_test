Objective
Brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) have long been utilized in the
investigation of auditory modulation and, more specifically, auditory brainstem
functions in individuals with autism. Although most investigators have reported
significant abnormalities, no single BAEPs pattern has yet been identified. The
present study further delineates the BAEPs deficits among subjects with autism.
Materials & Methods
BAEPs were recorded in 43 male patients, aged 35–104 months, who underwent
standard evaluations after receiving a diagnosis of autism. The control group
consisted of 43 age-matched typically developing boys. The study took place in
a tertiary neurodevelopmental center over a period of two years.
Results
The mean values of all absolute and/or interpeak latencies were longer in
patients when compared to controls, albeit the differences were not significant
for any of the parameters. Prolonged or shortened absolute/interpeak latencies
(control group mean ± 2.5SD) were unilaterally or bilaterally identified in 33%
of patients, compared to 9% of controls. The most frequent findings included
prolongation of absolute latencies I, V and III, followed by shortening of interpeak
latency I-V. In addition, abnormalities (either shortening or prolongation) of
absolute latencies I and V, as well as interpeak latency I-V, were significantly
more common among patients. Taken together, BAEPs in 23% of patients were
indicative of a clinically abnormal response in 32% of patients.
Conclusion
As can be easily concluded, BAEPs abnormalities characterize only a subset
of subjects with autism, who may be important to identify clinically. The latter
individuals may benefit from targeted intervention to utilize brainstem plasticity.

The Civil Engineering Design Seminar course at Ohio Northern University is intended to provide the opportunity for students to participate in a creative engineering capstone design experience. The objective of this class is to allow students the chance to experience a real-life example of the engineering design process. This process starts with the formation of design teams, the search for engineering problems, the preparation of proposals, and concludes with the award of projects to successful biddings design teams. This course represents an attempt to simulate the professional engineering environment through a syllabus that will allow the students to gain the experience and the exposure that they need to be prepared for a bright future in their professional endeavors.

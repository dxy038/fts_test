The objective of the described floodlight radar resulted from the threat by ARM-missiles. By avoiding a scanning narrow transmit beam the radiation may be covered by a decoy transmitter all the time. The floodlight transmission is combined with a CW-signal, modulated by a polyphase code for range estimation. A multibeam receiver allows the direction estimation of targets. For detection the signals have to be integrated over a period corresponding to the usual scan period, e.g. 2 sec. A Doppler tolerant test procedure applying a combination of autocorrelation estimates is suggested and discussed. The detection performance turns out to be almost comparable to coherent processing but to be more robust for signals with varying Doppler frequencies

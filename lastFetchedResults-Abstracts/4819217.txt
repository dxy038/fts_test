In this paper, we mainly concern the expected value model and its solution method of the multiobjective programming problem under bifuzzy environment. We first consider the expected value model to the problem, and investigated its convexity. Furthermore, to the proposed model, the concepts of non-inferior solution are defined. According to practical decision-making process, a solution method, called the method of main objective function, has been studied, whose results can facilitate us to design algorithms to the problem.

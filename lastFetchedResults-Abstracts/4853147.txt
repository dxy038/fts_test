This paper is a unique approach to customer and developer interaction and bringing in a more friendly way of communication between them to gather the requirements more efficiently. This way benefits like requirement analysis, scope of the project, objective of the project and detection of errors in the project offering the greatest potential for improving requirements quality and avoiding cost overruns in the development of software systems, both for the customer(s) and the developers. We have proposed a number of extra features for the traditional FAST (facilitated application specification techniques), providing more benefits to both the parties than it is doing now. In our approach we have defined what the facilitator (the one who is responsible for conducting meetings between the two parties i.e. the customer and the developer) should really do and specifically who should it be, more over certain terms that can come in front in FAST meetings are looked upon and that how can one be careful about them, keeping things straight and simple between both the parties. Moreover verification and validation is provided in all the early stages of the software development, being discussed in every FAST meeting and monitored by the facilitator. This paper basically shows way of improving the software quality right from the beginning of the project to the end product

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether Interceed oxidized regenerated cellulose (Johnson & Johnson Medical, Arlington, Tex.), because of its polyanionic nature, may compete for the macrophage scavenger receptor. STUDY DESIGN: RAW macrophages were incubated with Interceed oxidized regenerated cellulose and known scavenger receptor ligands. The production of interleukin-1β by mouse peritoneal macrophages was measured in the presence of Interceed cellulose. RESULTS: When macrophages were incubated with Interceed cellulose, increasing concentrations inhibited the uptake of fluorescent acetyl low-density lipoprotein. In the presence of Interceed cellulose there was a decrease in the production of interleukin-1β by mouse macrophages. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the interaction of Interceed oxidized regenerated cellulose with macrophages with scavenger receptors may result in a decreased secretion of matrix components, inflammatory mediators, and cellular growth factors. Thus Interceed cellulose may function as a biologic barrier in preventing adhesions.(Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;177:21)

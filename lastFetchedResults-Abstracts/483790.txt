The main objective of this paper is to present a methodology for the seismic safety assessment oflow rise reinforced concrete (R.C.) buildings damaged by the Bam earthquake. Details of this five step evaluation methodology is described in part one. In this method, safety of the buildings is evaluated based on the strength and ductility parameters in two levels of earthquake motions, namely: strong earthquakes and very strong earthquakes. In this part of the paper, two sample buildings damaged during the Bam earthquake have heen studied using this method. In addition, results ofdetailed evaluation of the sample buildings using nonlinear statie and dynamic analyses is compared with field observations and the results of the evaluation method. The results of this study indicate n good compatibility between the evaluation method, detailed analyses, and field observations.

Image formation in phase-contrast electron microscopy is governed by the contrast transfer function (CTF). The key parameter to tune the CTF is the defocus. A precise and unbiased estimate of the defocus is essential to determine the forward model and interpret high resolution images in cryo-TEM. We present an algorithm based on the weak-phase approximation for determination of the defocus and astigmatism of the objective lens from recorded images of an amorphous sample. The algorithm identifies Thon rings in the power spectrum density (PSD) and uses them to estimate astigmatism and defocus together with their uncertainties. For the astigmatism estimation we use a transformation to polar coordinates to fit ellipses to the Thon rings. Averaging the PSD over these ellipses reduces CTF estimation to a 1D problem and enhances the signal-to-noise ratio.

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is most widely used standard in the world for securing electronic mails. It promises for confidentiality, integrity and authentication to its users. These security services are provided at a cost of various cryptographic algorithms. Given a data, choosing particular algorithms for its security, according to the user requirements, is a non-trivial task. As various algorithms with different security levels and cost are available. In this paper we have proposed a meta-heuristic based on Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for selecting appropriate algorithms for PGP according to the user requirements of cost and security levels.

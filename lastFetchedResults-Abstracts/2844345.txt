This paper evaluates the effect of varying the number of bit allocation sub-bands that segment the transformed wavelet spectrum in an eletromyographic signal encoder. This study investigates the optimal number of sub-bands in the segmented wavelets transform spectrum, which is used in the quantizing algorithm. The criteria of objective evaluation is based on percent residual difference (PRD) and compression factor (CF). In the computational simulations, were implemented and compared two methods of allocating bits: linear decreasing spectral shape and hyperbolic tangent decreasing spectral shape.

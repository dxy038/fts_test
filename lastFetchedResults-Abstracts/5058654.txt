A new genetic algorithm based method for solving nonlinear multicriterion optimization problems is described. The method does not use a fitness value as a measure, as a genetic algorithm uses to create the population of chromosomes for the next generation. The proposed method uses tournament selection which does not require evaluation of fitness values in order to create a new population of chromosomes for the next generation. The tournament is arranged such that objective functions are evaluated only for feasible solutions. After a detailed description of the method two examples are presented and the results are compared with those obtained using other methods. This comparison shows the effectiveness of the proposed method

Recently, a lot of studies on Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), in which Genetic Algorithm is applied to Multi-objective Optimization Problems (MOPs), have been reported actively. MOGA has been also applied to engineering design fields, then it is important not only to obtain Pareto solutions having high performance but also to analyze the obtained Pareto solutions and extract the knowledge in the designing problem. In order to analyze Pareto solutions obtained by MOGA, it is required to consider both the objective space and the design variable space. In this paper, we define &#8220;Non-Correspondence in Spread&#8221; between the objective space and the design variable space. We also try to extract Non-Correspondence area in Spread with the index defined in this paper. This paper applies the proposed method to the trajectory designing optimization problem and extracts Non-Correspondence area in Spread in the acquired Pareto solutions.

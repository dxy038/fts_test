Background and Objective: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women around the world and in Iran.  A limited number of studies have been conducted on the relationship between dietary factors and breast cancer development in Iran.  The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of dairy products and animal proteins consumption and breast cancer among women in the province of Isfahan in the year 1390. 
Materials and Methods: This case-control study was carried out on 100 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 100 healthy women as the control group.  All participants were Iranian and over 18 years old.  The case and control groups were matched regarding age, body mass index, physical activity, and age of menarche.  Data were collected by Frequency Food Questionnaire (FFQ) and analyzed by T-test, Chi-square, Man Whitney and Logistic Regression.
Results: Our findings show that while red meat and milk were consumed the most among animal proteins and dairy products, respectively, fish and butter were consumed the least.  Logistic Regression analysis indicates that consumption of sausage and salami, red meat, and high-fat milk and yogurt show a significant correlation with breast cancer risk (P <  0.0001).
Conclusion: Consumption of fish and low-fat dairy products might decrease the risk of breast cancer in the Iranian women.  Further researches are recommended to investigate the role of chicken consumption in breast cancer risk.

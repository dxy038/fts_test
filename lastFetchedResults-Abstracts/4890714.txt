One of the main problems facing accurate location in wireless communication systems is non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation. Traditional location algorithms are based on classical techniques under minimizing a least-squares error criterion and it loses optimality when the NLOS error distribution deviates from Gaussian distribution. In this letter, an effective location algorithm based on robust objective function is proposed to restrain the NLOS errors. Compared to other robust location algorithms, the proposed algorithm can give a closed-form solution. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can improve location accuracy.

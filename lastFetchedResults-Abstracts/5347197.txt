In this paper, the problem of model reference adaptive sliding mode control for a class of perturbed uncertain systems is investigated. An integral sliding surface design is proposed by adding an integral term into the linear sliding surface. The additional integral in the proposed sliding surface provides one more degree of freedom and also reduce the steady-state error. Based on the Lyapunov stability theorem, an adaptive sliding mode control strategy for solving the robust tracking problem without the knowledge of upper bound of perturbations is developed. The use of adaptive technique is to adapt the unknown upper bound of perturbations so that the objective of globally asymptotical stability is achieved. Once the system enters the integral sliding manifold, the dynamics of controlled systems are insensitive to matching perturbations. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed control scheme

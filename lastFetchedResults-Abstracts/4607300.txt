In this paper, we consider the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based bidirectional transmission where a pair of users exchange information with the assistance of a decode-and-forward (DF) relay. Each user can communicate with the other via three transmission modes: direct transmission, one-way relaying, and two-way relaying. We jointly optimize the transmission policies, including power allocation, transmission mode selection, and subcarrier-node assignment for maximizing the weighted sum rates of the two users with quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. We formulate the joint optimization problem as a mixed integer programming problem. By using the dual method, we solve the problem efficiently in an asymptotically optimal manner. Particularly, we derive the capacity region of two-way DF relaying in parallel relay channels. Simulation results show that the proposed resource-allocation scheme can substantially improve system performance compared with the conventional schemes.

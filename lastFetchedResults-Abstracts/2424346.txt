The utilization of syngas shows a highly potential to improve the economic potential of the stand-alone power unit-based gasification plants as well as enhancing the growing demand of transportation fuels. The thermochemical conversion of biomass via gasification to heat and power generations from the earlier study is further enhanced by integrating Fischerâ€“Tropsch (FT) synthesis with the existing gasification pilot scale studied previously. To support the potential and perspectives in major economies due to scaling up in developing countries such as Thailand, the objective of this work is to develop a base case process model coupled with techno-economic evaluation for the FT synthesis. In particular, the FT process configurations are designed and assessed using current kinetic laboratory data by our research group for modeling specific reactions in PFR reactor. The calculation of equipment sizing incurred several major unit operations is performed for once-through mode (no recycles of unconverted syngas) with electricity co-production. This study provides a detailed base-case model for the FT synthesis with the capacities of 1, 2 and 3 MW of syngas technology sharing and the comparison between the integrated- and non-integrated FT syntheses with respect to techno-economic criteria. The integration of FT synthesis with biomass gasification in this study results in the significant assessment of energy efficiency and cost reduction by 36.92% and 16%, respectively.

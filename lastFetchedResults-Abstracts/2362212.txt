The principle of the consent in contracts has exceptions which are called contracts by deed or formal contracts (tashrifati contracts). Most of the jurists believe that these acts are impossible in the form of the provision of result because of not accessing the nature of stipulations. The present note argues that it is not necessary for the provision of the result to achieve the nature of stipulations or at least it does not need that the outcome and result of those acts achieve to the nature of stipulations but even if the requirement of that legal act is established, it is adequate. It should be stated some evidences (reasons) for this claim such as the indication of the requirement and the divergent meaning (Mafhum al-Mukhalafah) of Article 236 of the Civil Code and also the provision of the contingent result which the civil legislature has accepted in Art. 119 and other Articles. From its effects, it can be mentioned the establishment of a type of objective right for one who is the clauses for because of the nature of stipulations and also creating duties because of taking away the obstacle (creating special cause) for one who is the clauses against.
Key words: The provision of result, The provision of the contingent result, The legal formal act, The legal consensual act.

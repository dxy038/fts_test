Medical image processing plays an essential role in providing information in wide area for such advanced images. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an advanced medical imaging technique providing rich information about the human soft tissue anatomy. MRI of the brain is an invaluable tool to help physicians to diagnose and treat various brain diseases including stroke, cancer, and epilepsy. The specific information to evaluate the diseases. Histogram equalization is one of the important steps in image enhancement technique for MRI. There are several methods of image enhancement and each of them is needed for a different type of analysis. In this paper study and compare different Techniques like Global Histogram Equalization (GHE), Local histogram equalization (LHE), Brightness preserving Dynamic Histogram equalization (BPDHE) and Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE) using different objective quality measures for MRI brain image Enhancement.

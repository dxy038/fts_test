Show-Through is a common occurrence when scanning duplex printed documents. The back-side printing shows through the paper, contaminating the front side image. Previous work modeled the problem as a <i>non-linear</i> <i>convolutive</i> <i>mixture</i> of images and offered solutions based on decorrelation. In this work we propose a cleaning process based on a Blind Source Separation approach. We define a cost function incorporating the non-linear mixing model in a mean-squared error term, along with a regularization term based on Total-Variation. We propose a location dependent regularization tradeoff, preserving image edges while removing show-through edges. The images and mixing parameters are estimated using an alternating minimization process, with each stage using only convex optimization methods. The resulting images exhibit significantly lower show-through, both visibly and in objective measures.

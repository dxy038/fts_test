An XNOR/OR circuit polarity optimization scheme is proposed with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of area and power. A polarity evaluation function is established based on the weighted sum method. The multi-objective genetic algorithm is modified according to the characteristics of the problem, and further an area-power synthesis optimization scheme is constructed. The proposed scheme is tested by nine Benchmark circuits and distribution characteristics of best polarities are discussed finally based on the simulation data.

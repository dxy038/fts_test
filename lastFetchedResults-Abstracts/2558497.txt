Background: Psychologically traumatic workplace events (known as critical incidents),
which occur globally, are increasing in prevalence within the USA. Assisting employers in
their response is a growing practice area for occupational medicine, occupational social work,
industrial psychology and other occupational health professions. Traumatic workplace events
vary greatly in their level of organizational disruption.
Objective: To explore whether extent of workplace disruption influences organizations' decisions
for post-incident response planning and plan execution.
Methods: Administrative data mining was employed to examine practice data from a workplace
trauma response unit in the USA. Bivariate analyses were conducted to test whether
scores from an instrument measuring extent of workplace disruption associated with organizational
decisions regarding post-incident response.
Results: The more severe and disruptive the incident, the more likely organizations planned
for and followed through to deliver on-site interventions. Following more severe incidents, organizations
were also more likely to deliver group sessions and to complete follow-up consultations
to ensure ongoing worker recovery.
Conclusion: Increasing occupational health practitioners' knowledge of varying levels of
organizational disruption and familiarity with a range of organizational response strategies
improves incident assessment, consultation and planning, and ensures interventions delivered
are consistent with the level of assistance needed on both worker and organizational levels.

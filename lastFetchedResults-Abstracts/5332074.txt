The following research presents a GIS-base multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach for evaluation/selection of planning and design alternatives. A wide range of decision and management situation used multicriteria decision analysis to solve spatial problems. Various researchers proposed many methods. The objective of this paper is to incorporate the concept of fuzzy set theory and hierarchical structure analysis into the GIS-base MCDA.

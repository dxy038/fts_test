Background and Objective: Early identification of individuals at risk of disease and modifying their high-risk behaviors is always a priority in the health system. Using less costly diagnostic methods and planning tools can be an effective step towards achieving this goal. The Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) can be one of these tools. The aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between AHEI and 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).  
Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 235 male-employees aged ?30 years selected by non-random sampling. The AHEI and 10-year risk of CVD were calculated based on data obtained through food frequency and dietary oil intake questionnaires and the Framingham risk score, respectively. To calculate the Framingham score components, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, fasting blood sugar and blood pressure of the subjects were measured. 
Results: There was no statistically significant asociation between AHEI and the 10-year risk of CVD 
(r =-0.12, p=0.07). However, the risk was inversely related with some of the AHEI components, including the nuts and soy group (r= -0.15, p= 0.02) and the fruits group (r = -0.13, p=0.04).Based on the stepwise multiple linear regression results, every additional serving of the nuts and soy group led to a 2.5% reduction in the CVD risk (B=-2.527, p=0.02), but after adjusting for the energy intake (a confounder), the association disappeared.
Discussion: In this study no statistically significant relationship was observed between the Alternative Healthy Eating Index and a 10-year risk of cardiovascular diseases.

[Method] The high performance liquid chromatography fingerprint spectrum (HPLC-FPS) was adopted to analyze and compare the fingerprint spectrum of root and leaf from different Isatis indigotica Fort sources. [Result] HPLC fingerprint spectrums of different sources of the root of Isatis indigotica Fort and the leaf of Isatis indigotica Fort was determined and 12 common fingerprint peaks was ascertained. Similarities of the fingerprint spectrums were compared and showed the quality difference for the different plants. [Conclusion] The Institute established Isatis root and leaves of Isatis fingerprint can be used to evaluate the quality of medicinal parts .Proper method for the determination of HPLC fingerprint spectrum of the root and leaf of Isatis indigotica Fort was established and up to the technical demand for TCM fingerprint spectrums. The study provided scientific basis and research method for evaluating quality of officinal portion from Isatis indigotica Fort.

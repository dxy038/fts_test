The author´s objective was to identify alternative cockpit display media which allow fighter pilots to receive flight critical data in an `eyes out´ mode, without dependency on the already overloaded auditory and visual senses. An intra-cockpit communication system based on the tactile/cutaneous sense is considered. If, for example, airspeed or angle-of-attack (AOA) data can be reliably communicated to the pilot through a cutaneous tactile stimulation device, the pilot could be constantly aware of his energy state without coming into the cockpit to read his displays. A method of information presentation based on electrotactile stimulation of the sense of touch is discussed

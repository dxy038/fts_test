Wheeling is a process of transmitting electric power through the transmission lines governed by a third party. A practical problem is that wheeling from vendor to vendee involves power flows through several intermediate networks that is, multi-area wheeling. Each utility involves in part of a more number of wheeling transaction over a few miles or hundreds of miles. A vendor that generates power does not have to own power transmission lines: only a connection to the network or grid. The vendor then pays the owner of the transmission line based on how much power is being moved and how congested the line is. In this paper, the basic objective is to minimize the overall operating cost considering the topological structure of the multi area wheeling. This is addressed as a non-linear optimization problem with linear constraints. The basic Genetic Algorithm is used to solve the above optimization problem.

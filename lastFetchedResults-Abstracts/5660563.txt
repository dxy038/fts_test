The objective of the present paper is to evaluate the impact of interference on the performance of a Bluetooth network. Specifically, the interference analyzed is that from other Bluetooth networks. The study focuses on the impact of adjacent and co-channel interference on the throughput and coverage performance. Analysis and simulation data illustrate the significant difference in performance between synchronous and asynchronous systems. The paper also provides insights on how to design Bluetooth networks for maximum throughput and coverage performance.

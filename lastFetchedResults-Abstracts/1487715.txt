The objective was to determine the effect of muscle location on protein solubility and protein degradation in deep (DSM) and superficial (SSM) portion of beef semimembranosus. At 24 h postmortem, the semimembranosus was removed from beef carcasses (n = 10), packaged in high-oxygen modified atmosphere (80% O2 + 20% CO2), and displayed for 7 d at 1 °C. DSM had higher (P &lt; 0.05) L*, a*, b*, and hue values than SSM throughout display. DSM had significantly higher protein denaturation and less protein concentration than SSM. Western blotting for μ-calpain autolysis revealed that DSM maintained more (P &lt; 0.05) unautolyzed μ-calpain than SSM. This result coincided with less desmin and troponin-T degradation in samples from the DSM. These results confirm the hypothesis that increased protein denaturation in DSM results in minimal proteolysis by negatively affecting μ-calpain activation. This demonstrates a potential to alter progression of proteolysis and improvement in tenderness associated with postmortem storage.

In this work, we present a Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) technique (a class of Atheromatic systems) that classifies the automatically segmented carotid far wall Intima-Media Thickness (IMT) regions along the common carotid artery into symptomatic and asymptomatic classes. We extracted texture features based on Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and LawÂ´s Texture Energy (LTE) and used the significant features to train and test the Support Vector Machine classifier. We developed the classifiers using three-fold stratified cross validation data resampling technique on 342 IMT wall regions. An accuracy of 89.5% was registered. Thus, the proposed technique is accurate, robust, non-invasive, fast, objective, and cost-effective, and hence, will add more value to the existing carotid plaque diagnostics protocol.

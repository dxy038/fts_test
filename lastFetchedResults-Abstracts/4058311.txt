It is shown that the problem of pole assignment by gain output feedback in linear time-invariant multivariable systems may be reduced to an algebraic optimisation problem, using the concept of virtual model following. The method requires no transformation of the open-loop system to a canonical form. A number of related problems involving combinations of pole placement with a secondary design objective are also discussed.

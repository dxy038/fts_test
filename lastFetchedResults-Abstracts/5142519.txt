Image fusion could process and utilize the source images, with complementing different image information, to achieve the more objective and essential understanding of the identical object. In order to implement image fusion on a real-time embedded system, a proper algorithm must be considered. A novel image fusion scheme based on biorthogonal wavelet decomposition is presented in this paper. As for wavelet transform algorithm, due to the virtue of its multi-resolution, wavelet transform has been applied in image processing successfully. Another advantage of wavelet transform is that it can be much more easily realized in hardware because its data format is very simple. This could save a lot of resources, besides, to some extent, it can solve the real-time problem of huge-data image fusion. However, as the orthogonal filter of wavelet transform doesnÂ´t have the characteristics of linear phase, the phase distortion will lead to distortions of the image edge. To make up for this shortcoming, the biorthogonal wavelet is introduced here. In this paper, the hardware and software solutions of an embedded real-time instrumentation are demonstrated. This design which is implemented on the high performance DSP (TMS320DM642) platform has combined an infrared image and a visible image with biorthogonal wavelet fusion technology.

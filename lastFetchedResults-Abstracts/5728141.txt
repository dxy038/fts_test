This paper considers the problem of waveform synthesis given a desired power spectrum. The properties of the designed waveforms are such that the overall system performance is increased. The metric used to evaluate the optimality of the synthesized time domain signals is the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). We discuss how to synthesize waveforms using the technique of partial transmit sequence (PTS). The key point is that the gradient can explicitly be derived from the objective function. Furthermore, the result is extended by allowing the power spectrum to deviate from its original shape, yielding a further reduction in the PAPR. The method is applied to derived power spectra for wideband multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar. It is shown that the proposed technique can achieve optimal or near optimal performance with PAPR below 0.5 dB.

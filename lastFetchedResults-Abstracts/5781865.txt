Image denoising is a key issue in all image processing researches. It is the first preprocessing step in dealing with image processing where the overall system quality should be improved. Generally, the quality of an image could be corrupted by a lot of noise due to the undesired conditions of image acquisition phase or during the transmission. The great challenge of image denoising is how to preserve the edges and all fine details of an image when reducing the noise. In this article, a comparative study of image denoising techniques relying on spatial filters is presented. Subjective and objective evaluation methods are used to judge the efficiency of different types of spatial filters applied to different types of noise. Moreover, a proposed denoising technique based on cascaded median and wavelet filter is presented. This study on denoising could be a considerable base in dealing with denoising purposes for all vital vision systems.

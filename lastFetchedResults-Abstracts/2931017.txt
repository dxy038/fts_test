At present, datapath synthesis techniques produce a design with a large number of isolated registers. Allocation of memory modules to implement these resisters are usually left to the designer. This paper presents new approach to the allocation of multiport memories which minimizes hardware costs in ASIC datapath synthesis. The proposed approach, AMD, considers not only the access requirements of registers but also the lifetime of registers. The objective is to minimize the requirement of registers and multiport memory modules under a given resource constraints simultaneously. The minimization problem has been modeled as a 0-1 integer linear programming problem. This approach is illustrated with an example

Purpose The primary objective of this study was to report
on the occurrence of mental health difficulties for a large
national sample of Australian fathers of children aged
0–5 years (n = 3,471). Secondary objectives were to
compare fathers’ mental health against normative data for
the general male adult population, and to examine the
course of mental health problems for fathers across the
early childhood period.
Methods Secondary analysis of data from the infant
cohort of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children at
three waves when children were 0–12 months, 2–3 and
4–5 years. Comparative data on the prevalence of psychological
distress in the Australian adult male population
sourced from the National Survey of Mental Health and
Wellbeing.
Results Approximately nine per cent of fathers reported
symptomatic or clinical psychological distress at each
wave, as measured by the Kessler-6. Approximately 30 %
reporting distress at wave 1 continued to report distress at a
similar or worse level across waves 2 and 3. Fathers not
living with their children also had high rates of distress
(14 % at wave 1 and 10 % at wave 2). Finally, fathers in
the present study had 1.38 increased odds (95 % CI
1.12–1.69) for psychological distress compared with the
Australian adult male population.
Conclusions Fathers are at risk of experiencing postnatal
mental health difficulties, which may persist across the
early childhood period for some fathers. The results suggest
routine assessment of fathers’ wellbeing should be
undertaken in the postnatal period with mental health
interventions and support provided across the early childhood
period

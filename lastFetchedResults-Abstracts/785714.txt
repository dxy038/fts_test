The sensitivity of the stock indices fluctuates according to business cycles or economic
fluctuations. This creates a trade-off between risk and return in the minds of investors. They
want to achieve maximum return at a minimal risk. This mode of optimisation requires portfolio
diversification . As a matter of fact, selection of portfolio is based on the computation of the
measures of central tendency and dispersion, namely mean and variance. More over the third and
fourth order moments of the data set on indices need to be optimised so as to maximize
skewness. In portfolio selection high return and minimal risk is the common objective of every
investor.The share market return depends on various factors which are qualititative and
quantitative in nature. Several researchers employ different fuzzy decision-making techniques to
manage portfolios.

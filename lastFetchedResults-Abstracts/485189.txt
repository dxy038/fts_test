One of its most important psychological effects is depression which involves considerable percent of these patients. Considering high prevalence of DM and its related depression, we designed a research to evaluate relation between social support and rate of depression in diabetic patients.

Data-gathering was accomplished by a questionnaire and social support and depression rate were assessed using Bek questionnaire. Finally, data were analyzed by SPSS software. Results: Correlation coefficient between results of social supports and depression tests was - 0.54. These variants were significant and in inverse relationship. Relationship between social support and depression in male and female diabetic patients were significant and were inversely related. Prevalence of depression was 58.8% in men and 76.2% in women which has not significant differences (P-Q.057).
Conclusion: According to our study, there is an inverse relationship between social support and rate of depression in diabetic patients. No gender differences were found. Psychological aspects of DM and importance of social supports in treatment of depression related to DM must be considered.

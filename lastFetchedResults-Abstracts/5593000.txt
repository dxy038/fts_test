Gradual approaching method which can deal well with distribution network dynamic reconfiguration is presented in this paper. The method not only can be realized easily, but also can make use of any established static method for solving dynamic reconfiguration. At first, objective function of static reconfiguration is amended for being applied in interval optimization. And then, time enumeration method is used for determining optimal time for reconfiguration. Thus, one times of reconfiguration for interval optimization is finished. For realizing multi optimizations within specified time interval, gradual approaching method is employed. At last, correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on modified IEEE 33-bus system.

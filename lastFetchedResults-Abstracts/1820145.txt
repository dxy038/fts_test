Objective
unknown which genes are differentially expressed in cultured epithelial cells derived from the epithelial rests of Malassez (ERM) in periodontal ligament and oral gingival epithelium (OGE). This study analysed the different gene expression of OGE and ERM cells using a DNA microarray technique.

lial cells from ERM and OGE were isolated from porcine periodontal ligament and oral gingival epithelium. Each RNA sample extracted from the cells was reverse transcribed into cDNA and labelled with either cytidine 5-dUTP (Cy5) or cytidine 3-dUTP (Cy3). These labelled cDNA probes were then mixed and simultaneously hybridised to the Pig 13K microarray plate bearing 13,295 different genes (Operon, AL). Cellular enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CELISA) was performed to confirm the expression at protein level.
s
were nine genes common to the triplicate microarrays in ERM cells and one in OGE cells. Four of the nine genes including tissue factor (TF), FAT cadherin (FAT) and two unknown genes were expressed at levels more than threefold higher in ERM cells than in OGE cells. The protein levels of both TF and FAT in ERM cells were significantly higher than those in OGE.
sion
 FAT may act as markers to distinguish ERM cells from OGE cells in vitro.

Security constraint optimal power flow is one of the most cost effective measures to promote both cost minimization and maximum voltage security without jeopardizing the system operation. It is developed into a multi-objective problem that involves objectives such as economical operating condition of the system and system security margin. This paper explores the application of Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO) to solve the security enhancement problem. In this paper, a novel fuzzy logic composite multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for security problem is presented. Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices, are modern compensators of active and reactive powers, can be considered viable options in providing security enhancement. The proposed algorithm is tested on the IEEE 30-bus system. The proposed methods have achieved solutions with good accuracy, stable convergence characteristics, simple implementation and satisfactory computation time.

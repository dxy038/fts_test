Soil adsorbing properties reduce sorption ability of the metal, which in turn may influence decision for
remediation at contaminated sites. The objective of this study is presentation of a model based on soil
properties to estimate the sorption of Cr(III) in chromium contaminated soils. Twenty uncontaminated
soil samples, with properties similar to the contaminated soils were selected from around of city of Tabriz
and treated with Cr as CrCl3. A multiple regression analysis with statgraph software was used to drive an
expression that related Cr sorption to common soil properties. The results showed that four soil properties
were important in determining the amount of Cr adsorbed by the soils including pH, cation exchange
capacity, total inorganic carbon and clay content with nearly 80% variability in Cr sorption and a
reasonable level of confidence by this model. The obtained model suggested that Cr(III) sorption was
enhanced by higher soil pH, more total inorganic carbon, more clay, and higher cation exchange capacity.

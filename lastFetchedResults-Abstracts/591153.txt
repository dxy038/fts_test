History is a great treasure of nations' lives in the course of time. Nations try to, through keeping and transferring historical knowledge to the next generations, protect their own identities. The non-objective nature of history as well as temporal interruption between the past and the present, because of which historical events cannot be experienced by the present generation, make this difficult. In the modern educational systems, teaching history is not aimed to remembering a host of names, but to strengthening one's power of analyzing historical events and studying their consequences for the contemporary lives of human societies.

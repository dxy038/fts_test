In this paper, a position sensing system based on infrared techniques for multiple robots operating within a structured environment is introduced. Unlike many existing multiple robot systems, the proposed sensing mechanism enables each robot to determine its position and path of movement without the need of a central coordinator. The robots communicate with each other with a radio link passing information about their intentions, positions and the performed tasks. The system is simple and it does not require complicated vision and communication capabilities, thus, a minimum computing power is needed for the operation. Clearly defined objectives, robust position sensing capabilities and efficient inter-robot communications enable each robot with self-autonomy to determine its own task to be executed. The main objective of the position sensing system is to enable a number of robots to operate in a cooperative manner as members of a team

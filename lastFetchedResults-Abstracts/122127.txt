Objective: To determine the life time frequency of mood disorders in patients with multiple sclerosis. Methods: 85 patients with multiple sclerosis (45 females and 40 males) aged 18-65 years, were selected through convenience sampling and were evaluated using the semi- structured clinical interview (SCID) based on the DSM-IV criteria. Data analysis was done with the chi-square and Mann - Whitney tests. Results: The life time frequency of mood disorders was 34.5% in psatients with multiple sclerosis; 15.6 of which had depressive disorder NOS; 8.2% had bipolar I disorder; 5.9% had major depressive disorder; 2.4% had bipolar disorder NOS; 1.2% had dysthymic mood disorder; 1.2% bipolar II disorder. Conclusion: The collective frequency of mood disorders in individuals with multiple sclerosis is considerable with bipolar mood disorders contributing more that expected. Since most of the these disorders can be successfully treated, clinicians should beware of and be sensitive to the timely diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of the psychiatric disorders in patients with MS.

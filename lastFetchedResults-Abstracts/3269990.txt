The objective of the paper is to estimate the load torque of the vector controlled synchronous drive. The proposed method supposes no additional hardware equipment. In order to estimate the load torque the values of the transversal stator current component and of the speed signal are necessary. These signals are available to any vector controlled synchronous drive system. Moreover, the proposed load torque estimator is integrated into an optimal control drive system. In order to increase the robustness to noises signal, in spite of using the first order load torque estimator the second order load torque estimator has been proposed.

Objective/Background: To evaluate the short-term outcome of patients who underwent carotid
stenting with the routine use of cerebral protection devices.
Patients and methods: In our center, 36 successful carotid stenting procedures (of 38 attempted)
were performed in 37 patients (23 men; aged 66  plus-minus 7 years). Cerebral protection involved
distal filter devices (n= 36) of which 12 were Accunet and 24 were EZ filter wires.
Results: The protection devices were positioned successfully in 36 of the 38 attempted vessels.
The 30-day incidence of stroke and neurological death was three. Neurological complications
included one major stroke, and one minor stroke. There was also one (sudden cardiac
death on the first day). The proportion of stroke or death was two for symptomatic lesions
and one for asymptomatic lesions, and two in patients aged <80 years and one in those aged
.80 years. Protection device-related vascular complications included mild spasm, which occurred
after three procedures (8%), none of which led to neurological symptoms. There were
another four cardiogenic deaths in 30-day follow-up.
Conclusion: In this uncontrolled study, routine cerebral protection during carotid artery stenting
was technically feasible and clinically safe. The incidence of major neurological complications
in this study was lower than in previous reports of carotid artery stenting without cerebral
protection.

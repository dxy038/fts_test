This paper deals with the effectiveness of fault-induced current injection into the system by wind turbines. First, a brief review of the grid code requirement on wind turbines to support voltage profile during fault is reviewed. Based on first principles, analytical expressions quantifying the effectiveness and the limits of the voltage support effort are formulated. This has then been extended to include the limits imposed on output current by the transient stability requirements of the wind park, in which stability constrained current limits through the link wind park - the point of the interconnection and the boundary conditions for stable operation have been derived. Using sample computations, the effect of the violation of this stability limit during fault on the wind park has been analyzed. Finally, a control scheme has been proposed, which on the basis of the voltage dip experienced by the network, reduces the real part of the wind park output current with the objective of enhancing the transient stability margin. Again the effectiveness of the proposed scheme has been demonstrated using sample computations.

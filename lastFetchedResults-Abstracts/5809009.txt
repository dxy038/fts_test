The theoretical basis of an objective approach for impedance characteristic interpolation in the development of RF coaxial impedance standards is presented. Variants of the scheme apply to three impedances commonly used to calibrate vector reflectometers and automatic network analysers. The scheme permits impedance standards to be characterised at intermediate frequencies in terms of their values and associated measurement uncertainties

Like other Muslim philosophers, Ibn Sina believes in the objective truth of God's attributes. His point of difference from most philosophers lies in the fact that he believes in the divine attributes at level of conception; nevertheless other philosophers regard the concepts of divine attributes as concepts that are based on multiplicity and different from each other.

Some people as a result of misunderstanding have accused Ibn Sina of confusing concept and denotation. But this theory given his principles is acceptable, because Ibn Sina regards the abstraction of multiple concepts from a fact that has no mode of multiplicity-even as regards its status- as impossible.

On the other hand, given the particular condition of necessary being which makes him a distinct being from other beings, concept implying the attributes of being is a fact distinct from a concept which denotes to the attributes of possible beings, whereas a concept denoting the attributes of possible being is different.

The main objective of this paper is to monitor the land cover change in the natural reserve of the Yellow River Delta (YRD) using Markov chain transition matrix method, especially changes of natural vegetation communities in the recent ten years. The results indicated that from 1999 to 2008, only 15.0% of Suaeda meadow, 40.0% of Chinese tamarisk shrubs, 22.2% of Reed swamp and 3.8% of Reed meadow had kept no change, and the regions in which the inverse succession happened were 2.07-fold that of progressive succession, which reflected ecological fragility of YRD, and the integration of satellite remote sensing, GIS and Markov chain transition probability matrices could provide a method for studying the dynamic succession processes of natural vegetation community.

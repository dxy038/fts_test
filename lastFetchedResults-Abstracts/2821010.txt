In this paper, robust design of multimachine power system stabilizers (PSSs) using multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is presented. The problem of selecting the stabilizer parameters is converted to an optimization problem with integral square error (ISE) and integral of time multiplied absolute value of the error (ITAE)-based objective functions. The MOPSO is employed to search for optimal PSS parameters for a wide range of operating conditions. The performance of the proposed MOPSO based PSSs is investigated for a three-machine nine-bus system under different configurations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing the dynamic stability of power systems is confirmed through eigenvalue analysis and nonlinear simulation results.

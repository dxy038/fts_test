Summary form only given, as follows. VNIIEF is developed magnetocumulative ultrahigh magnetic field generators (MC-1) of various sizes including those with large HE charge: inner and outer diameters are 360 and 650 mm, respectively, and mass is about 140 kg. Various sizes of the generator liners, their design parameters and powering condition have been analyzed by a numerical model of the cascade MC-1 generator. The objective of the work is to choose design and operating mode of the generator MC-1 which will ensure maximal fields in a suitable for measurement volume. Computational results are supposed to be verified experimentally.

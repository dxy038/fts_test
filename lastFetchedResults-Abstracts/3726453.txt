The modeling and control of two piezoelectric actuators (PAs), with an objective application towards intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), is addressed in this paper. The PAs are used to realizing the fast and precise movements of an injector so as to penetrate an oocyte (egg cell) with precision and without causing a large deformation. Two specific PA designs are considered for this application: linear reciprocating and partially rotating. General models are presented for the purpose of control system design for both designs. To address the nonlinearities and uncertainties of the actuators, as represented in the model, an adaptive controller is proposed to yield robust control performance. Application results are presented and discussed in this paper. Successful penetration of the zona pellucida (cell membrane) of the oocyte to the ICSI problem has been achieved with both designs and the merits and demerits of both configuration are duly discussed.

A new family of soft-switching phase-shift bidirectional DC-DC power converters is proposed. The converters are composed of fundamental switch cells with phase-shift control. They can achieve zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) in both forward and backward modes without increasing voltage or current stresses. The operation principle and analysis of one particular converter, taken as an example of the converter family, are explained. Experimental results are presented

The objective of this study is to determine the interactions between high hydrostatic pressure, pressurization temperature, time and pH during pressurization on death and injury of pressure-resistant and pressure-sensitive strains of four foodborne pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus 485 and 765, Listeria monocytogenes CA and OH2, Escherichia coli O157:H7 933 and 931, Salmonella enteritidis FDA and Salmonella typhimurium E21274. Among these strains S. aureus 485, L. monocytogenes CA, E. coli O157:H7 933 and S. enteritidis FDA were reported to be more pressure-resistant than the respective strain of the same species (Alpas et al., 1999). In general, viability loss of all pathogens was enhanced significantly as the level of pressure and temperature were increased (P&lt;0.05). All the strains except S. aureus 485 demonstrated more than 8 log cycle reduction when pressurized at 345 MPa at 50°C for 5 min. This strain seemed to be the most pressure-resistant strain within the conditions of the study. Pressurization in the presence of either citric or lactic acid increased the viability loss by an additional 1.2–3.9 log cycles at pH 4.5 for both acids at 345 MPa. This study has indicated that high hydrostatic pressure applied in conjunction with mild heat and acidity can be an effective method for inactivating pressure-resistant and pressure-sensitive strains of four foodborne pathogens in organic acid solutions. This combination treatment indicates possible pressure pasteurization applications to liquid foods that have low pH.

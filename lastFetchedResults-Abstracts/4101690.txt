Full-order small-signal modelling and dynamic analysis of zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) phase-shift bidirectional DC-DC converters is studied. A general modelling method is proposed to develop the discrete-time average model. This full-order model takes into account the leakage inductance current and the resonant transition intervals in order to realise ZVS. Both the leakage inductance current and the resonant transition intervals are the key to accurately predict the dynamic behaviour of the converter. A control-to-output-voltage transfer function is derived for the dual active bridge DC-DC converter, which is taken as an example to illustrate the modelling procedure. Experimental results confirm that the new model correctly predicts the small-signal frequency response up to one-third of the switching frequency and is more accurate than the previously presented models.

From January 1986 through December 1993, we operated on 59 patients with documented Mycobacterium tuberculosis  infection. Indications for operation were as follows: multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) in 19 patients; bronchopleural fistula secondary to Mycobacterium tuberculosis  infection in 12; massive hemoptysis in 5; destroyed lung in 7; solitary nodule in 7; trapped lung in 3; complicated cavity in 4; and empyema in 2. Sixty-five operative procedures were performed: pneumonectomy with latissimus muscle flap in 15 patients; pneumonectomy in 3; lobectomy in 16; segmental or wedge resection in 11; decortication in 5; window thoracostomy in 3; thoracoplasty with myoplasty in 4; tube thoracostomy in 4; return to operating room for bleeding in 2; Clagett procedure in 1; and drainage of a cold abscess in 1. There were no operative deaths. Major postoperative complications occurred in 5 patients. The two late deaths were in patients with MDRTB: 1 with progressive disease and massive hemoptysis and the other with a relapse of MDRTB. Of the patients operated on as part of their therapeutic regimen for MDRTB, 17 (89%) of 19 have remained culture negative. We conclude that (1) surgery still plays an important role in the management of patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis  infection; (2) surgical intervention can be performed with acceptable mortality and morbidity; (3) a variety of procedures are needed to effect cure; and (4) encouraging results in patients with MDRTB support surgical therapy in this difficult group of patients.

Objective. We previously showed diminished inotropic responses to isoproterenol in uninfarcted posterior papillary muscles of rats with anterior wall infarcts comprising  30% of the left ventricle. We have also shown that this occurs in the absence of β-receptor downregulation. Our objective was to show a mechanical defect in the rat infarct model which is secondary to cellular defects downstream to cAMP production.
Methods. Sprague-Dawley rats were infarcted via coronary ligation. After 3 weeks, the uninfarcted papillary muscle was placed in a muscle bath and exposed to increasing concentrations of dibutyryl cAMP while contracting isometrically at 28°C.
Results. The large infarct group showed evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy which was manifested by an increased right ventricular mass. No differences were found in baseline measurements of developed tension (DT); rate of tension development (dT/dt); rate of relaxation (-dT/dt); time to peak tension (TPT); and relaxation time (t1/2R).
When these muscles were stimulated with dibutyryl cAMP, the large infarct group had a reduced inotropic response as measured by +dT/dt and TPT. No consistent abnormalities were noted in relaxation. The findings are similar to those we noted previously with isoproterenol stimulation.
Conclusion. The impaired response to β stimulation in uninfarcted myocardium from rats with large myocardial infarctions is due to cellular defects which lie downstream to cAMP production.

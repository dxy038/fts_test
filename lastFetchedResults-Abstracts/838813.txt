The paper analyzes nonlinear optimal control of integralâ€“differential equations that describe the optimal management of a forest taking into account intra-species competition and carbon sequestration. The objective function includes the revenues from timber production, operational expenses, and the net benefits from carbon sequestration. A dual system is derived and a necessary extremum condition is established.

Abstract Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a condition associated with chronic anovulation, insulin resistance and androgen excess. Women with this syndrome are at increased risk of metabolic syndrome. Objective: The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MBS) in women with PCOS referred to Arash Hospital in different ages and body mass index (BMI). Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Gynecologic Clinic at Arash Hospital affiliated with Tehran University. A total of 282 women with PCOS ages between 15-40 years were included. The prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome and its components in this population were the main outcomes. Height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and laboratory tests (FBS, TSH, HDL-C, serum prolactin, triglycerides and total cholesterol) were measured in this population. Results: The prevalence of MBS in PCOS women was 22.7% (64 cases). The rate of central obesity, FBS more than 110 mg/dl, triglycerides more than 150 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (HDL-C) less than 50 mg/dl, and blood pressure ?130/85 mmHg in PCOS women was 31% (87), 3.2% (9), 33% (93), 68.8% (194), and 10.6% (30), respectively. The risk of MBS was increased in older and the obese women (BMI ?30 kg/m2). Conclusion: The present sample showed women with PCOS have a high prevalence of MBS and its individual components, particularly decreased HDL-C.

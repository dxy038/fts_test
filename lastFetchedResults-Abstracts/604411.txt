Introduction: Malnutrition is a clinical disorder and a usual risk factor in older people, that was considered as a natural part of geriatrics process in the past, but nowadays it is found that malnutrition is detectable, preventable and treatable and its early diagnosis can lead us to on time intervention. Thus, older peopleâ€™s nutritional status and detecting its causes can help caregivers to plan and implement appropriate interventions.
Objective: The aim of this study is nutritional status assessment in the retired senile by some demographic characters in two parts: screening and complementary. 
Materials and Methods: This study is a descriptive-cross sectional one on 194 senile retired from governmental organizations who were assessed by simple sampling. In this study, we use a questionnaire consisting of two parts: one part for demographic data and the other called MNA (Minimal Nutrition Assessment) that has 18 items and two parts: screening and complementary parts. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 16 using statistical tests including Krauskal Wallis, Man Whitney and Spierman.
Results: Findings showed that 87.1 percent of the participants had normal nutrition and 12.9 percent of them had probable malnutrition and 4 percent were with malnutrition. Among the demographic factors (age, sex, marital status, educational status, income and co morbidity), nutrition was found to be related to sex (0/002) and income (p < 0.013) significantly. Thus, the normal nutritional status was high in female older people and in senile with higher income. Conclusion: Considering the high probability of malnutrition demonstrated in this study, it is necessary for the clinicians and authorities to receive related education and become aware of this issue and respective consequences. Also, it is necessary to implement plans and programs to relieve poverty as a main risk factor in malnutrition.

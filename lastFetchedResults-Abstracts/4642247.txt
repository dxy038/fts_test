The high temperature inside a grain storage will cause grain damage and thus lower the quality of the grain. Currently, aeration system is installed in grain storage to overcome this problem. This system has been proven practical, suitable and economical in the humid topics like Malaysia. However, the automatic aeration system is not yet available in our country. So, the objective of this project is to develop a monitoring and control system for the grain storage. The monitoring system which is also known as SCADA system will monitor and control the aeration process in the grain storage. This paper will also discuss the aeration system design that consists of 4 important elements which is airflow rate, fan selection, air distribution and ventilation system. The system configuration that comprises hardware and software is designed to demonstrate the automatic aeration system.

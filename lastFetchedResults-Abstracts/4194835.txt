The Aide de Camp project at the University of Liverpool has been addressing the problem of information overload (together with related issues), particularly with regard to electronic mail. One successful application supplied users with a knowledge-based system (KBS) which, together with a sophisticated e-mail user agent, can handle routine communications on behalf of the user. This approach was used to create a software knowledge-based assistant (KBA) which helps a lecturer in the administration of an undergraduate course. Whilst this approach is successful in its objective of reducing the number of messages presented to the lecturer, it often achieves this by increasing the number of messages other members of the organisation receive (for example the student and the technical support staff). To overcome this failing, the work utilises a system of cooperating knowledge-based systems which reduces the overall number of messages for the organisation. This cooperation is implemented using the Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML), which provides a protocol for KBSÂ´s to share and exchange knowledge

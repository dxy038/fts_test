The paper presents the optimization of metal-plate-connected plane timber trusses with special emphasis on joint flexibility. The optimization was performed by the non-linear programming approach. Since various truss design parameters such as type of truss configuration, span/depth ratio, number and type of diagonal and vertical members and type of joint connections simultaneously affect each other, it is proposed that all of these parameters should be considered simultaneously in a single mathematical model. An optimization model for cost optimization of timber trusses was thus developed. The economic objective function for minimizing the structure’s self-manufacturing costs was defined, subjected to the design, stress and deflection (in)equality constraints. The finite element equations were as the equality constraints defined for the calculation of the internal forces and the deflections of the structure. The stiffness matrix of the structure was composed by considering fictitiously decreased cross-section areas of all the flexibly connected elements. Constraints for the dimensioning of the timber members were determined in accordance with Eurocode 5 in order to satisfy the requirements of both the ultimate and the serviceability limit states. The cross-section dimensions and the number of fasteners were defined as independent optimization variables. A numerical example demonstrates the applicability of the optimization approach presented as well as the influence of the fasteners’ flexibility on the optimal self-manufacturing costs.

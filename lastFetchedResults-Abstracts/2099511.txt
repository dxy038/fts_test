Oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated CpG motifs (CpG ODN) have been proven to be immunoprotective in mouse models. However, little work has been conducted on in vivo immune responses in chicken with CpG ODN. The objective of this study was to investigate the immunoadjuvant effects of CpG ODN to Newcastle disease (ND) vaccine and its protective effects against ND virus in SPF chicken. In this report, the titre of serum IgG to ND vaccine and the proliferation of lymphocytes were monitored in SPF chickens. The results demonstrated that the above-mentioned immune responses were significantly stronger in chickens that received CpG ODN than in the birds that received only ND vaccine. Furthermore, ND vaccine plus CpG ODN protected SPF chicken from challenge with an otherwise lethal dose of ND virus. These data suggest that CpG ODN holds considerable promise as an adjuvant for future vaccines against ND virus.

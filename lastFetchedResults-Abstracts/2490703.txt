Production is one of the basic pillars of the economy, and accordingly examining the producers’ behavior and the Muslim producer’s objective function have always been amongst the important theoretical problems for Muslim economists.
Having the theories regarding Muslim producer’s behavior in mind and considering the hypothesis that maximizing private interest by Muslim producer is done with an eye to the religious standards and public interest, the present study tries to answer this question: What are the Muslim producer’s goals?
Thus, empirically studying the behavior of producers in Kermanshah and utilizing questionnaire and AHP method, the study has tried to rank the standards regarding the decision-making indices of the city’s producers. The results show that, on the one hand, private interest index plays a more important role in the producers’ decision-making than the index of God’s being satisfied and public interest, and on the other hand, the standards of decreasing the competitors’ profit, labor-intensive production and the scarcity of production factors have a more intense effect on the producers’ behavior and decision-making than those of paying taxes, giving complete information, not wasting production resources, increasing labor force’s wage, and production costs. One of the important findings is that the producers consider allocative efficiency, and paying attention to the private interests, if the public interests get threatened, they give up a part of their own interests for the sake of the society’s well-being.

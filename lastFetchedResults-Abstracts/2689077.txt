In this study, a single-stage pickup with zero-voltage turn-on to reduce the switching loss is proposed for parallel resonant compensated contactless power transmission systems (CPTS). A bidirectional switch composed of two back-to-back connected active switches is integrated to regulate the output voltage. The relationship between the output voltage and the duty ratio of the bidirectional switch is derived and verified. To evaluate the validity and performance of the proposed pickup circuit, a 500 W prototype CPTS is constructed. The experimental results show that the power conversion efficiency of the proposed pickup is about 95%. Moreover, compared with common two-stage pickup, the number of required passive components in the proposed topology is reduced. The resulted volume of proposed pickup is also reduced which is more suitable for space-limited applications.

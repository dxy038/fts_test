Quality of Experience (QoE) in the context of high definition IPTV represents a purely subjective measure from the userÂ´s perspective of the overall value of the service provided. QoE cannot be taken simply as objective quality parameter of the service, but must also take into consideration every factor that contributes to overall user service perception. This paper introduces typical challenges and approaches for QoE testing of HD IPTV services. We provide an overview of influence factors, with a special focus on content types and characteristics, and we provide decision criteria for selecting subjective testing methods for IPTV research studies. We furthermore highlight related key results and learnings from the ongoing European research project OptiBand.

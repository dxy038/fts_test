Objective: T lymphocytes and macrophages are considered essential components of the immune response. Many factors are known to influence the presence and distribution these cells in genital mucosa. This study investigated the effect of sexual intercourse on cervical intraepithelial T lymphocytes and macrophages in healthy uninfected women. Study design: Cervical intraepithelial samples were obtained with an endocervical brush from 31 women; the cervical T lymphocytes and macrophages were analyzed by flow cytometry. Eleven women with a history of last sexual intercourse at <3 days were compared against 20 women with last sexual intercourse of >3 days. Furthermore, cellular activation markers (CD69, CD25, HLA-DR) on T lymphocytes and costimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86) on macrophages were studied. Results: Women with last sexual intercourse at <3 days showed predominance of CD4+ T lymphocytes compared with women with last sexual intercourse of >3 days (P< .02); the numbers of macrophages were higher in the latter (P< .005). No difference was found in the density of T-lymphocyte activation and macrophage costimulatory markers between the two cohorts. Conclusion: Within cervical epithelium, the distribution of mononuclear leucocytes may be altered after coitus. The higher proportion of cervical intraepithelial CD4+ T cells that were observed in the early postcoital period suggests a mechanism by which the relative risk of the acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus infection is increased in women.

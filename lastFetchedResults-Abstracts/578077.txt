Osmoregulators or plant growth substances can play an important role in the development of salt tolerance in crops. Therefore, the main objective of the present study was investigating the role of osmoregulators or plant growth substances in counteracting the harmful effect of salinity (1.3, 5, 7.5 and 10 dSm-1) on pea plant. Salt stress up to 10 dSm-1 impaired pea plant growths by reducing plant height, leaves and stems dry weight, leaf area per plant and yield as well as its components. Application of either osmoregulators or plant growth substances in most cases increased significantly all growth and yield characteristics as compared with control plants or untreated plants under such salinity levels. This would suggest that the depressive effects of sodium chloride salt stress on pea growth and yield can be alleviated and/or modified to some extent, by presoaking seeds and spraying plants with appropriate concentrations of salicylic acid at 50 and 100 mg/l, calcium chloride at 2.5 and 5 mM or thiamin at 25 and 50 mg/l.

The objective of the current study was to
evaluate how the inclusion of 3 Sluggish Cognitive Tempo
(SCT) symptoms in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD) diagnostic criteria influences the external
validity of the ADHD subtypes. The sample comprised
228 children (166 boys, 62 girls) ranging in age from 5â€“
18 years who were referred to clinics for attentional,
behavioral, and/or learning problems and diagnosed with
DSM-IV ADHD (124 Combined type, 81 Inattentive type,
23 Hyperactive-Impulsive type). Parent ratings of ADHD
symptoms were obtained using the Emory Combined
Rating Scale (ECRS), which assesses symptoms of the
common DSM-IV childhood psychiatric disorders. Regression
analyses incorporating planned comparisons were
conducted to examine how the inclusion of SCT symptoms
affects differences among ADHD subtypes on several
external validity indicators (i.e., gender, age-of-onset, and
overlapping conditions). The regression analyses did not
yield any significant differences in gender ratios, mean ageof-
onset, or overlapping externalizing or internalizing
problems when the ADHD Inattentive type was subdivided
into high- versus low-SCT groups. In conclusion, the
current results suggest that the inclusion of parentreported
SCT symptoms in the ADHD diagnostic criteria
has limited utility for isolating diagnostically meaningful
subgroups of the Inattentive type or for enhancing the
external validity of the ADHD subtypes in clinic-referred
samples.

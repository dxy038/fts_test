In this paper, the Pre-emptive Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Project (PRCPSP) is considered. The paper mainly focuses on the problem 1_PRCPSP, where a maximum of one interruption per activity is allowed. A time-fragment linked-list method (TFLLM) is proposed to generate an effective solution for a given precedence-feasible activity list. Based on the TFLLM, an evolutionary algorithm is developed with the objective of makespan minimization. Computational experiments on the standard J30 and J60 sets show that the proposed algorithm can perform better than the compared approach in literature for the pre-emptive cases.

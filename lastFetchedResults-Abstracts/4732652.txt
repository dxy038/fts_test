In this contribution the behavior of an elderly couple, recorded by a radio module system in their own home is analyzed. There is an increasing interest in giving elderly people the possibility to live at their own homes as long as possible. Since diseases like dementia are diagnosed through the change of behavior, especially the activities of daily living (ADL), there is a growing need of an objective instrument for measuring behavioral changes. Therefore the Eventlogger was developed and installed for 32 days in a home of an elderly couple. Throughout this paper the outcome of the data collection as well as first steps for analyzing it will be discussed. Furthermore we were able to observe different routines of the diseased and the healthy person. The diseased proband follows a very strict routine whereas the healthy proband routines are dependent on different factors.

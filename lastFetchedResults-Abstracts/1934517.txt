This paper, which illustrates some results of the project SO.L.E.AGRI. (“Wood-energy chain sustainability in agricultural sector”) funded by Provincia di Siena and of the PRIN 2005–2006 “Study of the biomass-energy chains in Italy” funded by the Italian Ministry of Instruction, University and Research, highlights that the use of agricultural residuals as renewable energy source is economically and environmentally convenient.

ork firstly looks at the energy use of agricultural residuals harvested, and then it considers their packaging and supply management. The main objective of the production of the solid bio-fuels originated from pruning residuals is the reduction of harvesting and transport costs; therefore, experimental tests have been carried out in different farms using an innovative shredding machine that simultaneously permits harvesting, shredding and packaging of pruning residuals. These trials have been undertaken in olive groves and vineyards, on stony and hilly terrain. The machine has obtained good results under different operative conditions: intensive mechanisation of harvesting implies lower costs and simultaneous packaging assures a better organisation of the whole energy chain.

Objective
The lymph node is an integral component of the immune system and the major site of antigen-dependent lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation. Development of animal models possessing functional primary human lymph nodes will have a significant impact on research in lymphopoiesis and immune response. To date, successful transplantation of primary human lymph nodes in rodents has not yet been reported. This work was undertaken to develop a reliable methodology to engraft primary human fetal lymph nodes in immunodeficient mice.
Materials and Methods

Three different sets of parameters, including three different transplantation sites in the mice, two different strains of immunodeficient mice, and two different preconditioning regimens, were evaluated. The growth characteristics of the implanted primary human fetal lymph nodes were examined 3 months after transplantation by histologic, immunocytochemical, and flow cytometric methods.
Results

Transplantation of primary human fetal lymph nodes into subcutaneous pouches in the ears in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice preconditioned with etoposide reproducibly give rise to >80% engraftment. The engrafted primary human fetal lymph nodes undergo massive growth (>200-fold) and retain the same histology and cellular composition as fresh human fetal lymph nodes from the same donors.
Conclusions

We report, for the first time, the development of a reliable methodology to successfully engraft human fetal lymph node in SCID mice. The engrafted human lymph nodes are visible and accessible to experimental manipulations. This SCID-hu mouse model with human lymph node should provide a physiologically relevant system to investigate lymphopoiesis, immunologic response, and virus-mediated immunosuppression.

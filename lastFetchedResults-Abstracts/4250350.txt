Resources limitations and requirements and representing a lot of objectives, have made inevitable the necessity of applying optimal and efficient available capabilities in each organization. For this reason, ranking of goals along with organizational goals in each organization cannot be avoided and also most of successful companies pay more attention to this point. But in achieving this objective considering goals and the decision maker conditions is mandatory. Therefore, presenting a scientific solution and appropriate model that can satisfy the relations between goals and limitations seems to be necessary. In the complicated situation, considering all components and factors in decision-making obliges us to create a balance between goals and effective factors in achieving them. In this condition, not only all of the components and environmental variables cannot be considered one dimensionally, but also the best solution is considering all conditions and goals and making a decision in order to succeed in the desired utility of them. These problems have caused the nature of decision making include so many ambiguities, from the simplest to the most complicated affairs, and caused decisions to be taken in a fuzzy environment. As fuzzy logic has several applications in making decision in uncertain and fuzzy environments, this paper intends to model one of the strict and sophisticated decisions of managers using a mathematical model based on fuzzy inference system, that is, analysis and determining ranking of goals, from the available list in which the maximum use of available resources, considering the existing limitations, can be reached.

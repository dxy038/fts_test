 A relatively new management strategy for the treatment of voice disorders is the use of laryngeal (LB) and velopharyngeal biofeedback (VB). The main purpose of the present pilot study is to document the outcome of vocal and velopharyngeal performances after a well-defined LB and VB treatment. Four subjects were studied pretreatment (1 week before LB or VB treatment) and posttreatment (1 week after the LB or VB treatment). To measure and compare the effect of LB and VB, objective and subjective assessment techniques were used. Perceptual voice assessment included a perceptual rating of the voice using the GRBAS scale. Furthermore, the vocal quality in this population is modeled by means of the Dysphonia Severity Index. For the objective assessment of nasal resonance, the Nasometer and the Glatzel test were used. A perceptual evaluation of speech, the Gutzmann test, and the tests from Bzoch were used as subjective assessment techniques. Both patients selected for LB and VB treatment showed improvement of their performances. The resulting improvement, as measured by means of an objective approach, is in agreement with the perceived (auditory) improvement of voice and resonance. The use of LB and VB treatment in patients, especially in some subjects who are not responding to traditional voice or velopharyngeal therapy, must be encouraged.

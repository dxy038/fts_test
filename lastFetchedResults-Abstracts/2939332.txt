We present deterministic algorithms for integer sorting and on-line packet routing on arrays with reconfigurable optical buses. The main objective is to identify the mechanisms specific to this type of architecture which allow building efficient integer sorting, partial permutation routing and h-relations algorithms. The consequences of these results on PRAM simulations are also investigated

Most data mining algorithms and tools stop at discovered customer models, producing distribution information on customer profiles. Such techniques, when applied to industrial problems such as customer relationship management (CRM), are useful in pointing out customers who are likely attritors and customers who are loyal, but they require human experts to postprocess the mined information manually. Most of the postprocessing techniques have been limited to producing visualization results and interestingness ranking, but they do not directly suggest actions that would lead to an increase the objective function such as profit. Here, we present a novel algorithm that suggest actions to change customers from an undesired status (such as attritors) to a desired one (such as loyal) while maximizing objective function: the expected net profit. We develop these algorithms under resource constraints that are abound in reality. The contribution of the work is in taking the output from an existing mature technique (decision trees, for example), and producing novel, actionable knowledge through automatic postprocessing.

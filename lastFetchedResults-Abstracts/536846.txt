The objective of this paper is to develop an efficient P wave detection algorithm based on the morphologycharacteristics of arrhythmias using correlation and regression in ECG signal. Subjects for experiments included normalsubjects, patients with atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and patients with change of the artifactuale amplitude. Afterthe step of the detection of R peak using the pan- tompkins algorithm, the correlation and regression were utilized to calculatethe similarity factors between a studied P wave and the reference one. The correlation coefficient can indicate the kind ofarrhythmia diseases. The algorithm was tested using MIT-BIH arrhythmia database where every P wave was classified. Theresults are presented in terms of correlation coefficient. Then some parameters have been extracted in order to classify thearrhythmias. The correlation coefficient results of the system are 1,0.07 and â€“0.92 for normal beats, atrial fibrillation andchange of the artifactuale amplitude, respectively. The extracted parameters are closely similar to the expert values given bythe cardiologist. The results reveal that the system is accurate and efficient to detect and classify arrhythmias resulted fromatrial fibrillation or change of the artifactuale amplitude

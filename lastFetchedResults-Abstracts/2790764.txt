The main objective of this paper is to investigate the reliability of applying nano copper conductive ink in preparing RFID inlay. We employed anti-oxidation nano copper particles to prepare the conductive ink and used UV (Ultraviolet) light curing technique to form the conductive pattern of RFID passive antenna on polyimide (PI) film. The adhesion of the nano copper conductive ink on PI film was checked by cross cut tape test and the results showed 100% area of ink remaining on film. Thickness and conductivity of the printed antenna were evaluated by optic microscope and four probe method. The reading distance of RFID inlay can reach 3 meters measured by a UHF RFID reader, which is sufficient to meet the demand for most RFID applications. These results have proven that nano copper conductive ink has a potential for RFID application.

The objective of this work is to investigate the effect of an ultracapacitor/battery based hybrid energy storage system (HESS) in an electric vehicle (EV) prototype having a 200 km range. Global positioning system (GPS) data is used to enhance the HESS power-mix optimization in real-time, based on the relative position of stop signs and traffic signals. It is shown that the GPS information, which is already available in the car, is beneficial in managing the u-cap voltage and reducing the dynamic currents on the battery. Simulations comparing various power sharing algorithms show the superior performance of the GPS enhanced HESS control scheme, based on the experimental drive-cycle. It is shown that utilizing the GPS data in the power optimizer can reduce the batteryÂ´s peak charge current by 38% compared to a standard HESS.

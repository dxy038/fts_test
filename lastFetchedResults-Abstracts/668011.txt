The objective of this study was to evaluate the response of a suite of portable, real-time aerosol instruments to Diesel exhaust aerosol with and without a catalytic stripper (CS) to determine the change in response as a function of particle size and volatility. The response of the photoemission aerosol sensor (PAS) was strongly influenced by the physical and chemical nature of Diesel aerosol. The presence of a large, predominantly volatile nuclei mode, and/or the presence of volatile material on the surface of the solid carbonaceous agglomerates in the accumulation mode suppressed the PAS response. Removal of the volatile material by passage of the aerosol through the CS enhanced the response, and improved correlations between the PAS, the diffusion charger (DC) and the scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). Data on aerosol size distributions, number, volume, and surface area concentrations with and without the CS in the sample stream are reported.

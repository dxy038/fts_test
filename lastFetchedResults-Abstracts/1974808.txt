The objective of this work was to study the influence of superchilling storage methods, shell freezing and non-shell freezing on the location/distribution of ice crystals during the superchilled storage of salmon. Physical measurements, water holding capacity and drip loss were also studied. Non-shell frozen samples resulted in extracellular ice crystals. Shell frozen samples showed both intracellular and extracellular ice crystals with a uniform distribution. Liquid loss (LL) decreased with storage time in both superchilling storage methods. There was no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) in LL between shell and non-shell frozen samples. There was significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) in the drip loss between shell frozen samples (1.62% as maximum) and non-shell frozen samples (1.4% as maximum). The information on the characteristics of ice crystals (location/distribution), which has a strong influence on the quality of the final superchilled food, is a factor key for the manufacturing of products with desired quality and shelf life.

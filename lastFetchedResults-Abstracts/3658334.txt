Users of pipe cable have a strong economic incentive to space manholes as far apart as possible. To attain this objective, it is necessary to have accurate information on the stresses developed in each conductor during the pulling operation. This paper describes a novel method of measuring tension on each conductor at the pulling head and presents the results obtained in installing about 6 miles (9.7 km) of 1250-kcmil 115-kV pipe-type cable.

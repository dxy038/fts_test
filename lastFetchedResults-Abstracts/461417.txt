Background
Knowledge about gender risk factors associated with acquiring postoperative coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgical site infections (SSIs) is limited.
Objective

Our objective was to determine whether the incidence of SSIs during 30 days postsurgery was greater among females compared with males who undergo primary (first time) CABG.
Methods

A retrospective cohort study of 3878 patients who had primary CABG surgery between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1998, at a cardiovascular center in the American Southwest. Multivariate techniques were used to analyze outcome risk differences by gender.
Results

The nosocomial SSI incidence rate among 957 females was 10.56%; among 2921 males, it was 7.57%; relative risk (RR) was 1.39 (95% confidence interval: 1.12-1.75), and Mantel-Haenszel Ï‡2 test was 8.47 (P = .004). Four preoperative variables were independent predictors of acquiring SSI: female gender, diabetes, body mass index, and urgency of surgery.
Conclusion

Females were at greater risk for acquiring SSIs postprimary CABG surgery in this cohort. Also, preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative control of glucose levels in diabetics and preoperative reduction of weight in obese patients may help to reduce SSIs post-CABG surgery. More studies are needed to understand gender-associated risk of SSI after CABG surgery.

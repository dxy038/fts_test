Two different internal fixation techniques for closed displaced fractures of the olecranon were evaluated at a mean of 18 years after injury. Thirty-two of the patients received tension-band wiring, and 35 received figure-of-eight wiring. There were 41 women (mean age, 52 years) and 26 men (mean age, 32 years) included. The results revealed that 80% of the patients had no subjective complaints, 16% had occasional pain, and 4% had daily pain. Comparison of the injured and uninjured elbows demonstrated a 3° reduction of flexion (P &lt;.05) and a 5° loss of extension (P &lt;.01). More than 50% of the fractured elbows had degenerative changes (joint space narrowing, subchondral cysts, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophytes) (P &lt;.001), and 4 had osteoarthritis (P &lt;.05). No subjective, objective, or radiographic differences were found when the two techniques were compared. Removal of the hardware was performed in 81% of the patients with tension-band wiring and in 43% of the patients with figure-of-eight wiring (P &lt;.01). The figure-of-eight technique can, therefore, be recommended, as it is associated with less frequent secondary procedures for hardware removal. (J Shoulder Elbow Surg 2002;11:377-382)

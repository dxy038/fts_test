This paper deals with the Open-Pit-Mining Operational Planning problem with dynamic truck allocation. The objective is to optimize mineral extraction in the mines by minimizing the number of mining trucks used to meet production goals and quality requirements. According to the literature, this problem is NP-hard, so a heuristic strategy is justified. We present a hybrid algorithm that combines characteristics of two metaheuristics: Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedures and General Variable Neighborhood Search. The proposed algorithm was tested using a set of real-data problems and the results were validated by running the CPLEX optimizer with the same data. This solver used a mixed integer programming model also developed in this work. The computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm is very competitive, finding near optimal solutions (with a gap of less than 1%) in most instances, demanding short computing times.

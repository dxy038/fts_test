We present the plan for an extended expert-system &#8220;front end&#8221; or design advisor for implementing systems (DAIS) for use in conjunction with a commercial digital control system environment, e.g., the Elsag Bailey INFI 90 System. The objective of DAIS is to make it substantially easier for applications engineers to make effective use of the broad spectrum of capabilities of this and similar hardware and software systems for industrial controls implementation. This concept is of quite general applicability for industrial controls environments. The extensions are primarily focused on handling multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) systems. This should greatly enhance the value of DAIS in modern process control applications

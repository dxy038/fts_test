Search advertising is one of the most important forms of electronic commerce. While click-through rates are considered a key measure of search advertising effectiveness by search providers, brand attention can also be a valuable objective. Our paper reports on an experiment that investigated how search advertisement placement affected search usersâ€™ brand recall and recognition. The results showed that semantically associated search ads generated significantly higher levels of brand attention than contextually associated ones. Significant interaction effects were found among search ad position, keyword association, and search result quality. Implications for decision makers are discussed.

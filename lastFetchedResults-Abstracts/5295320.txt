In this study, we propose a tabu search algorithm for solving the task scheduling problem in peer-to-peer networking system. The communication costs for given tasks are considered in the proposed algorithm. The operating sequences among tasks are also discussed, which make the problem more realistic. The objective is to minimize the completion time of all tasks. Experimental results on several random generated cases verified the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

The main objective of this research was to develop a convenient and effective method for the synthesis of inorganic fullerene-like disulfide tungsten (IF-WS<sub>2</sub>) nanoparticles via a horizontal tubular quartz reactor. Subsequently, the produced IF-WS<sub>2</sub> particles were characterized utilizing XRD and TEM. A facile route for fabricating IF-WS<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles was presented by the reaction of sulfur powder (S) and as prepared WO<sub>3</sub> nanoparticles in a hydrogen atmosphere at a heating temperature of 850 degC. The as-synthesized IF-WS<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles are almost of closed hollow cage structure with an average size of about 55 nm. The possible growth mechanism of obtaining IF-WS<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles is believed to be controlled by an outside-in process. This strategy provides a low cost, large-scale method for the synthesis of WS<sub>2</sub>, and may become a general method for the synthesis of transition metal dichalcogenides.

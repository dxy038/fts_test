Introduction: A combination of Propofol and Fentanyl is used as a method for inducing general
anesthesia. Although Propofol is widely used for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia,
it has a significant effect on reducing arterial blood pressure. It has been suggested that
Calcium Gluconate, when administered simultaneously with Propofol, may reduce the inotrope
negative effect of Propofol on heart function.
Objective: To determine the effect of Calcium Gluconate in decreasing the negative effect of
Propofol.
Materials and Methods: This randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial divided 70
patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) into two groups:
Group A (Calcium Gluconate) and Group B (placebo). Each patient was injected with Fentanyl
(4 ?g/kg), Pancuronium (0.1 mg/kg), and Propofol (1.5 mg/kg) within 60 seconds via a central
vein line. Calcium Gluconate (30 mg/kg) and saline (placebo) were administered to Group A
and Group B, respectively. Homodynamic data were obtained at baseline (T0), 4 minutes after
anesthesia induction (T1), and 2 minutes after tracheal intubation (T2). The data were analyzed
using descriptive statistics, repeated measurement, and T tests; a p value  <  0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results: The mean and SD of mean arterial pressure at T0 was 101.11±13.63 for Group A and
107.142±14.59 for Group B (non-significant). These figures for T1 (4 minutes after anesthesia
induction) and T2 (2 minutes after tracheal intubation) were 70.14 ± 14.67 and 80.22±23.29 for
Group A and 72.05±15.45 and 82.42±14.86 for Group B (non-significant).
Conclusion: The findings of this research indicated no differences between the two groups.
Calcium Gluconate appeared to exert no impact on reducing the negative effect of Propofol.

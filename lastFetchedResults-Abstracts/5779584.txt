Most existing routing protocols for wireless sensor networks have energy efficiency as their main objective. But for WSN systems in which various types of data coexist, a different QoS (quality of service) metric is required. We describe a mission-oriented selective routing scheme that runs on each node of a network and invokes different algorithms for data of different priority, so as to determine a route which meets the objectives of each priority level in terms of path delay, energy consumption and reliability. Scalability and mobility are achieved by employing a localized routing method which only requires geographic information about the host node and its adjacent neighbors. Simulation results confirm that our scheme can meet the objectives of each priority level effectively.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the abortifacient effect of intravaginally administered moistened misoprostol tablets with that of the combination regimen of mifepristone and oral misoprostol. Study Design: One hundred women at ≤56 days’ gestation received 800 μg misoprostol intravaginally in the form of sodium chloride solution–moistened tablets. The dose was repeated 24 hours later if a gestational sac persisted on ultrasonographic examination. These 100 subjects (group 1) were then matched with 100 subjects who had received 600 mg mifepristone followed by 400 μg misoprostol orally as part of a large multicenter American trial (group 2). Subjects were monitored for abortion success, adverse side effects, and bleeding characteristics. Abortion failure was defined as persistence of an intrauterine sac or the need to perform a surgical evacuation of the uterus for hemorrhage, for incomplete abortion, or at the subject’s request. Results: In 88 of the 100 women in group 1 and 94 of the 100 women in group 2, abortion occurred and a surgical procedure was not required. Abortion rates were not influenced by gestational age in either group. Prostaglandin-related side effects of fever and chills, vomiting, diarrhea, and uterine pain were all significantly higher in group 1. Excessive uterine bleeding was uncommon in both groups, and no subjects received blood transfusions. Conclusion: The abortion rate with intravaginally administered moistened misoprostol tablets is similar to that with the combination of mifepristone and oral misoprostol. However, intravaginal administration of misoprostol is associated with significantly more prostaglandin-related side effects. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:1386-91.)

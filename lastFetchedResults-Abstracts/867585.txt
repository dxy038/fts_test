Two of the most realistic assumptions in the field of scheduling are the consideration of setup and transportation
times. In this paper, we study the flexible flowshop scheduling where setup times are anticipatory
sequence-dependent and transportation times are job-independent. We also assume that there are
several transporters to carry jobs. The objective is to minimize total weighted tardiness. We first formulate
the problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. With this, we solve small-sized
instances to optimality. Since this problem is known to be NP-hard, we then propose an effective metaheuristic
to tackle large-sized instances. This metaheuristic, called electromagnetism algorithm (EMA),
originates from the attractionâ€“repulsion mechanism of the electromagnetism theory. We conduct a series
of experiments and complete statistical analyses to evaluate the performance of the proposed MILP
model and EMA. On a set of instances, we first tune the parameters of EMA. Then, the efficiency of the
model and general performance of the proposed EMA are assessed over a set of small-sized instances.
To further evaluate EMA, we compare it against two high performing metaheuristics existing in the literature
over a set of large-sized instances. The results demonstrate that the proposed MILP model and
EMA are effective for this problem.

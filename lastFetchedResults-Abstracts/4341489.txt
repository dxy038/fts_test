A new type of power MOSFET called super junction MOSFET has been introduced. This new power MOSFET presents an interesting behavior in terms of a R<sub>DS(on)</sub> reduction for the same silicon area allowing fabrication of high voltage devices. Additionally, a reduction in the parasitic capacitances, improving the commutation characteristics, have been observed. Thus, this new power MOSFET could replace the traditional device in different power converter applications like power supplies (SMPS) or power factor correction applications. The objective of this paper is to explore the switching characteristics and to present a comparison of this new device SJ-MOSFET with the conventional power MOSFET under different operating conditions using special test circuits.

An economically optimal operation of batch diafiltration processes is studied. The processes are characterized by complex membrane transport models that adequately describe non-ideal membrane characteristics of real-life systems. We consider the optimization criterion which comprises two conflicting objectives, a minimization of processing time and a minimization of solvent consumption. The problem is treated in the multi-objective form in order to investigate the impact of operational cost factors on optimal operation policy. Thanks to the application of PontryaginÂ´s minimum principle (PMP), we find the economically optimal operation of studied process in the analytical form. Developed methodology is applied to two case studies taken from literature.

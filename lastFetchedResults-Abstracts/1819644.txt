Objective
m of this study was to characterize the tooth phenotype of CSF-1-deficient op/op mice and determine whether expression of csCSF-1 in these mice has a role in primary tooth matrix formation.

lasts and odontoblasts, isolated from wt/wt frozen sections using laser capture microdissection, were analysed for csCSF-1, sCSF-1 and CSF-1R mRNA by RT-PCR. Mandibles, excised from 8 days op/op and wt/wt littermates, were examined for tooth morphology as well as amelogenin and DMP1 expression using in situ hybridisation. op/opCS transgenic mice, expressing csCSF-1 in teeth and bone using the osteocalcin promoter, were generated. Skeletal X-rays and histomorphometry were performed; teeth were analysed for morphology and matrix proteins.
s
 dental cells in vivo express both CSF-1 isoforms and CSF-1R. Compared to wt/wt, op/op teeth prior to eruption showed altered dental cell morphology and dramatic reduction in DMP1 transcripts. op/opCS mice showed marked resolution of osteopetrosis, tooth eruption and teeth that resembled amelogenesis imperfecta-like phenotype. At 3 weeks, op/op teeth showed severe enamel and dentin defects and barely detectable amelogenin and DMP1. In op/opCS mice, DMP1 in odontoblasts increased to near normal and dentin morphology was restored; amelogenin also increased. Enamel integrity improved in op/opCS, although it was thinner than wt enamel.
sions
s demonstrate that ameloblasts and odontoblasts are a source and potential target of CSF-1 isoforms in vivo. Expression of csCSF-1 within the tooth microenvironment is essential for normal tooth morphogenesis and may provide a mechanism for coordinating the process of tooth eruption with endogenous matrix formation.

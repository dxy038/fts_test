This letter demonstrates bidirectional transmissions of 320 Gb/s (160 Gb/s per direction) over metropolitan networks using linear optical amplifiers (LOAs) as bidirectional inline amplifiers. The bidirectional transmissions resulted in 18.5 dB (of worst) Q factor over three spans of 40-km single-mode fiber, and 17.6 dB over four spans, thus, proving the feasibility of the LOAs as the bidirectional amplifiers.

Objective
This study was undertaken to compare the quality of life (QoL) in women with early stage endometrial cancer treated with 2 different surgical approaches.
Study design
Eighty-four women with clinical stage I endometrial cancer were enrolled in a prospective randomized controlled trial design and treated with laparoscopic or laparotomic approach. Another 40 women matched for demographic characteristics were studied as controls. In patients, before and after surgery, and in their matched controls, QoL was evaluated by using the Short-Form Healthy Survey (SF-36) and the climacteric symptoms using the Kupperman Index (KI).
Results
After randomization, no difference was detected in data recorded between the groups. At entry, QoL was similar in both treatment groups but significantly (P< .05) worse in comparison with controls. Throughout the study, QoL was significantly (P< .05) higher in laparoscopic group versus laparotomic group. After KI adjustment our data did not change.
Conclusion
In early stage endometrial cancer, the laparoscopic approach provides significant benefits compared with laparotomy in terms of QoL.

Four types of relationship between support activities and support equipment (i.e., 1:1, 1:N, N:1, and N:M) were considered in the model and the adapted genetic algorithm (AGA) was chosen to obtain the model´s solution because of AGA´s excellent performance in global and local search. The proposed model was proved via a case study, and it could improve the allocation efficiency of the support equipments, and provide a solid approach for support equipment optimizing in the design and development phase.

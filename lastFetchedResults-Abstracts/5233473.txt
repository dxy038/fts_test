The objective of this research is to design and develop the dynamics and kinematics simulation software for robot education purpose. The dynamic models of robots and controllers are composed of, six types of robot and PID-controller. The kinematics model to consider Forward kinematics based on Denavit-Hartenberg Transformation. MATLAB software is applied for creating graphical user interface allowing users to choose different kinds of simulation components (robots and controllers parameters) to be simulated. Furthermore, ROBOSIM2 is used together with MATLAB in order to display the output in three dimensional graphics based on the chosen parameters from users. The testing results can be used to analyze the robot interface and controllers. In addition, the kinematics analysis in software can be applied to robot design study.

Principal objective of this paper is to form the ISAR image of a complex target using 76GHz long range radar (LRR). Modeling of point target is done and the idea is extended to model a complex target (vehicle). Simulation is performed in MATLAB platform. The sample points are generated using Graphical User Interface (GUI) of MATLAB. These sample points are processed using Nearest Neighbor Approximation interpolation technique. This ISAR imaging can be used for object classification and will be applicable to intelligent transportation systems (ITS) for adaptive cruise control (ACC) and hence to avoid collision.

Objective(s): Studies have confirmed that microgravity, as a mechanical factor, influences both differentiation and function of mesenchymal stem cells. Here we investigated the effects of simulated microgravity on neural differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). Materials and Methods: We have used a fast rotating clinostat (clinorotation) to simulate microgravity condition. Real-time PCR and flow cytometry analysis were used to evaluate the regulation of neurotrophins, their receptors, and neural markers by simulated microgravity and their impact on neural differentiation of cells. Results: Our data revealed that simulation microgravity up-regulated the expression of MAP-2, BDNF, TrkB, NT-3, and TrkC both before and after neural differentiation. Also, the neural cells derived from ADSCs in microgravity condition expressed more MAP-2, GFAP, and synaptophysin protein in comparison to the 1G control. Conclusion: We showed that simulated microgravity can enhance the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into neurons. Our findings provide a new strategy for differentiation of ADSCs to neural-like cells and probably other cell lineages. Meanwhile, microgravity simulation had no adverse effects on the viability of the cells and could be used as a new environment to successfully manipulate cells.

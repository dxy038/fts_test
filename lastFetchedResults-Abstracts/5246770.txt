The objective of this paper is to propose efficient content control scheme in the home network based on UPnP. To share and control contents efficiently, we propose virtual media server for distributed multimedia contents. To access specific content, a user needs to know the media server´s name or location. However by using our proposed server, a user can access the content without any awareness of media server´s location or name, because virtual media server provides integrated information such as available media servers, content grouping, etc. This virtual media server is a logical media server, which doesn´t have any storage spaces, but it is handled like general media server by other devices of the network. This paper will present the scheme and implementation of the proposed virtual media server between local area network such as home, office and campus.

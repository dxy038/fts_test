Coverage quality of targets is one of the most significant criteria for some applications such as surveillance and environmental monitoring. Cost is also an important factor for the coverage problem in visual sensor networks. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate a novel coverage problem by considering both cost and coverage quality. To accomplish this purpose, firstly a criterion for the coverage quality of visual sensors is defined with regard to the attributes of lens of their camera. Then, considering cost and quality objective functions, Max-Quality Min-Cost Selection problem (MQMCS) is addressed and formulated as a bi-objective programming. Finally, two centralized and distributed algorithms that with a high probability can find a cover set with the maximum coverage quality and the minimum number of sensors are proposed.

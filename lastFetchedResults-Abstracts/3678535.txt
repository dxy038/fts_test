Two types of commutation signaling for combating multipath are introduced: <img alt="M \\times N" src="/images/tex/3148.gif"/> signaling, in which the signal set cycles successively among <img alt="N" src="/images/tex/88.gif"/> different sets of <img alt="M" src="/images/tex/49.gif"/> sigals each; and <img alt="M + N" src="/images/tex/3149.gif"/> signaling, in which the signal set at any time consists of <img alt="M" src="/images/tex/49.gif"/> members of an alphabet of <img alt="M + N" src="/images/tex/3149.gif"/> signals, <img alt="N" src="/images/tex/88.gif"/> of which are inactive at any epoch. In both cases, the objective is to remove from use any signal sent recently enough that it is still "ringing" in the multipath channel. We consider the problems of minimization of <img alt="M" src="/images/tex/49.gif"/> and <img alt="N" src="/images/tex/88.gif"/> , hence the total number signals used; analysis of <img alt="2 \\times N" src="/images/tex/3150.gif"/> sets ( <img alt="M = 2" src="/images/tex/3151.gif"/> is almost uniformly optimal); analysis of the simplest <img alt="M + N" src="/images/tex/3149.gif"/> set, i.e., a 2 + 1 set; and presentation of the results of simulation of <img alt="M \\times N" src="/images/tex/3148.gif"/> and <img alt="M + N" src="/images/tex/3149.gif"/> signaling through realistic urban/suburban radio channels. Comparison of these simulations to simulations of other antimultipath techniques is also made. The simulation results are due to Kamil [3].

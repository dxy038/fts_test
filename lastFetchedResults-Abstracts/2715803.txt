This paper presents a novel topology for the generation of adjustable frequency and magnitude pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) three-phase ac from a balanced three-phase ac source with a high-frequency ac link. The proposed single-stage power electronic transformer (PET) with bidirectional power flow capability may find application in compact isolated PWM ac drives. This topology along with the proposed control has the following advantages: 1) input power factor correction; 2) common-mode voltage suppression at the load end; 3) high-quality output voltage waveform (comparable with conventional space vector PWM); and 4) minimization of output voltage loss, common-mode voltage switching, and distortion of the load current waveform due to leakage inductance commutation. A source-based commutation of currents associated with energy in leakage inductance (termed as leakage energy) has been proposed. This results in soft-switching of the output-side converter and recovery of the leakage energy. The entire topology along with the proposed control scheme has been analyzed. The simulation and experimental results verify the analysis and advantages of the proposed PET.

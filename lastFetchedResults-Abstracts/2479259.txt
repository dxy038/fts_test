<div><p align="left">Accidents and their resulting losses are one of the critical public health issues. Identification the near misses offer the opportunity to improve safety by developing effective prevention approach. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of two types of intervention in increasing the participation of first line managers in reporting near misses. In order to increase the participation, the Green Card System (GCS) was implemented. After preliminary studies, in order to increase the participation rate, the decision was taken to implement the intervention program. In this program, first line managers were divided into two groups. For the control group, the bonus was increased to double whereas, for the experimental group, in addition to the two-fold increasing remuneration (bonus), appropriate feedback and actions carried out in the context of reported near misses, were presented through regular collaborative meetings. The results showed that six months after the stop of the intervention, the rate of participation in both groups showed a significant increase. After 18 months of intervention, the participation trend in both groups was downward. However, this reduction was only significant in the control group. The findings highlight the long-term effects of the intervention of financial payments along with providing appropriate feedback. <strong></strong></p></div>

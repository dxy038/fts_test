Bottleneck in the production system has become an important factor to achieve the objective. How to deal with bottleneck resource utilization, load balance and reasonable arrangement for the production tasks has become one of the main tasks for production scheduling research. More and More enterprises and scholars are concerned about bottleneck production. So bottleneck identification has become the key to study the production scheduling problem. On the basis of literature study, this paper summarized methods of bottleneck identification available. Unlike the exiting intuitive methods, this paper make the bottleneck identification model based on the shortest delay time of completing the job, and use the genetic algorithm to solve the model to determine the bottleneck. The case shows that this approach can calculate overflow load of each machine and meet the delivery of each workpiece, thus effectively identify the bottleneck.

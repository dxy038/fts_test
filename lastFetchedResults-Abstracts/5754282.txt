This paper firstly points out the concept of the service supply chain of port. With the content and features it included being analyzed, reasonable performance indexes are selected to set up a system of service supply chain of port. Then a grey relational analysis model based on entropy weight is presented. For this part, entropy method is used for empowering the performance evaluation indicators of port service supply chain, and thus the port service supply chain performance is evaluated. Entropy method combined with the grey relational analysis reduces the influences of subjective factors and improves the objectivity and accuracy of evaluation results. At last, combining with specific case, this paper verifies the validity and applicability of the model. Our results provide relative scientific and objective basis for decision-makers.

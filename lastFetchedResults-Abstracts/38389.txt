The objective of the study was to develop a simple, cheap and reliable system to investigate boom movements on a standard test track and under field conditions. A series of tests was conducted in the laboratory to investigate the accuracy of measurement and the reliability of such a system based on potentiometric transducers in comparison with a very precise and sophisticated infrared-ultrasonic system. The correspondence between the data of the two systems justifies the adoption of the transducer system for the inspection of boom movements under field conditions.

Preeclampsia is a common (not, vert, similar7% of all pregnancies) disorder of human pregnancy in which the normal hemodynamic response to pregnancy is compromised. Despite many years of intensive research, the pathogenesis of preeclampsia is still not fully understood. The objective of the present study was to investigate the concentration of coenzyme Q10 in normal pregnancy and preeclampsia. Pregnant women (n = 18), women with preeclampsia (n = 12), and nonpregnant normotensive women (n  = 22) were included. Plasma levels of coenzyme Q10 were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Plasma coenzyme Q10 levels were significantly higher in normal pregnant women (mean = 1.08, SEM = 0.08 umol/l; p < .005) in comparison to nonpregnant women (mean = 0.86, SEM = 0.16 umol/l) and women with preeclampsia (mean = 0.7, SEM = 0.03 umol/l; p  < .0001). These results demonstrated that during preeclampsia there is a significant decrease in plasma levels of coenzyme Q10 compared to normal pregnant women, and compared to those who are not pregnant.

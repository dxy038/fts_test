The increasing popularity of online social networks (OSNs) has been transforming the dissemination pattern of social video contents. Considering the unique features of social videos, e.g., huge volume, long-tailed, and short length, how to utilize the information propagation pattern to improve the efficiency of content distribution for social videos attracts more and more attention. In this paper, we first conduct a large scale measurement to explore the social video viewing behavior under the community classification. Based on the measurement, we investigate the community driven sharing video distribution problem under the cloud-centric content delivery network (CDN) architecture. In particular, we formulate it as a constrained optimization problem with the objective to minimize the operational cost. The constraint is the averaged transmission delay. Following that, we propose a dynamic algorithm to seek the optimal solution. Our trace-driven experiments further demonstrate our algorithm can make a better tradeoff between monetary cost and QoS, and outperforms the traditional method with less operational cost while satisfying the QoS requirement.

detect any mental health problem among them. The aim of this study was to determine the
condition of mental health and health promoting behaviors among elder people in Hamadan.
Materials & Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. By multistage sampling method, 400
participants over 60 years old were selected randomly. Data-gathering device was a
questionnaire with 2-parts of General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) used to measure mental
health condition and a check-list for measuring health promoting behaviors. Descriptive
statistics (mean, variance and percentage) and One-way analysis of variance and t-test were
used to compare average rate of psychical health in subjects.
Results: According to the cut off point of GHQ-28 that was 23, respondents were divided into
psychiatrically deranged ones (42%, n = 168) and noncases (58%, n = 232). There was seen a
statistically significant difference in mental health condition based on gender, education level,
economic status, marriage status and family structure (P < 0.001). Also the results showed that
there was statistically significant relationship between mental health and smoking, doing
exercise, drinking alcohol, eating fruit and vegetable, physical health condition and
controlling blood pressure(P < 0.05).

their mental health can be threated easily. Due to the relationship between mental health and
health promoting behaviors, authorities are recommended to identify the psychological
factors, both facilitating and prohibiting factors, associated with these behaviors.

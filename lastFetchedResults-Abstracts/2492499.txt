The rehabilitation of sandy desertified land in various dryland ecosystems by different management practices has a great potential to increase aggregate stability and improve soil quality. However, plants in general may have a different ability to sustain soil. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of practices including Haloxylonammodendron and Atriplexcanescens plantation on some soil properties, soil erodibility and the relationships between soil properties and erodibility index in desertified land of Jupar in Kerman Province, South Eastof Iran. According to the research objectives, 24 soil samples from 0-20 cm depth were taken from each area, i.e. reclamation sites and control area (untreated land) using a systematic â€“ random method. Soil properties such as soil texture, structure, pH, EC, CaCO3, gypsum, bulk density, organic carbon and soil organic matter were measured. The mean weight diameter (MWD) and geometric mean diameter (GMD) were used as soil erodibility indices. The results of our study showed that MWD had positive correlation with organic carbon, CaCO3 and soil acidity values. Furthermore, according to the effect of Haloxylon on aggregate stability and its positive role in modifying soil physical and chemical properties, and also the height of this species, which can contribute to wind erosion control in this area, we conclude that Haloxylonammodendron has better performance in desert rehabilitation and sandy land stabilization in Jupar area than Atriplexcanescens.

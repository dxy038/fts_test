The need for business processes to fulfill multiple business objectives simultaneously is paramount to the overall success of the business. In earlier papers, authors introduced the basic principles of process decomposition using business objectives as the guiding business criteria. In this paper, these principles have been complemented by a comprehensive mapping of workflow patterns to objectives patterns to enable business process design to be guided by business objectives. The objectives patterns are based on the "value-focused thinking" framework that enables identification and structuring of multi-objective decisions. The process patterns are based on the generic patterns and are illustrated using event-driven process chains (EPC) workflow language. The mapping enables intelligent decision support for process engineering through synchronized decomposition of business process and objectives and.

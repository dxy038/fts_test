Water balance of Swamp Mahogany (Eucalyptus robusta Sm.) and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana Kunth var. Callide) plantations was studied in large experimental plots, which were irrigated with secondary treated sewage effluent. The tree plots designated as T10, T20, T30 and T40 received four different nitrogen (N) concentrations of 10, 20, 30 and 40 mg/l, respectively. The grass plot designated as G30 received one N level (30 mg/l). The objective of the study was to compare growth and water use of these plantations and the possible effluent losses to the environment.

There was little response to N treatment in the first year of tree growth. A significant response to high N concentration was observed in tree treatment plots in the second year of the growth. Thus, at 20 month stage, the T40 trees reached a height of 4.1 m and had a leaf area index (LAI) of 2.5 compared with 2.2 m and 1.6, respectively in T10 trees. As expected, the T40 treatment had the largest interception losses (10%) and the least runoff and interflow. There was a progressive decrease in runoff and interflow with reductions in the level of nitrogen applied.

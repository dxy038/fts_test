Objective To describe symptom dimensions
of psychosis using detailed psychopathological
information from epidemiologically defined incident
cases which include the full spectrum of functional
psychosis across all age ranges. Then, assess the
comparative usefulness of the dimensional and categorical
representations of psychosis in discriminating
between demographic and pre-morbid risk factors.
Method A total of 464 incident cases of psychosis
assessed with OPCRIT (Operational Checklist for
Psychotic Symptoms) were included in an exploratory
factor analysis. Using Regression analyses we modelled
the associations of the dimensional and categorical
representations of psychosis with antecedent
validating variables and compared the subsequent
models using the likelihood ratio test. Results Factor
analysis produced five-symptom dimensions, manic,
disorganisation, depressive, delusional and auditory
hallucinatory symptoms, explaining 58% of the total
variance. Different dimensions were differentially
associated with the pre-morbid risk factors. Neither
the dimensional nor the categorical representations
on their own were sufficient to explain associations
with the antecedent validating variables. Conclusion
Neither the dimensional or the diagnostic representation
of psychosis was superior in
discriminating between known risk factors, combining
dimensional measures with categorical diagnoses
will probably be more informative in determining the
causes and correlates of psychosis.

An attempt is made to implement the objective analysis of Cressmann for some fields including sea level pressure, temperature and geopotential height at standard levels in an operational framework. The work presented here is a part of a complete automatic system for decoding, quality control and analysis of meteorological maps. The results are compared with the subjectively analyzed maps and are in good agreement. It is shown that the output of a numerical weather prediction model with 2.5° and 5° horizontal resolution as the background field and 1200 km and 2500 km as the radius of influence for the surface and upper air analysis respectively give the best results.

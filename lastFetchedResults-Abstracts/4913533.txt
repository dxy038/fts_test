Due to increasing concern over global climate change, renewable energy sources, particularly wind turbine based generation systems are gaining more attention to meet the targets of emissions reduction. Combined economic load dispatch (ELD) and economic emission dispatch (EED) involves the simultaneous optimization of fuel cost and emission (CEED). This bi-objective CEED problem is converted into a single objective function by introducing a price penalty factor (PPF) approach. In this paper, Swarm Intelligence (SI) methods such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), artificial bee colony (ABC) and an elitist´s artificial bee colony (EABC) are applied to solve CEED problem. The results are compared by considering ten and forty unit systems having non-linear cost function and valve-point effects. In addition suitable amount of wind power penetration is considered in both cases. It is demonstrated that the results obtained by applying elitist´s artificial bee colony (EABC) algorithm are better than other two methods.

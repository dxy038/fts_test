The approach to biochar carbon sequestration from crop residues and forestry wastes offer a possibility to turn biomass management into a carbon-negative industry, by right of its long storage time and high carbon content in plant biomass. This approach is under development and is currently considered as an attractive candidate for inclusion in the global carbon market. This paper analyzes the necessity of biochar research in Chinese low-carbon economy. Our analysis shows from the perspectives of emission reductions, biochar compound fertilizer, and soil amendments that biochar carbon sequestration is an effective approach to ameliorate the ecological environment, accelerate agriculture and rural economy development. Additionally, when it comes to the application prospect of biochar on carbon-trading schemes, the support for biochar research and development must be strengthened at the national level, for it not only has environmental, ecological, economic, and social significances, but also is in line with the strategic objective of sustainable development of the country.

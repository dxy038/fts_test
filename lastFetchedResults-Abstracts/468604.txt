Objective: This study was undertaken to determine the point prevalence of psychiatric disorders during the second trimester of pregnancy in a population-based sample of pregnant women. Study Design: Participants were 1795 consecutive pregnant women attending routine ultrasound screening at two obstetric clinics in Northern Sweden during 1 year. The Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) was used for evaluating. Results: Overall, 1734 (96.6%) of the women filled in the PRIME-MD patient questionnaire. Psychiatric disorders were present in 14.1% of the women. Major depression was prevalent in 3.3% of patients and minor depression in 6.9% of patients. Anxiety disorders were encountered in 6.6% of patients. Women with psychiatric disorders displayed significantly more somatic symptoms and more pronounced fear of childbirth. Among diagnosed patients, only 5.5% had some form of treatment. Conclusion: The prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders in this unselected population of pregnant women was high and the majority of the women were found to be undiagnosed and untreated.

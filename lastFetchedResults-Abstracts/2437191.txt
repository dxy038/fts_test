Supplier selection problem is a multi-criteria decision making problem which includes both qualitative and quantitative factors. In the selection process many criteria may conflict with each other, therefore decision-making process becomes complicated. In this paper, we propose a compensatory fuzzy approach to solve multi-objective linear supplier selection problem with multiple-item (MLSSP-MI) by using Werners’ “fuzzy and” (μand) operator. The compromise solutions obtained by using “fuzzy and” (μand) operator are both compensatory and strongly efficient for our MLSSP-MI. To our knowledge, combining compensatory (μand) operator with MLSSP-MI has not been published up to now. Our compensatory fuzzy approach was explained on a case study.

The objective of this paper is to elucidate novel applications where the low frequency component of a background signal (haze) level of a wafer inspection tool can be used to qualitatively analyze different epitaxial processes. During initial epitaxial development cycles, a fast method of qualifying the growth runs is required. While SEM inspections can sub-sample the wafer, a semi-quantitative way of qualifying growth can be immensely helpful to quicken up the process. In this paper we monitor the epitaxial growth of Ge (heteroepi&#770;taxial) and SiGe strain relaxed buffer layers (SRB approach) with haze.

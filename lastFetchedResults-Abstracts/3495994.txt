The problem of selecting a set of paths to optimize the performance of a combinational circuit is studied, assuming that gate resizing and buffer insertion are the two possible optimizing techniques for reducing the delay of a circuit. The objective of the path selection problem is to select as small as possible a set of paths to ease the optimization processing to guarantee that the delay of the circuit is no longer than a given threshold &#964; if the delays of all the selected paths are no longer than &#964;. It is shown that the path selection is different from path sensitization. An input vector-oriented path selection algorithm is proposed. Because it may be infeasible for complex circuits with many primary inputs, a path-oriented algorithm is also developed and implemented. Experimental results on ISCAS85 benchmark circuits show a potentially big improvement for the optimization process

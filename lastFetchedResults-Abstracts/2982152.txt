This paper considers the design of a switched beam linear array in which two beams with specified shapes, a narrow beam and a wide beam, are to be produced. The goal of the design effort is to determine a set of complex excitation coefficients such that switching between beams is accomplished by changes in the phase weights alone. Three approaches are presented each of which uses Genetic Algorithm Optimization for at least a portion of the design task. The three approaches are 1) sequential design of narrowbeam pattern followed by widebeam design, 2) sequential design of widebeam followed by narrowbeam and 3) simultaneous widebeam/narrowbeam design. It is discovered that much better results are yielded by simultaneous, multi-objective optimization based design using GA instead of sequential GA optimization for the narrow and wide beam cases individually. Design results are presented

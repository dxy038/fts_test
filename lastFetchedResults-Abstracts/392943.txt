Objective
To find the effective maneuver of a positional test.
Methods
We performed three different maneuvers of a positional test in 86 vertiginous patients in supine-lying position in the following order: (1) “body-only maneuver”: a patient turned only his body to one side while keeping his head still; (2) “head-only maneuver”: a patient turned only his head to one side while keeping the body still; (3) “head-and-body maneuver”: a patient turned his head and body together to one side. Eye movement during the whole procedure was recorded by two-dimensional electronystagmography.
Results
Nystagmus provocation rates were 9% in “body-only maneuver”, 16% in “head-only maneuver”, and 33% in “head-and-body maneuver”.
Conclusion
The positional test in which patient turned his head and body together proved most effective.

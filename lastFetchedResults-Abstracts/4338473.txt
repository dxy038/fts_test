In practical power system, there exist two critical nonlinear factors, e.g., the valve limit on the governor and the generation rate constraints (GRC). In this paper, the distributed model predictive control (DMPC) based on T-S fuzzy model is presented. The valve limit on the governor is modeled by a T-S model so that the local predictive controllers are incorporated into the nonlinear control system. And DMPC is employed to tackle with the GRC problem. The model of the whole system is decomposed into subsystems and then obtains a local objective for each subsystem. The proposed methodology is tested with a four-area interconnected power system. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

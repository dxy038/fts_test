Describes results obtained in a propagation measurements program currently being carried out in Brazil. The experiments objective is to obtain statistics of propagation data relevant to terrestrial digital radio systems design. The results are being used in the planning of 144 Mbit/s, 16 QAM and 64 QAM digital radio relay networks by the Brazilian Administration. The multipath fading occurrence factor and two-ray model parameters, namely the maximum fading depth and the relative delay between rays, are being continuously measured and recorded in ten line-of-sight analog radio links of Brazilian Communications Network. A set-up based on the Taylor and Shafi (1983) method has been selected due to its simplicity, since the measurements program intends to cover several different climatic zones in Brazil

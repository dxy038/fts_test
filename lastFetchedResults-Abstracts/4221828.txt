We consider the problem of wavelength assignment in a reconfigurable bidirectional ring network with wavelength converters. We show that for N-node P-port bidirectional rings, a minimum number of <span style="font-family:Arial" class="MsoNormal">&#9484;</span>PN/4<span style="font-family:Arial" class="MsoNormal">&#9488;</span> wavelengths are required to support all possible virtual topologies in a rearrangeably nonblocking fashion, and provide an algorithm that meets this bound for connected topologies using no more than <span style="font-family:Arial" class="MsoNormal">&#9484;</span>PN/2<span style="font-family:Arial" class="MsoNormal">&#9488;</span> wavelength converters. This improves over the tight lower bound of <span style="font-family:Arial" class="MsoNormal">&#9492;</span>PN/3<span style="font-family:Arial" class="MsoNormal">&#9496;</span> wavelengths required for such rings given in A. Narula-Tam et al. (2002)] if no wavelength conversion is available. We also provide another algorithm that uses more wavelengths yet requires significantly fewer converters. Both algorithms are then extended to the case of unconnected topologies using at most one additional wavelength. Finally, we develop a method that allows the wavelength converters to be arbitrarily located at any node in the ring. This gives significant flexibility in the design of the networks. For example, all <span style="font-family:Arial" class="MsoNormal">&#9484;</span>PN/2<span style="font-family:Arial" class="MsoNormal">&#9488;</span> converters can be collocated at a single hub node, or distributed evenly among the N nodes with <span style="font-family:Arial" class="MsoNormal">&#9484;</span>P/2 <span style="font-family:Arial" class="MsoNormal">&#9488;</span> converters at each node.

A bidirectional amplification module has been proposed for use in IP-over-CWDM networks. The amplification is provided by a bidirectional Er<sup>3+</sup>-doped fiber amplifier. The results of a bidirectional IP transmission experiment using the module clarified that the loss of the transmission fiber in the network could be compensated.

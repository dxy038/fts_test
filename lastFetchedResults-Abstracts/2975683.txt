A novel enhancement system is developed that exploits the properties of stationary regions localized in both time and frequency. This system selects stationary time-frequency (TF) regions and adaptively enhances each region according to its local signal-to-noise ratio (LSNR) while utilizing both the acoustical knowledge of speech and the masking properties of the human auditory system. Each region is enhanced for maximum noise reduction while minimizing distortion. This paper evaluates the proposed system through informal listening tests and some objective measures

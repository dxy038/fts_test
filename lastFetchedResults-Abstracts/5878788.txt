This paper proposes a design methodology for solving a multi-objective circuit design problem, which is based on formulating the problem as a multi-objective geometric program (MOGP) with variable weight factors. In general, to solve the problem using GP, multiple objectives are combined into a scalar objective by assigning arbitrary, fixed weight factors to individual objectives. On the contrary, the proposed method considers weight factors as optimization variables as well. As a result, the achieved solution becomes closer to the ideal multi-objective optimum than the fixed-weight MOGP.

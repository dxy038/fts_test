Introduction: Headache incidence after spinal anesthesia is a complication of this kind of anesthesia. There are differences in incidence of headache at different functional conditions.
Objective: This study was carried out to examine headaches after spinal anesthesia for cesarean section in Alzahra hospital, Rasht.
Materials and Methods: In this cross sectional study, out of 331 patients undergoing spinal anesthesia after 24 hours, they were asked questions about headache after postural puncture. If headaches were present in frontal or occipital areas that increased with sitting or situational movement, they were considered as Post Spinal Puncture Headache.
Results: We observed post spinal puncture headaches (PSPH) in about 51 patients (15.4%) .The incidence rates of headache by using needles with number 22,23,24 and 25 were 63/8%, 1112%, 4/5% and 0% respectively. The incidence rates of headache when injection operators were first degree resident, 2nd degree residents and anesthesiologist were 23/2%, 14/9% and 8/1% respectively (P=0/04).
Conclusion: The incidence of PSPH in this hospital was high and with decreasing needle diameters and increasing operators' experience, incidence of headache will decrease.

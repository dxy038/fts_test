Objective To assess the longitudinal
effectiveness of a comprehensive vocational rehabilitation
program in Germany. Methods In a non-randomized
open study, 106 participants of two
comprehensive rehabilitation programs were prospectively
and multidimensionally compared to a
control group (n = 75) at program termination and at
a 9 months follow-up. Primary outcome was
employment status at 9 months follow-up, secondary
outcome parameters were changes in symptoms
(Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale), subjective
well-being (WHOQOL-Bref), and level of functioning
(Level of Functioning Scale) during the study.
Results Regarding the primary outcome measure,
there was significant more day structuring employment
(mainly sheltered) in the rehabilitation group
than in the comparison group (39.7 vs. 18.7%) at
9 months follow-up. Regarding secondary outcomes,
rehabilitation participants showed a better course in
general symptoms, subjective well-being and level of
functioning. Conclusion Vocational services proved
to be effective to find day structuring employment for
subjects with severe mental illness. Furthermore it
had positive effects on functioning and psychological
well-being during a 9-months follow-up period

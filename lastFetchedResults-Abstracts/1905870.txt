The main objective of this study is to identify the most important criteria and indicators in selection of business intelligence vendors, and ranking the vendors of such tools using Fuzzy Analytical hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS), to compare results of these two methods and to provide appropriate solutions for the sample company, namely National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC).
Spearman's rank correlation test was used for comparing the methods and determining their correlation. A strong positive correlation was observed between the ranks of business intelligence tools at the significance level of 0.05 in both methods. The results of the ranking by means of FAHP method show that IBM Company was the best one, followed by Oracle, SAS, QlikTech, SAP and Microsoft. However, based on the FTOPSIS method, Oracle was the leading company, followed by IBM, SAS and SAP and finally Microsoft.

In recent times, energy conservation in network has been focus of extensive research. The main objective this research is to study the power consumption of WLAN and propose a new technique to reduce the power consumption of access points. In order to save energy of access point, first we build a centralize network with the aid of nodes, switches, servers, and APs and controller. Here, controller is node and the role of controller is store all the information about network like, number of nodes, node IP address, MAC address, name, AP MAC address, BSSID, SSID, coverage area and power status(active or sleep) etc. Controller node is capable of taking appropriate power saving decision, when user request to connect a particular active access point but that user comes under the range of active and sleep access point. At this moment, controller will shift the node request from sleep access point to active access point and inactive access point remains sleep. In this way, our controller base novel approach has significant impact in term of power saving and cost of communication network.

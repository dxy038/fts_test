DEAP (Dielectric Electro Active Polymer) is a new type of smart material. The actuator based on DEAP material tends to be applied in a variety of occasions. It will have prosperous future when employed in automotive field. This paper is focused on the design and implementation of a low input voltage and high output voltage bidirectional converter for driving the DEAP actuator. The detailed design and implemented parameters have been summarized, especially for the high voltage transformer. The experiments have been performed to validate the design and implementation.

Based on multi-objective differential evolution algorithm, adaptive chaotic multi-objective differential evolution algorithm (AC-DEMO) is proposed, combining with adaptive and chaotic principles. In AC-DEMO, chaotic initialization and adaptive mutation operator are introduced to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Numerical experiment results of commonly used test functions show that the algorithm has a good approximation and uniformity index and is suitable to solve complex multi-objective optimization problems.

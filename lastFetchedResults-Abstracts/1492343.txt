In Canada, there is growing acceptance that tillage erosion is a serious form of soil degradation and a threat to the sustainability of agriculture across the country. To date, the potential risk for tillage erosion within potato production systems has not been investigated. The objective of this study was to generate tillage translocation values for primary and secondary tillage implements common to seedbed preparation within conventionally and conservation tilled potato production systems in Atlantic Canada. Tillage translocation was measured for each implement by labelling a plot of soil with a tracer. The tracer redistribution along the path of tillage was used to generate a summation curve to calculate mean soil movement in the direction of tillage. The results show that each primary and secondary tillage operation moved vast quantities of soil and is potentially erosive. Maximum displacement distances were considerably larger in this project than those reported in previous studies looking at tillage erosion by primary and/or secondary tillage implements. All four tillage implements tested moved soil at least 3 m, with the greatest translocated distances (5.6 m) observed for the chisel plough (CP) and vibrashank (VS). The mass of translocated soil (TM) was greatest for the CP, followed by the mouldboard plough (MP), VS and offset disc (OD). In addition, compared to travelling downslope, the upslope speed of tillage was reduced by 38%, 21%, 32% and 12% for the MP, CP, OD and VS, respectively, while the depth of tillage was reduced by 6%, 5%, 35% and 2%, respectively. It is apparent that conservation tillage implements (the CP is generally promoted to reduce water erosion in Atlantic Canada) and secondary tillage implements (OD and VS) can move as much soil as conventional tillage implements such as the mouldboard plough, and must be considered when developing plans to reduce soil erosion within potato fields in Atlantic Canada.

Nowadays, the interest in dietary antioxidants, mainly present in fruits and vegetables, has prompted research in the field of commercial polyphenol-rich beverages. The main objective of the present work was to produce new polyphenol-rich beverages using lemon and pomegranate juices in different proportions (at 25%, 50% and 75% for both juices). The bioactive composition (flavonoids and vitamin C) of the mixtures as well as its stability, antioxidant capacity and changes in colour over a 70 days storage period were studied. Our results suggest that the new drink made of 75% of pomegranate juice (PJ) and 25% of lemon juice (v:v), has potential for development of new healthy beverages or food products, emphasised by its high antioxidant capacity determined by its phenolic composition – punicalagin isomers, anthocyanins and vitamin C – and improved colour properties.

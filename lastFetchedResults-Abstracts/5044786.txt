Presented here are the results of a survey performed at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center on radiation data for commercially available optical fiber. The survey includes data from the past decade that can still be used for currently available parts. The objective of this work was to provide a current central location for relevant radiation data on optical fiber that could be useful for space flight projects. Only valid part numbers that are currently relevant to the manufacturers producing the optical fiber and parts that have been verified as changing number but not process, are included in this study. Presented are the currently available optical fiber types with valid part numbers and manufacturer, the relevant radiation data, and the corresponding data reference. Also included in this summary is the recent unreleased radiation data from experiments conducted at Goddard Space Flight Center on OFS (formerly Spectran) 62.5/125/250 micron optical fiber. This database will serve as a tool for engineers when selecting radiation tested optical fiber for future and current optical fiber systems for space flight applications.

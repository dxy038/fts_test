Objective
The objective of the study was to evaluate the relationship among polyp site, number, diameter, and symptomatology in endometrial polyps in reproductive and postmenopausal women.
Study design
One hundred fifty-five subjects with endometrial polyps were evaluated retrospectively. Sociodemographic characteristics, endometrial thickness, polyp number, diameter, and site were reviewed, and their relations with abnormal uterine bleeding were tested.
Results
A total of 36.1% of the patients in the postmenopausal group and 44.4% of the patients in the reproductive-aged group were asymptomatic. In addition, 37.3% of polyps in the reproductive-aged and 29.2% in the postmenopausal group were multiple. Polyp number, diameter, and site were not different among the 2 groups (P = .282, P = .469, and P = .485, respectively). When patients were evaluated as a whole, symptomatology was not related with polyp number, diameter, and site (P = .677, P = .334, and P = .699, respectively).
Conclusion
Many endometrial polyps are asymptomatic and multiple in nature. Polyp site, number, and diameter do not correlate with symptomatology

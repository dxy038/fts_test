This paper presents a research on developing an intelligent visual inspection system (IVIS) for bottling machine, focusing on the development of image processing framework for defect detection. The objective of the research is to contribute a method on modeling, integrating and enhancing IVIS for the process of quality control in industrial area. IVIS application for quality control was studied using plastic bottles on a production line simulation. An experiment had done by using developed software and special equipments such as conveyor belt, lighting source, and a Web camera (Webcam) to capture the image. The experiment result shows that the system is accurate enough to detect moving object on the speed at 106 rpm with the accuracy of the image acquisition is 94.264%.

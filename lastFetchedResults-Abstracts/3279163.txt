This paper proposes the design of controllers for Multi Input Multi Output MIMO systems. The main objective of these controllers is to satisfy some step response performances such as the settling time and the overshoot. The controller parameters are obtained by resolving a non-convex optimization problem. The resolution of this type of problems can generate a local solution. Thus, the thought is to exploit the Generalized Geometric Programming (GGP) as a global optimization method. Simulation results are given to shed light the efficiency of the proposed controllers.

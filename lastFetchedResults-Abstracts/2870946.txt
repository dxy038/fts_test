This paper investigates a novel control strategy of three-phase voltage source PWM rectifier (VSR) system with the combination of proportional-integral (PI) control method and sliding mode control method. To have satisfactory performances, the condition of uncertain disturbances and loads disturbances should be taken into consideration when designing the controllers. The whole double closed loops control strategy is realized in two parts: outer voltage loop control and inner current loop control, to achieve the aim of well controlled output dc-bus voltage, sinusoidal input currents at AC mains, controlled power factor and bidirectional power flow, etc. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method and it is in good agreement with the desired performances. The proposed control strategy in this paper presents new insights into the control of three-phase VSR system in presence of disturbances and may provide instructions for the control of energy conversion system.

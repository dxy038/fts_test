BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Several species of the genus Euphorbia (Euphorbiaceae) have been tested for their efficiency as anti-viral and anti-tumor agents. Herpes Simplex Viruses (HSV) are pathogenic to human. Antiviral drugs are mostly weak or are associated with side effects. Medicinal plant products have been used as folk remedies for different kinds of ailments including viral diseases. The objective of this study was to compare the phytochemical study and anti-viral effect evaluation of methanolic extract with fractions of aerial parts of euphorbia spinidens.
METHODS: In this experimental and laboratory research the methanolic extract of aerial parts of E. spinidens with maceration method was subjected to solvent partitioning and afforded chloroform, butanol and hexane fractions. B-carotene-linoleate model system, folin-Ciocalteu method and aluminum chloride colorimetric method, respectively, were employed for evaluation of antioxidant activity, total phenolic, flavonoid and flavonol contents of the extract and fractions of this plant. The cytotoxic and anti-viral effects of methanolic extract and fractions were determined using MTS assay and the CC50) 50% cytotoxic concentration( and EC50 (50% effectiveness concentration) were evaluated on Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1. 
FINDINGS: The highest antioxidant activity and phenolic and flavonoid and contents were in buthanol fraction (59.33±0.576, 99±1, 70±1), methanolic extract (44±1, 70±1, 49.96±0.996), chloroform fraction (33.33±0.996, 35.33±0.577, 25.33±0.996) and hexane fraction (19.66±1.146, 27±1, 9.33±1.628) respectively. The highest CC50 was in hexan fraction with 9.92± 0.072 mg/ml and the lowest CC50 was in methanolic extract with 5.072±0.063 mg/ml. Also, the highest anti viral activity revealed in the butanol fraction (SI: 28.125), methanolic extract (SI: 15.85), chloroform fraction (SI: 8.44) and hexane fraction (SI: 2.07), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Based on the results, methanolic extract and buthanol, chloroform and hexane fractions of E. spinidens show anti HSV-1 activity. Antiviral effect observed can be attributed the presence of various secondary metabolites, particularly polyphenols, flavonoids, terpenes and saponins.

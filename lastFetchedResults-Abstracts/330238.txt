Objective: A recent study reported that an estrogenic chemical, bisphenol-A, was released from a fissure sealant. The aim of this study was to identify and quantify the major (or detactable) components released from any of seven commercially-available, light-cured pit and fissure sealants in vitro.

Methods. The fissure systems of ten extracted, third molar teeth were filled with sealant, light-activated and immersed in separate containers of distilled water. Separate, cylindrical stainless steel molds were filled with sealant which was then light-activated and immersed. Each mold or tooth with sealant was moved to a new container of water at defined times and each remaining water sample (eluate) then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Results. Triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) was present in all eluates from each of the sealants tested. 2,2-bis[4′-(2′-hydroxy-3′-methacryloyloxy)phenyl]propane (BisGMA) was detected at much lower levels (about one thousand-fold less) in eluates from one sealant only. Bisphenol-A was not detected in any eluates. The rates of TEGDMA and BisGMA release were highest on first immersion and decreased thereafter. The total amount of TEGDMA released was on the order of 0.25 mg per tooth. Most release occurred during the first day.

Significance. Because bisphenol-A release could not be detected from any of the seven sealants tested, these results call into question earlier concerns expressed about possible adverse effects of bisphenol-A released from resin sealants.

Deciding where to establish development locations is a strategic decision in the field of follow-the-sun software development. Our research has focussed on two factors: a. the optimal time zone difference between locations, and b. the natural ease of communication. The former depends on the required transfer time for handing over work from one location to the other. The latter involves communication aspects such as language. The objective is to construct a routing model, which calculates (sub)optimal deployment routes. The routing model consists of an algorithm that calculates sequences of locations from a dataset containing demographic data about these locations. The possible sequences are prioritized based on a set of parameters. The routing model has been implemented in a website. The Website can be used to validate the routing model, but moreover can be used as a first support when considering potential locations for follow-the-sun software development.

Epidemics such as tuberculosis (TB), can be represented by a finite number of states and transition rules that govern the spread of the disease in each discrete time step. This paper uses a graph theoretic approach to investigate TB interactions in a community where infectives are categorized. A threshold value,  , for ‘reasonable’ infectives is proposed. The results show that an epidemic will not ensue as long as the threshold is surpassed. Simulations presented show that unreasonable infectives can amplify the epidemic.

Dynamic channel switching system (DCSS) has been proposed as a solution that improves the capacity of wireless mesh networks (WMNs) based on current IEEE 802.11 standards. DCSS divides wireless interfaces into data receiving and data sending interfaces. The receiving interfaces stay on the specified channels, while the sending interfaces can be switched as necessary. A node sends the data by switching the sending interface to the channel assigned to the receiving interface of the communicating node. However, outward and return paths routed by conventional routing algorithms are generally the same. Thus, intermediate nodes have to switch their interface channel frequently and compete with each other to be the receiver channel. This leads to significant degradation in their throughput. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to propose a disjoint path routing scheme in order to prevent the frequent interface switching and improve the throughput performance in WMN. Simulations revealed that the proposed routing scheme can produce excellent performance compared with the conventional routing scheme.

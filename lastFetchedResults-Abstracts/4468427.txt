The reasonable use of railway waiting compartment is very important for improving the efficiency of passengers transport organization. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization model for utilization of railway waiting compartment was established. The objectives are: passengers of a train can occupy the only waiting compartment at the same time, minimizing the distance of passengers and balancing the utilization of waiting compartment. By applying Arena system simulation software, the simulation with a practical case was carried out and the analysis of waiting compartment operational plan was finished. With the adjustment of parameters and analyzing the simulation results, the paper evaluated the planÂ´s advantages and disadvantages, and verified the correctness of mathematical model.

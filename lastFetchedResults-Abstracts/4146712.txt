In recent years, body-centric wireless communications have been studied because they have potential to improve the qualities of various kinds of applications. Since the prospective frequencies for the body-centric wireless communications are in an extremely wide range from megahertz to gigahertz, an objective idea on how to select a right frequency band for individual applications is required. However, few publications have tackled this need. In this paper, the frequency dependence of the communication channels in the range of 3 MHz to 3 GHz is assessed based on numerical analyses.

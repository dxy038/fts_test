The problem of location of protective devices is important in distribution networks so the various methods were considered for installation of fuse, recloser, disconnecting switch and breaker. In these methods, a set of protection, economic and reliability aspects are considered. Because of various goals, the optimal approach from some intelligent methods such as genetic algorithm does not get the best approach. At this condition, using mathematic methods is reasonable because they satisfy the best and the optimal approach. Binary programming method is one of these mathematic optimization methods that its speed is high. The problem of location of protective devices is naturally binary in distribution networks. This specification causes using binary programming method for optimal location of protective devices. In this analysis, the binary programming method is implemented for optimal location of protective devices installation in distribution networks. The optimization objective function includes the switching procedure cost and protective devices lifetime cost. Furthermore, the SAIFI and SAIDI analyses beside optimal approaches are calculated. The programmer with reliability consideration easily can choose the optimal possible approach. The proposed method make easy to obtain the best approach with protection consideration and etc. To analyze proposed method, a test network is considered. At a distribution network, the breaker is located in the beginning of the network so the simulation result can be extended to obtain the optimal location for recloser, fuse and disconnecting switch. The proposed method is obtained from Visual Studio C# .NET software.

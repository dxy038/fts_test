A newly developed device for photolithography of micropatterns without the preparation of photomasks by a modified, commercially available liquid crystal display projector (LCDP) was reported. The novel devise was equipped with an XY positioning stage, sliding system for variable focal distance, and exchangeable objective lens, facilitating the exposure of micropatterns with large area and variable resolution.

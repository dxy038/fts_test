The report is of a 50-year-old man with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who had rapidly progressing metastasis to the tongue at 10 months after the left radical nephrectomy. The metastatic lingual tumor was not resectable, therefore treated with radiation (50 Gy). The tumor disappeared macroscopically after the radiation therapy, but enlarged again 4 months later. The patient died of respiratory failure due to multiple lung metastases 12 months after the appearance of the lingual metastasis. Radiation therapy is an acceptable palliative strategy for advanced lingual metastasis of RCC.


Due to the process of deforestation and Increasing human population and growing demands for forests, afforestation and the development of forest is and will be of paramount importance. The objective of this research is to identify suitable plant species for afforestation and forest development in Dareh vesieh watershed by using multi criteria evaluation making. Slope, aspect, hypsometry, isometric, isothermal, soil, geology, river and land-use maps were used to produce the homogenous unit by using GIS. After removed Limitations from homogenous unit were determined suitable area for afforestation and studied ecological unit specifications. According to autochthonous species and adaptive exotic species and their ecological demand suggest species for afforestation in 26 ecosystem units that ecological demand of the suggested species is similar to ecology specifications of units that have capability for afforestation. Several species suggest for afforestation in every ecosystem unit such as Juniperus polycarpos, Amygdalus scoparia, Celtis caucasica, Elaeagnus angustifolia, Berberis crataegina, Pinus eldarica, Amygdalus lyciodes and Morus alba. Then, the best species suggests for afforestation in every ecosystem.

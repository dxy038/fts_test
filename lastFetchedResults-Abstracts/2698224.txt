Environmental concerns, from consumers, governments, and academics, have encouraged businesses to incorporate more environmentally conscious designs in their new product development. However, selection of the best green design is a decision-making process that is not easy to address. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a popular and comprehensive tool to accomplish the objective. Nevertheless, LCA is a time-consuming process that requires substantial resources and expertise. This research proposes an innovative approach to performing structured LCA in conjunction with the concept known as fuzzy analytical hierarchical process. In doing so, some of the disadvantages of LCA can be remedied and this provides a practical tool for performing LCA.

Achieving Quality of Service (QoS) objective in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) handling the multimedia information has significantly gained the importance lately besides energy efficient hardware designing. Transport layer of the WSN communication protocol stack plays a significant role in meeting the QoS objective of WSN. This paper presents a light weight transport protocol for WSN that can handle packets from a numbers of sources having different sensed information and having different priority levels. The protocol assigned middle motes are intelligent enough to achieve prioritization in transmission based on the priority level and packetÂ´s Time-To-Live (TTL) information. Extensive simulation is carried out for the three different modes of the envisaged protocol having no prioritized enabled storage, complete prioritized enabled storage and distributed prioritized enabled storage. The results reveal that the significant improvement is observed in case of distributed prioritized enabled storage, approximately 3% data loss occurred, in comparison to 7% data loss for without prioritized enabled storage mode.

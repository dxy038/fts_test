Near Field Communication, being an emerging technology, has become an attractive area of research in academics as well as in industries due to its flooding growth and promising applications like short range contactless communication for mobile phone and other devices alike. In this regard, a proper understanding and direction of current research of NFC is to be perfectly maintained for the advancement of knowledge and to reduce the bridge gap between its basic theory and application practice. In this paper, we have proposed a thorough survey on NFC and discussed it in terms of our own visualization. We have found the problems available in the current technology of major industries like Apple, Google, Paypal and proposed some new thoughts to solve those. We also have analyzed the NFC business ecosystem and current / future market trends. In other words, this holistic review with the objective of bringing to state-of-the-art in NFC design provides development of knowledge in this field with future research directions.

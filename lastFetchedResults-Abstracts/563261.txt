Prolactin (PRL), a polypeptide hormone synthesized and secreted by the animal's anterior pituitary gland, plays an important role in the regulation of mammalian lactation and avian reproduction. Considering the significant association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5'-flanking region of PRL and reproduction traits in the chicken, the objective of this study was to screen for SNP in the 5'-proximal region of PRL in geese and to evaluate the association between SNP and reproduction traits in geese. Chinese Wan-xi White geese (n = 200) and European Rhine geese (n = 80) were used for phenotyping. SNP was screened by comparing sequences of PCR products, and the single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) protocol was adopted for genotyping. Three SNPs (A-401G, G-268A and T-266A) in the 5'-proximal region of goose PRL were identified in both breeds. Statistical analysis suggested that the genotype AA characterized by A-401, G-268 and T-266 had a positive genetic effect on egg production. Therefore, these polymorphisms have the potential to be utilized in molecular breeding for egg production in geese

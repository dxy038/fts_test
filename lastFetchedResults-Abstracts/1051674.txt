Background: Students differ in terms of mental abilities, learning style and rate, fitness, intelligence and aptitude, personality, interest in and motivation for learning, and academic activities as a means of assessing their learning. Objective: The present paper aims to discover some of such differences. This study seeks to investigate the relationship that exists between personality and learning approaches in predicting studentsâ€™ preferences based on six different methods of assessment. Method: The present research is based on a descriptive-survey method and is of a correlative type. Sample: Using cluster sampling method, 410 participants were selected. Instrument: The instruments used in this study included NEO Five-Factor Personality Inventory, study skills questionnaire, and assessment methods questionnaire. Results: Data analysis with a correlation coefficient showed that the five personality traits and two learning approaches had a relationship with assessment methods. Moreover, results of multiple regression were indicative of the fact that students with low openness personality trait preferred multiple choice method; whereas students with openness personality traits and deep approaches to learning, preferred descriptive examinations and practical projects. In addition, students with deep approaches to learning, conscientious personality traits and low neuroticism preferred oral tests. As for continuous measurement method, regressions lacked any significance. Students with deep learning approaches and low openness personality trait preferred team work assessment method. Discussion and Conclusion: Students who possess openness and conscientiousness traits and adopt deep learning approach mostly select descriptive examinations, oral tests, teamwork, and practical projects as the assessment method.

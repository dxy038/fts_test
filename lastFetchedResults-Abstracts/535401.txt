Road network as the basis of forest management and road construction is one of the most important cost factor of investment. So, it is necessary to use different tools due to decreasing the expenses in planning and evaluating forest road network. Estimation of the volume of cut and fill operations is one of the time consuming and tiring parts in preparation of forest road project stages which can be used as an important construction cost factor and applied as a criterion for evaluating of road network variants. The objective of this study is Using GIS in estimation of the volume of cut and fill operations and investigating its rectification with ground truth through field measurement. This study was carried out in Chelir district of Kheiroud forest. Firstly a digital elevation model (DEM) was derived and was used to provide terrain data. Then a road network regarding technical principles and forestry necessities were designed using PEGGER (an extent ion for Arc view software) and digital topographic maps. Afterwards the volume of cut and fill operations was calculated in GIS environment. In order to testing the calculated volume operations in GIS environment, the road network was checked in the forest and the side slope was measured at every 100 meters. Using side slopes which were measured in 11/4 KM of road length, 115 cross-profiles were drawn. The volume of cut and fill were estimated by two manual and digital methods and were compared by paired samples T Test. The results suggested a significant difference between two methods

The compensated carrier PWM synchronization (CCPS) method for AC-fed PWM power converters is presented. The method provides a solution to PWM converters fed by industrial power systems (IPSs). Such environments usually present unbalances and magnitude fluctuations of AC voltages. Those circumstances impair standard PWM techniques because low-order harmonics are produced and DC-link regulation is poor. To reduce these undesirable effects produced by IPS, a method based on using independently compensated carriers per phase was conceived. In particular, CCPS prevents second harmonic generation and achieves converter self-regulation. The method can be used with any PWM technique and bidirectional power flow. The evaluation of CCPS is based on a complete performance comparison of a PWM rectifier with and without CCPS for various known PWM techniques

According to the Malaysian Ministry of Tourism and Culture, tourism has been identified as one of the twelve National Key Economic Area to drive the countryÂ´s growth. This gave rise to this research objective which is to determine the attention ranking of Malaysians while booking a hotel using a mobile devise. Lab Based Usability Testing with eye tracking technology was carried out with Malaysians to achieve this objective. Results revealed that Malaysian are highly attracted to both the &#8220;booking&#8221; and &#8220;price&#8221; information, followed by the &#8220;ratings&#8221;, &#8220;introduction&#8221; and lastly the &#8220;title&#8221; of the hotel, which is in contrast to other countries.

This paper presents an engineering design method for output filter in parallel active power filters. LCR filter with resonance attenuation characteristic is applied. The special requirements of output filter are analyzed in parallel active power filter. The proposed method firstly builds multi-objective function considering requirements of switching harmonic attenuation, output capability and power loss. Then, fuzzy optimization is used to obtain optimal parameters of output filter. Therefore, the comprehensive performance of parallel active power filter is enhanced, including compensation capability and power loss. The simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed method.

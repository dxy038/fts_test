The main objective of the present study is to determine spatial and temporal distribution of common carp in depths 2-100 m in Iranian waters of the Caspian Sea, during 2007-2011. Seasonal sampling data collected by using bottom trawl in 57 stations. The results showed that the maximum catch and average of CPUE (±S.E.) were 39.0 kg and 0.98±0.35 kg/0.5 hr-1 in depths of 2-10 m in 2011 spring. The bulk stock concentrated in depths  < 20 m in eastern region (from Amirabad to Hasangholi), which seasonal averages of CPUE were 0.69±0.62, 1.08±0.41, 0.16±0.10 and 0.46±0.14 kg/0.5 hr-1 in spring, summer, autumn and winter in the region, respectively. High concentration of carp in the eastern region could be due to stock enhancement program of carp which conducted by Iran Fisheries Organization.

The multi-constrained QoS multicast routing problem has been shown to be NP-complete. Many researchers used some single-objective optimization algorithms to solve the problem. However, the constraint-handling approaches in these methods have some drawbacks. In this paper, we converted the constraints sing-objective problem into a multi-objective problem, and gave a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) to solve it. By simulation experiments, we find this approach for constraint handling not only can find the constrained optimality, but also can provide the decision maker with a group of trade-off solutions with slightly constraint violation and meanwhile with substantial gain in the objective function.

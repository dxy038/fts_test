A new approach for the design of wideband sonar waveforms using linear FM signals and Hermite-Rodriguez functions is proposed. The use of Hermite-Rodriguez functions make it possible to formulate the waveform design problem as an optimal parameter selection problem with a positive definite objective function and linear and bilinear constraints. Such a formulation is quite flexible and can accommodate both frequency and time domain design specifications and constraints. The approach used to solve the optimization problem is to convert the nonlinear and nonconvex complex-domain constraints to simple linear and bilinear real-domain constraints by introducing extra optimization variables. Some preliminary numerical results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

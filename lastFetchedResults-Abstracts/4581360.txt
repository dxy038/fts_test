This paper proposes a new topology for a three-phase AC/AC converter without DC. The presented topology is based on an direct AC/AC C&#769;ukB2 bipolar matrix-reactance chopper. The considered solution is intended to control power flow and compensate voltage perturbations in the modern AC power grid with active loads (two-source system). The main difference in the proposed solution in comparison to a conventional UPFC is the lack of DC energy storage in the power electronic converter. The main aim of this paper is to analyse the basic properties of the presented solution in a two-source system and to consider the possibility of bidirectional power flow control. The paper presents an operational description, theoretical analysis and the experimental test results from a 1 kVA laboratory model using a PWM control strategy with open feedback loop.

The paper gives an overview of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system modeling and simulation. The categorization of tools for HVAC system design and analysis with respect to which problems they are meant to deal with is introduced. Each categorization is explained and example tools are given. Further, the paper summarizes current approaches used for modeling (i) HVAC components, (ii) HVAC control and (iii) HVAC systems in general. After giving an overview of solution techniques for HVAC system simulation, the paper provides suggestions on how one should select an HVAC modeling approach relative to the simulation objective at hand.

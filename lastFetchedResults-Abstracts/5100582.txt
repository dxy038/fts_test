This paper uses a conventional pulse width modulator (PWM) control method to design a negative feedback controller for the PWM-buck converter. The main objective in using the conventional control is to design a stable compensator in the closed loop to provide stability and improve the performance for the power supply for the parameter variations, load changes, and the equivalent series resistance (ESR) effects. This is done by adding a compensator in the feedback loop of the switching power supply. The performance of the PWM-buck converter is improved. The simulation program PSPICE is used to verify the theoretical analysis of the converter

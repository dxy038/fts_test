We now live in a digital society where day-to-day operations are optimized by complex real-time control systems. Our surface transportation infrastructure has evolved to a level of complexity where intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are essential for large urban environments. Our surface transportation infrastructure is a highly complex system subject to day-to-day operations with different levels of recurring congestion, stresses from special events, and damage from natural disasters, accidents, sabotage, and nuisance attacks. Under normal traffic conditions, ITS operation is optimized for system-wide objective functions (i.e., minimize network-wide delay or maximize throughput), and travelers modify their behavior accordingly by alternating their departure time, travel route, or mode of travel. This work presents a security and survivability analysis of the City of Moscow, Idaho ITS project, which is now under development.

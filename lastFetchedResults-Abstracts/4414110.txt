Hybrid Microgrids are becoming increasingly attractive to the consumers because of high reliability, low running cost with flexibility to operate in grid-connected and islanded modes. The Hybrid AC/DC Microgrid comprises of direct integration of AC and DC Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and loads to their respective AC and DC links with bidirectional converter for exchanging of power between links. The Hybrid grid increases system efficiency by eliminating multiple reverse conversions in various home, office and industry facilities. Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel cells and Super-capacitor are included along with conventional Photo-Voltaic(PV) and Wind to overcome the short duration voltage dips during load switching. A small Hybrid AC/DC Microgrid has been modeled and simulated in MATLAB-SIMULINK environment. The simulation results shows that the system can maintain stable operation while switching between grid-tied, islanded mode with variable loads.

It is expected that the amount of product information available from the Internet of Things and Services will be so tremendous, that the main challenge will be to provide the right information, at the right time, in the right place, and to the right people. This objective is addressed by Aletheia - a distributed information system that enables the federation and semantic integration of very heterogeneous information sources. This paper discusses the goals, functionality, and architecture of Aletheia, guided by a real-world case study in the industrial service sector and conducted in cooperation with ABB, a major company providing power and automation technologies, products, and services for utility and industry customers.

Permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) will demonstrate chaotic phenomena when its parameters fall into a certain area. The performance of PMSM will degrade because of chaos. Therefore, chaos should be suppressed or eliminated. According to the features of this practical plant, the drawbacks of existing control methods are analyzed, and the nonlinear feedback control method is suggested to control the chaos in PMSM. The nonlinear feedback principle is developed using the direct axis and the quadrature axis stator voltage as manipulated variables. The control target will become a unique asymptotically stable equilibrium under the nonlinear feedback principle, by this way, the controlled states can reach the target and the control objective can be implemented. This method can be physically realized using nonlinear state feedback. The control forces can be put into effect at any time. The target of the method may be any point in the strange attractor. The influence of the model error and the measurement noise upon the control performance is studied via simulations. Simulation results show the effectiveness of this method under the presence of the model error and the measurement noise

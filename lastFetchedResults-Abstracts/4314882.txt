Madagascar is the only country of the Indian Ocean Commission possessing a paper industry. Since three years, that paper industry has confronted major fiber waste due to major technological problems. The latter affects the competitiveness at national and regional level. The objective is to prove that solving technological problems solves competitiveness problems. To approach this problem, the Skinner\Â´s competitiveness concept will be utilized. And the methodologies will be the value engineering and the benchmarking. The purpose of value engineering is to simplify products and processes. Its objective is to achieve equivalent or better performance at a lower cost while maintaining all functional requirements defined by the customer. The objective of process benchmarking is to understand and evaluate the current position of an industry in relation to "best practice" and to identify areas and means of performance. The survey is going to analyze fiber waste, and then she will explore its effect on competitiveness. A focal result appears: the rehabilitation of the existing technology and its combination with information technology improve competitiveness. That permits to conclude that the converging technologies are competitive quality process.

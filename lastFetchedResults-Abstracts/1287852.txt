Background & Objective: Evaluation is necessary to ensure the quality of education in any educational system. Any educational program needs to be evaluated critically before any modification and revision. This study was conducted to evaluate the program of Bachelor Degree in Health Services Management at Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Iran, by applying the CIPP model of evaluation (Context, Input, Process, Product).
Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, 10 faculty members, 64 students and 90 alumni participated. Three valid and reliable questionnaires were completed regarding four dimensions and nine domains of CIPP model. In order to analyze the data, Man-Whitney, Pearson correlation and descriptive statistic tests were applied.
Results: The whole scores for the context, input, process and product were 2.34, 2.97, 3.68 and 2.55, respectively. Faculty members significantly gave a higher total score for context in comparison to alumni (P  <  0.05); nevertheless, there was not any significant difference between these both groups regarding the product total score. In addition, there was not any significant difference between faculty members and students in input and process scores. A significant correlation was observed for different dimensions of the CIIP model (P  <  0.05). Totally, health care management program was evaluated as a partially accepted program.
Conclusion: CIPP evaluation model can show the advantages and disadvantages of an educational program; therefore, decision and policy makers can come to a point whether to stop, review or continue a program.

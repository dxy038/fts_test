A vertically stacked Yagi-Uda antenna array with X-shape driven dipoles for the long range Meteor Burst Communication (MBC) at the VHF is presented. The parameter design and multi-objective optimization process of the compact 6- element antenna array are given. The simulated impedance bandwidth of VSWR&lt;1.4 reaches 10%. The simulated antenna gain across the operating frequency band is 13.7~15.0 dB and the HPBW in the azimuth plane is 49deg~37deg. The results show that good radiations with gain variations less than 1.3 dB and the side lobe level less than -15 dB over the optimized band have been obtained.

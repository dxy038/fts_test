This paper proposes a practical photovoltaic (PV) model to be extensively used for commercial PV modules and arrays of different cell type. The proposed model is programmed with both icon and dialog box using Simulink to have a user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI) like the Simulink block libraries. The main objective of this paper is to improve the model accuracy by the exact selection of series and shunt resistance and the suitable parameter modification for the real operating conditions. Based on the available information in the manufacturesÂ´ datasheets, the parameters of the nonlinear I-V characteristics are determined by the built-in functions. Finally, the validation of the proposed model using the experimental data of a commercial PV module demonstrates its simplicity, user-friendliness, and accuracy.

Frequent variations occur in the mobile network due to mobility of device (mobile) and the change in propagation channel. In reverse link CDMA system, these frequent variations occur in terms of received signal strength (power) from the mobile station. So an effective and faster power control in reverse link is required, which is the main objective the paper. Adaptive-step power control algorithm dynamically controls the reverse link power of CDMA system. It also removes the near-far effect which is the main problem occurring in the system.

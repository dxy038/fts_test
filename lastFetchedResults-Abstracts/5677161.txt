This article discusses issues on data compression of electromyographic (EMG) signals. A new coding scheme was proposed in our previous work, and a summary of the first experimentations had been given. The new aspect presented in this paper is a deepening of this method followed by a N-order general decomposition scheme. From this generalization, a more complete characterization of the method is made. Tests for order N equal to 1, 2 and 3 carried out showed some improvements compared to. The technique helps to show that the decomposition of Modified Lifting Scheme (MLS) to the order N can solve the recurring problem of storage and/or duration of transmission with more efficiency as compared to wavelet packet transform and lifting scheme. Each of the methods is shortly presented, along with results obtained from actual signals. Signal to noise ratio, compression ratio, distortion of the mean frequency, entropy and computation load allow objective comparisons.

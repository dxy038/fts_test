The objective in this paper is to present some developments for the analysis of Navierâ€“Stokes incompressible
and compressible fluid flows with structural interactions. The incompressible fluid is
discretized with a new solution approach, a flow-condition-based interpolation finite element scheme.
The high-speed compressible fluids are solved using standard finite volume methods. The fluids are
fully coupled to general structures that can undergo highly non-linear response due to large deformations,
inelasticity, contact and temperature. Particular focus is given on the scheme used to couple the
fluid media with the structures. The fluids can also be modelled as low-speed compressible or slightly
compressible media, which are important models in engineering practice. Some solutions obtained
using ADINA are presented to indicate the analyses that can be performed

This paper describes a single-phase transformer design suitable for classroom use. The scope of this design is limited to the specification for the core and coils of the transformer. Both shell and core configured transformers are designed in this paper. A computer program is developed for the purpose of illustrating the design procedure and demonstrating how it works. The objective is to meet all performance requirements at minimum cost

Interior permanent-magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) are suitable for small-size light traction drives due to their rugged and compact construction, high torque and power densities, good efficiency as well as operability over a wide speed range at constant power. This paper presents a bi-objective particle-swarm- optimized (PSO) design of a small three-phase concentrated-winding IPMSM for light traction applications. The PSO design is thus formulated as a constrained optimization problem of maximizing the IPMSM energy efficiency, while minimizing the weight of its active parts.

The preparation of pectic enzymes are used for a more efficient extraction of desirable red grape pigments and other compounds which are bound in plant cells and can be faster released by the action of pectic enzymes; shorten the time of maceration, setting, and filtration. The main objective of the present study was to investigate the enzymatic extraction of anthocyanic pigments from the residue remaining after the vinification process of three varieties of Vitis vinifera from Central Chile. The best results of extraction of anthocyanins can be obtained with Vinozym EC using skin grape Ribier after 2 h of treatment.

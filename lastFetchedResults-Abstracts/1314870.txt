     This research, for the first time presents the Flexible Flow Shop model of scheduling method for considering runway assignment and operations planning together. One of the advantages of the developed model is considering the procedures of air routes in terminal airspace and separation between consecutive aircraft which is very similar to the real world condition. There are different objective functions in airport literature, then a dual criteria model offers for this problem and solve with meta-heuristics SA (simulated annealing) algorithm. This approach can be used as a decision aiding tool, delay reduction, and improving the available runway throughput.

Sphingobium chlorophenolicum is well known as a pentachlorophenol (PCP) degrader. The objective of this study was to evaluate PCP degradation in a loamy sandy soil artificially contaminated with PCP using phytoremediation and bioaugmentation. Measurements of PCP concentrations were carried out using high performance liquid chromatography analyses (HPLC). The toxic effect of PCP on plants was studied through the monitoring of weight plant and root length. The biodegradation of PCP by S. chlorophenolicum in soil was assessed with a bioluminescence assay of Escherichia coli HB101 pUCD607. Bacterial analyses were carried out by plating on Mineral Salt Medium (MSM) for S. chlorophenolicum, MSM for PCP-degrading/tolerant organisms and Trypticase Soy Broth Agar (TSBA) for heterotrophic organisms.

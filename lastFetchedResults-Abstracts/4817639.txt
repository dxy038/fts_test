The objective of this paper is to investigate the sensitivity of cross-polarized backscatter to soil moisture content (m<sub>v</sub>) using experimental and simulated data. The experimental data set consists of co- and cross- C- and L band radar and ground data collected over bare fields by the University of Michigan in 1992 and during the Italian ENVISAT 2003 campaign over Matera (Italy), and over wheat fields during the European Space Agency AgriSAR 2006 and 2009 campaigns over DEMMIN (Germany) and Flevoland (The Netherlands), respectively. The simulated data set has been generated by merging a first-order Radiative Transfer model with a second-order Small Slope Approximation model. Preliminary results show that the model can reproduce the observed sensitivity of cross-polarized backscatter to m<sub>v</sub>. However, the modelled cross-polarized backscatter is biased with respect to the observations, suggesting that a single scale soil roughness is not sufficient to reproduce the backscatter level observed over fairly smooth surfaces.

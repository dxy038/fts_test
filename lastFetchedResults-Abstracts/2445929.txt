<p><strong>Objective:</strong>To determine the association between serum 25 - hydroxy vitamin D concentration and anthropometric indices in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).<strong><br />Materials and methods:</strong>This is a descriptive cross - sectional study which was carried out on women with PCOS aged 19-39 years old referred to an infertility clinic of Alzahra Hospital, Rasht, Iran during September2011- March2012. The study was conducted based on the Rotterdam criteria. Exclusion criteria were hyperandrogeniema and thyroid dysfunction. The data were gathered through an interview with focus on demographic characteristics and history of infertility. The height, weight and waist and hip circumferences were measured and BMI had been calculated. Also, blood sample had been checked to indicate the level of hydroxy vitamin D. While all statistical analyses were carried out using software package used for statistical analysis (SPSS) version 16 (SPCC Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).<strong><br />Results: </strong>Over 68% of patients had vitamin D deficiency (Vit D &lt; 15). Level of vitamin D had a significant correlation with waist circumference (p &lt; 0.02), height (p &lt; 0.001) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (p &lt; 0.007).<strong><br />Conclusion: </strong>Based on the anthropometric indices, it seems that we can predict the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in women with PCOS.</p>

Unavailable bi-directional switches and difficulties in high-current commutation have limited modern matrix converter development to low power range, below 2-3 HP. This paper reports a new design approach based on an integrated bidirectional power module (IBPM) concept and newly developed 3-in-1 IBPMs rated 1200 V and 100 A. A modularity design of phase-banks is conceived to reduce critical parasitic inductance, minimize the power connection terminals, and simplify AC bus structure and wiring. An adaptive phase commutation method is developed to improve commutation. Experimental results operating over 0-400 Hz verify the new concepts and design

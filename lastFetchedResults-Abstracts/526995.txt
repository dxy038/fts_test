This study was carried out in the biotechnology laboratory of Agricultural Faculty of Ondokuz Mayis University. The objective of this study was to establish the effects of chilling period and chilling temperature on germination in linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.). Seeds were subjected to six different heat temperatures (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 oC) for 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours. Germination tests were carried out in a clammed chamber at 25 oC with 70% humidity, 8 hours dark and 16 hours light condition. In all varieties, germination was significantly affected by temperature chilling level. Average mean germination percentage was 88.50% and 93.77% for Antares and 83.24% for Bionda. Germination capacity of seeds was affected either by chilling period or chilling temperature. The highest germination percentage were 0 oC chilling temperature and 96 hours chilling period for Antares with 97.20% and 72 hours chilling period for Bionda with 90.80% germination percentage.

Objective
To clarify the effects of contrast and spatial frequency in patients with migraine by means of pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (PVEPs).
Methods
PVEPs were obtained from 14 patients who had migraine without aura (MO), 11 patients who had migraine with aura (MA), and 25 age-matched, healthy controls (CO). PVEPs were binocularly recorded with a reversal rate of 1 Hz (2 reversal/s) at 3 spatial frequencies (0.5, 1.0 and 4.0 cpd) at high (98%), medium (83%) and low (29%) contrast. N75, P100 and N135 latency and the amplitudes of P50–N75, N75–P100 and P100–N135 were analyzed.
Results
Increased amplitude of PVEPs in patients with migraines were revealed at 3 different spatial frequencies in all components. The MO and the MA showed increased amplitudes mostly in high contrasts (98%). These findings were detected more at a high spatial frequency (4.0 cpd) than at a low spatial frequency (0.5 cpd). Increased amplitude with prolonged latency of N135 were found both in MO and MA at 4.0 cpd.
Conclusions
We conclude that pattern stimuli of high contrasts may be particularly effective in uncovering abnormal cortical reactivity which may be modified in the primary and secondary visual cortex in the interictal state of migraine.
Significance
These findings indicate that there is abnormal visual cortex processing in patients with migraine.

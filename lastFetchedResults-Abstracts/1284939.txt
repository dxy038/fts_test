Structural optimization of recently discovered new chemical entity, 2,8-dicyclopentyl-4-methylquinoline (DCMQ; MIC =  6.25 μg/mL, M. tuberculosis H37Rv) resulted in the synthesis of four new series of ring-substituted quinolinecarboxylic acids/esters constituting 45 analogues. All new derivatives were evaluated for in vitro antimycobacterial activities against M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Certain ring-substituted-2-quinolinecarboxylic acid ester and ring-substituted-2-quinoline acetic acid ester analogues described herein showed moderate to good inhibitory activity. In particular, three analogues methyl 4,5-dicyclopentyl-2-quinolinecarboxylate (3b), methyl 4,8-dicyclopentyl-2-quinolinecarboxylate (3c) and ethyl 2-(2,8-dicyclopentyl-4-quinolyl)acetate (14g) exhibited excellent MIC values of 1.00, 2.00 and 4.00 μg/mL, respectively. Results obtained indicate that substitution of the quinoline ring with dicyclopentyl substituent presumably enhances the antimycobacterial activities in the quinoline analogues described herein.

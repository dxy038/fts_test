In this paper, a risk based methodology for placement of Distributed Generation (DG) using a multi-objective optimization is presented. The cost function consists of costs of loss, unreliability, energy not supplied and installation and maintenance. In the proposed approach uncertainties in load, power generation of renewable based DG and market regulation are considered. A practical example in a real network is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

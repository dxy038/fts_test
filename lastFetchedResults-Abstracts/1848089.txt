Objective
m of this study was to investigate the relationship between abnormal acetabular labrum depicted by radial magnetic resonance and progressive joint space narrowing (JSN) of hip dysplasia.
s
ts were 23 joints [21 patients; mean age: 35.1 years (16–53 years)] that had acetabular dysplasia with lateral center-edge angle of Wiberg (CE angle) greater than 5° and smaller than 25° (mean, 16.4°), which did not show any arthrotic changes on plain radiograms and were followed up for 3 years or longer. Radial images of acetabular labrum were classified into three stages.
s
ssion of JSN was not significantly related to CE angle but to progression of MRI stage (P=.006). In multivariate analysis, one rank progression of MRI stage was significantly associated with progression of JSN (adjusted OR=11.41, 95% CI: 1.51–86.24, P=.018).
sion
ndings showed that in patients whose acetabular dysplasia has 5–25° CE angle, MRI staging based on radial MRI is a better factor for prediction of progression of JSN than CE angle.

the current study, we examined longitudinal
changes in, and bidirectional effects between, parenting
practices and child behavior problems in the context of a
psychosocial treatment and 3-year follow-up period. The
sample comprised 139 parent–child dyads (child ages 6–
11) who participated in a modular treatment protocol for
early-onset ODD or CD. Parenting practices and child
behavior problems were assessed at six time-points using
multiple measures and multiple reporters. The data were
analyzed using cross-lagged panel analyses. Results indicated
robust temporal stabilities of parenting practices and
child behavior problems, in the context of treatmentrelated
improvements, but bidirectional effects between
parenting practices and child behavior were less frequently
detected. Our findings suggest that bidirectional effects
are relatively smaller than the temporal stability of each
construct for school-age children with ODD/CD and their
parents, following a multi-modal clinical intervention that
is directed at both parents and children. Implications for
treatment and intervention are discussed.

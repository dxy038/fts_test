Illusory motions refer to the phenomena in which static images composed of certain colors and patterns lead to the illusion of motions. This paper presents a first approach to generating illusory motions on 3D surfaces which can be used for shape illustration as well as artistic visualization of line fields on surfaces. Our method extends previous work on generating illusory motions in the plane, which we adapt to 3D surfaces. In addition, we propose novel Repeated Asymmetric Patterns (RAPs) to visualize bidirectional flows, thus enabling the visualization of line fields in the plane and on surfaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with applications in shape illustration as well as line field visualization on surfaces.

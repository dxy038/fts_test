Objective
To assess whether alterations in the stromal cellâ€“derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXCR4 occur in patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and in Gata1low mice, an animal model for myelofibrosis, and whether these abnormalities might account for increased stem/progenitor cell trafficking.
Materials and Methods

In the mouse, SDF-1 mRNA levels were assayed in liver, spleen, and marrow. SDF-1 protein levels were quantified in plasma and marrow and CXCR4 mRNA and protein levels were evaluated on stem/progenitor cells and megakaryocytes purified from the marrow. SDF-1 protein levels were also evaluated in plasma and in marrow biopsy specimens obtained from normal donors and PMF patients.
Results

In Gata1low mice, the plasma SDF-1 protein was five times higher than normal in younger animals. Furthermore, SDF-1 immunostaining of marrow sections progressively increased with age. Similar abnormalities were observed in PMF patients. In fact, plasma SDF-1 levels in PMF patients were significantly higher (by twofold) than normal (p < 0.01) and SDF-1 immunostaining of marrow biopsy specimens demonstrated increased SDF-1 deposition in specific areas. In two of the patients, SDF-1 deposition was normalized by curative therapy with allogenic stem cell transplantation. Similar to what already has been reported for PMF patients, the marrow from Gata1low mice contained fewer CXCR4posCD117pos cells and these cells expressed low levels of CXCR4 mRNA and protein.
Conclusion

Similar abnormalities in the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis are observed in PMF patients and in the Gata1low mice model of myelofibrosis. We suggest that these abnormalities contribute to the increased stem/progenitor cell trafficking observed in this mouse model as well as patients with PMF.

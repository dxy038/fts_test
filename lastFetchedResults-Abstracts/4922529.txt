It is suggested that the Air Force (AF) Electronic Combat (EC) Test Process for RF receiver systems can be realized via application of the scientific method employed by experimental scientists for centuries. The authors delineate the direct correspondence of the scientific method to the disciplined AF EC Test Process for RF receiver systems. A by-product of this examination is the identification of the pitfalls which have historically plagued EC system test and evaluation. Particular emphasis is placed on the roles of computer modeling and simulation to implement key steps in the scientific method relative to hypothesis formulation, prediction validation, experiment correlation, and the generalization of these results to operational performance estimates. Mathematical formulations are presented to accomplish the mapping of RF receiver test objective specific performance characteristics to operationally relevant performance measures

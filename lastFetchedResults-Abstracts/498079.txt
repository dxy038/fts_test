Background and objective: The geographic conditions is such that animal husbandry is in separable part of villagers and farmers life and they are at risk of infection due to contact with cattle and on the other hand, the whole people urban or rural are using unpaseurized dairy products expose at the risk all of society. Brucellosis diagnosis can have special significance based on serologic tests. The aim of this study is to determine Seroepidemiologic survey of Brucellosis diagnosis using agglutination test procedures in cattle owners and cattle of Babol.

Materials and methods: In this research, 150 cattle owners and 300 cattle were investigated random during year of 83-84. After blood sampling in view of Rosebangal, tube Wright test, 2 ME and Coombs Wright test were investigated. Then data import to SPSS software and have been analyzed. P<0.05 was significant.

Results: Between 150 serums Sample of studding cattle owners, 80 and 70 people were men and women respectively.

The relative average of these people was 38.86. The most percent of negative cases dedicated to Rosbangal test is 66.7%. The significant difference wasn't observed with Rosebangal method according to Sex in cattle owners (p. value= 0/863).

According to the obtained results, the serum titer of tube Wright test in the studied people was different from 1/20 to 1/2560 and in five people (3.3%), there people (2%) and one of them (0.7%) was 1/640, 1/1280 and 1/2560 respectively. The serum titre 2 ME in 4 people (2.7%), 4 people (2.7%) and 3 people (2%) was 1/160, 1/320 and 1/640 respectively. The serum titer of coombs Wright in 13 people (8.7%) and 8 people (5.3%) was 1/320 and 1/640 respectively. With the above studied, in 300 cattle there was positive 9% with Rosbangal test and serum titer of tube Wright 2 (0.7%) 1/160, 2 (0.7%) 1/320 , 2 (0.7%) 1/640 , 4 (1.3%) 1/1280 and 2 ME serum titer 2 (0.7%) 1/160, 1 (0.3%) 1/320, 5 (1.7%).

Conclusion: The fining of this research indicated that the significant agreement statistically between Rosebangal results and the other methods including tube Wright, 2 ME and coombs Wright have been observe in the anti brucella antibody in cattle owners and cattle serum.

Swarm intelligence enables the distribution and implementation of complex tasks among multirobot systems to be achieved in a more efficient manner. This paper proposed a dual-agent multirobot system for a foraging task based on swarm intelligence. The dual agent system consists of two type of robots. They served as scouts and harvesters respectively. The scouts are designed to be sensor orientated. The harvester relies upon the scouted information with its limited sensing abilities. All robots will communicate information to a centralized hub, which provides information back to the robots. This paper also compares the optimal ratio of scouts to harvesters well as analyzing the benefit of alternative solutions to the objective.

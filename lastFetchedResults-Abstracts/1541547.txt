Policies regarding the use of the Bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) vaccine for tuberculosis vary greatly throughout the international community. In several countries, consideration of discontinuing universal vaccination programs is currently under way. The arguments against mass vaccination are that the effectiveness of BCG in preventing tuberculosis is uncertain and that BCG vaccination can interfere with the detection and treatment of latent tuberculosis.

s work, we pose a dynamical systems model for the population-level dynamics of tuberculosis in order to study the trade-off which occurs between vaccination and detection/treatment of latent tuberculosis. We assume that latent infection in vaccinated individuals is completely undetectable. For the case of a country with very low levels of tuberculosis, we establish analytic thresholds, via stability analysis and the basic reproductive number, which determine the optimal vaccination policy, given the effectiveness of the vaccine and the detection/treatment rate of latent tuberculosis.

sults of this work suggest that it is unlikely that a country detects and treats latent tuberculosis at a high enough rate to justify the discontinuation of mass vaccination from this perspective.

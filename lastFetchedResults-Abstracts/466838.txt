OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the potential of 3 spectroscopic techniques (intrinsic fluorescence, diffuse reflectance, and light scattering) individually and in combination (trimodal spectroscopy) for the detection of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions. STUDY DESIGN: The study was conducted with 44 patients who underwent colposcopy for the evaluation of an abnormal Papanicolaou smear. Fluorescence and reflectance spectra were collected from colposcopically normal and abnormal sites and analyzed to extract quantitative information about tissue biochemistry and morphologic condition. This information was compared with histopathologic classification, and diagnostic algorithms were developed and validated with the use of logistic regression and cross-validation. RESULTS: Diagnostically significant differences exist in the composition of fluorescing biochemicals, the scattering properties, and the epithelial cell nuclear morphology of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions and nonâ€“squamous intraepithelial lesions. Trimodal spectroscopy is a superior tool for the detection of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions than any 1 of the techniques alone. CONCLUSION: Trimodal spectroscopy has the potential to improve the in vivo detection of precancerous cervical changes. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;186:374-82.)

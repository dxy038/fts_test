An examination model was proposed for safety performance of civil aviation supervisor, by the use of Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation method. This model considered the impact of safety responsibility of civil aviation supervisor and influence from surveillance actions to those who being supervised. This included, safety policy, safety risk management, safety assurance, safety promotion, 4 top-level indicators and other 10 second-level indicators. Thus this integrated after-the-event, during-the-event and before-the-event, three kinds of safety surveillance responsibilities. Consequentially, this changed the traditional way of performance examination, which mainly based on the subjective ideas of upper level management, released subjectivity in the process of performance examination, provided a more objective way of examination of civil aviation safety supervisor safety performance.

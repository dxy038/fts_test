Due to space robot meeting the constraint of conservation of angular momentum, which can not be analytically integrated, space robot is with the non-holonomic characteristic. In this paper, the algorithm of non-holonomic path planning base on Newton iteration is proposed. Firstly, the kinematics model is established and the non-holonomic characteristic is analyzed. Secondly, the functions of the joint angles are parameterized by polynomial functions and joint angle range and joint angle velocity range are considered. Thirdly, the objective function and constraints equations of non-holonomic path planning are established. Finally, the optimal solution of the parameters are found by Newton iteration method. The practicability and validity of the algorithm is verified by simulation experiments.

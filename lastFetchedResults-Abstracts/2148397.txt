Background and Objective: Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is a severe debilitating neurological condition in adults. This study sought to assess the effect of observation and mimicking functional activities on weight distribution and dynamic balance index improvement in lower limbs of hemiparetic patients based on mirror neuron theory. 
Materials and Methods: This clinical trial was performed on 36 males and females aged 45-60 years who suffered ischemic CVA for the first time. Subjects were randomly divided into 3 groups as follows: viewers of functional film, viewers of non-functional (symbol) film and the control group (not watching any film). The physiotherapy treatments in all groups were similar. 
Results: Weight percentage distribution was not significant. The values prior to and after dynamic balance index were statistically significant in all 3 groups. Significant differences were found between group 1 and the other 2 groups in terms of balance index percentage change (level 6). 
Conclusion: Observation and imitation of action along with rehabilitation exercises and functional activities had a positive effect on the improvement of balance Index in post-stroke patients.

Hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (C3H6N3(NO2)3, royal demolition explosive or RDX) is a common nitramine explosive and one of the major constituents in wastewaters from ammunitions plants. The objective of this study is to investigate zero-valent iron (Fe(0)) pretreatment for enhancing the biodegradability of recalcitrant RDX. It was hypothesized that iron pretreatment can reductively transform RDX to products that are more amenable to biological treatment processes such as activated sludge. Results of batch and column experiments showed rapid and complete removal of RDX by Fe(0) regardless of the buffering capacity. Formaldehyde (HCHO), a major reduction product of RDX, was readily biodegraded by a mixed culture. Respirometric data indicate that iron-treated RDX solution exerted substantially higher biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) than untreated RDX solution. We propose that an integrated iron reductionâ€”activated sludge process may be a feasible option for treating RDX-laden wastewater.

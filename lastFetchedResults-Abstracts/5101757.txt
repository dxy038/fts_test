Detection is the prerequisite and basis for the control of space debris distribution, as well as a critical work about the observation and study of space debris. The proposed method uses hyperspectral imager for space-based sampling, which can detect the weak differentiation caused by the rotation of target. It also overcomes this trouble that space-based visible light camera cannot take advantage of the fact that space debris makes a rotate motion around its spindle to detect. Therefore, the decision for space debris can be based on objectÂ´s special motional information without any sampling images of space debris. Further details in spectral signal can improve the detectability of target, especially for pixel-level dangerous space debris objective is to bring the double-break in detection method and accuracy.

The objective of this manuscript is to implement autonomous, mobile predator and prey robots "stalking" and "fleeing" in an open field, respectively. This work is composed of three major components: algorithm development to produce autonomous predator and prey robot behaviors, architecting a multi-chip embedded system that simultaneously processes video, AM and IR data packets while controlling servo motors for locomotion, and multi-level system testing. Each robot consists of a camera with a co-processor, an IR transmitter (if predator) or receiver (if prey), an AM transmitter/receiver, four proximity sensors, and a microcontroller. The predator camera detects the color of a prey robot and tracks it after the startup. The prey camera sees the attacking predators and configures multiple escape routes during the attack. The IR transmitter creates the sense of "predator scent" for the prey; prey robots flee from the region as soon as they detect predators\Â´ IR transmission. The AM transmitter/receiver combination establishes the communication link between the predators to capture a prey, and between the preys to synchronize a group motion. The proximity sensors are used for obstacle detection. The microcontroller collects sensory input data and controls the predator and prey robots in the field.

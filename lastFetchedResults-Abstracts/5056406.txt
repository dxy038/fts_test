Non-grid-connected wind power system is a complex system, which includes several subsystems such as wind turbine subsystem, non-grid-connected electric generator subsystems, non-grid-connected wind power control subsystem, gas-solid coupling vibration subsystems, and high energy-consuming special load subsystems. It is a multi-objective, multi-factor, higher-order non-linear dynamics of large-scale system. The non-grid-connected wind power system simulation is an experimental method based on the operation model of non-grid wind power system. This paper analyzes the importance and processes of the non-grid-connected wind power system simulation, and presents the process of a CMM / CMMI software development model. In the end, applications of the CMM / CMMI in the non-grid wind power simulation system design are discussed.

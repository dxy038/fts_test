Inroduction & Objective: Physical activity exhausting the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species activated (RNS) is a well has a dual role as both deleterious and beneficial species is known. N - Acetylcysteine (NAC) acetylating of the amino-L-cysteine, which is converted in the body into metabolites that are capable of stimulating glutathione synthesis may be resulting in the elimination of free radicals. Effective properties of complementary N â€“ acetylcysteine reduces fatigue and effects on sub maximal contractions. 
Material and Methods: This study used 16 female Wistar rats weighing 150 to 200 g and (8 to 10 weeks old) were divided into 2 groups. First group effervescent tablets were given (600 mg) of N-acetyl cysteine dissolved in water) four hours before the experiment by gavages and group was taken as the control. Blood samples were taken 1 hour before starting the exhaustive exercise - immediately after the exhaustive exercise and after one hour at rest.
 Results: Significant decrease was observed in the concentration of MDA immediately after the exhaustive exercise in the group consumed NAC and blood concentration of TAC one hour after exhaustive exercise as compared with the control (P?0.05). Reactive protein concentrations - C (CRP) in the period before, immediately and after exhaustive exercise did not show any significant difference.
Conclusion: The results of our study demonstrated that orall administration of N-acetyl cystein at least four hours before an exhaustive exercise can significantly reduce the harmful effects of oxidative stress in rats.

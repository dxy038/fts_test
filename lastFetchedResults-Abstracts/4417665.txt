Previous research proposed a framework for the objective and accurate estimation of software project schedules in the proposal preparation stage of large-sized software development projects. A probabilistic approach was used to take into account the uncertainty inherent in the early stage of such projects. This work illustrates how to use the framework in the later planning stage when additional, more detailed information is available via the design documentation. The process continues to use the International Function Point User Group (IFPUG) function point analysis and the International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) regression equations to calculate project size and resource effort, but substitutes the more accurate adjusted function point information for the previously used unadjusted function point data. The use of the proposed framework in the planning stage provides for the reassessment, verification and/or refinement of the estimated schedule produced in the early stage.

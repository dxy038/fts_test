In this paper we propose a new method to approach optimal Traffic Engineering routing. The method consists of dividing the traffic matrix into N sub-matrices, called strata, and route each of these independently. We propose two di erent implementations of our method in routers. Our method can also be used to compute a very precise approximation of the optimal value of a given objective function for comparison to heuristic Traffic Engineering algorithms. For this application, our algorithm is very efficient on large topologies compared to an LP formulation.

The objective of this paper is to explore the priority of the improvement in respect of the usersÂ´ requirements of digital game and to identify the engineering characteristics of Human-Computer Interface that can be better improved. Focused on the two most popular games (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Play Game and Action Game), this paper applies Quality Function Deployment to find out the priority of improvement which customers require, that is, customer attributes. To find out the correlation matrix of House of Quality, this paper analyzes the engineering characteristics of three human-computer interfaces and further conducted surveys among these experts. We found that the prioritized customer attributes that need to be improved first is the computer self efficacy in the massively multiplayer online role play games, while the action games needs to improve the controllability of the players. In addition, the engineering characteristic of human computer interfaces is instinctive control that should be improved first. The results provide theoretical and practical contributions that help the manufacturers to improve the human-computer interface design.

An important class of network optimization problems is one in which the objective function is defined in terms of port immittances. Since many solution procedures employ a gradient evaluation of the objective function, calculations of the partial derivatives of port immittances with respect to the parameters that vary are required. A procedure is presented for evaluating the partial derivatives of port immittances with respect to <img src="/images/tex/1475.gif" alt="\\sigma"/> and <img src="/images/tex/1072.gif" alt="\\omega"/> , where <img src="/images/tex/10355.gif" alt="\\sigma + j \\omega"/> is the transform frequency variable. Adjoint calculations are central to the method.

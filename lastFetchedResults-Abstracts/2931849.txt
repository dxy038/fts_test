The authors present the application of quadratic-phase weights to produce concomitant broad beam with the same aperture of the pencil-beam phased array antenna. The concomitant broad beam is applied to improve the efficiency of the missile acquisition before the missile midcourse during radar engagement situation. The major objective is to find optimal procedure to evaluate the influence of the beamwidth and power gain for the existing antenna pattern. The procedure is verified on both corporate and space fed pencil-beam phase array antenna with three channels (SUM/AZ/EL) pattern

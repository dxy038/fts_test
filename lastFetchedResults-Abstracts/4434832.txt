This paper discusses a new and innovative experience in designing, implementing, and improving a multidisciplinary class for engineering capstone design. The approach was designed and augmented in order to fulfill the ABET required capstone design in all departments in our College of Engineering. The objective of this innovative capstone experience is to create a broad, practical, and exciting alternative to traditional capstone senior design experiences. This paper presents and discusses the creation process of the class from the conceptual point to implementation, with a new idea of engaging relatively large teams of 8-12 students in each project. The paper also presents results from the industrial partners´ and students´ perspectives.

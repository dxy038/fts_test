This paper presents patients recovered after head, neck and mouth cancer and it has as main objective the observations regarding quality-of-life changes. The medical record is briefly exposed. We highlight the modalities by which the patients healed their inside and outside scars commanding respect due especially to media exposure. They rebuilt their personalities becoming public speakers, blog-writers, fundraisers, being kind of modern Demosthenes. The Attic Demosthenes fought with a speech impediment and he considerably practiced to deliver orations. The modern Demosthenes have to face the fear of premature death, diverse traumas, lack of voice, disfigured faces, very low self-esteem, long bodily and psychic severe distress, difficult social reintegration. The online world has offered proper ways to present their experiences via videoconferences, blogs, sites, interviews and speeches on YouTube. The development of educational initiatives from these inspirational stories may be an effective, procreative strategy.

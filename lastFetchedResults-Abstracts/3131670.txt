In order to predict the potential dangers of coal and gas outburst accurately, applying the matter-elements model to classify the dangerous grade of coal and gas outburst mine for three grades. According to rhombic thinking mode and the extension of matter element, the multi-index and hierarchical system of dangers of coal and gas outburst in mines was built and gave the method determining the synthesis weights of indexes that include both subjective favoritism and objective information. Using synthesis weights, qualitative knowledge and quantitative data can be reflected in the prediction results of dangers of coal and gas outburst. Matter-element model was constructed to forecast dangers of coal and gas outburst by matter-element transform. It has theoretical significance and practical value in perfecting the safety management in coal mine.

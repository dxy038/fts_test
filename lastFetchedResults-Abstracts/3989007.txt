We propose a method for object tracking using prototype-based deformable template models. To track an object in an image sequence, we use a criterion which combines two terms: the frame-to-frame deviations of the object shape and the fidelity of the modeled shape to the input image. The deformable template model utilizes the prior shape information which is extracted from the previous frames along with a systematic shape deformation scheme to model the object shape in a new frame. The following image information is used in the tracking process: 1) edge and gradient information: the object boundary consists of pixels with large image gradient, 2) region consistency: the same object region possesses consistent color and texture throughout the sequence, and 3) interframe motion: the boundary of a moving object is characterized by large interframe motion. The tracking proceeds by optimizing an objective function which combines both the shape deformation and the fidelity of the modeled shape to the current image (in terms of gradient, texture, and interframe motion). The inherent structure in the deformable template, together with region, motion, and image gradient cues, makes the proposed algorithm relatively insensitive to the adverse effects of weak image features and moderate amounts of occlusion

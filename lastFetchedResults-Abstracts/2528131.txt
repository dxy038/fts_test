Inroduction and Objective:Bacillus cereusis an important enterotoxigenic food borne pathogen. It contains NHE and HBL complex  enterotoxins. The genes of these complex can be used for characterization of  enterotoxin production in B. cereus. The objective of this study is to detect enterotoxigenic B. cereus and assessing the incidence of it in foods.Material and Methods:220 food sles including  80 meat products, 20 dairy, 20 rice and 100 salad sles, have been collected in the years 20122014. Using biochemical and molecular tests, the B. cereus positive food sles has been detected. B.cereus isolates checked for NHE and HBL complex by specific primers. B. cereus isolates which contain both NHE and HBL have been used for cytotoxic assay on Vero cells.Results: Among 100 B.cereus isolates, 40 contain NHE, 23 contain HBL and 17 isolates contain both complexes. The recent isolates have been used for cytotoxic assay on Vero cells.Conclusion: PCR is a prompt, reliable method for detection of enterotoxigenic bacteria. Enhancing awareness about virulence and prevalence of genes involved in food poisoning would be effective in prevention of food poisoning.

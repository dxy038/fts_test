Autonomic logistics, the use of computer and information technology to automate logistics, is enabled by two computer-based technologies, Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) and Distributed Information Systems (DIS). US military and commercial aviation interests are moving forward in development of these technologies with the objective of greatly improving the efficiency of the support system while making significant reductions in operating and support costs. Developments to date and associated cost and benefit analysis indicate the potential for significant achievement in reaching the goals of the program. This paper discusses how autonomic logistics, prognostic health management and a supportive distributed information system are integrated to provide a great leap forward in the effectiveness of aircraft support systems and how cost benefit analyses can be used to rationalize the use of these technologies. It also identifies problems encountered and lessons learned in doing cost benefit analyses for an advanced military fighter aircraft system

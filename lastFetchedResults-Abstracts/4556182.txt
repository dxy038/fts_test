A spectrum leasing strategy is considered for the coexistence of a licensed multihop network and a set of unlicensed nodes. The primary network consists of a source, a destination and a set of additional primary nodes that can act as relays. In addition, the secondary nodes can be used as extra relays and hence potential next hops following the principle of opportunistic routing. Secondary cooperation is guaranteed via the &#8220;spectrum leasing via cooperation&#8221; mechanism, whereby a cooperating node is granted spectral resources subject to a Quality of Service (QoS) constraint. The objective of this work is to find optimal as well as efficient heuristic routing policies based on the idea outlined above of spectrum leasing via cooperative opportunistic routing. The optimal policy is obtained by casting the problem in the framework of stochastic routing. The optimal performance is then numerically compared with two proposed heuristic routing schemes, which are shown to perform close to optimal solutions and as well being tunable in terms of end-to-end throughput vs primary energy consumption.

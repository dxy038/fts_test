The objective of this study is to determine energy balance between inputs and output for tangerine production in Mazandaran province, one of the most important citrus production centers in Iran. Data is collected by administering a questionnaire in face-to-face interviews. The results show that the highest share of energy was utilized by application of chemical fertilizers and chemicals. Average yield and energy consumption are calculated as 26862.5 kg ha−1 and 62260.9 MJ ha−1, respectively. The energy productivity and net energy value are estimated as 0.43 kg MJ−1 and −8201.4 MJ ha−1, respectively. The ratio of energy outputs to energy inputs is approximately 0.87. In addition, the Cobb–Douglas production function is applied to estimate the econometric relationship among different forms of energy consumption. The findings suggest that tangerine producers must optimize their use of indirect and non-renewable energy resources; they apply an excess use of some energy inputs, resulting in an inverse effect on yield as well as imposing risks to natural resources and human health.

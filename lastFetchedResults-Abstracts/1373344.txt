Recently, a number of new technologies have been developed to improve the detection of cervical cancer. Increase the early detection of meaningful pap smear abnormalities, reduce the number of unsatisfactory smears and false negative results and provide fewer ambiguous results one of these method is the new test, include liquid-based to improve the quality and quantity of the cervical pap smear. The aim of this study is to evaluate rate of unsatisfactory smear of cervical cytology in two methods, conventional pap smear (CP) and liquid-Based (L.B).

Materials&Methods: A comparison cross â€“ sectional study was performed from 2004-2005 on 1500 patients referred to the Ghaem hospital and private clinic. From all patients cervical cytology was taken randomly via two methods  CP and L.B. Subsequently frequency unsatisfactory cervical cytology in tow methods evaluated. Statistical analysis using the SPSS soft ware was done and t-test and ?2 used for comparative evaluation.

Results: Considering the incidence of unsatisfactory cervical cytology in CP  method %0.3 was and in LB method %1 was. Sensitivity of the C.P method was 68.8% and that of the L.B method was 83.1%.

Conclusion: In this study incidence unsatisfactory rate in L.B method was higher than C.P method.

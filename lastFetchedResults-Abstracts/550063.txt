The periodical orientations and trends of governments toward centralization and decentralization systems appeared, after a relatively long period of centralization and at the beginning of decentralization experiences since 1970s. Originating generally from political and economic domains, decentralization entered curriculum and education systems. Problems such as deficiencies in professional human resources, the lack of sufficient funds and support, teachers resistance, globalization, and so on resulted in governments' showing interest in recentralization in order to improve the quality of education and solve relevant problems. In the light of centralization and decentralization, especially in education and curricula, we have addressed the main causes of derivation from original objective of decentralization, including a focus on peripheral aspects, such as financial, administrative and managerial (hard approach) and attenuated attention to the main objective of quality improvement and curriculum development (soft approach). The two types of approach toward decentralization have been practically entered in curriculum and education systems, which have resulted in inaccurate and false perspectives about decentralization. True understanding of the two systems, characteristics and correct approaches and their underlying rationale can help curriculum enhancement. We have also addressed the implications of centralization and decentralization for Irans' curriculum systems in the lights of the country's historical and cultural background and orientation toward its decentralization as well as Iran's current conditions.

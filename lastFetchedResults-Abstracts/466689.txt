Objective: To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of cervicography in detecting cervical cancer precursor lesions in women participating in the National Cancer Institute's multicenter atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion triage study (ALTS). Study Design: Cervigrams were obtained from 3134 women with a referral Papanicolaou smear diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Cervigram and cervical histology results were compared by using cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 and CIN 3 disease end points. Results: Of 3134 women, 444 had histologic findings of more than or equal to CIN 2 and 222 had CIN 3. Cervicography interpretation by using a threshold of greater than or equal to atypical had a sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 79.3%, 61.0%, 13.4%, and 97.5%, respectively, for detecting greater than or equal to CIN 3. Cervicography was more sensitive (80.8% vs 57.1%), but less specific (55.7% vs 81.8%), for detecting CIN 3 in women younger than 35 years compared with women 35 years or older, respectively. Conclusions: Cervicography functioned moderately well at detecting CIN 2 or CIN 3 in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion Papanicolau smear results. Cervigram sensitivity was better for younger women. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185:939-43.)

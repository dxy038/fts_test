This paper derives an optimum relay amplifying matrix for a wireless relay network under channel uncertainty and received power constraints at the destination node. To achieve this objective, an amplify-and-forward strategy is employed at the relay nodes, and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criteria is applied. And, for simplicity, this paper will assume a one-source-one-destination pair and N multiple relays. Then this paper will compare the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed relay network with that of other existing schemes, and also claim that the proposed relay amplifying matrix can improve BER significantly, compared to other existing schemes.

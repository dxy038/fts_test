Objective: It is important to determine whether the widespread use of mobile phones and its electromagnetic radiation (EMR) affects or alters any human physiological response. HSP70, one of the stress response protein marker, is targeted in the present study. The rationale of this study is to explore the expression pattern of HSP70 and HLA-DR (class II immune response gene) frequency among frequent users of mobile phones. Methods: Thirty four employees from ITES (IT Enabled Services) and frequent users are recruited based on their exposure to mobile phones. The detection of hsp70 mRNA expression was studied using Reverse Transcriptase-PCR. Sequence Specific Primers (SSP) were used to genotype the of HLADR class II molecules (PCR-SSP). Results: The data obtained from the present study group showed that, the dominance of DRW53 restricted alleles i.e., DRB1*04, DRB1 *07 and DRB1 *09 are observed frequently than other alleles. Out of 34 individuals studies, 24 are positive for any one the allele belonging to the broad specificity of DRW53. The hsp gene expression was up regulated (increased intensity) in all the individuals irrespective of the age groups.

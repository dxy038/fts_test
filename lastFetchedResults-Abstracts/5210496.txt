This paper proposes a multi-objective optimal design for an in-wheel permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) at the rated and maximum torque. In order to improve the characteristics of the PMSM such as the average torque, torque ripple and the efficiency, the Taguchi method, the response surface method (RSM) and genetic algorithms (GA) are utilized. In addition, the results of the proposed model were compared with the initial model and verified by 2D FEM.

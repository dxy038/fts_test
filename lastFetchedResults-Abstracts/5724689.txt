As a type of word of mouth, online reviews have great impact on both consumers and sellers. As objective and subjective reviews from different sources may differ emotionally, their impacts and target readers may differ accordingly. Our study firstly uses text semantic analysis and multiple linear regression models to explore the emotional tendency of reviews from different sources. Our results show that objective tendency is stronger in expert reviews, which are mainly influenced by the arributes of the products; user reviews, which mainly depend on personal preference and product experience, tend to be more subjective than professional reviews. According to characteristics of reviews from different sources, we proposed some strategy suggestions for sellers.

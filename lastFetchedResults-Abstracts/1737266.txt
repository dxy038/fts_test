Iodine deficiency (ID) is an endemic health problem in Kangra district, Himachal Pradesh (HP) state. ID leads to mental retardation, deaf mutism, squint, dwarfism, spastic diplegia, neurological defects and congenital anomalies. Iodine nutrition status amongst neonates can be assessed by estimating thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The present study was conducted with an objective to assess the iodine nutrition status amongst Neonates in Kangra district, HP. All of the hospitals in the district which provide obstetric services were enlisted, of which three were selected for this survey. A total of 613 umbilical cord blood samples of neonates were collected on filter paper and analyzed for TSH. WHO (2007) reported that that a &lt;3% frequency of TSH concentrations above 5 mIU/L in samples collected 3â€“4 days after birth indicates iodine sufficiency in a population. In our study we found that 73.4% of the neonates had TSH levels of more than 5 mlU/l, thus indicating ID in the population studied. Iodine deficiency continues to be a public health problem in Kangra district, Himachal Pradesh.

Investigating and discussing on the new feature image of which pixel holds the number of frequency (FI) and/or co-occurrence frequency (CFI) of the gray value are the objective of this OS. For preparing this, some basic considerations on the current state and the future of image feature are shortly presented by over viewing the cutting edge of image processing research around IAIP of JSPE. Finally, abstracts of a few interesting studies of image input devices and image processing algorithms including FI and CFI are described.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Without bone marrow transplantation (BMT), B- thalassemia major (B-TM) patient needs regular blood transfusion. Iron deposition after blood transfusion causes many unwanted effects. BMT obviates the need for blood transfusion in B-TM. In this study, bone marrow transplantation in seven B-thalassemia major patients in Amirkola children hospital was reported. 
CASES: Among B-thalassemia major patients for doing BMT seven patients [4 girls (57%) and 3 boys (42%)] had human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched donors. Mean age of patients was 10.86±5.58 years. Three donors were sisters, two donors were brothers, one donor was father and one donor was aunt. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) collected from bone marrow (4=57%) and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSc) (3=42%). There was no engraftment failure or graft rejection. One patient suffered from acute graft versus-host disease (GVHD) (stage IV). Mean duration of hospitalization was 37.71±10.32 days. Mean duration of follow up was 353.14±152.133 days. At present all patients are alive, disease free and independent blood transfusion. Chimerism in all of them was more than %90 in the last assessment.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that all studied patients became independent to blood transfusion after BMT. There was no engraftment failure or graft rejection.

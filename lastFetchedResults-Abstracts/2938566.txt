ETSI STC RES10 has started its work with the objective of approving a standard by the end of 1994, and this is was achieved. HIPERLAN provides the sufficient and necessary means for ensuring high speed radio data transmission for local area networks. The available bit rate is 30 Mbit/s in the air from point to point. HIPERLAN provides the necessary facilities for interactive multimedia applications to be supported over the air, via the support of time bounded services as well as asynchronous services on the same spectrum. All these facilities are offered thanks to the unique flexibility of HIPERLAN, obtained with a fully distributed system architecture, which allows any kind of implementation to be realised

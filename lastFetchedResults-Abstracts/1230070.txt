Electronic components within a projectile are subjected to severe loads over an extremely short duration during the launch process. Failure of these components during launch can result in negative effects on the mission of the projectile. While experimental data can be helpful in understanding failure of electronic components within a projectile, collecting such data are usually difficult. There are also limitations on the reliability of sensors under these circumstances. Finite element modeling (FEM) can offer a means to better understand the behavior of these components. It can also be used to develop better shock mitigation features into the projectile design. This research has two objectives. The first objective is to develop an FEM that one describes the interaction of a typical projectile with the gun barrel during launch. The projectile includes a payload of a one-pound mass representing a typical electronic package supported by a plate. The second objective of this work is to investigate the use of composite plates to support electronic payload as a means to reduce the transmitted shocks during the projectile launch event. The proposed plate has carbon fibers embedded in an epoxy matrix. A parametric study of the effects of varying the thickness of the supporting plate and the fiber volume fraction on the accelerations and stresses is included. Results of the study are used to reach general recommendations regarding reducing failure of electronic components within a projectile.

Raspberry Pi is employed as a basic embedded system and being a low cost single-board computer, it has emerged to be immensely popular in recent times. This paper mainly deals with natural color of an image including human faces in HSI color space. In this kind of image, it is necessary to describe skin color accurately hence we go on to restore the image based on this criterion. Histogram equalization (HE) is a popular technique for contrast enhancement of images. In order to vary the enhancement degree to get proper skin color, HE with variable enhancement degree (HE-VED) is introduced. The enhancement degree of HE-VED is controlled by intensity and saturation parameter &#945; and &#946; respectively. Dark and low contrast images were captured using the Raspberry Pi camera module and HE-VED was applied to enhance the objective image in a particular enhancement degree automatically with help of Raspberry Pi. Lastly HE-VED was extended to a complete image and appreciable results were obtained which could be further enhanced using different pseudo coloring techniques.

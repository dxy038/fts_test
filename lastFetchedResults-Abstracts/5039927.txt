Labs form a central component especially in engineering education. The objective of our current work is to enhance the possibility of teaching, learning and experiencing engineering lab targeted towards teachers and students of various disciplines in engineering. This is achieved by developing virtual computer based lab environments. The experience of these environments is enriched with touch based technology. This paper talks about creation of virtual soldering environment. We have successfully implemented a working prototype which would enable the end user to get a feel for real time soldering. This approach of `virtualÂ´ computer based training environment has great potential that stimulates self-learning process of soldering.

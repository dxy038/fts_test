A 5-level cascaded hybrid multilevel inverter for interfacing with renewable energy resources is developed. The objective of this research is to propose an alternative topology of hybrid cascaded multilevel inverter applications. The modified PWM technique is also developed to reduce switching losses. Also, the proposed topology can reduce the number of required power switches compared to a traditional cascaded multilevel inverter. PSIM (PowerSim) and Simulink/MATLAB are used to simulate the circuit operation and control signal. The 3-kW prototype is developed. The results show that this alternative topology can be applied for high power applications as a multilevel inverter.

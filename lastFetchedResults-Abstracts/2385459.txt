This paper reviews the use of microemulsions, especially the water-in-oil (w/o) microemulsions, for preparation of nanoparticles that are employed as catalyst components in heterogeneous catalytic reactions. The objective is to show the growing interest of using microemulsions in the preparation of different types of materials such as metals, single metal oxides or mixed metal oxides with a broad range of application in heterogeneous catalysis and also in electrocatalysis. In most cases, the catalytic material showed improved catalytic properties as a result of the special synthesis environment created by the microemulsions. Still, research is needed for a better understanding of such beneficial effects. In addition, this method needs improvements in order to produce, in an environmentally friendly way, a suitable amount of material for use in industrial-scale catalytic processes.

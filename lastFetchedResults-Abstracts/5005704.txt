Oscillation damping via variable speed wind generators have been addressed in literature. Among the techniques, active power modulation has been studied. However, active power is closely related with electromagnetic torque. Modulating active power can introduce oscillations in the torque. This is undesired. The objective of this paper is to study an alternative technique - reactive power modulation for inter-area oscillation damping. A two-area four-machine power system with doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farm is modeled in MATLAB/Simulink. Vector control for rotor-side converter (RSC) of DFIG is modeled. A control scheme based on reactive power modulation for inter-area oscillation damping is proposed. Simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrate the effectiveness of the control technique.

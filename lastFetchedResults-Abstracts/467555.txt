Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare interleukin-6 and funisitis as predictors of impaired neurologic outcomes in children by performing a secondary analysis on data that were collected prospectively for another purpose. Study Design: We examined umbilical cords for funisitis and obtained cord blood for interleukin-6 levels. A psychomotor developmental index score was determined for each child at age 18 months. Results: The prevalence (46%) of elevated interleukin-6 levels (â‰¥ 10 pg/mL) among children with low psychomotor developmental index scores (<100) was not significantly different from that of children with normal scores (47%). Among children with funisitis (n = 21), the median psychomotor developmental index score was 94; for children without funisitis (n = 92), it was 99 (P< .02). When the data were regressed for confounding, funisitis remained significant (adjusted odds ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9). Furthermore, funisitis was a more specific predictor of low psychomotor developmental index scores (P< .001), although elevated interleukin-6 levels were more sensitive. Conclusion: When used for the prediction of impaired neurologic outcomes in children, funisitis has better specificity and thus a better positive predictive value than does interleukin-6.

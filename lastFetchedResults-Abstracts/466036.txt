Objective: A circulating factor derived from the placenta has been implicated in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. The aim of this study was to determine whether placental extracts from normotensive women and women with preeclampsia increase oxidative metabolism and histamine-induced vasoconstriction in porcine carotid artery. Study Design: Placental extracts from normotensive women and women with preeclampsia were applied to porcine carotid artery, and oxidative metabolism was measured. Histamine-induced isometric force responses were also determined in the absence and presence of placental extracts. Results: Application of placental extracts to porcine carotid artery caused a fall in oxygen tension, which reflects increased consumption. Extracts from placentas taken from women with preeclampsia caused a greater fall than those from normotensive women (0.117 ± 0.026 vs 0.018 ± 0.0024 μmol oxygen per milligram; P ≤ .01). Histamine-induced contractions were potentiated by extracts from preeclampsia but not from those of women without hypertension. The maximal steady-state force values were 13,137 ± 3647, 12,921 ± 3684, and 21,673 ± 7189 N/m–2 for control, normotensive, and preeclamptic samples at 10-μmol/L histamine (P ≤ .05, compared with control placental extracts). Conclusions: Placental extracts from women with preeclampsia cause a greater stimulation of porcine artery oxygen consumption and exacerbation of histamine-induced vasoconstriction than extracts from normotensive women.

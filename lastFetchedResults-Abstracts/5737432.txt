The objective of this research was to develop a brain computer interface (BCI) communication device for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. The device was designed to meet the needs of ALS patients, and to be used at a clinical level. Initial tests were performed by ALS patients, and the result was accounted for in the experimental production of the communication device. Lastly, the device was evaluated by able-bodied examinees and ALS patients. For able-bodied examinees, the device scored a high rate of correct sessions. When an ALS patient was the user, the correction rate was not as well, but it would have scored highly if a correct parameter was chosen.

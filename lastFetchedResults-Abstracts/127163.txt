BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Wound repair is one of the most important purposes in physiotherapy. Use of amniotic membrane as allograft in partial thickness burns and use of ultraviolet rays in order to delay rejection of allograft have been the subject of many researches. In this study, clinical processes of rejection of amniotic membrane as allograft by UVB radiation was assessed and compared with unirradiated allografts.
METHODS: This study was performed on 40 burned patients (8 males and 32 females) with mean age of 24.9 years and mean burned area of 36.3 percent. They were divided into three groups, twenty patients as case groups (in two equal subgroups), which exposed to 100 and 200 mj/cm2 UVB radiation, respectively. The third group (20 patients) was considered as control unirradiated ones. The adherence and color of allografts were recorded daily and the results were analysed by statistical Z test.
FINDINGS: Allograft adherence in case groups was statistically longer than that of control group. Also, the time that the allograft was red and bright was longer in case groups. There were not significant differences between two case subgroups in adherence and color of allograft.
CONCLUSION: Irradiation of UVB on allograft before grafting causes better and longer adherence and improves blood circulation and wound repair. The above findings were in agreement with findings of most studies in this field. Futher investigations with different wavelengths of UV are recommended.

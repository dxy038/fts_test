Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology enables bidirectional energy flow between electric vehicles (EVs) and grid, which provides powerful demand response, balancing the electricity demand and supply in smart grid. Mobility is the key feature of EVs, which is also a significant challenge for V2G systems. In order to model the EV mobility in V2G systems, we propose a complex networking modeling for V2G mobile energy network. Each district has a V2G system. EVs travel among different districts. The EV fleets transport energy and impact the V2G systems of districts. The theory of complex network synchronization is employed to analyze the dynamics of the mobile energy network. Numerical results show the energy transportation of EV fleets may achieve synchronous stability of demand level of different districts, balancing the demand response in the mobile energy network.

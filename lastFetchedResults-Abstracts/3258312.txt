We consider the Multi-Area Economic Dispatch problem (MAEDP) in deregulated power system environment for practical multi-area cases with tie line constraints. Our objective is to generate allocation to the power generators in such a manner that the total fuel cost is minimized while all operating constraints are satisfied. This problem is NP-hard. In this paper, we propose Real-coded Genetic Algorithm (RCGA) to solve MAEDP. The experimental results are reported to show the efficiency of proposed algorithms compared to Particle Swarm Optimization with Time-Varying Acceleration Coefficients (PSO-TVAC).

Objective (s): The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Spiritual Well-Being (EORTC QLQ-SWB) is a cross-cultural international module measuring spiritual well-being of patients with cancer, receiving palliative care. This article intends to address the process of providing Persian version of the module.
Methods: All steps of providing Persian version of the measure were carried out based on the EORTC Quality of Life Group-Translation Procedure.
After contacting the translation coordinator in the EORTC and receiving permission to translate the measure, forward translation from English into Persian using two qualified translators was performed. Then, forward translations were reconciled into a single version. Consequently, the version was provided for two other translators, not informed of the original questionnaire to do backward translation. After receiving backward translations and comparing them with original questionnaire, appropriate changes were made in provisional Persian version. Before pilot testing, a report was sent to the EORTC Quality of Life Study Group and necessary modifications were made. Then pilot testing was conducted and the related report was sent to EORTC. Approval by the EORTC yielded the final Persian version of the questionnaire.
Conclusion: Following the EORTC Quality of Life Study Group guidelines in translating a standard measure of quality of life questionnaires could result in providing a version that conceptually is equivalent to the original questionnaire as we found it for the Persian version of the EORTC QLQ-SWB.

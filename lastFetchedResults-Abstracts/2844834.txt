The neuromechanics of human motion are generally represented in the literature by feedforward control mechanisms: the brain sends a control signal to a part of the body to move, and motion ensues. Thus neuromechanical commands for motion are influenced by control signals from neurocognitive inputs. However, feedback also exists from the neuromechanical system to the neurocognitive one, so that subsequent decisions related to motor commands are influenced by the motion itself. Recent work suggests that accounting for bidirectional feedback, both from neurocognitive to neuromechanical systems and from neuromechanical to neurocognitive ones, allows for more robust accounts of behavior. In this paper, we describe a neurocognitive model, a neuromechanical model, and a simple bidirectional feedback mechanism to couple the two systems. We then show that the behavior of the combined system is determined by the interaction of coupling strength and properties of the mechanical and cognitive models.

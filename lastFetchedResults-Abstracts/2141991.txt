The objective of the current study was to assess the applicability of the Pampean Diatom Index (the PDI) to natural communities other than epipelic diatom communities as well as those growing on artificial substrates in Monjolinho River and its tributaries, SÙ…o Carlos-SP, Brazil. Benthic diatoms and water quality sampling was done at 10 sites during summer base flow period (2008 and 2009). The PDI scores were calculated based on epilithic, epiphytic, epipsammic and epipelic diatom communities as well as those growing on bricks and glass substrates. Pearson correlation was used to determine the relationship between the PDI scores from different substrates sampled and measured physical and chemical water quality data. Two-way ANOVA was used to compare these correlation values among substrates. The PDI scores based on all the substrates showed significant correlations with physical and chemical variables. Insignificant differences in the PDI scores based on different natural substrates were recorded, with all substrates classifying the sites into to roughly the same categories. In the light of these results, the PDI can be applied to communities other than epipelic, and is applicable to the study area. The choice of substrate sampled may not affect accuracy of the PDI-based water quality assessment.

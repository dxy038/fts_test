The design of an axial-flow compressor stage for subcritical Mach numbers has been formulated as a non-linear multi-objective mathematical programming problem with the objective of minimizing the aerodynamic losses and the weight of the stage, while maximizing the compressor's stall margin. Aerodynamic as well as mechanical constraints are considered in the optimization solution. The prediction model for estimating the performance characteristics, such as efficiency, weight and stall margin, of the compressor stage is presented. The present design optimization procedure can be applied to a multi-stage compressor.

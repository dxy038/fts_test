Background: Obesity is a consequence of the excessive accumulation of fat in adipose tissue which can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Obesity is a major health problem in Iran. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of EPA consumption on BMI and fasting blood sugar by FABP2 genotypes and PPARα (Leu162Val, and G/C intron polymorphism) genotypes. Methods: A total of 170 hypertriglyceridemic subjects were selected and genotyped for Ala54Thr, using a polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. After determination of their FABP2 genotypes, the first 23 eligible subjects who were determined as Ala54 carriers and the first 23 eligible Thr54 carriers were enrolled in the study. Participants took 2 g/d of pure EPA (four gel caps, each containing 500 mg of ethylester EPA 90%). Height and weight were measured by a Seca scale with light clothing and no shoes on. BMI was then calculated. Waist and hip circumferences were measured with a flexible tape. Results: EPA supplementation decreased fasting blood sugar in Ala54 and Thr54 (p<0.001). No significant association was observed between BMI or fasting blood sugar and different FABP2 genotypes after EPA consumption. EPA supplementation increased BMI and decreased fasting blood sugar in Lue162 and Val162 (p<0.01), and interon 7 polymorphism (p<0.01). No interaction was observed between PPARα genotypes and degree of changes in BMI or fasting blood sugar after EPA supplementation. Conclusion: Although EPA consumption showed the effect of EPA response on FBS in Ala54 or Thr54 and Leu162 or Val162 in FABP2 and PPARα genotypes but no interaction was observed between these genotypes and EPA supplementation.

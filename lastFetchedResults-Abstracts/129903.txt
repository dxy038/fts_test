BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: cAMP as a second messenger and an intracellular regulatory agent has been considered to play a role in various biological processes. Some of compounds exert their effects via cAMP. In this study, the effect of cAMP on induction of apoptosis in alveolar macrophages was investigated.
METHODS: Alveolar macrophages were lavaged from rat lung and exposed to various concentrations of CAMP (0.5-200 µM) and then they were incubated for 24 hours at standard condition. The effect of cAMP was investigated by measuring percent of viable cells, superoxide anion production and DNA fragmentation,
FINDINGS: The results show that low concentrations of cAMP (<50 µM) enhance macrophage survival, but at higher concentrations (>100 µ.M) a significant decrease in the cell survival is occurred. Analysis of anion superoxide production indicates no significant increase using low concentrations of cAMP (<50 µM), but at higher concentrations of cAMP (>100 µM) both superoxide anion production and DNA fragmentation could be increased.
CONCLUSION: The results show that the effect profile of cAMP is dose dependent. So low concentrations of cAMP prevent apoptosis of macrophages, whereas at higher concentrations induces apoptosis in the cells.

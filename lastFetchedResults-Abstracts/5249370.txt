The objective of this work is to validate the Geant4 for mammographic applications. The computational geometry simulates a LORAD MIII mammographic equipment, operating into the range of 24 kVp up to 34 kVp with target-add filtration material and thickness Mo-30&#956;m Mo and Mo-25&#956;m Rh. Were compared values of normalized glandular dose (D<inf>gN</inf>) and backscattering factor (BSF). Were simulated non-antropomorphic models composed by a homogeneous distribution of BR12 and PMMA of dimensions (10 &#215; 12 &#215; 4) cm<sup>3</sup> and (10 &#215; 12 &#215; 8) cm<sup>3</sup>. We present the comparison of BSF of our simulation to Kramer, EUR report and Hoff published data. The results presented on this work can be considered a good agreement The validation using absolute dosimetric quantities like exposure and KERMA can be done, but it is important to define the number de photons emitted by mAs. We suggest the use of a semi-empirical correction factor based on tube enhancement test to realize this kind of validation.

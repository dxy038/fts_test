To develop a well-designed curriculum of service engineering is a prerequisite for training students get new skills and ability to design and develop globally effective solutions in a service business environment. As service engineering is an application-oriented discipline, sufficient practice is extremely important. In this paper, we show an experimental solution of a course "comprehensive practice on service engineering", which has been explored for three years in Harbin Institute of Technology. Its objective, process, execution program, and detailed design of each phase, are elaborately presented. Lessons learned from the explorations and future improvement on this solution, are briefly discussed.

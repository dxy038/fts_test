We propose an improved interpolation scheme for quincunx-subsampled images. Firstly, Gabor filters are used to analyze the texture orientation of each pixel in the quincunx-subsampled image. Secondly, bases on reproducing kernel space W<sup>2</sup> <sub>2</sub> (R) and W<sup>2</sup> <sub>2</sub> (R) times W<sup>2</sup> <sub>2</sub> (R) are applied for interpolation. Finally, a procedure is developed to reconstruct the missing pixels based on the above two steps. Experiments show that our scheme is better than the existing schemes, especially in objective term. Furthermore, applying it to the system of multiple description image coding with quincunx segmentation can improve the performance of that system

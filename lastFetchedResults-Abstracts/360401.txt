Study objective: To investigate the effects on knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported behaviors of a 1-week course of injury control and crash safety information integrated within a high school physics curriculum. Methods: Students in an intervention high school (n=129) were compared with students in a control high school (n=74) enrolled in a comparable physics curriculum. A standardized survey was administered before instruction (time T1), and at 2 weeks (T2) and 6 months (T3) after instruction was completed. The behaviors measured were self-reported use of seat belts, speeding, drinking and driving, and intention to use seat belts in the future. Results: At T2, students in the intervention group reported attitudes that were less favorable toward risk-taking in regard to speeding and seat belt use than those of the control group. At T3, there was still a difference in attitudes toward speeding but not toward seat belt use. The intervention significantly altered the knowledge level of the course participants, and these changes persisted to T3. The strongest and most persistent change was that students in the intervention group reported increasing their use of seat belts when riding as a passenger. (Seat belt use as a driver was high for both groups.) The intervention group showed a significant increase in their 1-year intentions to use seat belts both as a driver and as a passenger. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that driver safety education can be successfully integrated into a mainstream high school science curriculum. Future studies measuring the effects of this curriculum on observed behaviors are needed.

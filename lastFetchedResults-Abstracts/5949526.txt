In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm for scheduling a flying test probe for unpopulated MCM substrates. Our objective is to reduce the total time of MCM substrate testing by optimizing the traveling path of the probe. This paper first describes two algorithms: Lin-Kernighan (LK) and Simulated Annealing (SA). We then discuss our proposed algorithm which is the combination of SA and LK to optimize scheduling of the flying test probe. The algorithm is based on the single-ended probe testing method. We applied the algorithms to a real MCM substrate and obtained satisfactory low-cost results

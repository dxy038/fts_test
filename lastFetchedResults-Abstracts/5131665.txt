In this paper, the design of two types of RF windows, namely, double-disc RF window, and pillbox type RF window is presented for use in high power microwave/millimeter-wave sources. The design of double-disc RF window was carried out for a specific 42 GHz gyrotron, while the design of pillbox-type RF window was carried out for a specific 2.856 GHz klystron. A recent popular and efficient swarm intelligence based method - particle swarm optimization - was employed to get optimum geometrical parameters of RF windows. In order to get optimum trade-off between matching of resonant frequency and minimizing power reflections, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) was used. The results show the effectiveness of the method for the design of a large class of high power devices and components.

Abstract
Objective
The great majority of patients with childhood leukemia become long-term survivors. They treated with chemotherapy and prophylactic central nervous system (CNS) irradiation. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate effect of the long-term toxicity in ALL survivors, and possible effects of this treatment on their intellectual in compare with their sibling.
Materials and Methods
In this case-control study 40 children, 20 ALL patients and 20 their sibling, were evaluated. This study chose 20ALL patients, which they sibs were 1 or 2 years younger or older and same sex. Patients were diagnosed in Shahid Saduoghi hospital and treated with single chemotherapy (systemic and intrathecal) and radiation therapy (1800 rad).
Variables such as age, treatment outcome, genesis and the effect of prophylactic treatment of the CNS on the intellectual function of ALL patients were studied and compare with their healthy sibling by Wechsler intelligent test.
Results
Age range was between 6 to12 years old. The mean verbal IQ score for patients was 113.25+/-13.35 and in their sibling was 113.25+/-14.74. (p=1), therefore the differences was not significant.
Conclusion
The mean verbal IQ score for patients that received low dose radiotherapy was in the average range. These preliminary findings provide direction for future studies to help identify high-risk patients.

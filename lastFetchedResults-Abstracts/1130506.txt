Abstract:
Introduction:: Quality of the sea water and lakes is directly related to that of their  corresponding origin rivers. Most of the rivers, due to the inappropriate disposal of refuse, agricultural, industrial and hospital wastes, are seriously polluted.
Objective: This research study has determined the microbial contamination of coastal water of the Caspian Sea in Gulian province, northern Iran.
Materials and Methods: This study was carried out during the warm months, on the six coastal areas of the Caspian Sea in Guilan Province in 2011 and sampling was done to monitor the parameters for total coliform, Feacal coliform, Enterococcus faecalis,Temperature and pH, according to the standard methods of water and wastewater.
Results: Results indicate microbial contamination of coastal water. The maximum amount of bacterial load was found to be in July. The average results of total coliform and fecal coliform, were, respectively 363 and 125.8 MPN per 100 ml of the samples. Also, the average amount of Enterococcus faecalis was 27.3 CFU per 100 ml of sample. Bacterial load was directly associated with water temperature and pollution in all the stations was more than the standard limits. The highest amount of bacterial load was observed in Pasdaran station and the amounts, were respectively, as follows: total coliform more than 1100, fecal coliform = 460 MPN per 100 ml and Enterococcus faecalis  was greater than 100 CFU per 100 ml of sample.
Conclusion: There is a serious risk to the health of the swimmers who go swimming during the warm months of the year, because the contamination may cause some diseases, especially meningitis and intestinal infection.

This paper deals with the optimal design of pinned photodiodes on standard CMOS technologies for Time-of-Flight sensors with the twofold objective of minimizing the dark current while ensuring an optimal charge transfer. The results are verified through CAD simulations with realistic doping profiles for a standard 0.18 &#956;m CMOS technology. To the best of our knowledge, no similar analysis have been previously reported in the literature.

The paper presents an adequate simulation model in the Matlab environment of the electric transportation supply system behaviour finalized at the ESSs sizing. The algorithm simulates the operating conditions of any dc electric traction system and evaluates also the convenience of bidirectional electric substation for energy saving during the braking phase. The results given by the implemented algorithm have been compared with those obtained by using different probabilistic methods presented in the paper.

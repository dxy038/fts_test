Objective (s): Life expectancy is one of the most important summary measures and the main indicator of health. Accordingly, the objective of this research was studying the effect of inflation, health expenditure and urbanization on life expectancy in the Middle East and North Africa Countries (MENA).
Methods: This research was a causal-analysis by using panel data over the period of 2000 - 2012 for the countries of Middle East and North Africa. 
Results: Coefficients for each of the variables in the model were consistent with the theoretical bases. So that, one-unit increase in the inflation has decreased life expectancy by 3.17 units and also one-unit increase in each of the variables of health expenditure and urbanization, have increased life expectancy by 0.12 and 0.37 units respectively.
Conclusion: Given the positive impact of health expenditure and urbanization on life expectancy, special attention to the health sector and increasing public awareness on using insurance services is recommended. Also, with respect of the negative impact of inflation on life expectancy, it is suggested that by using appropriate policies, the policy makers prevent excessive price increases to provide the least purchasing power of people and therefore their physical and mental health.

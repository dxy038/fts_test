Orthogonal experimental design in general belongs to a single target design, using conventional visual analysis and variance analysis to select the best and the most influential factors combination. However, in actual production, the product needs more than one indicator to be inspected, belonging to multi-index test design, and each index on the influence degree of product performance is different, and there is a reasonable question of empowerment. Aiming at the difficulties in determining each experiment index weight by experimental design of an integrated multi-index weighted scoring method, this paper analyzed the respective shortcomings of current widely used subjective and objective weighting approach, proposed taking into account the subjective preferences and objective information in a comprehensive weight assignment method, so that a comprehensive analysis of the weighted scoring system more reasonable, in order to enhance the reliability of analysis results to find a new way.

Survivability is a key concern in modern network design. This paper investigates the problem of survivable dynamic connection provisioning in general telecom backbone networks, which are mesh structured. We assume differentiated services where connections may have different availability requirements, so they may be provisioned differently with protection (if needed) based on their availability requirements and current network state. The problem of effectively provisioning differentiated services requests, which has been widely investigated for connections routed at the physical layer, assumes peculiar features if we consider sub-wavelength requests at the logical layer that have to be protected (or more generically, whose availability target have to be guaranteed), but also have to be groomed for an efficient use of network resources. An integrated multilayer approach is necessary that considers requirements and grooming of connections at the logical layer as well as their routing and availability at the physical layer. Joint availability-guaranteed routing and traffic grooming may lead to a negative interaction, since the objective of the first problem (guaranteeing a given level of availability to the connections) clashes with the objective of the other problem (minimize resource consumption). For a multilayer WDM mesh network, we propose a new multilayer routing strategy which performs effectively availability-guaranteed grooming of sub-wavelength connections. The strategy jointly considers connection availability satisfaction and resource optimization. Numerical results show high effectiveness of our provisioning strategy.

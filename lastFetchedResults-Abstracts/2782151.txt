This letter proposes a new technique for realizing a nonuniform linear array with low sidelobe level (SLL) and beamwidth. The technique utilizes multiple-objective functions for this purpose. These functions are applied in a cyclic fashion to optimize the spacing, excitation, and phase variation of the elements using the Genetic Algorithm. The simulation analysis is performed on 12- and 128-element arrays. It is found that the present algorithm realizes the array with very low SLL of -26 dB and low beamwidth of 19.1&#176; for N=12-element array, and SLL of -20.2 dB and also low beamwidth of 1.8&#176; for N=128-element array.

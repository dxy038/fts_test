Function approximation has been found in many applications. The radial basis function (RBF) network is one approach which has shown a great promise in this sort of problems because of its faster learning capacity. A traditional RBF network takes Gaussian functions as its basis functions and adopts the least-squares criterion as the objective function, However, it still suffers from two major problems. First, it is difficult to use Gaussian functions to approximate constant values. If a function has nearly constant values in some intervals, the RBF network will be found inefficient in approximating these values. Second, when the training patterns incur a large error, the network will interpolate these training patterns incorrectly. In order to cope with these problems, an RBF network is proposed in this paper which is based on sequences of sigmoidal functions and a robust objective function. The former replaces the Gaussian functions as the basis function of the network so that constant-valued functions can be approximated accurately by an RBF network, while the latter is used to restrain the influence of large errors. Compared with traditional RBF networks, the proposed network demonstrates the following advantages: (1) better capability of approximation to underlying functions; (2) faster learning speed; (3) better size of network; (4) high robustness to outliers

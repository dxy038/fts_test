The world largest adobe citadel in Bam (Arg-e Bam) was damaged seriously in the 26 December 2003 earthquake. Since then many studies and researches have been done to restore this historical complex. One of the first structures in the citadel for which a restoration plan was prepared over a project was adobe tower No. 32. The objective of this project was studying the seismic behaviour of the tower to find out the cause of damage, the weakest parts of the structure in future earthquakes, the best way to improve the seismic performance, and the most approperiate restoration plan. This paper presents the study on seismic behaviour of tower No. 32 and its restoration plan.

Summary form only given, as follows. Non-thermal plasma process has been considered to be an effective method to remove NOx from flue gas. In order to optimize the reactor and provide the information for numerical simulation of NOx removal, it is important to study directly the discharge induced plasma chemical processes responsible for NOx removal in the reactor. Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) is a useful diagnostic method for in-situ observation of the phenomena during the NOx removal. The main objective of the presented work is visualization of two-dimensional NO concentration and monitoring the process of NOx removal inside the corona radical shower reactor. Planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) was employed for this purpose.

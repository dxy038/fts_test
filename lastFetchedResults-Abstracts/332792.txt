Objective
To evaluate the effects of Streptococcus mutans biofilm/restorative materials interaction on surface roughness, hardness and morphology of materials tested.
Methods

Empress 2 (E2), Filtek Supreme (FS), Vitremer (V) and Ketac Molar Easymix (KM) were tested. Twenty-five disks of each material were made and divided into three storage groups: (1) 100% relative humidity (n = 5); (2) growth medium (BHI and 1% sucrose) (n = 5); (3) S. mutans biofilm-growth medium (n = 15). Before storage, hardness measurements were immediately obtained from group 1 specimens. After 30 days of storage, the specimens were cleaned in order to obtain the surface roughness and hardness values, besides morphology analysis by scanning electron microscopy.
Results

The surface roughness and hardness values obtained from E2 and FS specimens did not present statistically significant differences among the groups 1, 2 and 3 and between immediate and 30-day-old specimens of each material. However, group 3 specimens of V and KM showed statistically significant higher surface roughness means than other groups. Group 1 specimens of V and KM also showed higher hardness values than the immediate values. Group 3 specimens of V presented decreased hardness values compared with other groups. The scanning electron micrographs showed an increase in surface degradation from group 1 to group 3 for FS, V and KM.
Conclusions

Thirty-day-old biofilm promotes a negative effect on the surface morphology of FS, V and KM, on the surface roughness of V and KM and on the hardness of V.

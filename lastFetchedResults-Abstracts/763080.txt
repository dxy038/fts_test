The goal of portfolio selection is to generate a portfolio that provides the highest
returns at a given level of risk. Harry Markowitz portfolio theory provides both the
conceptual framework and the analytical tools for determining the optimal portfolio
in a disciplined and objective way. The inputs from portfolio analysis can be used to
identify the set of efficient portfolios. From this set of portfolios, the optimal has to
be selected for investment. It is highly sensitive and quickly response to incidents
that happen in any corner of the world. Because of these reactions, stock market is
highly volatile. The volatile nature of a stock market makes it difficult to predict the
stock returns; the uncertainty in stock returns can be diversified. Next is systematic
risk, which is influenced by market factors and cannot be diversified. Furthermore,
the uncertainty of when to buy when to sells the stocks prevails all the time. Even all
these uncertainties, a large number of infesters tend to invest their money in common
stocks. Such investment common stocks can provide more substantial returns than
the provided by corporate and government bonds. Since return from investment on
common stock is uncertain, knowing the nexus between return and risk will be
crucial for investors. This helps them to maximize their returns and minimize their
risk. The possible increase and decrease in the price of a stock can be predicted in
relation to possible increase and decrease in market. This study evaluates the
investment strategies like buy and hold, and market timing.

Background: Embryo transfer to a developed endometrium is an important prognostic factor in frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycle outcome. Vaginal estrogen, such as Vagifem vaginal tablets and Premarin vaginal cream, is a regimen used for the patients with refractive endometria. Objective: Our objective was to compare the effects of Vagifem and Premarin on the endometrial thickness of the patients with refractive endometria. Materials and Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, 30 patients with refractive endometria in frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles received Vagifem vaginal tablets and 30 women received Premarin vaginal cream. Endometrial thickness was measured on the 14th day of drug administration. Results: Comparing the endometrial thicknesses of the two groups showed that the endometria of the Vagifem group was significantly thicker than that of the Premarin group (5.93±0.38 vs. 6.74±0.32; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Vagifem is superior to Premarin in induction of endometrial thickness in frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles in the patients with refractive endometria

Background and Objective: Pasta products are widely used all around the world. A variety of changes have been made to improve their nutritional values. This study aimed to investigate the use of wheat germ in preparing pasta as well as its effects on chemical, quality and microbial properties.
Materials and Methods: Pasta samples were made from flour blended with 10%, 15%, 20% wheat germ and kept for 6 months to be compared with control sample.
Results: Findings showed that by increasing the level of wheat germ, the studied factors improved accordingly; protein and fat content increased by 15% and 10%, respectively. Also the effects of cooking time (10, 20, 30 minutes) on cooking quality were studied. Results showed that by increasing the wheat germ, the cooking loss and cooking water acidity were increased. Pasta samples enriched with wheat germ were more desirable, showed more acceptable quality, and had significant differences in some tests compared to control sample. In microbial tests, pastas enriched with wheat germ showed more pollution during storage than the control sample. The color of different samples showed significant difference compared to control sample, so that the enriched samples were darker and the darkness increased by increasing the percent of the wheat germ. In taste panel evaluation, panelists preferred the texture and taste of the enriched pasta to that of control samples.
Conclusion: There was no significant difference between enriched samples and control sample in the overall score given by the panelists. It might be recommended to produce pasta enriched with wheat germ by 6 month shelf life.

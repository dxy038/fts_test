Ultrasonic motors have been attracting considerable attention in the last decades. Different types of ultrasonic motors have been constructed and manufactured. The objective of this paper is to propose a novel co-axial parallel ring type ultrasonic motor with double stators and double rotors for high output torque and electromagnetic compatibility application. Firstly, the configuration of the novel ultrasonic motor is presented. Several methods are employed to ensure the electromagnetic compatibility. Then, modeling studies focused on performance estimation and analyses of the novel motor are examined. Afterwards, operational performances of the novel motor are examined and compared with that of conventional ring type ultrasonic motor with single stator and single rotor. The results indicate that performances of the novel ultrasonic motor have been improved significantly compared with the conventional ultrasonic motor, which indicates promising prospect of the novel ultrasonic motor.

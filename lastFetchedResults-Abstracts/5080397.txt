An improved bridgeless boost-doubler rectifier is proposed for high-efficiency power-factor correction (PFC). In the proposed rectifier, the conduction losses are reduced by essentially eliminating the full-bridge diode rectifier. A bidirectional switch is used for the power switches, simplifying the overall power circuit structure. The reverse-recovery problems of the rectifying diodes are also reduced by using a simple passive snubber circuit. Zero-current turn-off of the rectifying diodes can be achieved, which removes the reverse-recovery losses of the rectifying diodes in the continuous conduction mode operation. The proposed rectifier provides high power-factor and improves power efficiency for low line voltage applications. The performance of the proposed rectifier is evaluated on an 800 W (400 V/2 A) experimental prototype at 110 V rms line voltage.

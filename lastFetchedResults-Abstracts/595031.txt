Objective: Diabetes Mellitus being a common disorder, having hyperlipidemia as one of major complications was studied.Materials and Methods: Patients with systemic diseases such as CRF, hypertension, nephrotic syndrome, myxoedema and SLE were excluded. Those cases who were on drugs like beta blockers, thiazide diuretics, steroids, alcohol etc were excluded from this study. Blood samples from all these established cases were taken for analysis for triglycerides alongwith other lipid profile.Results: The commonest finding was hypertriglyceridemia both in insulin and non insulin dependent diabetic patients. It was more so in non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (65%) as compared to insulin dependent diabetics (45%). Only few (3%), all females were having morbid levels of hypertriglyceridemia.Conclusions: Early diagnosis, good glycemic control and dietary modification are usually enough for prevention and treating hypertriglyceridemia in diabetes mellitus. Exercise not only reduces the serum lipid levels but also potentiates the effects of diet or drug therapy of glucose metabolism in diabetic patients. When these measures fail then lipid lowering drugs are instituted. HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors are of value in moderate to severe hypertriglyceridemia with coexisting hypercholestrolemia while severe hypertriglyceridemia alone is treated by fibrates.

Sensor nodes may be equipped with a "directional" sensing device (such as a camera) which senses a physical phenomenon in a certain direction depending on the chosen orientation. In this article, we address the problem of selection and orientation of such directional sensors with the objective of maximizing coverage area. Prior works on sensor coverage have largely focused on coverage with sensors that are associated with a unique sensing region. In contrast, directional sensors have multiple sensing regions associated with them, and the orientation of the sensor determines the actual sensing region. Thus, the coverage problems in the context of directional sensors entails selection as well as orientation of sensors needed to activate in order to maximize/ensure coverage. In this article, we address the problem of selecting a minimum number of sensors and assigning orientations such that the given area (or set of target points) is k-covered (i.e., each point is covered k times). The above problem is NP-complete, and even NP-hard to approximate. Thus, we design a simple greedy algorithm that delivers a solution that k-covers at least half of the target points using at most M log(k|C|) sensors, where |C| is the maximum number of target points covered by a sensor and M is the minimum number of sensor required to k-cover all the given points. The above result holds for almost arbitrary sensing regions. We design a distributed implementation of the above algorithm, and study its performance through simulations. In addition to the above problem, we also look at other related coverage problems in the context of directional sensors, and design similar approximation algorithms for them.

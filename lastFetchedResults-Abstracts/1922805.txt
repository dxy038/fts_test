Hereditary transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis is an adult-onset disease characterized mainly by peripheral neuropathy and cardiomyopathy. Although disease progression is usually 5 to 15 years from time of diagnosis to death, no specific measurements of disease progression have been identified. The present study was designed to identify objective parameters to measure progression of hereditary TTR amyloidosis and determine if these parameters would show significant change within 1 year. Nine patients with biopsy-proved TTR amyloidosis and evidence of cardiac involvement were studied at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram. Neurologic impairment score and electromyogram were determined at baseline and 12 months. Left ventricular mass determined by MRI and echocardiogram showed significant change at 12-month examination (p = 0.005 and p = 0.0009, respectively). Electrocardiogram and neurologic impairment score did not show significant change at 12 months. Measurement of left ventricular mass by MRI and echocardiographic techniques showed significant change in hereditary TTR cardiac amyloidosis within 1 year. In conclusion, these methods provide a means to clinically monitor progression of hereditary TTR amyloidosis and determine efficacy of therapeutic interventions.

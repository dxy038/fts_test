Objective: To establish a syndrome differentiation model and program of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) based on fuzzy recognition. Method: According to the syndrome differentiation system of five zang-organs, combined with approaching principle in the fuzzy mathematics, the fuzzy recognition model of heart system basic syndrome was established first, and then the program was designed based on this model. 200 medical records of heart system were tested retrospectively with the program. Result: The accurate rate of syndrome differentiation program was 84.5% Conclusion: The nonlinear mapping between heart basic syndromes and symptoms could be simulated by using fuzzy recognition. The thought of this paper could be applied to syndrome differentiation system of five zang-organs, which would provide methodology for syndrome standardization.

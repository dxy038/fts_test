Abstract
Objective: The aim of present study was to design the pattern of organizational effectiveness in selected sports federations of Iraq.
Methodology: Statistical population of this study were 221 managers, professional employees, coaches, elite athletes and referees of four sports federations such as football, basketball, weightlifting and track and field. 184 participated in our research (n=82 0/0). Eydi et alâ€™s (2012) organizational effectiveness questionnaire was used for data gathering. 12 sport management scholars approved the validity of questionnaire and also reliability was calculated to be .97 0/0. Lisrel software was used for confirmatory factor analysis and verifying fitting model and relationships between constructs.
Results: The results showed that work force expertise (.88 0/0), organizational interaction (.88 0/0), productivity (.87), work force cohesion (.84 0/0), planning (.84 0/0), stability (.81 0/0), flexibility (.780/0), and resources (.74 0/0) had the most impact on organizational effectiveness respectively. Confirmatory factor analysis results showed that patterns of internal process model (e.g., organizational interaction & stability) and rational-goal model (e.g., planning & productivity) were most important models for organizational effectiveness in Iraq sports federations. Also, football, track and field, weightlifting and basketball federations obtained highest means of organization effectiveness respectively.
Conclusion: According to our results, in order to achieve organizational effectiveness in Iraq sports federations we suggest that attention should be paid to a variety of indices; among the most important ones are the use and recruitment of skilled and professional workforces.
Keywords: Competing value framework, Iraqi sports federations, Organizational effectiveness.

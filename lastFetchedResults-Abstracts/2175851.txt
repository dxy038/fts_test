Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin that causes renal tumors in rats, particularly in males. In previous kinetic studies performed in fed conditions (Vettorazzi et al., 2008), mature F344 male rats presented a significantly lower OTA bioavailability than females and young animals. The objective of the present study was to evaluate two factors which could explain this different kinetic profile: the presence of food and the male-specific protein alpha-2u-globulin. Therefore, a 24 h kinetic study has been performed in rats under fasting conditions. Food ingestion has been controlled in both sexes during two months. The presence of alpha-2u-globulin in the urine has been analyzed with SDS-gradient mini-gel electrophoresis.

g tends to increase the maximum OTA plasma concentrations and the rate of absorption. The relative bioavailability is significantly increased under fasting conditions only in males. Mature males consumed a higher amount of food but, as the OTA dose administered, it was proportional to body weight. The reason why the OTA bioavailability is more affected in presence of food only in males is unclear. Several possibilities, such as differences in gastric emptying, OTA-food interactions and the involvement of alpha-2u-globulin are discussed.

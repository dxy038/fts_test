The objective of this research is to study the antecedents of technology trust and its perceived consequences. The purpose is first to find potential factors behind the technology trust, evaluate their significance empirically, and then assesses the relationship between technology trust and perceived performance. Special attention is given to the behavior of technologists, people who have technological education, experience, and who are currently working in a high-tech organization. Empirical results confirm the underlying roles of social, institutional and technological dimensions behind the technology trust and, as a consequence, the explaining power of the trust on perceived organizational performance.

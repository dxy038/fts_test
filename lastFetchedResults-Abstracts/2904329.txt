We consider the problem of efficient virtual optical network (VON) mapping in a multi-domain optical network (VON-MD) with the objective of minimizing total network link cost for a given VON demand that is embedded over the multi-domain optical network. Topology aggregation (TA) is used to exchange intra and inter-domain information between domains, and heuristic algorithms are proposed for embedding considering different domain selection techniques and virtual link ordering techniques. We provide an integer linear programming formulation (ILP-VON-MD) to compare with our heuristic approaches. Numerical results show that our heuristic approaches are effective in reducing total network cost.

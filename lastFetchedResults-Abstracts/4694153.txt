Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) can lead to huge savings and may be essential to survival in a competitive environment; but decisions to redesign business processes are often based upon little more than heuristics and gut feelings. Dynamic modeling techniques add rigor to BPR, however, off-the-shelf simulation software is not generally well-tailored to the BPR approach. We have developed a Dynamic Modeling Toolkit (DMT) utilizing pre- and post- processors to customize CACI\Â´s SIMprocess as a BPR tool. A front-end data repository supports management of a large BPR analysis and aids formulation of SIMprocess models of business operations. A back-end processor combines results from simulations of system components into a hierarchy, and supports a "black box" approach where component models can be replaced by alternative designs to assess the impact on the overall system. The DMT provides a comprehensive evaluation of system performance, yielding objective and rigorous economic justification for redesign.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Objective.  To report a retrospective series of marginal mandibulectomy for cancers of oral cavity, with special reference to squamous cancers of gingival buccal complex.

Methods. Retrospective record review of 107 patients who underwent marginal mandibulectomy between 1994 and 2001.

Results. Eighty-three marginal mandibulectomies were done for gingivo-buccal complex cancers. Local failure rate was 16%. The 2-year and 5-year disease free survival rates were 69 and 60%, respectively. The local recurrence free survival at the end of 2 and 5 years were 79 and 70%, respectively.

Conclusion. In carefully selected patients, marginal mandibulectomy is an oncologically safe procedure to achieve good local control.

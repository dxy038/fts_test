Objective(s): Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Every year, one million new cases are reported worldwide, representing 18% of the total number of cancer in women. Hereditary BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations account for about 60% of inherited breast cancer and are the only known causes of hereditary breast cancer syndrome. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of BRCA2 (exon2 and exon11) gene mutation in patients with early-onset breast cancer among Iranian Azeri-Turkish women.
Materials and Methods: We obtained clinical information, family history and peripheral blood from 110 women under the age of 45 with early-onset breast cancer for scanning germline mutations in the exon2 and 11 of BRCA2 genes which comprises over 50% of the gene. Single-strand conformation polymorphism assay was used in order for screening potential mutations on amplified regions followed by direct sequencing analysis to determine the genotypes.
Results: Overall, 11 sequence variants were identified in this study group, including four homozygotes and seven heterozygotes silent substitution of c.3807T to C, p.Val1269Val (rs543304).
Conclusion: Mutations in BRCA2 were surprisingly infrequent in the early onset breast cancer patients among Iranian Azeri-Turkish women.

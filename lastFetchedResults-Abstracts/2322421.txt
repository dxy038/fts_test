Introduction & Objective: Chronic tonsillitis with caseum has been proven to be the cause of halitosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of temperature-controlled radiofrequency tonsil ablation in the treatment of halitosis caused by chronic tonsil-litis with caseum.
Materials & Methods: In this clinical trial study 28 adult patients with halitosis due to chronic tonsillitis with caseum were treated by temperature-controlled radiofrequency tonsil ablation and efficacy and complications of procedure were recorded and the data were analyzed by Spss software and paired t-test.
Results: The difference between the amount of halitosis was statistically significant before and after the procedure (P  < 0.001). Patientsâ€™ pain were mild to moderate .Mild bleeding occurred in 21% of patients and 79% had no bleeding. In average 3.14 days after the procedure patients tolerated regular diet and after 1.96 days they could do their daily routines.
Conclusion: Temperature-controlled radiofrequency tonsil ablation is a safe and effective method for treatment of halitosis due to chronic tonsillitis with caseum and have several ad-vantages compared to conventional tonsillectomy such as reduced post-operative pain and bleeding, shorter recovery time and convenience of an office procedure.

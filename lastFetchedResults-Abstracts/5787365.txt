This paper intends to investigate a comprehensive evaluation method for material purchasers´ performance with the consideration of the existing corruption. Firstly, the paper puts forward the multi-level evaluation index system of purchasers based on the objective of corporation strategy. After indexes´ weights are determined by using AHP, a multi-level gray evaluation model for material purchaser´s performance is presented on its gray characteristic. This paper proposes a new method with a rough set approach to evaluate the purchaser´s corruption degree, based on the purchasers´ financial statements. After using a rough set based feature selection technique to get the main affecting factors on materials´ price, a mathematical model for purchasers´ financial credit rating is proposed with regression analysis and price D-value analysis. Finally, the model has been verified by adopting a group of experimental data and shows superiority in preventing excessive corruption.

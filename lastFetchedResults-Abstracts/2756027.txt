Vehicular communication networks are increasingly being considered as a means to conserve fuel and reduce emissions within transportation systems. This paper focuses on using traffic light signals to communicate with approaching vehicles. The communication can be traffic-light-signal-to-vehicle (TLS2V) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V). Based on the information sent, the vehicle receiving the message adapts its speed to a recommended speed (S<sub>R</sub>), which helps the vehicle reduce fuel consumption and emissions. The key contribution of this paper is the proposal of a comprehensive optimization model that involves V2V and TLS2V communications. The objective function is to minimize fuel consumption by and emissions from vehicles. The speed that can achieve this goal is the optimum S<sub>R</sub> (S<sub>R</sub>*). We also propose efficient heuristic expressions to compute the optimum or near-optimum value of S<sub>R</sub>.

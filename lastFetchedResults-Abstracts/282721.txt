The purpose of the present research was to provide evidence for the validity of the Multidimensional Parenting Perfectionism Questionnaire (MPPQ), an objective self-report instrument designed to measure multiple aspects of parenting perfectionism. Data from two separate samples provided evidence that the MPPQ parenting perfectionism tendencies were systematically related to parenting styles, parenting satisfaction, parental bonding, and attachment tendencies. The discussion focuses on the implications of these research findings and future directions for research with the Multidimensional Parenting Perfectionism Questionnaire.

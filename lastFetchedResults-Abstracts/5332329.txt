According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the rate of serious injury in passenger vehicle rollover crashes is 36 percent higher than in crashes with no rollover. An ideal emergency notification system would detect life threatening events immediately and then notify service providers within a short period of time without any human intervention, with necessary information to permit the delivery of appropriate type of help quickly. While there are very few existing systems that have similar functions, none of them perform the event notification without the help of human intervention. At the same time, these systems are very costly and vehicle specific. The objective of this work is to design and develop an economical general purpose wireless emergency event notification system for vehicles that might roll over. This system uses wireless channels to dispatch necessary information to emergency service providers for acquiring necessary help, with no requirement for human intervention.

In this paper, the authors propose a new practical multi-objective optimization framework that combines optimization method, modeling and simulation technologies organically. The new framework is called Multi-Objective Integrated Optimization that combines Multi-Objective Differential Evolution and Radial Basis Function Network. This new framework is used to reduce the number of accesses to a simulator or a sensing system with heavy computational load. According to the numerical experiment on typical benchmark problems, it is shown that the proposed Multi-Objective Integrated Optimization obtains good Pareto solutions with drastic reduction in the number of function calls for evaluating the performance index values of systems.

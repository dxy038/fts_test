The behavior of several absorption lines under different atomization conditions (from tube wall, Lâ€™vov platform and with and without modifier) and the maintenance of the carrier gas flow during atomization were studied with the objective of expanding the working concentration range in the determination of Sn, Ni and Fe in brass alloy samples by on-line anodic electrodissolution and electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). The employment of several lines and atomization conditions does not seem to affect the precision with any of the investigated metals. The upper working limit for Sn, Ni, and Fe is approximately 1.5, 3.5 and 4.0 times higher, respectively, under stop gas flow conditions using the less sensitive line than under the most sensitive condition. When combined with the use of resonance lines, non-stop gas flow could be a promising alternative especially for Ni and Fe. The use of non-stop gas flow in combination with non-resonance lines should be avoided. The detection limit and the sensitivity can be adjusted better by employing elevated currents in the electrodissolution step.

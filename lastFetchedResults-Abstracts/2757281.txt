Considering simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), we investigate cooperative-jamming (CJ) aided robust secure transmission design in multiple-input-single-output channels, where a cooperative jammer introduces jamming interferences and assists a source to supply wireless power for both an energy receiver and a legitimate destination. The destination employs a power splitting (PS) scheme to split the received signals for both information decoding and energy harvesting (EH). Compared with conventional transmission without SWIPT, the transmission with SWIPT should satisfy additional worst-case EH constraints. Furthermore, the PS scheme introduces an additional multiplicative optimization variable, i.e., the PS factor. Our objective is to maximize worst-case secrecy rate under transmit power constraints and worst-case EH constraints. We propose to decouple the problem into three optimization problems and employ alternating optimization algorithm to obtain the locally optimal solution. For the optimization of transmit covariance matrices and PS factor, we propose to employ the S-procedure and its extension to reformulate it as a convex semidefinite programming. It is shown through the simulation results that our proposed CJ aided robust secure transmission scheme outperforms the robust direct transmission scheme without CJ and the CJ aided non-robust scheme.

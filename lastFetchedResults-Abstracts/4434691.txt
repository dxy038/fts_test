An analysis is made of various reflection components which influence the requirements placed on passive optical networks (PONs). Reflections due to connectors, splitters, optical detectors, and fiber backscatter are investigated to reveal each componentÂ´s impact on overall system performance or design requirements. Architecture specifications are recommended to successfully deploy passive distribution architectures in the local loop, particularly if bidirectional operation and/or redundant headend electronics are desired

Objective: Oximes are important materials in organic chemistry. Synparamethyl benzaldehyde
oxime (toloaldoxime) is structurally similar to other oximes, hence we have studied
its effects on the neonatal and adult female Balb/c mice reproductive systems in order to
provide a platform for future studies on the production of female contraceptive drugs.
Materials and Methods: In experimental study, we studied the effects of toloaldoxime
on ovary growth and gonadal hormones of neonatal and adult Balb/c mice. A regression
model for prediction was presented.
Results: The effects of toloaldoxime on neonatal mice were more than adult mice.
The greatest effect was on the number of Graafian follicles (59.6% in adult mice and
31.83% in neonatal mice). The least effect was on ovary weight, and blood serum levels
of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).
Conclusion: According to the data obtained, toloaldoxime can be considered an antipregnancy
substance.

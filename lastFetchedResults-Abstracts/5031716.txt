In this paper, we consider reconfiguration of the virtual topology of a wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical network. The traffic generated by the higher layers is dynamic; hence reconfiguration is carried out in order to maximize resource utilization. We consider reconfiguration with the objective of minimizing congestion. Priority levels are assigned to the lightpaths between various node pairs based on the traffic. During reconfiguration, new lightpaths are established and existing lightpaths are removed from congested links based on the priority levels. The earlier works considered traffic volume as the basis for reconfiguration. Thus priority is given to traffic with higher priority levels. The results for congestion with and without reconfiguration have been obtained

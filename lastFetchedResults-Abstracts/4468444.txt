This paper presents a novel mathematical model to calculate system average interruption frequency index (SAIFI). Then a proper objective function relevant to improve the SAIFI is proposed. The proposed objective function increases the reliability of the distribution system by minimizing the costs of decreasing the failure rates of the distribution lines. The results of the optimization problem can minimize the SAIFI by a minimum cost. It means the proposed method leads electrical companies to optimize investment in order to improve reliability indices by minimized cost.

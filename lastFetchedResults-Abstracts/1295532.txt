This paper deals with a class of multiple objective linear programs (MOLP) called lexicographic multiple objective linear programs (LMOLP). In this paper, by providing an efficient algorithm which employs the preceding computations as well, it is shown how we can solve the LMOLP problem if the priority of the objective functions is changed. In fact, the proposed algorithm is a kind of sensitivity analysis on the priority of the objective functions in the LMOLP problems.

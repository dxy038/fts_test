This paper presents a QoS management architecture for VoIP networks. Voice quality, specifically MOS (mean opinion score), is continuously and automatically monitored by using an objective voice quality evaluation tool for periodically generated test calls carrying artificial voice signals. Edge-to-edge measurement based admission control is used to maintain packet loss rates for both directional voice flows below a predetermined value under various traffic conditions. A network design method is given to meet target blocking probability and packet loss rate. Simulation is used to evaluate network performance such as blocking probabilities and packet loss rates for the network with edge-to-edge measurement based admission control. It is shown that admission control works well to control packet loss rate under various network conditions

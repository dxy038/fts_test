High-precision geometric correction algorithms for a bidirectionally scanned image that are based on separate geometric models according to the distortion characteristics are described. The modeling accuracy is evaluated through the use of simulated and observed Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images. TM images include a discontinuous distortion and a high-frequency distortion due to attitude fluctuations and bidirectional scans. A geometric model consisting of a single-valued-function is used to correct these distortions. The iteration calculation of the mapping cannot be converged, resulting in an enormous amount of calculation and data. Therefore, geometric models consisting of separate geometric models of the bidirectional scans and frequency components are proposed

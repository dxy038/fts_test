Scrap tyres were pyrolysed in a fixed bed reactor and the evolved pyrolysis gases were passed through a condenser system maintained at separately controlled temperature to determine the yield and composition of the condensed oil. The main objective was to maximise the selective condensation of single ring aromatic compounds which are of known higher commercial value. In addition, the molecular weight range of the condensed oils was also determined. The influence of condenser packing material was also examined. The results showed that the type of packing material within each condenser was also examined and found to be important in determining the yield and composition of the condensed oil. Similarly, condenser temperatures determined the yield and also composition of the oils. Maximum concentrations of single ring aromatic compounds in relation to the selective condensation process showed significant increases in the concentration of certain compounds could be achieved in the condensed oils collected in each condenser.

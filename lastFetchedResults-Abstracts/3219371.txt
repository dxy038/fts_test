Breast Cancer Conservative Treatment (BCCT) is now the preferred technique for breast cancer treatment. The limited reproducibility of standard aesthetic evaluation methods led to the development of objective methods, such as Breast Cancer Conservative Treatment.cosmetic results (BCCT.core) software tool. Although the satisfying results, there are still limitations concerning complete automation and the inability to measure volumetric information. With the fundamental premise of maintaining the system as a low-cost tool, the incorporation of the Microsoft Kinect sensor in BCCT evaluations was studied. The aim with this work is to enable the simultaneous detection of breast contour and breast peak points using depth-map data. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is accurate and robust for a wide number of patients. Additionally, comparatively to previous research, the procedure for detecting prominent points was automated.

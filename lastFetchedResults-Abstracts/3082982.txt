The satellite module layout problem belongs to the constrained multi-objective optimization problem. Taking the layout design of an international commercial communication satellite as a background, a human-guided genetic algorithm for the satellite module layout problem is proposed, in which a new selection strategy is adopted based on the DebÂ´s constrained-domination principle and the engineering requirements, then in order to combine the respective strengths of human and computers, a heuristic artificial individuals adding rule is proposed to add the artificial individuals into population to operate with the algorithm individuals to guide the whole optimization process. The experimental results show that the human-guided genetic algorithm is superior to the GALib on computational precision, efficiency and stability

Objective: Electro-magnetic radiation (EMR) is emitted from mobile phones. Various researches have shown relationships between mobile phone EMR exposure to cancer and neurologic damages. This study aims to investigate the effects of mobile phone EMR on brain antioxidant enzyme activity and the learning process.
Methods: Rat pups and their dames were exposed to EMR for 3 h per day from P2 to P14. After separation of male and female rats on P22, the rats were housed in an air room under normal animal conditions. From P59 to P61, male rats were trained three times per day for a total of 3 days. On P62, their behavior was assessed. The rats were sacrificed by decapitation and the levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase in their brains were assessed. 
Results: The amount of time to locate the hidden platform and time spent exhibiting freezing behavior increased in exposed group compared to the control group. Superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were reduced in the mobile phone group.
Conclusion: Additional studies are necessary to clarify the relationship between mobile phone radiation and brain tissue with regards to antioxidant enzyme activities, learning and memory. Our results suggest that mobile phone radiation may lead to decreased learning that is induced by abnormalities in antioxidant enzyme activities.

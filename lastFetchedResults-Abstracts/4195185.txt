The objective of multiple description coding (MDC) is to encode a source into two (or more) bitstreams supporting two quality levels of decoding. A high-quality reconstruction should be decodable from the two bitstreams together, while lower, but still acceptable, quality reconstructions should be decodable from either of the two individual bitstreams. This paper describes techniques for meeting MDC objectives in the framework of standard transform-based image coding through the design of pairwise transforms

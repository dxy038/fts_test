Reliability evaluation methods are applicable in various engineering fields. A specific method may be used in analyzing and evaluating the reliability in different systems. The cut and tie set analysis method is applied to reliability analysis. Cut and tie set analysis method based on the reliability diagram, a set of minimal elements whose failure results in cutting off all incoming and outgoing routes is studied and thus the system stays operational even when at least one of the elements is still functioning properly. Through the use of this method, one can replace complex system reliability formulae with those that apply to parallel as well as series systems according to the logic behind their operation. This objective was attained by the present work through simultaneous use of this Method and programming done by the Matlab software. One needs to have a full grasp of a system in order to evaluate its reliability proficiently. Finally, this paper has come to providing a model of complex node for ADCS, EPS and thermal subsystem in a cube satellite whose life mission is designed to be five consecutive years, which was simplified by the simple network.

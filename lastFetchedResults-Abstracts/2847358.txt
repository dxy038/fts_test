In this paper, the nonlinear optimal control problem is formulated as a multi-objective mathematical optimization problem. Harmony search (HS) algorithm is one of the new heuristic algorithms. The differential harmony search (DHS) optimization algorithm is introduced for the first time in solving the optimal power flow(OPF) solution. A case on optimal power flow problem in the IEEE 30 bus system is presented to show the methodologyÂ´s feasibility and efficiency, compared with the existing optimal power flow problem in power system methods, the search time of the DHS optimization algorithm is shorter and the result is close to the ideal solution, simultaneously.

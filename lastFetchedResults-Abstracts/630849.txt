The objective of this research is to further our understanding of how and
why individuals enter and leave coresidential relationships. We develop and estimate
an economic model of nonmarital cohabitation, marriage, and divorce
that is consistent with current data on the formation and dissolution of relationships.
Jovanovic’s (Journal of Political Economy 87 (1979), 972–90) theoretical
matching model is extended to help explain household formation and dissolution
behavior. Implications of the model reveal what factors influence the decision
to start a relationship, what form this relationship will take, and the relative stability
of the various types of unions. The structural parameters of the model are
estimated using longitudinal data from a sample of female high school seniors
from the United States. New numerical methods are developed to reduce computational
costs associated with estimation. The empirical results have interesting
interpretations given the structural model. They show that a significant cause of
cohabitation is the need to learn about potential partners and to hedge against
future bad shocks. The estimated parameters are used to conduct several comparative
dynamic experiments. For example, we show that policy experiments
changing the cost of divorce have little effect on relationship choices.

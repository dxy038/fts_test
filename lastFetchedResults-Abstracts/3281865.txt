This paper presents the development of an unmanned aerial vehicle of type quadrotor, its dynamic model, besides simulations and tests of a PID controller for the projected structure embedded stabilization (vertical direction motion). This vehicle is characterized by having four motors, which are responsible for generating the platform movement. This work objective is to show a structure, type quadrotor, development (design and construction), presenting a mathematical model of quad rotor based on the Newton-Euler formalism and a microcontroller system project used for the PID controller, used for stabilization and driving the motors, as well as the classical PID controller simulation in Simulink&#174;/Matlab environment and the tests in the developed structure.

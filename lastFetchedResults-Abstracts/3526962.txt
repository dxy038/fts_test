Images formed with endoscopes suffer from a spatial distortion due to the wide-angle nature of the endoscopeÂ´s objective lens. This change in the size of objects with position precludes quantitative measurement of the area of the objects, which is important in endoscopy for accurately measuring ulcer and lesion sizes over time. A method for correcting the distortion characteristic of endoscope images is presented. A polynomial correction formula was developed for the endoscope lens and validated by comparing quantitative test areas before and after the distortion correction. The distortion correction has been incorporated into a computer program that could readily be applied to electronic images obtained at endoscopy using a desk-top computer. The research presented here is a key step towards the quantitative determination of the area of regions of interest in endoscopy

This paper considers beamforming problem in relay-assisted multi-user communication and presents an efficient algorithm to solve Min-max optimization of information throughput under limited power resources. We use DC programming and penalty function method to handle the inherent non-convexity of the associated objective function and follow an iterative procedure to solve for the global optimal beamforming vector. Extensive simulations are performed to establish the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm over conventional techniques based on randomization.

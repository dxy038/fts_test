The objective of this review is to describe the suitability of different biomaterials as coronary stents. This review focuses on the following topics: (1) different materials used for stents, (2) surface characteristics that influence stentâ€“biology interactions, (3) the use of polymers in stents, and (4) drug-eluting stents, especially those that are commercially available.

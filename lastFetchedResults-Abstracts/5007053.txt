This paper presents the results of a theoretical analysis of SONET bidirectional rings. It provides significant insight into ring planning by studying the impact of the number of nodes on a ring, realizable assignments, and ring interconnection. A new concept of realizable assignments is developed and studied. Realizable assignments provide a pragmatic method of determining the assignment capacity of the Bidirectional Line Switched Rings. The ring interconnection analysis studies the impact of inter-ring vs. intra-ring demand, drop and continue, and DS1 grooming at ring interconnect nodes on the economic prove-in of rings

Background
A phase I trial was initiated to define the feasibility and safety of single-lung isolation perfusion with tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and moderate hyperthermia for patients with unresectable pulmonary metastases.
Methods

Twenty patients with lung metastases (Ewing's, 2; sarcoma, 8; melanoma, 6; other, 4) were considered for single-lung isolation perfusion with 0.3 to 6.0 mg of tumor necrosis factor-α and 0.2 mg interferon-γ, delivered through an oxygenated pump circuit. Sixteen perfusions were performed in 15 patients (bilateral in 1). Metastases were completely resected (no single-lung isolation perfusion) in 3 patients, 1 patient had extrapulmonary disease, and one single-lung isolation perfusion was aborted for mechanical reasons.
Results

There were no significant changes in systemic arterial blood pressure or cardiac output during perfusion. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure increased with isolation, but returned to pre-single-lung isolation perfusion levels after clamp release. The maximum systemic tumor necrosis factor-α level was 8 ng/mL, whereas pump-circuit levels ranged from 200 to 10,976 ng/mL. There were no deaths, and the mean hospitalization period was 9 days (range, 5 to 34 days). A short-term (6 to 9 month) unilateral decrease in perfused nodules was noted in 3 patients (melanoma in 1, adenoid cystic carcinoma in 1, renal cell carcinoma in 1).
Conclusions

Future studies using a combination of biologic modifiers, chemotherapy, and hyperthermia should be pursued to define active cytotoxic agents that will preserve underlying pulmonary function.

This text assigned to the separating-planting mechanism of the key component of the rice seeding transplanter as the main research object, with the planetary elliptic gears as example, through developing the software of the theory model, adopting the optimization algorithm in the mechanical design, optimizing the eight optimization parameters and more than ten optimization goals, solving the separating-planting mechanism of the strong coupling, fuzziness and non-linear multi-parameter multi-objective optimization problems. Through the human-computer interaction method proposed "star judging method" based on .NET, through "parameters adjustment" function, transferred the knowledge from the expert\Â´s body to the enterprise in the related fields of users and researchers, provided a "fool" platform for the person of the research institution and those who designed products, achieving the goal of developing and studying quickly. The application of information technique to other various transplanting mechanism and other machinery of theoretical analysis and design has a certain significance.

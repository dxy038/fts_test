BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recently, the use of mobile technology has significantly increased in a number of fields. With regard to the increasing development of information and communication technologies and the pervasive use of mobile devices for educational purposes, we aimed to evaluate the factors affecting the acceptance of mobile learning use. 
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on the medical students of Babol University of Medical Sciences during 2013-2014. Data related to the acceptance of mobile learning including age, gender, type of device, as well as the time and place of device use, were collected using a questionnaire; afterwards, the obtained data were evaluated. 
FINDINGS: Mobile learning was not significantly correlated with age, gender, or time of  device use among the students of Babol University of Medical Sciences. However, mobile learning was significantly correlated with the type of device and the place of use. 
CONCLUSION: The results showed that the type of device and the place of use had significant impacts on the acceptance of mobile learning. 
KEY WORDS: Effective Factors, Acceptance, Mobile Learning.

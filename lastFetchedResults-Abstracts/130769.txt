Introduction: Fasting in word means refuse to eat or drink, and not to do or say anything unreligious. Fasting affects spiritual and emotional aspects of human and stress is also an emotional variable.
Although it is believed that a little stress is necessary for daily living but excess stress has serious side effects on body, mind and social relationships. In last years, there has been an increasing emphasis on decreasing stress by means of non - invasive and non - medical methods that are justified in a particular culture.
The researchers were interested to assess the effects of fasting in Ramadan on students' level of stress through an applied research.
Objective: The main goal of study was to determine the relationship between fasting and students' stress level during and after Ramadan. The assumption of the study was that fasting affects students' stress level.
Materials and Methods: This study was cross - sectional and the sample consisted of 110 male students living in dormitories who were randomly chosen. The data collection instrument was a two-part questionnaire. The first part covered demographic data and the second part consisted of Hamilton's Stress Checklist. At first, students' stress level was measured at fourth week of Ramadan and then after a month, it was remeasured.
Results: The results indicated that the students stress level was medium and showed a significant correlation between stress during and after Ramadan (P< %0t). Stress decrease was not related to age, level of education or tea consumption assumption. Smokers had higher level of stress in Ramadan (P< %05).
Conclusion: The research results showed that the study assumption was accepted and fasting in Ramadan influences student's stress level.

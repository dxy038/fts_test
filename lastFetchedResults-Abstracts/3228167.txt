Continual improvement in the quality of products, processes, and services has been facilitated by applying statistical methods. The statistical process control technique (SPC) provides enhanced results, as it utilizes statistical methods throughout all the developmental stages of a project and/or production. One of these techniques is control charts, which are powerful tools for viewing and understanding different types of process variations. Therefore, it is essential for professionals linked to engineering and technological fields to be familiar with these techniques and software programs, in order to facilitate the development process for creating control charts. The majority of these software programs designed for easy utilization and friendly interface for SPC applications are sold at high prices and thereby make access impossible to this computational resource for freelance professionals, small businesses, and especially students. The GNU R interface is open source and provides free access as one of the alternatives. So, for this purpose, this paper presents the description and application of control charts in three different R interfaces, as its objective is to use them for the teaching and learning process.

In order, the controlling objective of the minimum structural displacements was aimed to be controlled to improve the comfort of high storey building with the nonlinear characteristics in damping coefficient and rigidity of building structure. The similar model of building structure of three-storey was made based on similarity theory, the 4-DOF vibration system was built up and the parameter of MRF absorber was optimized and designed, while the mass and damping coefficient and rigidity were obtained according to the characteristic of structure; a set of testing system of semi-active vibration control used for building was designed and the effect of damper on shock absorber was studied, under the circumstances of taking the natural frequency and strength of external magnetic field synchronously, swing of structure decreases obviously after fixing the MRF absorber and the vibrating process is reposeful, verifying the effect of MRF absorber on shock absorber.

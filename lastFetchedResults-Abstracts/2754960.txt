In this study, a novel network reinforcement model incorporating optimal wind farms (WFs) integration to power systems is proposed. Based on the reinforcement model, new transmission lines are added to the network for eliminating the transmission network congestion. In addition, a methodology for determining the WFs optimal capacities, the economical WF lines transfer rates and the appropriate reinforcement plan, whereas maximising the total benefit using cost-reliability analysis is presented. In this way, the objective of the proposed optimisation problem has been divided into a master problem and two subproblems. Benders decomposition is employed to connect the master and subproblems of the model. In order to assess the validity of the proposed method, it is applied to the IEEE 24-bus test system under three different scenarios.

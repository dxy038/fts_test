Our objective is to create a unique environment consisting of a magnetized high energy density plasma (n ~ 10<sup>19</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>, T ~ 10 keV) produced by laser irradiation of atomic or molecular clusters in a megagauss magnetic field. With deuterium or CD<sub>4</sub> clusters the DD fusion neutron yield can be up to 10<sup>7</sup> neutrons/shot. Requirements on the magnetic field source are: on-axis field strength of 1-2 megagauss in a cylindrical volume of 1 cm<sup>3</sup> (reaching &#946;~ 1 for 10 keV plasma), portability so it can be installed at laser facilities e.g. Texas Petawatt Laser (TPW), operation in vacuum conditions, and constant field for ~100 ns. In a collaboration between the University of Texas at Austin (UT) and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), we have designed, built, and tested a pulsed power source suitable for cluster fusion experiments at the TPW. Some of the salient design features include use of low inductance circuit elements, a single-turn coil, ten 3.1 &#956;F 100 kV high energy density capacitors (15.5 kJ each), and one high voltage spark gap switch per capacitor. Each capacitor discharges via six high voltage cables into a conical transmission line, which feeds into a vacuum chamber through an insulator stack similar to that of the Z machine at SNL. Current rise time is 1.7 &#956;s with peak current up to 2 MA; system inductance is about 48 nH, including the single-turn coil. A major challenge was to drive the current through the coil in vacuum conditions without a significant inductance penalty or damage to the vacuum system. The single-turn coil, made from 1/8" thick copper, is destroyed every shot. Clearing shot debris, replacing the coil, and achieving the required vacuum pressure of &#8804;10<sup>-5</sup> Torr reduces the repetition rate to 2 - 3 shots per day.

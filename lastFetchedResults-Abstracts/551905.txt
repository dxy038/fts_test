Introduction: The use of exercise along with herbal supplements is one of the recommended methods for controlling obesity and its complications, but its effects have been controversial due to the diversity of training programs and also herbal supplements. Hence, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of 10 week ginger and progressive resistance training on C-reactive protein (CRP) and other cardiovascular risk factors in obese men.
Methods: In a double-blind design, 32 obese men (BMI> 30) were selected and randomized to four groups (each group comprised of 8 subjects): 1- ginger (GI) 2- resistance training plus placebo (PLRT) 3- resistance training plus ginger (RTPL) and 4- placebo (PL). Subjects of groups 1 and 3 consumed 1 gr ginger/d for 10 weeks, while subjects of groups 2 and 3 performed progressive resistance training at the same time. To evaluate lipid profiles, insulin resistance and CRP, blood samples were collected at the beginning of the first week and after the last week. Moreover, body composition and anthropometric indices were measured simultaneously.
Results: After 10 weeks of interventions, both GRT and PLRT groups showed a significant decrease in WC, WHR, body fat percent, body fat mass, total cholesterol and insulin resistance, while these remained unchanged in two PL and GI groups (P>0.05). Moreover, significant decreases in the mean values of CRP were observed in all groups except the placebo group (P<0.05).
Conclusion: According to our results, resistance training was a preventive approach to reduce the cardiovascular risk in obese men. Moreover, ginger supplementation did not have any influence on the lipid profile and insulin resistance at a dose of 1 gr/day, however, it exerted favorable effects on CRP in obese men.

Two of the most important problems of autonomous mobile robots are the physical implementation (sensors and actuators) and strategy definition. The objective of the paper is to describe a vehicle guidance circuit with less specific hardware as possible and with an easy way of defining the guidance strategy. The control circuit is based on a low cost microcontroller and an FPGA. The guidance strategy is based on a fuzzy algorithm implemented in the FPGA

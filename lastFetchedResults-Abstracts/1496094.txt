Because of high organic matter content of Histosols, they have a thin capillary fringe that would lead to strong soil structure. Soil structure is referred to as aggregate stability which affects crop production. The objective of this study was to determine the distribution of organic carbon, total nitrogen, carbohydrates and calcium carbonate in different-sized aggregates and to investigate the role of these compounds on aggregate stability in two soil types of Histosol. In each region 3 soil profiles were studied (0-120 cm, at each 20 cm interval) and sampling was carried out. Results showed that in both types of Histosols in all depths, larger aggregates contained more organic carbon, total nitrogen and carbohydrate content than the smaller aggregates, while the smaller aggregates contained more calcium carbonate. Studying the independent role of the studying properties on aggregate stability in two soil types implies on positive role of organic carbon (r= 0.48, r= 0.25; P= 0.01), total nitrogen (r= 0.62, r= 0.44; P= 0.01) and carbohydrate (r= 0.51, P= 0.01; r= 0.23, P= 0.05 hot-water soluble; r= 0.52, r = 0.63; P= 0.01 acid soluble) and negative role of calcium carbonate (r= -0.79, P= 0.01; r= -0.23, P= 0.05) on soil structural stability. Investigating the Pearson correlation coefficients in different-sized aggregates resulted in different outcomes on the role of these elements. The relative importance of each of the studying properties in conjunction with other properties on the soil structural stability revealed the positive influence of total nitrogen in two soil types, positive effect of acid soluble carbohydrate in soils of Shahrekord and negative effect of other properties in two soil types.

Objective: Improvements in cancer treatment have allowed more young women to survive.
However, many cancer patients suffer from ovarian failure. Cryopreservation is one
of the solutions for fertility restoration in these patients. The cryopreservation of isolated
follicles is a more attractive approach in the long term. Many endocrine and paracrine
factors can stimulate the granulosa cells of preantral follicles to proliferate. Melatonin acts
as direct free radical scavenger and indirect antioxidant. In this study, we investigated the
direct effects of melatonin on follicle development and oocyte maturation by exposing in
vitro cultured mouse vitrified-warmed ovarian follicles to melatonin.
Materials and Methods: In an experimental study, preantral follicles with diameter of
150-180 ?m were isolated from prepubertal mouse ovaries. Follicles were vitrified and
thawed using cryolock method. They were then cultured individually for 7 days in droplets
supplemented with 0, 10 and 100 pM melatonin, while ovulation was induced using epidermal
growth factor (EGF) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The survival rate of
follicles and nuclear maturation of ovulated oocytes were determined.
Results: At the end of culture, significant increases in follicle survival (p < 0.001) and in diameter
(p < 0.05) were noticed in 10 pM melatonin group compared to control group. In the 100
pM group, survival rate was not affected by melatonin. It was revealed that after induction of
ovulation, total number of metaphase II oocytes in treatment groups were not influenced by
melatonin (p > 0.05).
Conclusion: Culture of mouse vitrified-warmed preantral follicles in a medium supplemented
with 10 pM melatonin increased the number of surviving follicles.

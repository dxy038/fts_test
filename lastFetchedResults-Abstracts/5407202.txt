In this paper, we develop a power allocation scheme that works robustly under channel uncertainty for a decode-and-forward (DF) cooperative cellular multi-user network with multiple fixed relays. We propose a method for selective relaying, where cooperation takes place only if it is beneficial for the network in terms of total transmit power minimization or source power savings. Our objective is to provide energy efficiency by minimizing the power consumption of the network while meeting the rate requirements of the users. We consider the probabilistically constrained optimization approach, in which quality of service (QoS) constraint is satisfied for all users with certain probabilities. We transform the probabilistic optimization problem into a deterministic one and derive closed form analytical solutions. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

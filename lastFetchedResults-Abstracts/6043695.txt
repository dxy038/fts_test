This paper decribes design, fabrication, and characteristics of all PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) pneumatic balloon actuators for the bidirectional motion of the microfinger. The actuation mechanism of the balloon actuator is based on pressure-dependent swelling and saturation phenomena of two flexible diaphragms with different thicknesses. Two types of microfingers with balloon actuators are fabricated by the simple silicon molding process and pneumatically tested. From the pneumatic test result, it is confirmed that the out-of-plane motion of the microfinger depends on the thickness of the bottom diaphragm of pneumatic balloon actuators. When the applied pressure is 50 kPa, the generated force and the bending angle of type A finger are 0.17 mN and 59&#176;, respectively.

Reservoir operation optimization is one of the most important issues in water resources management. In this study, reservoir operations of Doroodzan dam were carried out using SA optimization algorithm, yield model and Standard Operation Policy (SOP). For each method, a computer model was developed using FORTRAN. The decision variables in the SA model were the amount of water release in different months. The objective function is deficit of water requirement which was investigated as minimization form. Yield model was defined as an amount of water which in addition to supply drinking and industry demands, reservoir can supply agriculture water demand with a reliability of at least 80 percent. Results showed that all three methods fully supply drinking and industrial demands. The performances of SA algorithm and yield model in agricultural uses were better than the standard operation policy. Also the yield model supplies much more water for agricultural use than SA model. SA algorithm and yield model decreased water deficit 33.74 and 83.86 percent, respectively. Therefore, the yield model passes the best performance and the SA algorithm and the standard operation policy obtained the next positions, respectively.

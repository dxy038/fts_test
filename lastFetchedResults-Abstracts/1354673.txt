Reduced activation ferritic/martensitic steels (F82H, JLF-1, 9Cr2WTaV and EUROFER-9Cr1WTaV), advanced ODS Fe–14%Cr alloys, standard and modified 9Cr1Mo conventional martensitic steels were irradiated as specimens for mechanical tests in different neutron irradiation experiments performed in the range 300–325 °C. The objective of this paper is to present the tensile and impact properties as well as the irradiation creep of these materials after irradiation to high doses (32–42 dpa) in BOR60. The evolution of tensile properties is discussed as a function of the dose up to 42 dpa including results from irradiations carried out in SM2 and OSIRIS reactors. In general, RAFM steels presented a lower level of hardening and embrittlement compared to 9Cr1Mo conventional steels. ODS-Fe–14%Cr exhibited the lowest hardening and a relatively high residual ductility at 42 dpa.

In this paper, an isolated bidirectional DC/DC Cuk converter featuring high power density, zero input/output current ripples, and symmetrical design is presented. The magnetic components of the converter, which include the input inductor, the output inductor, and the isolation transformer, are assembled together in one magnetic structure. The magnetic assembly is modeled and designed using the gyrator-capacitor (G-C) approach. Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the converter performance in both forward and backward modes of operation. The effect of the switching frequency on the percentage current ripples is discussed.

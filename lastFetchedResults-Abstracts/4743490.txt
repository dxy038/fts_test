A home area network (HAN) incorporating a high-power high-efficiency charging/discharging battery system is capable of executing energy saving strategies in the smart grid, such as TOU or DR. This paper presents a bidirectional isolated DAB-based dc/dc converter for a Li<sup>+</sup>Fe battery system in the HAN. Battery energy is controlled by the phase angle between the primary bridge and the secondary bridge of the converter. Theoretical analysis and control implementation are described. A LABVIEW-based prototype is established to verify effectiveness.

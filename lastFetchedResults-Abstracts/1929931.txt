European wet grasslands are characterized by high diversity of plant and animal species but are threatened by intensive land use. Although preservation or restoration of species-rich wet grasslands requires low nutrient availability that could be achieved by long-term management, studies monitoring nutrient removal are lacking. Our objective was to assess the long-term effect of management (mowing twice a year without or with PK fertilization for 20 years) on (i) productivity and nutrient removal with the harvest, (ii) the type of nutrient limitation, and (iii) plant species richness in wet grasslands in north-western Germany considering the differences between organic and mineral soils.

lly low nutrient availability in soil led to decreased productivity and base cation removal with harvest particularly on mineral soils after six years of mowing twice a year without fertilization. On mineral soils, N:K ratios indicated limitation of plant growth by K. On organic soils, neither productivity nor K removal with the harvest changed with time suggesting additional K input probably caused by rising groundwater. On organic soils, K:P ratios and a significant decrease of productivity with increasing N:P ratios suggested P limitation. Plant species richness was maintained or even slightly increased by mowing twice a year without fertilization but mainly comprised species that were already present at the study sites.

tivity and N, P, K, and Mg removal with the harvest was significantly increased by mowing twice a year with PK fertilization while species richness was maintained. After 10 years, N:K ratios indicate K limitation even for mowing twice a year with PK fertilization. In case of initially low nutrient availability in soil, cautious PK fertilization and mowing can be recommended to meet demands of agriculture and nature conservation.

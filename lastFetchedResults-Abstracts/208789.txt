Background: One of the modern Drug Delivery methods is the use of microemulsion for oral
delivery of insoluble drugs .To use medicinal plants oil in these systems resulted in therapeutic
solution for carrying lipophilic drugs.
Pumpkin seed oil is one of the plant oils with high therapeutic properties especially in BPH
treatment .The oil has significant absorption in the body.
Objective: Microemulsion Preparation from Pumpkin Seed Oil for Oral Drug Delivery
Methods:
-To choose surfactants and cosurfactants based on oil components structure
-To formulate the ingredients with different methods in different conditions
-To study the repeatability and stability of samples
-To measure particle size
Result: Short chained alcohols are not suitable cosurfactants for this research. The best result
is obtained with polysorbate 80 as a surfactant and sugar as a cosurfactant.
Addition of polymer has no effect on the stability of microemulsion. On the other hand, stirring
has no effect in bench scale. It would be better to conduct the experiments at room temperature.
Conclusions: Pumpkin oil O/W microemulsion contained 5-10 % oil could be prepared by
polysorbate 80 as a surfactant and sugar as a cosurfactant.

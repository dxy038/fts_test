Wide angular velocity operation of an electrical machine is demonstrated by partitioning each of the stator coils of a three-phase configuration. An open-winding machine drive circuit is proposed with which dynamic transitions between machine operating modes can be executed. The principle of operation and the design choices of the required bidirectional series switch are explained and motivated. The behavior of the proposed system is analysed, and verified by simulations. Finally, the results of a configuration (gear) transition are compared to a state-of-the-art mechanical twin-clutch transmission, showing that both the angular jerk and transition time are much smaller with the proposed system.

This article discusses the need for standard software interfaces for programming of networks, specifically for service and signaling control, through programming interfaces. The objective is to enable the development of open signaling, control, and management applications as well as higher-level multimedia services on networks. The scope of this effort includes ATM switches, circuit switches, IP routers, and hybrid switches such as those that provide for fast switching of IP packets over an ATM backbone. The basic ideas represented herein are in the process of development as a standard for application programming interfaces for networks under IEEE Standards Project IEEE P1520

One of the first issues which has to be taken into account by software companies is to determine what should be included in the next release of their products, in such a way that the highest possible number of customers get satisfied while this entails a minimum cost for the company. This problem is known as the Next Release Problem (NRP). Since minimizing the total cost of including new features into a software package and maximizing the total satisfaction of customers are contradictory objectives, the problem has a multi-objective nature. In this work we study the NRP problem from the multi-objective point of view, paying attention to the quality of the obtained solutions, the number of solutions, the range of solutions covered by these fronts, and the number of optimal solutions obtained.Also, we evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art multi-objective metaheuristics for solving NRP: NSGA-II and MOCell. The obtained results show that MOCell outperforms NSGA-II in terms of the range of solutions covered, while this latter is able of obtaining better solutions than MOCell in large instances. Furthermore, we have observed that the optimal solutions found are composed of a high percentage of low-cost requirements and, also, the requirements that produce most satisfaction on the customers.

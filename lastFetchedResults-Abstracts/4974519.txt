Mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) due to its innate capabilities of instant communication in many time and mission critical applications recently received a significant researchersÂ´ attention. For already identified security vulnerabilities in a wireless environment, such as MANET, a set of countermeasures were proposed. However, only a few of them provide an anonymity guaranty which is an orthogonal to security critical challenge we faced in this paper. We present a new distributed reputation system designed for the anonymous authentication protocol in mobile ad hoc networks (ANAP). The reputation system is incorporated for a trust management and malicious behavior detection in the network where an anonymity support is a major objective. An evaluation of the reputation model is conducted with simulation results based on OMNeT++ environment.

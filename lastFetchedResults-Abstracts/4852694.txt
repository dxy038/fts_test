Road transport networks in cities are getting denser and new cars are being unveiled daily. With the rapid increase in road transport the world over comes the need for enhanced driving safety and convenience. Advanced technological concepts ensure a perpetual scope for development in this sector. We are currently developing an RFID based system that will alert vehicle drivers about road oddities at an optimum distance before encountering them. The objective is to provide an alternative to road signs, which are generally scattered, inconspicuous and appear too late for corrective action. Also, the device will aid in averting accidents and traffic jams, and in implementing traffic law and order.

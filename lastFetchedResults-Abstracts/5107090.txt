In recent years there has been a significant increase in the amount of research done in the field of system of systems engineering. Despite many attempts, there is still a lack of a unified definition and standards for Systems of Systems (SoS). Case study research provides us with an opportunity to extract best practices from real life system of systems cases and set much needed guidelines for SoS governance. The yellow cab case is a well documented example of a System of Systems, which consists of multiple integrated complex systems working together to achieve the objective of transporting passengers in New York City in a safe and efficient manner. The best practices of the yellow cab SoS can be implemented in other SoS domains and the questions developed could be used for discussions in a class setting. Furthermore, these questions could be extended and applied to analyze other SoS cases in a similar manner.

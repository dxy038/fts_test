accounting procedures. Its purpose is to convey an understanding of some financial aspect of a
business firm. Financial analysis (also referred to as financial statement analysis or accounting
analysis) refers to an assessment of the viability, stability and profitability of a business, subbusiness
or project. It is performed by professionals who prepare reports using ratios that make
use of information taken from financial statements and other reports. These reports are usually

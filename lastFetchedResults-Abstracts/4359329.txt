The authors describes a concept and an implementation of a networked and sensorized environment which they are developing. They call this environment SELF, named after Sensorized Environment for Life. The main objective of SELF is to construct an environment which can support healthcare of not only aged but healthy people with the information accumulated by surrounding sensors installed in it. To equip such capabilities with the system, all sensors should be embedded in the environment and systematically form a sensor network. This paper outlines the concept of SELF and shows its current implementations

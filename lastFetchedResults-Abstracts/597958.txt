Levels of engagement within an organization can have substantial and measurable impacts upon the outputs of an organization. The objective of this exploratory study was to establish, the difference between employee engagement before and after a business and culture transformation intervention in the workplace. The participants of an IT firm represented all employee levels in the organization. A pre-intervention and post-intervention sample consisted of 427 and 253 individuals respectively. The Gallup q12 method was used to determine if differences exist in employee engagement before and after a two-year pre- and post merger intervention. The main findings of the research indicated that there was a limited impact on employee engagement before and after the business and culture transformation interventions, and are discussed accordingly

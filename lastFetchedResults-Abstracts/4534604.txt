Cell segmentation is a challenging problem due to both the complex nature of the cells and the uncertainty present in video microscopy. Manual methods for this purpose are onerous, imprecise and highly subjective, thus requiring automated methods that perform this task in an objective and efficient way. In this paper, we propose a novel method to segment nucleus and cytoplasm of white blood cells (WBC). WBC composition of the blood provides important information to doctors and plays an important role in the diagnosis of different diseases. We use simple morphological operators and explore the scale-space properties of a toggle operator to improve the segmentation accuracy. The proposed scheme has been successfully applied to a large number of images, showing promising results for varying cell appearance and image quality, encouraging future works.

Smoking is the leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide , Since the price and expense of tobacco
products are important factors relating to smoking and tobacco control, it is necessary to calculate the expense of dally
smoking in order to enforce tobacco conlrol programs, This study was done to assess the expense of daily smoking among
smokers in Tehran.
Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was done among a random population sample of 3026 smokers in different
areas of Tehran. Data collection was done via WHO and IUATLD (International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung
Disease) questionnaires by questioning health-care workers . Finally data were analyzed by Chi-Square, Fisch er's exact and
logistic regression tests .
Res ults: Among 3026 participants, 2413 (80.9%) persons were male. The mean age of the population was 40±12,7 years.
49.2% of the populelion (1439 persons) had below diploma degree s and the maximum frequency distrib ution of occupation
belonged to employees (36.7%), The mean age of initiation of smoking was 21±8.19 yrs. and the mean number of cigarettes
smoked daily was 16.81±10.61 cigarettes. 41.8% of population (1192 persons) had daily smokin g expense of 2,510 10 4,500
Riels". The mean was 4,680±388.78 Rials. In evaluation of daily smoking expense according to gender, over 6,500 Rials
daily expenditure was more frequent among men (20.1%) in compan'son with women (13,5%) (P=O,OOO). Persons with daily
income of less than 50,000 Rials, spent 9,3% of it for smoking .

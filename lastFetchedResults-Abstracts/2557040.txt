Objective: This study intended to observe the effects of methoxyamine (Mx) on cytotoxic
effects and DNA damage caused by 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) in combination with gamma
radiation in a human colon cancer cell line, HT29.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, HT29 cells were cultured as a monolayer
and treated with different concentrations of 5-FU along with 1 mM Mx for 24 hours.
Next, the cells were irradiated with 2 Gy gamma radiation. After the treatments, we assessed
for DNA damage, cytotoxicity, and viability by alkaline comet, clonogenic survival,
and trypan blue dye exclusion assays.
Results: Cytotoxicity and DNA damage increased with increasing 5-FU concentration.
The 1 mM Mx concentration had no significant effect on cytotoxicity and DNA damage
from 5-FU; however, it increased the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of different concentrations
of 5-FU when used in combination with 2 Gy gamma radiation.
Conclusion: Mx combined with 5-FU enhanced the radiosensitivity of colon cancer cells.

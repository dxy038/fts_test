This study presents a new solution procedure for multiple objective programming (MOP). It applies the concept of the normal boundary intersection (NBI) within the framework of the interactive weighted Tchebycheff procedure (IWTP). The proposed procedure is a collaborative approach to overcome the weak points inherent in both the NBI method and IWTP. In order to control the solution procedure of pinpointing a final solution properly, we parameterized the Pareto-frontier via a set of reference point vectors based on the convex hull of individual maxima (CHIM) instead of using the varying weights of each objective. Using well-distributed reference point vectors, we could identify well-distributed Pareto-optimal solutions, thereby eliminating the IWTP filtering stages and reducing the chance of missing the best compromise solution from the decision maker (DM)'s utility point of view. Moreover, by working with a sequence of progressively smaller subsets of reference point vectors, the DM can identify a final solution at earlier stages than with the IWTP.

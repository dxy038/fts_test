The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of how an Evidence-based implementation framework was developed through the implementation of an ICT4D project in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The framework was developed over a period of three years through five phases. Each phase represented a specific point in time and the objective was to create a platform to enable widespread participation and collaboration between multiple stakeholders in a rural school district that has the buy-in of key stakeholders and has demonstrable impact on education and quality of life in the region. After every phase the framework was adapted to accommodate the lessons learnt. The most important lesson was that it was not about the technology but about empowering the people to take ownership of their own destiny.

Continuous increases in GMU population have severely strained the parking facilities. Currently, users are upset and frustrated with the lack of convenient parking at GMU. Our objective is to provide ideas to help alleviate the stress on the parking system. After conducting research and evaluation of the current parking system, the following base and advanced alternatives were selected. Base alternatives consist of increasing parking enforcement, providing carpooling incentives, encouraging the use of the CUE bus, and revising the distribution of the schedule of classesÂ´ student load. The advanced alternatives are differential pricing and an online auction for purchasing parking decals. For differential pricing, linear regressions were used to find the relationship between the number of decals sold and multiple independent variables. To simulate auctioning, an online auction game was conducted. Using multiattribute utility theory, it was determined that the base alternatives combined with differential pricing has the highest overall utility.

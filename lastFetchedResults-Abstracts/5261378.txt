The main objective of this experience lies on the development of positive learning aptitudes on engineering students. The experience presented in this paper has been carried out with the help of the problem-based learning (PBL) methodology. Solutions of medium-high complexity problems by students make them work on the development of different skills. The teaching model turns into a significant and autonomous learning model where students are conscious of their compromise with this process (learning). The obtained results are a starting point to other authors willing to use active learning methodologies within the framework of engineering degrees. Both lecturers and students involved in the experience have done a positive assessment of the methodology.

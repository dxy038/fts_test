We study the preemptive stochastic online scheduling problem on uniformly related machines where jobs are arriving over time. The objective is to minimize total weighted expected completion time. We consider the class of machines sets where the speed ratios have a lower bound. For each set of machines in this class, we design an algorithm with competitive is 2. More specially, we show that the competitive of our algorithm canÂ´t be improved. This generalizes the currently best known result for identical machines and includes the result for two uniform machines obtained by Gu et al.

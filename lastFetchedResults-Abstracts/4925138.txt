The population search strategy in Genetic Algorithm (GA) provides a very suitable solution for multi-objective optimization, so applying it to the issue of test paper auto-generating can achieve good results. In this paper, we study the issue of test paper generation and propose the mathematical model and object function. Then some improvements are made in Simple GA for test paper generation. Based on the algorithm, a system is designed and implemented.

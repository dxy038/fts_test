This paper addresses the problem of scheduling n grouped jobs on m identical parallel machines with objective of minimizing the sum tardiness, subject to the constraints that each model number is only one and has different matching with each machine. A heuristic approach based on list scheduling is presented. Some conditions are presented which can break the sequence of assigning jobs. The results show that it can get a satisfactory solution

The objective of this paper is to propose a unidirectional antenna using circular disc monopole excited circular ring above cylindrical reflector to cover the frequency of 3.1-10.6 GHz for ultra-wideband (UWB) applications. The simulated results are presented ultra-wideband performance of this antenna by using Computer Simulation Technology (CSTreg). The simulated results verified that the proposed antenna radiates unidirectional pattern. Moreover, the antenna design is described in terms of return loss/impedance bandwidth and radiation pattern. The return loss of better than 10 dB covers the frequency range from 2.46 to 12.41 GHz. The proposed antenna has a unidirectional pattern with the gain of 9.98 dBi at 3 GHz, 11.56 dBi at 7 GHz and 11.59 dBi at 11 GHz from the simulated results. Moreover, the design of this antenna is simple. Therefore, proposed antenna is suitable for many applications in long and narrow path service cell.

In this paper we use multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) with recursive least square (RLS) equalizer used for channel estimation and equalization then compare it with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). RLS algorithm is used because its converges faster leading to faster and better results compared to other algorithms. Results are received by simulating the transmission of the signals over Rayleigh fading additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Objective is to prove that the bit error rate of MC-CDMA system falls more rapidly as we increase the transmitted signal power compared to the OFDM system.

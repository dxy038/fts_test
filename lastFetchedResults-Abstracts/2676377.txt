The need to improve the seismic performance of
buildings has brought about innovative systems such as
rocking wall-moment frame (RWMF) combinations. The
behavior of RWMFs can best be visualized by the momentframe
(MF) restraining the wall in place, and the rigid
rocking wall (RRW) providing additional damping and
imposing uniform drift along the height of the frame. A
novel method of analysis followed by the development of a
new lateral resisting system is introduced. The proposed
concepts lead to an efficient structural configuration with
provisions for self-centering, reparability, performance
control, damage tolerance and collapse prevention. Exact,
unique, closed form formulae have been provided to assess
the collapse prevention and self-centering capabilities of
the system. The objective is to provide an informative
account of RWMF behavior for preliminary design as well
as educational purposes. All formulae have been verified
by independent computer analysis. Parametric examples
have been provided to verify the validity of the proposed
solutions.

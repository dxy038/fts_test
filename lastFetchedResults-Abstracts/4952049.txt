p-Cycles have been proposed for pre-provisioned 1:N protection in optical mesh networks. Although the protection circuits are preconfigured, the detection of failures and the rerouting of traffic can be a time consuming operation. Another survivable mode of operation is the 1+1 protection mode, in which a signal is transmitted on two link disjoint circuits, and the destination chooses the strongest of the two signals, hence recovery from failures is instantaneous. The disadvantage is the large number of protection circuits. In this paper we introduce a new concept in protection: 1+N protection, in which a p-Cycle can be used to protect a number of bidirectional connections. Data from different circuits are combined using network coding, which can be implemented in a number of technologies. The maximum outage time under this protection scheme is limited to no more than twice the p-Cycle propagation delay.

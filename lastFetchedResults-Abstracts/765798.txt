Aspen was heat-treated at high temperature
in a laboratory thermogravimetric analyzer. The high
temperature wood treatment technology is new in
North America and needs to be adapted to the North
American species. The objective of this study is to
understand how the treatment affects the mechanical
properties of aspen such as hardness, modulus of
elasticity and modulus of rupture, and, consequently,
the quality of the product. The wood samples were
heated in an inert gas environment under different
operating conditions. The parameters studied are the
final treatment temperature, heating rate, holding time,
and the gas humidity. The weight loss and the
temperature history of wood were monitored during
the treatment. After the experiments, the properties of
the samples were measured, and the effects of the
above parameters on the properties were analyzed.
The weight loss increased with increasing temperature,
heating rate, holding time, and gas humidity. Increasing
temperature caused an increase in MOE and a
decrease in MOR. Overall hardness decreased with
increasing temperature above 160  C and it increased
with increasing holding time and heating rate whereas
it decreased with increasing gas humidity. Holding
time and heating rate did not seem to affect MOE. Gas
humidity increased MOE. MOR increased with holding
time and decreased with heating rate and gas
humidity.

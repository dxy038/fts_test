Objective (s): To investigate the effects of Quran reading during third trimester on severity of labor pain in primiparas women. 
Methods: This was a randomized clinical trial. A sample of primiparas women attending a prenatal care centre in hospital, entered into the study. They were randomly allocated into two groups: the experimental group (n=41) included women who they were reading Quran from third trimester of pregnancy to normal spontaneous delivery (at least 30 times) whereas the control group (n=46) received routine care only. Severity of pain were determined by visual analogue scale in three cervical dilatation of 3-5, 5-8, 8-10 centimeter and second stage. 
Results: In all 87 women took part in this study. There were not differing between two groups in baseline characteristics. There were significant differences in severity of pain score between two groups  in cervical dilatation of 3-5, 5-8, 8-10 centimeter (P=0.001, P=0.003, P=0.023 respectively) but there was no  significance difference in severity of pain score in second stage (P=0.368).
Conclusion: This study provides evidence for the use of Quran reading is an acceptable and non- medical strategy for reducing the pain during labor at the first stage of delivery.

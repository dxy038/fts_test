This paper proposes an error concealment method for whole-frame losses based on motion stability estimation. Motions of 4times4 blocks in the lost frame are estimated as stable or unstable after a bidirectional motion vector (MV) projection. Then a two-step decoding is employed for both the lost frame and its succeeding frame. Blocks in the lost frame with stable motion are first concealed directly with the projected MV, which provides adequate information for concealing unstable motion blocks in the next step. Then a list of MV candidates is tested for each block in the lost frame with unstable motion, which minimizes the distortion in both the lost frame and its succeeding frame. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous methods in both objective and subjective performance.

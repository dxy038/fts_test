Proposes a method to enhance the contrast of a gray image using the genetic algorithm that measures the fitness of an individual by evaluating the intensity of spatial edges included in the image. By the ability of the genetic algorithm to search a solution in a global space, a relation between input and output gray levels is determined to convert an original gray image to an enhanced image with a good contrast. Experimental results show that the resulting images by the proposed method have good and natural contrasts compared with the resulting images by conventional methods through subjective evaluation and objective evaluation

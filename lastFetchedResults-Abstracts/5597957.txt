Considering the characteristics of multi-objective, multi-index and coexistence of certainty and uncertainties, set pair analysis theory was introduced into evaluation of hospital medical service efficiency. The concept of structural function, that is, identity-discrepancy-contrary connection degree was developed. Based on the set pair theory, the fuzzy set pair analysis evaluation model of hospital medical service efficiency was established. This model was applied to evaluate the service efficiency in hospital D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>4</sub>. Service efficiency of the four hospitals could be determined objectively and the order preference of service efficiency was gained. The case study shows that this method is scientific, simple, and practical for multi-objective decision-making questions of service efficiency evaluation.

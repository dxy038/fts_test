This paper shows the result of designing, developing and implementing a portable system for obtaining the temperature and humidity from the foot-shoe interface, with the objective of carrying out experimental studies of microclimate in the lower limbs. The system has 10 sensors which can be repositioned for different configurations. Reading tests were conducted for 20 participants, 10 men and 10 women. Preliminary data obtained and analyzed, yield differences in temperature and humidity between the different genres.

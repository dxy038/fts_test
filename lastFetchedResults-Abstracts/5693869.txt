In this paper, an attempt has been made to formulate multiple objective fractional transportation problem (MOFTTP). The multiple objective fractional transportation problem with non-linear bottleneck objective function is related to lexicographic multiple fractional time transportation problem, which is solved by a lexicographic primal code. An algorithm is developed to determine an initial efficient basic solution of this MOFTTP. A real life example is also solved by using this algorithm for minimizing the total actual arrival time to total standard arrival time, total actual departure time to total standard departure time and total actual congestion time to total standard congestion time for transporting the bikes.

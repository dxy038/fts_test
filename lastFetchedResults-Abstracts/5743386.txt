Coal-fired power plants are big contributors to air pollution and particle pollution is one of the most dangerous air pollutants. In order to solve the problem, fabric filters are widely used and currently considered to be the best available control technology for fine particles that are of greatest health concern for human beings. As the key part of bag filter, the performances of the filter media directly decide its operation effect and cost. The major objective of the study focuses on how the performances of the filter media changes with various operation conditions after a period of service times.

Forecasting the probable maximum flood in a watershed is of vital importance in designing the spillways of the dams and estimating the volume of the reservoirs to be constructed on its respective river.  As numerous watersheds are unguaged or lack reliable long-time data, many hydrologists have tried to develop theories based on the geomorphology of such basins. We simulated the direct surface run-off (DSRO) hydrographs for 4 rainfall events for the Shoor Indica Catchment (SIC) in the Khuzestan Province, I.R.Iran using the GIUH-based Clark-Nash models and compared them statistically with the instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) model option of the HEC-HMS package and the Nash IUH model using some commonly used objective functions.  The geomorphological parameters of the SIC were evaluated as the Hortonâ€™s ratio from the topographic and hydrographic maps using the GIS package. Individual dynamic velocity parameter was estimated for each event using the regional relationships developed between the flow velocity and the excess mean rainfall intensity based on the river cross sectional geometry. Statistical comparison of the developed and the recorded hydrographs indicated that the GIUH-based estimations more precisely predicted the events than the IUH routine.

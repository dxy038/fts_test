The objective of this work was to know the occurrence of OTA in organic and non-organic cereals and cereal products from Spain and Portugal. A method based on extraction with matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) using octylsilica (C8) followed by liquid chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection (LC–FD) was used to determine OTA from the selected samples. Recoveries of OTA from the studied samples spiked at 10 ng/g level ranged from 78% to 89% with a standard deviation of 3.66. The limits of detection and quantification of this method were 0.05 and 0.19 ng/g, respectively. Furthermore, LC–FD after OTA methylation was used to confirm the identity of OTA in all positive samples. This procedure was applied to 83 organic and non-organic samples including rice, wheat, barley, rye, oats and maize from Spain and Portugal. OTA was detected in 22% of the samples, with concentrations ranging from 0.20 to 27.10 ng/g. From the total OTA contaminated samples (n = 18), 72% were organic cereal and 28% were non-organic cereal samples, with mean concentrations of 1.64 and 0.05 ng/g, respectively. The 66% and 34% of contaminated samples were from Spain and Portugal, respectively, with mean concentrations of 0.93 and 0.64 ng/g for each country. Six contaminated samples exceeded the maximum limits (ML) for OTA fixed by European Commission Regulation (5 μg/kg), among them three were from Spain and three from Portugal.

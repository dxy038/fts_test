Traffic grooming technique is one of the important candidates to save energy for networks. In order to minimize the energy consumption using Integer Linear Program (ILP) or Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), the assumption has to be made that all the connection requests are accepted in the IP over WDM network. However, a connection request may be blocked in a real network. In this paper, a bi-objective ILP is proposed for minimizing the energy consumption in a blocking IP over WDM network. It maximizes the throughput for a given network first, and then minimizes the energy consumption for the obtained maximized throughput. The simulation results show that the bi-objective method can save half of the energy consumed in the single-objective method if only the throughput is maximized.

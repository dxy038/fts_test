The classification of the uterine myoma and adenomyosis from their ultrasound images mainly depends on doctorsÂ´ experience and lacks objective criterions. Here a novel classification method is proposed using the multiresolution analysis and the orientational fractal analysis. Firstly, texture features under various resolutions and orientational fractal features are obtained from ultrasound images. Then the feature selection (FS) process is implemented using the sequential forward selection algorithm (SFS). Finally a classifier based on the support vector machine (SVM) is set up to classify the images into normal (Nor), myoma (Myo) and adenomyosis (Ad) cases. From the application of 27 Nor, 45 Ad and 74 Myo cases, it is showed that orientational fractal features and some multiresolution texture features are sensitive to the uterine Myo and Ad classification. The SVM classifier with the selected features may be useful in the practical classification

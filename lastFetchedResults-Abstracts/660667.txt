The objective of this study is to investigate the distribution characteristics of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners in sediments of the lower Nakdong River of Korea. The sediments were collected using a grab sampler in May 1999. PCBs were extracted in the Soxhlet extractor and cleaned by using adsorption chromatographic techniques and concentrated sulfuric acid. A HP6890 gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector was used for quantification. The results of congener specific analysis showed that the total concentration is ranged over 1.1â€“141 ng/g dry weight. The levels of PCB congeners are significantly correlated with the total organic carbons (TOC) in the sediments. The major fractions of PCBs in these sediments are congeners containing 4, 5 or 6 chlorine atoms per biphenyl molecule.

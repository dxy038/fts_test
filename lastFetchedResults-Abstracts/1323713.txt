Background: Single domain antibodies from camel heavy chain antibodies (VHH or nanobody), are advantages due to higher solubility, stability, high homology with human antibody, lower immunogenicity and low molecular weight. These criteria make them candidates for production of engineered antibody fragments particularly in transgenic animals. Objective: To study the development of transgenic chicken using a recombinant retrovirus containing fluonanobody. Methods: The retrovirus constructs containing nanobody genes along with secretory signals and GFP gene were established and packed. The virus particle containing the obtained fusion gene was injected into the eggs in stage X.  Molecular detection and protein analysis was done in the G0 chickens. Results: The rate of hatched chicken after gene manipulation was estimated to be about 33%. Real-Time PCR assay showed that the nanobody along with GFP gene were integrated in cells of 1.2% of chickens. Conclusion: We conclude that although the rate of gene transfer by recombinant viruses in chickens is low, it would be possible to transfect the target camel immunoglobulin gene into chicken genome.

In this paper, based on bifuzzy theory, a new class of two-stage bifuzzy programming model is presented. Since the convex analysis plays an important role in the studies of optimization, this paper discuss some fundamental properties of two-stage bifuzzy programming, including the convexity of feasible set as well as convexity of objective function, which facilitated us to design algorithms to solve the programming problem above.

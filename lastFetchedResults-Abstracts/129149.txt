Objective: This study to investigated the correlation of helicobacter pylori Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection with liver enzymes in dyspeptic patients.
Material and Methods: This cross-sectional study obtained blood samples for liver enzymes was obtained from all eligible dyspeptic patients referring to Baqiyatallah Hospital. Then they Linder went endoscopy and two biopsy specimens were taken for rapid urease test and the result was reported within 24 hrs.
Results: A total of 475 patients (272 men) were enrolled in the study and 403 out of 475 patients had positive urease tests and the remaining 72 had negative results. Body mass index was identical in both groups. The mean value for AST, ALT and Alkaline Phospatase in the urease positive group was 25.8±2.08, 28.75±3.6, 192.2±81, respectively and in the urease negative group was 23.76±2.8, 32.11±9.8, 197.1±85, respectively which show no statistical difference.
Conclusion: Although the role of HP infection on chronic liver disease has been reported, the mechanism and the process of liver injury have not yet been defined. This study indicates that there is no relationship between HP infection and serum liver enzyme levels in dyspeptic patients.

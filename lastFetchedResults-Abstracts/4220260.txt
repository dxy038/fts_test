Cloud computing is defined as a structured model that defines computing services, in which resources as well as data are retrieved from cloud service provider via internet through some well formed web-based tool and application. It provides the on demand services for various applications and infrastructure to the user. Cloud service providers are required to provide the service efficiently and effectively. For that, a cloud provider utilizes all the resource from the node. Thus, the node that are meant for creating a task in the cloud computing must be considered for efficient usage of the available resources. Resources have to be properly selected according to the properties of the task. By analyzing the present research on cloud computing, we have come to the most common and important issue of load balancing. Load balancing has always been a research subject whose objective is to ensure that all computing resources are distributed efficiently and fairly. As the numbers of users are increasing on the cloud, the load balancing has become the challenge for the cloud provider. Load balancing being subject of research, we have proposed an algorithm for load balancing which will work dynamically for optimal usage of resource utilization. We have compared our algorithm with various existing static load balancers as well as conventional dynamic load balancer also.

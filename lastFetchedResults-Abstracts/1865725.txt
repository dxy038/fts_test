Objective: Dendrosomes are a family of rather new polymers that enhance solubility of insoluble or low soluble drugs in biological media. Curcumin is anti-cancer component by very low solubility in water that in this research transferred with dendrosome as a carrier to human Caucasian gastric adenocarcinoma cell line (AGS).  Materials & methods: In the present study, we transferred dendrosome formulation of curcumin to AGS cells. Then, apoptosis induction was investigated by propidium iodide staining. Also, transcript level of Survivin and hTERT genes was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Results: Dendrosomal curcumin increased apoptosis induction in AGS cells in compared to free curcumin. Also, Semi-Q RT-PCR results exhibited the relative decrease of hTERT and survivin gene expression, which involved in cell proliferation and survival increasing. Conclusion: In this study was showed that dendrosomal curcumin induced apoptosis more than free curcumin in AGS cells. Therefore, dendrosome is a sufficient carrier for curcumin delivery to cells and this nanoparticle can be used for treatment and extinguish of cancer cells.

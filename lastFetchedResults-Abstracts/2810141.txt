Telerobotic task performance cannot compare to direct object manipulation with the hands. However, the computer in-the-loop offers the potential to give assistance to a human operator. The present work studies a class of computer assistance functions known as haptic virtual fixtures (VF). The objective is to use practical human trials to discover the ways VFs impact task execution.

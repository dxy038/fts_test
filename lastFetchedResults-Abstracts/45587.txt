An analytical solution for waves propagating through a horizontal porous plate of finite thickness is obtained. The objective of the plate is to reduce the incident short-wave energy and the long-wave energy as well. Consequently, in this study the plate is analyzed in a global perspective [i.e., considering its response to obliquely incident short waves (both regular and irregular) and wave groups (with the consequent generation of free and locked long waves)]. To solve the propagation of regular and irregular waves, an eigenfunction expansion is used and the results are verified with experimental data showing good agreement. The propagation of a wave group past a horizontal porous plate is studied using a multiple-scale perturbation method, and an analytical solution is presented. The results show that the generated long waves are present on both sides of the plate and that maximum short-wave reflection is associated with maximum longwave transmission.

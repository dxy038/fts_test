Dental implants are ideally placed in an orientation that allows vertical transfer of occlusal forces along their long axis. Nevertheless, optimal situations for implant placement are seldom encountered resulting in implants placement in angulated positions, which may affect their long-term success. The resonance frequency (RF) is an objective tool used to monitor stability of the implant tissue integration; however, little is known of the effect of the implant orientation in bone on the RF and its potential significance. The purpose of this research was to determine the relation between the dental implant orientation and the corresponding RF of implant. Three-dimensional (3D) modelling software was used to construct a 3D model of a pig mandible from computed tomography (CT) images. The RF of the implant was analysed using finite element (FE) modal analysis in software ANSYS (v.12). In addition, a cubical model was also developed in MIMICS to investigate the parameters affecting the relationship between RF and implant orientation in a simplified environment. The orientation angle was increased from 0 to 10 degrees in 1 degree increments and the resulting RF was analysed using correlation analysis and one-way ANOVA. Our analysis illustrated that the RF fluctuation following altering implant orientation was strongly correlated (r = 0.97) with the contacting cortical to cancellous bone ratio (CCBR) at the implant interface. The most extreme RF change (from 9.81 kHz to 10.07 kHz) occurred when the implant was moved 0.5 mm in positive z-direction, which resulted in the maximum change of CCBR from 52.9 to 54.8.

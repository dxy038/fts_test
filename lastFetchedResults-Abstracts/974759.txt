    The objective of the present study was to detect clinical endometritis through vaginal examination together with transrectal palpation of reproductive tract in dairy cattle before breeding. A number of 1620 holstein cows in a large commercial dairy farm around Tehran province were clinically evaluated  by rectal as well as vaginal examination at least forty days postpartum and afterwords. Cervical and uterine horns diameter were measured manually. In the absence of external uterine discharge following rectal massage of the uterus, vaginal examination was performed manually under aseptic condition with lubricated gloves after cleaning the vulva and searching for uterine discharge. The vaginal mucus was scored for character and degree of endometritis based on the amount of pus in uterine content. The prevalence of various degrees of clinical endometritis was 12% and the examination of vaginal discharge was required to identify 25% of these cases. Sensitivity of rectal massage for uterine discharge and diagnosis of endometritis was 74.7%. Asymmetricity in uterine horns diameter has no significant relationship with the degree of endometritis. Means cervical diameter of score 1 and 2 of endometritis were not significantly different but it was statistically larger for score 3 (p < 0.05). Cervical diameter, when endometritis was diagnosed rectally, was significantly larger (p=0.0005) indicating more severe condition. Number of lactations shows no significant relationship with degree of endometritis. Cervical and uterine diameter was not always a reliable evidence of endometritis when compared with vaginal discharge. In conclusion vaginal examination can be a useful method for detection of the majority and more cases of clinical endometritis.

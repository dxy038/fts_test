this paper presents a Unit Commitment model with reactive power compensation that has been solved by Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization techniques. The GA has been developed a computational tools programmed/coded in MATLAB. The main objective is to find the best generations scheduling whose active power losses are minimal and the reactive power to be compensated, subjected to the power system technical constraints. Those are: full AC power flow equations, active and reactive power generation constraints. All constraints that have been represented in the objective function are weighted with a penalty factors. The IEEE 14-bus system has been used as test case to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Results and conclusions are dully drawn.

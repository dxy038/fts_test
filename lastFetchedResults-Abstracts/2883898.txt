As 3D video becomes more and more prevalent in recent years, supporting the quality of wireless 3D video transmission becomes an important research area. The characteristics of 3D video are mass data, high delay requirement, and clear images. However, with the bandwidth of wireless network always fast changing, the quality of 3D video sometimes cannot be guaranteed. This paper proposes a wireless 3D video transmission algorithm called selected progressive optimal algorithm (SOA), which can adaptively discard non-essential frame from 3D video at the transmission side, to ensure subjective evaluation of video quality. MSE and PSNR has been adopted to be objective evaluation criteria to evaluate the quality of 3D video. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can remarkably reduce mosaic in received 3D video after time-varying channel transmission.

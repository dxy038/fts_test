Equipments and systems on board ship, although well designed, will not remain safe or reliable if they are not maintained. The general objective of the maintenance process is to make use of the knowledge of failures and accidents to achieve the maximum possible safety with the lowest possible cost. In this insight, this study proposes a risk-assessment methodology for preventive maintenance planning evaluation based upon a reliability model for marine engine systems, which allows the use of flexible intervals between maintenance interventions. Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) approach is chosen as a risk assessment methodology in this paper to synthesize the potential failure modes in order to identify early response and smoothly promote a preventive maintenance planning. As a case application fuel oil system is comparatively assessed. In the paper, it is seen that the proposed risk-assessment methodology provides invaluable supports to construct risk-based preventive maintenance planning for fuel oil system onboard ship.

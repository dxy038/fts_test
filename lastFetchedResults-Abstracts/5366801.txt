An objective of the Noise Injection Experiment (NIE) is to calibrate the numerical methods used to estimate the noise level in the proposed internal, cowound voltage sensors to be used in the superconducting magnets, such as those in ITER and TPX. A time-varying magnetic field is applied to the sample windings and the pick-up signals in the parallel and helical sensors (some are internally terminated) are measured. A computer model is developed to predict the results, and the measurements are compared with the computer simulations

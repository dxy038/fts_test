The uniformity of stepper exposure fields was evaluated and quantified by analyzing the electrical critical dimensions of patterned arrays of dense and isolated bridge resistors. The objective of this effort was to aid in the understanding, and ultimately reduce the occurrence of, stepper field uniformity issues that can degrade device performance

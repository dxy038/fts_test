Background and Objective: To estimate the risk of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection for
cervical malignancies, we conducted a case-control study in southern Iran (Hormozgan province).
Materials and Methods: For this purpose, 52 paraffin embedded blocks with exact diagnosis
of cervical carcinoma(50 carcinomas and 2 carcinomas in situ) from 2001 to 2006 and 52 praffin
embedded blocks of cervical tissue specimens with normal histopathology as the control group were
tested for the presence of HPV DNA using PCR based assay.
Results: HPV DNA was found out in 16 out of 52 patients (30.7%), while it was not detected in
any of the control group samples.
Conclusion: Considering the fact that unrestrained sexual behavior increases risk of becoming
infected with HPV, our finding is in favor of the concept of low frequency of HPV infection and thus
its less important role in women with cervical cancer in islamic countries.

The control functions, system motions, and other characteristics which are obtained from the mathematical synthesis of ``optimal´´ bipedal locomotion gaits with respect to locomotion criteria (to be minimized) defined in the paper are considered. Results are presented for three mathematical biped models and several locomotion criteria (objective functions). Optimal walking trajectories and associated control functions are synthesized using the optimal programming method of [1]. In the synthesis approach, the model structure and locomotion criterion determine the optimal controls motion and foot placement parameters. These effects are examined, and qualitative comparisons to human walking patterns are suggested. These studies also provide quantitative information for the design of prostheses and walking machines, for example: ranges of suitable motion patterns (as functions of time) and magnitudes of controlling efforts and energy requirements.

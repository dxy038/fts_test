Presents a framework for fuzzy modeling of dynamic systems using orthonormal basis functions in the representation of the model input signals. The main objective of using orthonormal bases is to overcome the task of estimating the order and time delay of the process. The result is a nonlinear moving average fuzzy model which, consequently, has no feedback of prediction errors. Although any technique of fuzzy modeling can be used in the proposed framework, a relational approach is considered. The performance of fuzzy models with orthonormal basis functions is illustrated by examples and the results are compared with those provided by conventional fuzzy models and Volterra models.

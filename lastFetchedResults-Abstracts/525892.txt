The increasing importance of Iran along with its unique regional position has motivated many Western thinkers and researchers to recommend Western and especially American politicians to grasp more precise knowledge about this country. This article argues that the U.S. needs to have a sound understanding of Iran's foreign policy which is based on great enthusiasm for independence and resistance to domination of foreign powers. On the other hand, Iranian people's historical memory remembers how Western countries, especially the U.S., despised them during the years before the advent of the Islamic Revolution. Therefore, the author argues that Iran does not accept any pressure or threat during negotiations and is ready to negotiate in an atmosphere of mutual respect. The U.S. should also recognize the legitimacy of Iran's revolution and have an objective assessment of Iran's power in the Middle East. The U.S. administration should revise its reliance upon the policies seeking containment and sanctions, because these policies do not affect Iran's government, rather they punish Iranian people, which the U.S. claims supporting.

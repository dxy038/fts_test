The plastic behavior of materials depends on their strain rate sensitivity. The main objective of this paper is the analysis of the effect of strain rate sensitivity on plastic behavior of cylindrical shells under internal pressure loading and hence a large number empirical test have been conducted on aluminum cylindrical shells. We have also manufactured and used a hydrostatic test machine to perform the internal static, semi-static and dynamic pressure loading of the specimens in the strain rate range between 1 to 0.00001 ( / Sec). On the other hand, we have used the explosive loading in order to simulate the super dynamic loading of cylindrical shells. Using the data of this complete set of experimental tests and the analytical formulation, have helped us to perform our desirable analysis on the effect of the strain rate and loading rate on the behavior of aluminum made cylindrical structures. Some semi-experimental terms have also been extracted which show the relation between the strain and strain rate. The analysis of the results shows that as the loading rate increases, the failure load and failure strain of the structures which are made of strain rate sensitive materials, increase.

Applying EA (evolutionary algorithm) to MOP (multi-objective optimization problem) has become more and more popular. To overcome the shortcomings of those EAs which adopt the real-coded scheme, this paper presents a new EA. It uses the special strategies for the generation, crossover and mutation of population, and does more helpful work to control the diversity of population. Contrasted with other EAs, the experimental results show that this algorithm can effectively avoid getting into local solutions and its evolution performance is more excellent.

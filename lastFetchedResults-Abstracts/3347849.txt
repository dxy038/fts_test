DC/DC converters with hybrid proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell and battery power sources are designed and implemented using sliding mode control (SMC). The converters are typically comprised by unidirectional boost converter and bidirectional converter which are used for regulating the bus voltage and managing power distribution. SMC is selected to control the converters since it can cope with the high non-linear characteristic of the coupled system as well as ensure the stability. The hybrid power control system is constructed in MATLAB/Simulink platform. A comparative approach based on conventional proportional-integral (PI) control is developed to compare the control performance with SMC. The experimental validation is carried out with National Instruments (NI) LabVIEW-based hybrid PEMFC/battery supplied DC/DC converters system prototype.

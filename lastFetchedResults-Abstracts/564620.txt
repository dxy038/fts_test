Condition of animals is manifested through level of achieved nourishment. Body condition score (BCS) is a precise method of determination of reserves of deposited energy in form of subcutaneous fat tissue. Adequate body reserves are necessary requirement for maximal increase of milk production in the period of early lactation. Based on BCS we can precisely determine the number of cows which are bellow weight (excessively thin) or over weight (excessively fat). Body condition changes during lactation. Cows in early lactation are in the negative energy balance (NEB). Changes of the body condition should be over at the end of lactation. Objective is to have cows in optimal body condition during all production phases. Object of research was body condition of high yielding cows during production cycle. Realized sample size was 363 cows of Holstein-Friesian breed. Average BCS value of cows in dry period was 3.39 (2.37-4.41), at calving 3.56 (2.55-4.63), at lactation peak 2.30 (1.35-3.16) and in the mid lactation 2.50 (1.35-3.43). In dry period, most of cows (n=100 or 27.55%) ranged in BCS from 3.26 to 3.50. During dry period increase of body condition scores of cows occurred. At calving, most of heads (n=99 or 27.50%) ranged in their BCS from 3.51 to 3.75. During period of early lactation there was a significant decrease of the body condition of cows. At the peak of lactation a slight increase of body condition was recorded. At the peak of lactation, most cows (n=125 or 36.76%) ranged in BCS from 2.26 to 2.50. In the mid-lactation period, slight increase of body condition of cows occurred. During this period, most cows (n=88 or 27.32%) ranged in their BCS from 2.51 to 2.75. In general, realized average BCS results according to production phases deviated statistically significantly from target values

 Background Under normal physiological condition, melanosomal
                            melanin acts as a natural UV photoprotective filter. However, after long
                            exposure to UV radiation, melanin has shown to involve in reactive
                            oxygen species (ROS) generation and increases the risk of developing
                            ageing, melasma and melanoma skin cancers. A number of plant polyphenols
                            influenced the melanin biosynthesis and growth of various melanoma cells
                            through their anti-tyrosinase activity as well as antioxidant effect.
                            Objective In this study, we evaluated the anti-melanogeneic and
                            cytotoxic effects of methanol extract of <i>Phlomis
                            caucasica</i> (<i>Lamiaceceae</i>) on human melanoma
                            SKMEL-3 cells. Methods The level of antioxidant and anti-tyrosinase
                            capacity of MeOH extract from <i>P. caucasica</i> (MPc) were
                            evaluated in vitro by DPPH radical scavenging and mushroom tyrosinase
                            activity assays, respectively. Moreover, the effects of MPc on the
                            melanin content, cellular tyrosinase activity and cytotoxicity (using
                            MTT assay) on human melanoma SKMEL-3 cells were determined 72 hours
                            after the treatment. Results The results showed that MPc weakly
                            inhibited DPPH radicals and mushroom tyrosinase activity with
                            SC<sub>50</sub> = 1.037 mg/mL and
                            IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.316 mg/mL, respectively. The
                            cytotoxicity assay showed that its IC<sub>50 </sub>value was
                            approximately 0.134 mg/mL (0.09791 to 0.1834) on SKMEL-3 cells. The
                            extract had no effect on the melanin content at concentrations of â‰¤ 0.1
                            mg/mL. Additionally, no effect on cellular tyrosinase activity was
                            observed at concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 0.25 mg/mL of MPc.
                            Conclusions The results obtained suggest that the <i>P.
                            caucasica</i> extract can reveal cytotoxic effect on human
                            melanoma SKMEL-3 cells at higher concentrations of 0.1 mg/mL. Therefore,
                            it can be considered as a good candidate for anti-melanoma therapy.

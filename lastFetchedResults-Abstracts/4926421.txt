Reconfiguration control of satellite constellation is relation with the control time, the fuel consumption, the performance improvement, the recoverability of the constellation configuration, as well as the performance influenced by the reconfiguration controlling, which is a multi-objective optimization problem. Using the multi-objective evolution algorithm NSGA-II, the Pareto solution sets which meet the mission requirements are obtained, then we can obtain the optimal satisfactory solutions of the constellation reconfiguration control through the linear weighted sum method in multi-objective decision. In view of the optimized design results and the design performance comparative analysis of different reconfiguration control strategies for the navigational constellation, it is indicated that the multi-objective evolution algorithm satisfied the mission requirements of optimal reconfiguration control, and the optimal scheme of satellite constellation reconfiguration control is found.

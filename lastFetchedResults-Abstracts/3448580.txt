On the basis of four common criteria&#194;&#191;integral square error (ISE), integral absolute error (IAE), time integral-square-error (ITSE), and time integral absolute error (ITAE)&#194;&#191;optimal lines for typical sampled data servo drives for computer numerical control (CNC) are derived and approximated by simple equations. The objective is to provide the control engineer with a simple equation for the selection of the control parameters. A line of critical damping is also derived and simply approximated.

This research adopts the Projection Pursuit Model to analyze the level standards for the evaluating indexes about the testability of a particular type of armored equipment. The Model is built with the samples randomly generated at all the levels; the weight coefficients of indexes are determined for the evaluation on testability of the armored equipment; and the correspondence is found between the variation ranges of characteristic values of projection and the levels of classification. Furthermore, an analysis is conducted on the original testability data of the equipment, which came from the final approval test of its type, to decide its testable level in evaluation. And the results are acceptable. This research provides the theoretic basis and methods of another approach to evaluate the testability and its design for a particular type of armored equipment in a scientific, accurate and objective way.

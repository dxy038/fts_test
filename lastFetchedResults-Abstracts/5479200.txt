The performance of a processing plant has a large impact on the profitability of a mining operation, yet plant design optimisation decisions are based on past experience and intuition rather than on scientific analysis. Genetic algorithms as a tool for circuit analysis in plant design and optimisation was considered. The multi-objective evolutionary algorithm initialises the plant design and optimisation based on experimental results, which are used to formulate and determine the objective function values. A simulation was conducted to assess the performance of candidate solutions. The two optima are then traded-off using cost objective, which is sought to be minimized. Once an optimum was selected, the circuit mass balance and equipment design was performed, bringing the theory of network design and genetic algorithms into unison. Results of the study provide financial benefits, optimal parameter settings for the comminution equipment and ultimately better plant performance.

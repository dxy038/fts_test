Use of native soil in adsorption of phenol from industrial wastewater has been one of the attractive
option for dephenolation, especially in view of low cost and ease in accessibility, as well as scope for regeneration (or,
at least reuse). However, an effective usage of the adsorbent necessitates a deeper understanding of the adsorption
characteristics. Most of the study of adsorption characteristics are confined to analysis of mono- and bi- parametric
isotherm models (and rarely, linearized multi-parametric isotherm models), due to the difficulties in solving higher
parametric models, as well as fairly satisfying results by lower-parametric models. In the present study, adsorption
batch studies were carried out using a naturally and widely available common soil of south India (namely, Adhanur soil),
for removal of phenol from the aqueous solution, with an explicit objective of comparison of linear and non-linear
regression methods for finding variation in isotherm coefficients and fitness of the models. Six linearized isotherm
models (including four linearized Langmuir models) and three non-linear isotherm model were discussed in this paper,
and their coefficients were estimated. Although all the studied isotherm models showed fairly good fit to the experimental
data, but Redlichâ€“Peterson isotherm was found to be the best representative for phenol-sorption on the used soil
adsorbent. Besides, it was observed that to determine the isotherm parameters non-linear isotherm models were found
to be the best representative of adsorption characteristics, than their linearized counter-parts.

The objective of this study was to develop an automatic rolling system for rice seedlings, which can roll up the seedling mat from a 30 by 60 cm tray into a cylindrical shape of 18 cm diameter and combine three rolls in one tray ready for transportation. The system employs a pneumatic mechanism for movement, with a programming logic controller for processing the procedure. Experimental results showed that the mechanism worked satisfactorily at 362 trays an hour, at which speed more than 95% of the seedling mats were rolled successfully and more than 90% of the three rolled mats were successfully combined in one tray. Since there was no significant difference in seedling quality for the machine-rolled mats compared to the manually rolled mats, this system should be favourably accepted by farmers.

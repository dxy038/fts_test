The authors describe a method of planning changes to a distribution system to meet load projections by minimizing the cost of these changes while ensuring the system meets required constraints. A computer program uses the method of simulated annealing to evaluate various configurations and to derive the optimal solution. The program evaluates options normally considered in a distribution planning study, such as reconductoring sections of feeders and switching sections of one feeder to another feeder. At each step of the optimization process, the program performs a load flow analysis to find the total losses and to check constraints. The objective function to be optimized is the cost of the changes added to the cost of the losses. The program has been used for several studies, including an existing 7.2 kV distribution system, and has provided good results

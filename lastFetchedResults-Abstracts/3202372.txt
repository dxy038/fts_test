Building Automation Systems (BAS) aim at providing control of indoor environment while for instance decreasing energy consumption. Most of these BAS exist and work in stand-alone configuration but the global objective for the whole building could be properly reached if the various BAS were able to cooperate. Thus, an abstraction layer is required to overcome this heterogeneity drawback. The objective of this paper is to describe a resource-based middleware that provides coordination capabilities and ensure the main properties required by the Building Automation (BA) domain. Then a dedicated framework is presented together with its exemplification scenario.

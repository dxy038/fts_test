One of the major innovations in higher education institutions emerges in the form of learning management systems (LMSs). The objective of this paper is to conceptualize the relationship between faculty member´s individual differences and LMS continuance in the higher education context. In essence, the individual differences between faculty members are viewed as influencing an instructor´s attitude and intention to continue using the LMS technology. The proposed integrative framework is supported by theoretical and empirical findings from prior Information Systems usage research.

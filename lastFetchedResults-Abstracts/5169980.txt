VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) is a technology that enables the routing of voice conversations over any IP-based network such as the public Internet. Separate and distinct client, gateway and call control functions that ability to support Peer-to-Peer, PC-to-telephone, telephone-to-PC and telephone-to-telephone scenarios. During transmission, the traffic loading and other factors in the IP (Internet Protocol) network may cause packets to be lost. Three parameters emerge as the primary factors affecting voice quality within networks that offer VoIP technologies: clarity, end-to-end delay and echo delayed. The objective of this research is to check Internet call delay over VoIP on peer-to-peer and telephone-to-telephone communication. The methodology used Sources of echo for test different type of call over VoIP. We used IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4), CISCO 3700 Series Router and telephone sets for experimentation. We checked QoS (Quality of Service) development on various sample signals. The tests were used templates varied in loudness,speech continuity, background noise and delay. We analyzed both male and female voices for results.

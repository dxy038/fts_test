Classical collapse therapy with extrapleural Lucite balls placement used for tuberculosis sequelae is associated with long term complications, such as migration of the foreign body. We report a new modality of collapse therapy for tuberculosis cavitation which may avoid this complication and which uses percutaneous tissue expanders. Postoperative course was uneventful and mid term follow-up confirmed the functional improvement without recurrence of the infection. This new modality of post-tuberculosis collapse therapy may allow treatment with fewer physical and physiologic sequelae of the residual cavities, and should reduce long term complications such as migration.

This paper introduces a new concept of artificial intelligence based algorithm for clustering the placement of SVCs in power system. The algorithm is based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique with objective function to minimize the transmission loss in the system. Experiments were performed on the IEEE 30- and IEEE 118-bus RTS to realize the effectiveness of the proposed technique, while verification was conducted through comparative studies with evolutionary programming (EP).

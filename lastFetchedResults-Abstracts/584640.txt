Background & Objective: Due to increasing rate of medical knowledge volume and depth, introducing new tasks and roles for general practitioners, and restriction of time and resources in medical education, it is essential to follow educational priorities especially in teaching medical doctors. The aim of this study was to determine the conformity of educational programs of ophthalmology department in Shiraz school of medicine, Shiraz, Iran, with the required educational priorities in medical doctor (MD) curriculum.
Methods: In this research, we focused on two aspects of theoretical education of ophthalmology; theoretical classes and final examinations. First, the topic discussed in the class or asked in final examinations was determined and its priority was graded according to a grading scale of A to D used in comprehensive study of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Then, after calculating sum of priorities, the rate of conformity with the expected priorities was determined using chi-square test.
Results: In both theoretical classes and final examinations, significant difference was observed between educational materials and the expected educational priorities (P  <  0.05).
Conclusion: In some cases, the priority “A” had been paid less attention and priorities “B”, “C”, and “D” had been paid more attention than the expected rates. Since the priorities considered in this study were based on those in Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences comprehensive study that is approved by faculty members of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, revision of the educational priorities seems to be required.

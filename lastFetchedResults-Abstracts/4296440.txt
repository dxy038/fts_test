The image template detection is usually a very important halfway step for a computational vision algorithm. In general, the basic idea of this type of algorithm is to receive an input image and generate a set of lines, borders, edges and other well known geometrical forms as outputs. Ben-Arie and Rao (1993) have proposed a linear filter that, given a template, maximizes the energy concentration in a single sample of its output. We propose a two-dimensional generalization of this method, formulating the template matching problem as a multivariable optimization. Three different objective functions are investigated. Simulation results show that the proposed method performs well on real images

The emerging of plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) results in the increase in the utilization of vehicles batteries for grid support. This paper presents a multi-objective algorithm to optimally determine the number of parking lots to be allocated in a distribution system. In addition, the algorithm optimally selects the locations and sizes of these parking lots. The proposed algorithm determines also the corresponding energy scheduling of the system resources. The objective of the proposed algorithm is to minimize the overall energy cost of the system. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem which is solved using artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm taking into consideration the power system and PHEV operational constraints. The proposed algorithm is applied to a 33-bus radial distribution network. The test results indicate an improvement in the operational conditions of the system.

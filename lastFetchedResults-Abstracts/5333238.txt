In this paper, the designing and manufacturing processes of the bidirectional pulse plasma power supply for the treatment of air pollution and ozone generation are proposed, and its characteristics are described with the experimental results. The proposed power supply consists of power semiconductor switch devices, high voltage and high frequency transformer, and control board for adapting the switching method. It is implemented with the pulse voltage of 0-20 kV and the pulse frequency range of 1-10 kHz. After the application of the bidirectional pulse power to the DBD (dielectric barrier discharge) reactor, it can be observed the spatial distribution of discharge inside the reactor by using an ICCD camera. And the characteristics of the proposed system are analyzed through the experiment of decomposition of CH<sub>4</sub> known to be the relatively persistent pollution gas

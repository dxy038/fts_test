This brief considers model predictive control of switched mode power converters using a hybrid sampled data model. The goal of the approach is to synthesize a controller that achieves both good dynamic performance and low harmonic distortion at steady state. The suggested control approach takes the switched nature of the converter into account in both the system model and the control objective. This has two main advantages. First, it removes the need for the low-pass filters which are conventionally applied to the state measurements to attenuate the switching ripple. This implies that improved dynamic performance can be obtained. Second, it penalizes the ripple deviation from the reference, which means that reduced harmonic distortion can be obtained at steady state.

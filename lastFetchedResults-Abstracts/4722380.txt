This paper presents a security constrained power system dynamic performance enhancement using particle swarm optimization (PSO) based on time domain simulation (TDS). The key feature of the security monitoring is the critical fault clearing time. Time-domain simulation is used to determine the unstable point of the power system based on bisection technique to reduce computation time. The Independent System Operator (ISO) should plan hours-ahead or days-ahead rescheduling to determine the optimal allocation of generated power from each generator based on the expected system disturbances. The objective is to find proper adjustments of the generated power that maintain acceptable security levels throughout the system and minimize system losses. The generation rescheduling (GR) is considered as a necessary remedial action to improve the system transient stability during the disturbances. PSO is used to determine the most suitable generation coordination among system generators.

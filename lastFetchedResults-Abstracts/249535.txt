The purpose of this work is to apply an inverse boundary element formulation in order to develop
e cient algorithms for identi cation of polarization curves in a cathodic protection system. The problem
is to minimize an objective function measuring the di erence between observed and BEM-predicted
surface potentials. The numerical formulation is based on the application of genetic algorithms, which
are robust search techniques emulating the natural process of evolution as a means of progressing
towards an optimum solution.
Examples of application are included in the paper for di erent types of polarization curves in  nite
and in nite electrolytes. The accuracy and e ciency of the numerical results are veri ed by comparison
with standard conjugate gradient techniques. As a result of this research, the genetic algorithm approach
is shown to be more robust, independent of the position of the sensors and of initial guesses, and will
be further developed for three-dimensional applications

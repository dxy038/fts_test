Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of chronic vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) on sleep/wake background EEG and interictal epileptiform activity (IEA) of patients with medically refractory epilepsy.
Methods: From a broader sample of 10 patients subjected to baseline and treatment polysomnographies, spectral analysis and IEA count have been performed on 6 subjectsâ€™ recordings, comparing the results by means of statistical analysis.
Results: An overall increase in EEG total power after VNS has been observed, more marked in NREM sleep; collapsing EEG power spectra into 5 frequency bands, we have found a statistically significant increase in delta and theta in NREM sleep, and of alpha in wakefulness and REM sleep. The incidence of IEA is diminished, although not significantly; only the duration of discharges is significantly diminished.
Conclusions and significance: Long-term VNS produces an enhancement in sleep EEG power of medically refractory epileptic patients. These results may be related to a better structured composition of EEG, and it is possible that chronic VNS may have a major role in enhancing the brain's ability to generate an electrical activity.

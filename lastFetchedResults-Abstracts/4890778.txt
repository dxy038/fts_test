In this paper, we propose a new image interpolation method based on redundant discrete wavelet transform (RDWT) and self-adaptive process according to edge details. Information about sharp variations both in horizontal and vertical directions derived from sub-bands has been considered, followed by a weighted part in order to predict the vertical and horizontal details separately needed to reconstruct the high-resolution image. Extensive tests show that both objective quality (PSNR) and subjective quality are obviously improved compared to several other state-of-the-art methods, and this work also leave wide area for further research.

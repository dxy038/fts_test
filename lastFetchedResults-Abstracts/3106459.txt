The Precipitation and All-weather Temperature and Humidity (PATH) mission is one of 15 Earth space missions that the U.S. National Research Council recently recommended that NASA undertake in the next decade. The PATH mission will place a microwave atmospheric sounder, operating in the same temperature and water vapor bands used by the low-earth-orbiting Advanced Microwave Sounding Units (AMSU), into geostationary orbit. The objective is to enable time-continuous observations of severe storms, tropical cyclones and atmospheric processes associated with the hydrologic cycle under all weather conditions. The ultimate goal is to improve models in these areas, provide initial conditions and assimilation data for improved forecasts, and develop long time series to support climate studies. Both NOAA and NASA have long sought to develop such a sensor, but it is only recently that new techniques have emerged that enable such a mission. The Geostationary Synthetic Thinned Aperture Radiometer (GeoSTAR) is a microwave sounder concept based on aperture synthesis that has been developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A small proof-of-concept prototype was completed in 2006 under the NASA Instrument Incubator Program, and this demonstrator proves that the aperture synthesis method is a feasible approach for attaining the very large aperture required for adequate spatial resolution. The performance of the prototype and projections to a full-scale space version indicate that GeoSTAR, unlike alternative approaches, can meet all measurement requirements. It is therefore now considered the baseline PATH payload and is expected to be implemented by NASA in the next decade.

We characterize the dynamics of multiple prioritized control objectives and we present a framework that can simultaneously control these objectives by providing decoupled closed-loop dynamics within their priority level. This controller is suitable for robots that operate in human environments, where they face multiple contacts and must comply with multiple control criteria. We explore several cases including constrained hand tracking and compliant multi-objective control.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of the Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale (BDS) as a measure of behavioral regulation in Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Two patients groups (n = 40 MCI and 40 AD) recruited from a memory clinic and an elderly control (EC) group (n = 40) recruited from the community were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests including the BDS and a measure of functioning of activities of daily living (ADLs). Results of ROC analyses revealed that performance on the BDS discriminated between the AD group and the MCI and EC groups but did not discriminate between the MCI and EC groups. Performance on the BDS was an independent predictor of ADLs in patient groups after controlling for the effects of performance on a memory measure.

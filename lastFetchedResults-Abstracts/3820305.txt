The objective of this study is to identify differences in the friction and wear characteristics of various particulate and metal evaporated (ME) magnetic tapes. Co-&#947;Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, CrO<sub>2</sub>, metal particle (MP), barium ferrite (BaFe) and ME tapes were run against Mn-Zn ferrite head samples in a linear mode under accelerated conditions. Coefficient of friction was recorded and depth of wear on the contact surface of the ferrite samples was measured by an atomic force microscope using a newly developed &#8220;nano-scratch&#8221; technique. The Co-&#947;Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MP and BaFe tapes resulted in a much lower wear rate of the mating ferrite sample than the CrO<sub>2 </sub> tape. MP and BaFe tapes resulted in a finely polished ferrite surface with original roughness eventually worn smooth. Some scratches were produced with all particulate tapes with heavier scratches in contact with Co&#947;Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and CrO<sub>2</sub> tapes. ME tape caused very little wear on ferrite with some mild abrasive action due to wear debris. Transfer of topical lubricant caused some agglomeration of this debris. ME tape showed a lower coefficient of friction against ferrite than the particulate tapes

The objective of this work was to determine the significant parameters of a 3-GW 200-kV dc superconducting cable system which influence the transient voltage distribution in the various parts of the cable. The cable system consists of four coaxial metallic cylinders. It was found that the dielectric constant and the electrical resistivity of the soil significantly affect the severity of the transient voltages; lower dielectric constant and higher resistivity of the soil will increase the magnitudes of the transient voltages by increasing the earth-return impedance. It was also found that the effect of the conductor internal impedances of the cable is insignificant. Shorting the coaxial cylinders of the cryogen flow and the cryostat will lessen the severity of the transient voltages. Grounding the second, third, and fourth cylinders at regular intervals with low-impedance grounding impedance will also improve the transient performance of the cable. More research is needed to evaluate these procedures

Summary form only given. In this paper, we are interested in the study of a method of reduction of order for a system slightly non-linear which is the engine with D.C. current. This method is based on the dominant variables. Initially we are interested in the problem of obtaining of a model reduced by minimizing a criterion of error given. In the second time we fix our self for objective to simplify the structure of the model reduced by using the genetic algorithms. To validate the made study, a series of tests of simulation is carried out by using the language C<sup>++</sup> Builder.

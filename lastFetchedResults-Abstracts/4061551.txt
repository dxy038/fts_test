Colorant-based direct binary search (CB-DBS) halftoning proposed in provides an image quality benchmark for dispersed-dot halftoning algorithms. The objective of this paper is to further push the image quality limit. An algorithm called hierarchical colorant-based direct binary search (HCB-DBS) is developed in this paper. By appropriately integrating yellow colorant into dot-overlapping and dot-positioning controls, it is demonstrated that HCB-DBS can achieve better halftone texture of both individual and joint dot-color planes, without compromising the dot distribution of more visible halftone of cyan and magenta colorants. The input color specification is first converted from colorant space to dot-color space with minimum brightness variation principle for full dot-overlapping control. The dot-colors are then split into groups based upon dot visibility. Hierarchical monochrome DBS halftoning is applied to make dot-positioning decision for each group, constrained on the already generated halftone of the groups with higher priority. And dot-coloring is decided recursively with joint monochrome DBS halftoning constrained on the related total dot distribution. Experiments show HCB-DBS improves halftone texture for both individual and joint dot-color planes. And it reduces the halftone graininess and free of color mottle artifacts, comparing to CB-DBS.

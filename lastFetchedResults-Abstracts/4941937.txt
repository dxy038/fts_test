Heuristic methods are specially well suited to solve combinatorial problems. One of these problems is the distribution of petroleum products through oil pipelines networks. In this paper the problem is stated and solved using a multiobjective and constraint evolutionary optimization algorithm. Several objective functions has been defined to express the goals of the solutions as well as the preferences among them. Some constraints are included as hard objective functions and some has been evaluated through a repairing function to avoid infeasible solutions. An example of working is given.

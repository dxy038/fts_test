A multiscale objective-oriented approach is proposed for the synthesis, simulation and development of solids processes. By examining the design effort at different length scales, we focus on the right scale and level of details; by aligning the objective of each subtask with the overall project objective, we minimize time and effort for development. To implement this approach for solids processes, the needs for systematic design procedures, simulation frameworks, equipment models, proper handling of uncertainties, and workflow are discussed.

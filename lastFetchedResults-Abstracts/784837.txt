Loss of muscle mass is common among old people living in institutions but trials that
evaluate interventions aimed at increasing the muscle mass are lacking. Objective, participants and intervention:
This randomized controlled trial was performed to evaluate the effect of a high-intensity functional exercise
program and a timed protein-enriched drink on muscle mass in 177 people aged 65 to 99 with severe physical or
cognitive impairments, and living in residential care facilities. Design: Three-month high-intensity exercise was
compared with a control activity and a protein-enriched drink was compared with a placebo drink. A bioelectrical
impedance spectrometer (BIS) was used in the evaluation. The amount of muscle mass and body weight (BW)
were followed-up at three and six months and analyzed in a 2 x 2 factorial ANCOVA, using the intention to treat
principle, and controlling for baseline values. Results: At 3-month follow-up there were no differences in muscle
mass and BW between the exercise and the control group or between the protein and the placebo group. No
interaction effects were seen between the exercise and nutritional intervention. Long-term negative effects on
muscle mass and BW was seen in the exercise group at the 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: A three month highintensity
functional exercise program did not increase the amount of muscle mass and an intake of a proteinenriched
drink immediately after the exercise did not induce any additional effect on muscle mass. There were
negative long-term effects on muscle mass and BW, indicating that it is probably necessary to compensate for an
increased energy demand when offering a high-intensity exercise program

This paper presents a new approach for coupling control problems for norm bounded continuous-time uncertain systems. Firstly, a design of the state feedback decoupling controller is presented. The nominal model could be decoupled completely and the coupling of the actual system would be reduced. Secondly, based on the linear matrix inequality (LMI), combining the guaranteed cost control law with the decoupling control, the state feedback tracking guaranteed cost control law is proposed. Finally, taking BTT vehicle as the research objective, the design procedure of the decoupling guaranteed cost controllers is shown and the final results of the simulation are proved with effectiveness for the proposed design approach.

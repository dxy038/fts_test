Packet dropping (or packet loss) in networks occurs due to congestion in the network. Congestion occurs more often in wireless cellular network due to limited resources (buffer and bandwidth) and frequent use of multimedia application. Efficient buffer management scheme with dynamic queue threshold can reduce packet dropping. We make a brief survey of buffer management scheme for wired and wireless network. We also present an idea of applying genetic algorithm technique to the base station buffer management with common threshold for multiple queues to reduce packet dropping (defined as packet loss ratio) in wireless cellular network. The basic objective of the applications of GA in our work is to tune parameters of threshold and a degree of buffer sharing. We define chromosome structure, fitness function and algorithm for buffer management using GA. The preliminary results are collected by testing of a Museum Multimedia Guide system in Belgorod-Dnestrowsk Museum, Ukraine. The final result is awaited.

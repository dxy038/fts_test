Objective: To study the effects of curcumin on the proteome of L02 cells with the techniques of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass-spectrometric. Methods: The total proteins of the untreated L02 cells and the L02 cells treated with 25 &#956;mol/L curcumin for 24 hours were separated and the 2-DE was used to establish the proteome maps. The differential expression proteins between the two groups were identified with the MALDI-TOF-MS. Results: 8 differential expression proteins were found, in which heat shock protein 70, glucose-regulated protein 75, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, eukaryotic translation initiation factor-3, &#946;-tubulin were up-regulated, and nuclear phosphoprotein-1, laminin receptor were down-regulated. Conclusion: These identified differential proteins might be related to the mechanism of the curcumin anti-atherosclerotic and anti-tumor.

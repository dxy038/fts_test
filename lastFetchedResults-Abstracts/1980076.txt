This study goes beyond subjective personal introspection and applies multiple methods to accomplish a confirmatory personal introspection (CPI) of a long‐term stay in Sweden, during a university exchange program. The utilization of old pictures of the experience is one of the key aspects of the research. This study aims to show the importance of confirmatory personal introspection and assess the meaningfulness of CPI for travel industry related marketing research, exploring further than the ordinary tourist vacations and investigating a broader spectrum of the travel experience, in this case a long‐term travel. Demonstrating the significance of photography relating to travel experiences is an additional objective of the study.

Presents simple formulas for predicting the effectiveness of sampling plans for inspecting welds in nuclear power plant piping systems. The alternative plans differ in terms of the initial sample size and the strategy used to expand the sample size. This study is concerned with developing formulas that describe the plans as they are actually implemented, particularly variants of the ASME Section XI plan. Historically, actual sampling plans have never been strictly followed: Whenever defects are found, the plan is typically augmented with additional inspections and repair. The objective of these calculations is to take these actions into account

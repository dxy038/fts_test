We developed a general method for determination of water production rates from groundbased visual observations and applied it to Comet Hale–Bopp. Our main objective is to extend the method to include total visual magnitude observations obtained with CCD detector and V filter in the analysis of total visual magnitudes. We compare the CCD V-broadband careful observations of Liller [Liller, W. Pre-perihelion CCD photometry of Comet 1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp). Planet. Space Sci. 45, 1505–1513, 1997; Liller, W. CCD photometry of Comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp): 1995–2000. Int. Comet Quart. 23(3), 93–97, 2001] with the total visual magnitude observations from experienced international observers found in the International Comet Quarterly (ICQ) archive. A data set of ∼400 CCD observations covering about the same 6 years time span of the ∼12,000 ICQ selected total visual magnitude observations were used in the analysis. A least-square method applied to the water production rates, yields power laws as a function of the heliocentric distances for the pre- and post-perihelion phases. The average dimension of the nucleus as well as its effective active area is determined and compared with values published in the literature.

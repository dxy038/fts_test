Timeliness is one of the most important objectives that reflect the quality of emergency services such as ambulance and firefighting systems. To provide timeliness, system administrators may increase the number of service vehicles available. Unfortunately, increasing the number of vehicles is generally impossible due to capital constraints. In such a case, the efficient deployment of emergency service vehicles becomes a crucial issue. In this paper, a multi-objective covering-based emergency vehicle location model is proposed. The objectives considered in the model are maximization of the population covered by one vehicle, maximization of the population with backup coverage and increasing the service level by minimizing the total travel distance from locations at a distance bigger than a prespecified distance standard for all zones. Model applications with different solution approaches such as lexicographic linear programming and fuzzy goal programming (FGP) are provided through numerical illustrations to demonstrate the applicability of the model. Numerical results indicate that the model generates satisfactory solutions at an acceptable achievement level of desired goals.

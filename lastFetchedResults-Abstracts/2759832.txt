Background: Given the level of technological pro- gress made today is that civic and government institutions seek to replicate the success of systems like the financial sector and banking in electronic voting systems. Objective: To make an analysis for the developed systems to conduct electronic voting from the Requirements Engineering perspective. Method: We use the methodology of systematic mapping study. Initially, we collect 240 publications and finally selecting 60 works. The Non Functional Requirements selected were Security, Performance efficiency, Reliability and Operability, which were chosen from several publications suggesting that this group was critical to the successful adoption of electronic voting systems. Results: The results show that 49 % of the proposals considered Security feature the most relevant, which is consistent with the literature. The 23% of publications addressing Performance Efficiency, revealing that the main problem today is to build a model of electronic voting that is safe and can be widely implemented dedicating a reasonable amount of resources. Conclusions: A set of recommendations was generated. Given the complexity of e- vote systems, these must be addressed holistically.

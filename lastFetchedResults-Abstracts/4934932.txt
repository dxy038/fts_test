Routing problems in integrated networks composed of hybrid-link systems are described. Circuit- and packet-switched traffic, both voice and data, share the network resources using a movable boundary scheme. The problem is to determine how two different kinds of traffic should be routed in a single network. It appears impossible to develop the optimum algorithm which finds the global optimum routes. This is because the objective function adopted, a weighted sum of blocking probability and time delay, is not convex with respect to the flows. Hence, a simple algorithm which can find a good solution is proposed. Using the algorithm, case studies have been carried out to check whether voice and data take the same paths, or whether they have their own set of paths. The numerical results indicate that voice and data should take the same paths to realize tolerable performance of blocking probability and time delay.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

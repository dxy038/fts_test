Some of the issues that should be considered in the design of a high-performance laser printer controller are discussed, with emphasis on predicting the performance under page description language (PDL) applications. The objective is not to develop a standard solution, but rather to bring out some of the design options, to provide a better understanding of the tradeoffs, and, in the process, to point out some pitfalls to avoid. A PDL, such as printer PostScript, is a high-level language used to describe both what is to be printed and how it is to be printed. The challenge is that of processing the high-level PDL to result in an optimal raster presentation to the engine at reasonable speeds and costs, and across a broad spectrum of applications. The input module performance can be highly dependent upon the page content-test, graphics, image-which is determined by the applications. The host-to-printer physical interface selection must also be evaluated to be consistent with the expected print file structure and desired print engine speed.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

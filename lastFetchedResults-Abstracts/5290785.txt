In recent years, power electronic energy storage systems using super capacitor bank have been widely studied and developed for the electronic vehicles. In this paper, a full-bridge/centertapped push-pull circuit-based bidirectional DC-DC converter and its control method are proposed and discussed. From the results of detailed experimental demonstration, the proposed system is able to perform adequate charging and discharging operation between low-voltage high-current super capacitor side and high-voltage low-current side with drive train and main battery. Furthermore, conduction losses and voltage/current surge are drastically reduced by ZVS operation with lossless snubber capacitor in high-voltage side as well as the synchronous rectification in low-voltage high-current super capacitor side.

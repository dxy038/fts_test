This paper presents the development of a handset adaptive antenna using a constant modulus algorithm (CMA). The antenna is a switched-beam phased array antenna which can assist initialization of CMA. The method to improve convergence property of CMA exploits a beam with maximum received power from several switched-beams of the antenna as an initial beam. A square patch of one wavelength width provides a bidirectional pattern that beam switching can be accomplished by switching a feeding probe position. A single stub is designed to match the input impedance. The signal processing unit is implemented on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Simulation results in term of signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) are shown to validate that the proposed antenna has a good performance and is suitable for installation on a handset.

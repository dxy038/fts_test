Two identical three-phase, bipolar transistor, controlled-current, pulsewidth modulation (PWM) power modulators are integrated so that one functions as a rectifier and the other as an inverter in an AC drive system. The rectifier input currents maintain near-60-Hz sinusoidal waveforms with unity power factor. A leading power factor is also possible. The modulators do not depend on the availability of bidirectional switch elements. Performance as a polyphase induction motor drive under motoring and regenerative braking is reported. The study includes digital simulation of operation as a synchronous motor drive.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

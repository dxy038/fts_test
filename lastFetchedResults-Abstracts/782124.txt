The objective of this work was to investigate the effects of a single anthelmintic treatment
on milk production. In 2008, in a flock of Sarda ewes naturally infected by gastrointestinal
nematodes, 162 adult and 72 primiparous ewes were allocated into four groups. For each
age class, one group was drenched with albendazole after lamb weaning whilst the other
was left untreated as control. The efficacy of single anthelmintic treatment at the beginning
of lactation was obtained by a faecal egg count reduction test. The effect of drenching on
milk yield and components was studied both using single test date and lactation records.
After 1 month geometric mean of eggs per gram of treated ewes decreased up to 1% of
the initial value (3.40 eggs/g versus 322.63 eggs/g in primiparous and 2.14 eggs/g versus
312.70 eggs/g in adult ewes). The anthelmintic treatment showed a significant effect only
on lactation milk yield of treated adult ewes that produced 19.2 L/year more than control
ewes. Production level was investigated as a criterion to apply targeted selective treatment.
High producer multiparous ewes produced 32.7 L/year more than control ones. Overall
results confirm a beneficial effect of anthelmintic treatment on milk production without
any detrimental effect on milk composition only on adult ewes markedly if high producers.
Thus, depending on milk price and the required length of the period of discarded milk, the
increased milk yield can counterbalance treatmentâ€™s costs.

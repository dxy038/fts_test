Hemorrhagic disease, caused by various serotypes of two closely related orbivirus serogroups, the epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses (EHDV) and the bluetongue viruses (BTV), is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in white-tailed deer (WTD) in the United States. Despite the importance of hemorrhagic disease in WTD, little is known about host defense mechanisms triggered by infection with either causative virus or how that immune response is modulated by challenge with closely related orbiviruses, as can occur under natural conditions. Initial experimental data from our laboratory showed WTD infected with EHDV serotype 2 (EHDV-2) had responded serologically but often became lymphopenic and had a reduced lymphocyte proliferative response in vitro to T-cell mitogens, suggesting possible suppression of cell-mediated immunity. The primary objective of this study was to more closely examine cell-mediated immunity of WTD when experimentally infected with EHDV-2 and subsequently challenged with BTV serotype 10 (BTV-10).

ll-mediated response was evaluated via in vitro lymphocyte proliferation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production assays, and in vivo delayed type hypersensitivity tests. Deer infected with either EHDV-2 or BTV-10 responded similarly in all assays. Infected deer had decreased lymphocyte counts between post-infection days (PID) 6 and 10, with concurrent diminished lymphocytic response to concanavalin A in lymphocyte proliferation assays and phytohemagglutinin in delayed type hypersensitivity tests. However, IL-2 production by peripheral blood lymphocytes of infected deer was comparable with that of non-infected control deer as measured using a IL-2-dependent bovine cell line (BT2). This suppression of T-cell proliferation, but not IL-2 production suggests selective inhibition of T-cells probably via altered signal transduction for either expression of the IL-2 receptor or for IL-2 receptor signal-induced T-cell proliferation.

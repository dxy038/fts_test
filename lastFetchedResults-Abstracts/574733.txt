Introduction & Objective: Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), the most common human malignancy, frequently occur on areas exposed to sunlight, but are uncommon on unexposed â€“ skin regions. Therefore, location cannot be relied as the first factor in diagnosis of BCCs. We report our experience about BCCs located on the covered and uncommon sites of body
Materials & Methods: A total of 1135 histologically confirmed primary BCCs, from 1992-2005, were studied. Age, sex and site of presentation and different histological subtypes of BCC were considered. 
Results: 48 cases (27 men, 21 women) of uncommonly located BCCs were recorded. The average age was 52.7?14.1, and the male-female ratio was 1.2. Of 48 BCCs, 27 (56.3%) were on the trunk, 8 (16.7%) on the upper limbs, 11 (22.9%) on the lower limbs, and 2 (4.2%) on the genitalia. Solid BCC (66.6%) was the dominant histologic type for all sites.
Conclusion: Although from total of 1135 primary BCCs were studied, only 48 cases (4.2%) located on covered and uncommon sites of body, but in our opinion, BCC should be considered in these areas and biopsy of all suspected lesions is advisable.

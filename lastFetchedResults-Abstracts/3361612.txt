Besides noise reduction an important objective of binaural speech enhancement algorithms is the preservation of the binaural cues of all sound sources. To this end, an extension of the binaural multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF), namely the MWF-ITF, has been proposed, which aims to preserve the Interaural Transfer Function (ITF) of the noise sources. However, the MWF-ITF is well-suited only for directional noise sources but not for, e.g., spatially isotropic noise, whose spatial characteristics cannot be properly described by the ITF but rather by the Interaural Coherence (IC). Hence, another extension of the binaural MWF, namely the MWF-IC, has been recently proposed, which aims to preserve the IC of the noise component. Since for the MWF-IC a substantial tradeoff between noise reduction and IC preservation exists, in this paper we propose a perceptually constrained version of the MWF-IC, where the amount of IC preservation is controlled based on the IC discrimination ability of the human auditory system. In addition, a theoretical analysis of the binaural cue preservation capabilities of the binaural MWF and the MWF-ITF for spatially isotropic noise fields is provided. Several simulations in diffuse noise scenarios show that the perceptually constrained MWF-IC yields a controllable preservation of the IC without significantly degrading the output SNR compared to the binaural MWF and the MWF-ITF. Furthermore, contrary to the binaural MWF and MWF-ITF, the proposed algorithm retains the spatial separation between the output speech and noise components while the binaural cues of the speech component are only slightly distorted, such that the binaural hearing advantage for speech intelligibility can still be exploited.

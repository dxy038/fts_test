Manufacturing and engineering education activities at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) are described. The primary objective of these activities is to prepare students to meet the challenge of the development and effective utilization of integrated information-driven manufacturing systems. Thus, the core of the program curricula consists of courses dealing with problems and methods of manufacturing systems integration, augmented for most students by an interdisciplinary team project performed in collaboration with industry. Also addressed is the need to prepare students to deal with problems at the element and subsystem level. Tables listing course contents are presented

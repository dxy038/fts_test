The main objective of this work is to implement a secure VPN tunnel between two computers by creating a VPN server and a number of VPN clients. This VPN implementation is done for a software tool named remote digital evidence acquisition. A VPN server acts as a tunnel between two client systems through which a file or message can be transferred in an encrypted form. Each client system has to be registered with the server before sending a VPN request. During the registration process the VPN server has to assign dynamic IP address to the requesting machine. If the IPN request is accepted, a tunnel is created between the client and the server. The data can be sent to some other system by specifying the IP address of the destination system. The data is transferred in an encrypted form through the VPN server.

One of the major objective of adsorption studies is the determination of required time for optimal adsorption in the solid-liquid. system In addition to research on the effect of sorbent dose, balance time, the efficiency of adsorption and adsorption kinetics models were evaluated. Fitness of measured data with the predicted value by lagergren and Avrami model showed the model not only gives a good estimation of equilibriuim value of absorption but also describes absorption data well.

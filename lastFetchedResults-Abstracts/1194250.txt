A Bayesian Network approach has been developed that can compare different building designs by estimating the effects of the thermal indoor environment on the mental performance of office workers. A part of this network is based on the compilation of subjective thermal sensation data and the associated objective thermal measurements from 12,000 office occupants from different parts of the world. A Performance Index (Î ) is introduced that can be used to compare directly the different building designs and furthermore to assess the total economic consequences of the indoor climate with a specific building design. In this paper, focus will be on the effects of temperature on mental performance and not on other indoor climate factors. A total economic comparison of six different building designs, four located in northern Europe and two in Los Angeles, USA, was performed. The results indicate that investments in improved indoor thermal conditions can be justified economically in most cases. The Bayesian Network provides a reliable platform using probabilities for modelling the complexity while estimating the effect of indoor climate factors on human beings, due to the different ways in which humans are affected by the indoor climate.

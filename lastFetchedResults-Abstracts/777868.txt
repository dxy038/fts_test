It is the purpose of this paper to multiobjective
design of the single-machine Power System
Stabilizers (PSSs) using Imperialist Competition
Algorithm (ICA). The ability of the proposed approach
for optimal setting of the widely used Conventional
Power System Stabilizers (CPSSs) has been attended.
The PSSs parameters designing problem is converted to
an optimization problem with a multi-objective function
including the desired damping factor and the desired
damping ratio of the power system modes, which are
solved by the ICA algorithm. The capability of the
proposed approach is confirmed on a single-machine
power system under different operating conditions and
disturbances. The results of the proposed approach are
compared with the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based tuned
PSS through some performance indices to reveal its
strong performance.

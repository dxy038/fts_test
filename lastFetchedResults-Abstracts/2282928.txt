The objective of this paper is aimed at investigating experimentally the irreducible water saturation and the dynamic behavior of the thickness of the adsorbed water layer (AWL) with a change of the driving pressure gradient. The thickness of AWL on micro glass beads is measured and calculated by means of a centrifugal method and a gravimetric analysis. The factors that influenced the thickness of AWL are investigated as well. The results disclose that the thickness of AWL is not a constant, but a function of the driving pressure gradient. Academic calculation and micro-tube experiment have been performed to study the effect of AWL on percolation behavior at lower Reynolds number (Re). The experimental result demonstrates that AWL plays a key role in the percolation of water in reservoir, especially in an extremely low permeability reservoir.

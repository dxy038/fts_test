Striving to maximize baseline (Joint Photographers Expert Group-JPEG) image quality without compromising compatibility of current JPEG decoders, we develop an image-adaptive JPEG encoding algorithm that jointly optimizes quantizer selection, coefficient &#8220;thresholding&#8221;, and Huffman coding within a rate-distortion (R-D) framework. Practically speaking, our algorithm unifies two previous approaches to image-adaptive JPEG encoding: R-D optimized quantizer selection and R-D optimal thresholding. Conceptually speaking, our algorithm is a logical consequence of entropy-constrained vector quantization (ECVQ) design principles in the severely constrained instance of JPEG-compatible encoding. We explore both viewpoints: the practical, to concretely derive our algorithm, and the conceptual, to justify the claim that our algorithm approaches the best performance that a JPEG encoder can achieve. This performance includes significant objective peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) improvement over previous work and at high rates gives results comparable to state-of-the-art image coders. For example, coding the Lena image at 1.0 b/pixel, our JPEG encoder achieves a PSNR performance of 39.6 dB that slightly exceeds the quoted PSNR results of ShapiroÂ´s wavelet-based zero-tree coder. Using a visually based distortion metric, we can achieve noticeable subjective improvement as well. Furthermore, our algorithm may be applied to other systems that use run-length encoding, including intraframe MPEG and subband or wavelet coding

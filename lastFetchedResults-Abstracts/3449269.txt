The main objective is to develop a generalized switch-controlled induction machine circuit modeling technique which is suitable for any switching circuit configuration. The authors present a generalized algorithm which provides a systematic procedure in connecting the formulated induction machine and the switching circuit models through the tensor approach. The formulations of the machine systems for both the switching circuits connected in the stator and rotor sides of the induction machines are derived. By proper selection of the <e1>dq</e1> reference frame, which depends on the side of the switching circuit connected to the machine, the proposed algorithm will supply an efficient and compact model suitable for arbitrary switching circuit configurations for the induction machine system. Numerical examples on the dynamic simulation of a stator-phase-controlled induction machine circuit are provided to demonstrate the validity of the algorithm

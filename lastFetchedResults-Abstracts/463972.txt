Objective: By presentation of cases of spontaneous (nontraumatic) ruptures of previously intact uteri, we sought to emphasize important aspects of this rare and dangerous event.
Study design: Two case presentations of oxytocin-associated unscarred uterine rupture and review of pertinent literature are used to study risk factors and accompanying clinical characteristics.
Results: Both spontaneous ruptures of previous unscarred uteri were associated with low-dose oxytocin augmentation, bradycardia, and uterine hyperstimulation monitor patterns and occurred at the onset of the second stage of labor.
Conclusion: Because of its rarity, further investigation of spontaneous uterine rupture will depend on case presentations where the associated events listed are noted and uterine hyperstimulation, fetal bradycardia, and second-stage onset are proved or disproved as valid clinical associations.

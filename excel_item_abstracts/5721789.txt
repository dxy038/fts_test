This paper proposes a metamodel for a metatool able to describe and manage components. A good reuse-oriented information system development environment must be composed of an appropriate component repository. Repositories must support organization and management of components, selection and comprehension of relevant components and components heterogeneity. The components repository designer should be able to design a components repository scheme, which could be used to structure and organize the components collection. So, the meta-model must be able to support heterogeneous components repositories. The meta-tool allows the development process using conceptual components and used in the different stages of the information system life cycle. The resulting meta-model is able to model components descriptions formalisms and component models and to define relationships. Therefore the metatool supports the developers (designer or programmer) by providing conceptual design and software solutions for the reuse of the selected components (conceptual or software).

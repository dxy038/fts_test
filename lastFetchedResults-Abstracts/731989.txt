Objective. The relationships between trait anxiety, or anxiety proneness, and smoking and between trait anxiety and smoking cessation, among an adult population were investigated.

Methods. The subjects were 2,669 male Japanese personnel working for a Japanese government agency. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire on smoking and smoking cessation status and other habits. Trait anxiety was evaluated with the trait anxiety part of the standardized Japanese version of the Spielberger State–Trait Anxiety Inventory. Trait anxiety is regarded as the long-term, more endogenous general type of anxiety. Odds ratios of the single 2 × 2 table were calculated and a logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for age.

Results. After adjusting for age, high trait anxiety did not increase the risk of smoking and was not related to success in abstaining from smoking. More subjects with high trait anxiety had planned to stop smoking (adjusted odds ratio: 1.39, P = 0.01) but did not actually succeed in doing so.

Conclusion. The present study did not support the hypothesis that high trait anxiety increased the risk of having a smoking habit and that high trait anxiety increased the chance of abstaining from smoking. However, the study did show that high trait anxiety was related to the planning of smoking cessation, but not to actually giving up the smoking habit.

Level control is one of the crucial parameter and need to be controlled accurately. More than 70 years, PID controllers are dominating and used preferably in industry. Today most of the single regulatory loops are configured for PID. PID is actually increases process variability, decrease production and product quality and ultimately increase overall cost. It has its inherent disadvantages. Advanced control algorithm can be used to overcome PID weaknesses. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a advanced control strategy which uses a model to predict future behavior of the system. Finally it calculates the future control sequence to bring the controlled variable to its objective. This paper is a sincere attempt to use MPC for a single regulatory level loop. LabVIEW based MPC is designed and simulated to control a level of a laboratory setup. The experimental model is identified using process reaction curve. LabVIEW based MPC is successfully simulated and its performance is tested for constrained and unconstrained input and output variable.

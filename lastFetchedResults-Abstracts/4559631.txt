Lockheed Martin has developed a Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) Terrestrial Emulator (MTE) to provide the joint warfighter insight into future capability as well as to anticipate, plan and incorporate MUOS into relevant tactics, techniques and procedures prior to MUOS initial operational capability (IOC). This paper will discuss the insights gained from a series of Joint DoD field experiments involving the MTE to understand the impact of MUOS support to distributed military operations.

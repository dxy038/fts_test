Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of perinatal factors that are associated with severe intracranial hemorrhage in a large and recent multicenter experience. Study Design: Retrospective analyses of nonanomalous newborns who were admitted to 100 neonatal intensive care units from 23 to 34 6/7 weeks' gestation were analyzed by multiple regression. Results: There were 12,578 premature newborns with a mean ( ± SD) gestational age of 31.3 ± 2.9 weeks and a birth weight of 1685 ± 571 g, respectively. The overall incidence of severe intracranial hemorrhage was 2.9%; in 4575 newborns who weighed ≤1500 g the incidences of intracranial hemorrhage was 7.1%. Factors with positive and negative associations with severe intracranial hemorrhage are listed in order of decreasing statistical significance: gestational age (negative), surfactant (positive), antenatal indomethacin (positive), neonatal transport (positive), cesarean birth (negative), poor prenatal care (positive), 5-minute Apgar score of <7 (positive), chorioamnionitis (positive), antenatal terbutaline (negative), preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes (negative), and abruption (positive). Conclusion: The incidence of severe intracranial hemorrhage has dramatically declined over the past 2 decades. Antenatal steroids were not associated with reductions in severe intracranial hemorrhage. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185: 859-62.)

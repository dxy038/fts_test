In this work, fractional order modeling as well as integer order modelling of continuous multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system is presented. The parameters of reduced order model (ROM) are obtained by minimizing the objective function which is formed in terms of integral-square-error (ISE) pertaining to step input. In this method the transfer matrix of a MIMO system is considered and PSO has been used for minimizing the objective function. FOMCON toolbox is used for calculating responses of fractional order systems. One numerical example is included to illustrate the proposed approach.

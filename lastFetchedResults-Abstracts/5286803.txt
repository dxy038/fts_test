The paper presents a new approach for generating optimized solutions of a switched-mode power supply with the higher efficiency. At the very beginning, we initialize a preliminary power supply design with a known topology (e.g. Fly-back). Then, we choose a set of alternative parts for some critical components such as the MOSFET and transformer. It is quite a complicated and time consuming task to obtain a design with the highest efficiency and lowest cost from numerous combinations. Multi-objective genetic algorithm is one generic solution to solve such optimization problems. In order to encode the electrical parts as the basic units of GA, the chromosomes, and evaluate them with a numerical function, we have to model an entire power supply circuits into a component-based system and simulate the electrical reactions by the numerical characteristics of components. This approach not only reduces the time in the design stage but provide a more convincing design before the production. The experiment results are presented to show the robustness and the effectiveness of this approach

We demonstrate the three-dimensional position measurement of a 100nm-gold nanoparticle held in optical tweezers in solution using an in-line low-coherence digital holographic microscope. The trapped gold nanoparticle had the axial movement of 4.5nm in the standard deviation when a 300mW laser beam was focused with an 1.25NA objective lens.

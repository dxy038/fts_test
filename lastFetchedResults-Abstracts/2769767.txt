Over the last few years, we\´ve seen a plethora of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, products, and services make their way into the industry\´s marketplace. All such solutions will capture large amounts of data pertaining to the environment as well as their users. The IoT\´s objective is to learn more and better serve system users. Some IoT solutions might store data locally on devices ("things"), whereas others might store it in the cloud. The real value of collecting data comes through data processing and aggregation on a large scale, where new knowledge can be extracted. However, such procedures can lead to user privacy issues. This article discusses some of the main challenges of privacy in the IoT as well as opportunities for research and innovation. The authors also introduce some of the ongoing research efforts that address IoT privacy issues.

We consider a campus environment connected using multiple WLANs and WLAN routers providing interconnection between the WLAN networks. The servers part of WLANs in a campus network provide various services to users across the network. We have extended our earlier work related to service- and session-specific labeling, path, and switching. The extension is to support service-specific QoS and this is achieved by identifying an SSP (service-specific path) tree (a collection of SSPs) rooted at the WLAN router connected to the server hosting the service. Further, the service QoS parameters are distributed across the SSP tree for network resource reservation purposes. This reserved SSP tree is used to set up bidirectional QoS supported session-specific paths.

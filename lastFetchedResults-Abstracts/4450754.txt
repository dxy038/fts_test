An important approach to reconstruction of PET and SPECT images is to utilize high-resolution information from registered MRI or CT images. Herein, a PET/SPECT image-reconstruction objective function is presented which includes parameters for the alignment between PET/SPECT and MRI/CT. A Levenberg-Marquardt estimation procedure is developed. An anecdotal evaluation is performed with computer-simulated PET/SPECT projection data for a brain phantom. The simulation models a spatial blur of 2 mm FWHM and utilizes 1-mm-wide PET/SPECT voxels. After two iterations, translational alignment errors are well under 0.1 mm and rotational errors are fractions of a degree.

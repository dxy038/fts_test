Proposes a new associative memory neural net (NN) model called the loop neural network model, and the theoretical proof of this NNÂ´s stability is given. Experiments show that this NN model is much more powerful than the McCulloch-Pitts model, the discrete Hopfield NN, the continuous Hopfield NN, the discrete bidirectional associative memory NN, the continuous and adaptive bidirectional associative memory NN, the backpropagation NN, and the optimally designed nonlinear continuous NN.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

The majority of modem mobile systems have two common denominators: quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, such as latency and synchronization, and strict energy constraints. However, until now, no synthesis techniques have been proposed for the design and efficient use of such systems. We have two main objectives: synthesis and conceptual. The synthesis goal is to introduce the first design technique for quality-of-service (QoS) low power synthesis. The conceptual objective is to develop a generic technique for the automatic development of on-line algorithms from efficient off-line algorithms using statistical techniques. We first summarize a system of provably-optimal techniques that minimize energy consumption of stream-oriented applications under two main QoS metrics: latency and synchronization. Specifically, we study how multiple voltages can be used to simultaneously satisfy hardware requirements and minimize power consumption, while preserving the requested level of QoS in terms of latency and synchronization. The off-line algorithm is used as input to statistical software used to identify important relevant parameters of the processes, buffer occupancy rate indicators, and a way how combine them to form a fast and efficient on-line algorithm which decides which task to run at which voltage. The effectiveness of the algorithms is demonstrated on a number of standard multimedia benchmarks.

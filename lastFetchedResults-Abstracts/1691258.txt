Inroduction & Objective: Almost any type of stress, whether physical or neurogenic, causes increased secretion of cortisol from the adrenal. The connection between stress and the gut microflora have been showed by several studies and severely damaged gut microflora could cause stress and vise versa. Since Probiotics modulate the composition of the intestinal microflora , they plays an important role in ameliorating the side effects of stress.
Material and Methods: For this study, forty male wistar rats aged 12-14 weeks and weighed 110-130 gm was used. After a 2-week adaptation period, the rats were randomly divided into four group positive control, negative control (stress), trail 1 (probiotic) and trail 2 (probiotic with stress). Trail groups were administrated with 2×109 cells of Lactobacillus casei TD2, by oral gavage. Restraint stress was applied to the treated group for 15 minutes. After 21 days, rats were anesthetized with ether and blood samples were taken from heart. Then EIA kit is used for quantitative determination of corticosterone in plasma.
Results:Our results showed that corticosterone level in positive group was significantly increased compare to negative control . It also became clear that receiving probiotics in second trial group caused a significant decrease in hormone concentration to 0.226 ± 0 005 mg/d compared to the positive control. Further examination of the results showed that the Trail 1 group had normal hormone levels compare to negative controls. 
Conclusions:The results of these tests indicate that the probiotic Lactobacillus casei as a probiotic can reduce the negative effects of chronic stress and reduce corticosterone hormone levels of blood significantly.

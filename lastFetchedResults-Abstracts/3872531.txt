A multi-objective design optimisation for double primary and secondary winding transformers is presented in the study, with the aim to minimise the deviation between the prescribed and designed short-circuit impedance values. The optimisation process involves the exploitation of the results of an efficient and experimentally validated finite element model for leakage field prediction by the Taguchi method. The model is used in conjunction with evolutionary stochastic and deterministic optimisation algorithms in order to derive the optimal winding configuration that meets the technical requirements for the compound multi-winding short-circuit impedance target value.

Our objective was to examine trends in outcome and cost of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) between 1990 and 1999. PCI has become the most common form of myocardial revascularization in recent years, rivaling the more established coronary artery bypass surgery. There has been increasing interest in improving outcome of PCI while also seeking to minimize cost. A total of 21,755 patients undergoing PCI were evaluated. Clinical data were gathered from the Emory Cardiovascular Database and financial data from the UB92 formulation of the hospital bill. Charges were reduced to cost using departmental cost-to-charge ratios. Costs were inflated to 1999 dollars using medical care inflation rates. Mortality varied without a significant trend from 0.63% to 0.44% (p = 0.64). The Q-wave myocardial infarction rate decreased from 0.68% to 0.40% (p = 0.0003). Emergent coronary surgery decreased from 3.50% to 1.25% (p &lt;0.0001). Mean hospital inflation-adjusted cost decreased from $10,478 to $8,367 (p &lt;0.0001). Length of stay after the procedure decreased from 2.8 to 1.8 days (p &lt;0.0001). Outcome of PCI continues to improve, with a decrease in coronary surgery and Q-wave myocardial infarction but with no significant change in mortality. This was accomplished while also decreasing costs and length of stay. Whether these favorable trends will continue remains to be seen.

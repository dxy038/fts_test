In the field of aerospace engineering but also in the fields of civil and mechanical engineering the industry demands for significantly reduced costs for development and operating. Reduction of structural weight at safe design is one avenue to achieve this objective. In many cases it results in thin-walled structures, which are prone to buckling if subjected to compression or shear. The presented paper is based on a recent European Space Agency (ESA) study, conducted at DLR Braunschweig, on Probabilistic Aspects of Buckling Knock-Down Factors and contributes to this goal by striving for an improved buckling knock-down factor (the ratio of buckling loads of imperfect and perfect structures) for unstiffened CFRP cylindrical shells. Buckling tests and buckling simulations were performed to investigate the imperfection sensitivity and to validate the applied simulation methodologies. Test results as well as deterministic and probabilistic buckling simulation results are presented and compared. Finally, improved knock-down factors are deduced and discussed.

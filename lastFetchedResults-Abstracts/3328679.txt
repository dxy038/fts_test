Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are highly coexisting, dynamic and application specific, as well as having resource constrained in nature, thus programming the sensor nodes is difficult when compared to traditional computer systems. It is most difficult task to build reliable and practical programming solutions or systems for distributed and resource-constrained wireless sensor devices. The objective of this research contribution is to present a comparative study in terms of programming approaches, its potentials and pitfalls.

Our team developed and demonstrated a new system design approach that can diagnosis and track overall machinery health, inform operators shortly before maintenance action is needed, place orders for parts needed to perform the specific repair or maintenance action and schedule needed manpower for repair action. This embedded wireless system was integrated into legacy Navy supply and maintenance systems. This paper discusses the wireless device, architecture, and processing used to meet the new objective of a sense and respond applications

The Radial Line Slot Array (RLSA) antenna is known for its good characteristics such as low profile, low cost, aesthetically pleasing, ease of installation and simple structure. This research involves the optimization of the design and development of a novel linearly polarized Beam Squinted Radial Line Slot Array (RLSA) antenna at 5.8 GHz band. The research objective is to study the optimum size of the antenna that can give an acceptable antennaÂ´s performance. There are four prototypes with different sizes has been developed and the measurements were obtain a return loss at 17.12 dB, antenna gain of 21 dB and 18.80% antenna bandwidth with 63.10% radiation efficiency for 400 mm diameter antenna design.

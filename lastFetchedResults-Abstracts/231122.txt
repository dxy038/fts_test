Best Estimate computer codes have been, so far, developed for safety analysis of nuclear power plants and were extensively validated against a large set of separate effects and integral test facilities experimental data relevant to such kind of reactors. Their application to research reactors is not fully straightforward. Modelling problems generally emerge when applying existing models to low pressure and more particularly to subcooled flow boiling situations. The objective of the present work is to investigate the RELAP5/3.2 system code capabilities in predicting phenomena that could be encountered under abnormal research reactorâ€™s operating conditions. For this purpose, the separate effect related to the static onset of flow instability is investigated. The cases considered herein are the flow excursion tests performed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory thermal hydraulic test loop (THTL) as well as some representative Whittle and Forgan (W & F) experiments. The simulation results are presented and the capabilities of RELAP5/Mod 3.2 in predicting this critical phenomenon are discussed.

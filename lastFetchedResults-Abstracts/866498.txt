This paper describes the elements of a multi-criteria optimization formulation of the assembly sequencing problem. The criteria considered are: total assembly time and number of reorientations. These two criteria are combined using multi-attribute utility theory to derive a single objective function. The combined objective function has been formulated subject to the precedence constraints of the assembly process. The model has been solved using simulated annealing. The elements of the developed algorithms and their performances are demonstrated in this paper.

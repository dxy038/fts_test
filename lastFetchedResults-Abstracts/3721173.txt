The analysis previously made to determine the response of a two-wire transmission line buried at constant depth near the earth-air interface when excited by a plane-wave electromagnetic field generated in free space is extended to include the case of the line suspended in air at a uniform distance above the earthÂ´s surface. The exciting field is the vector sum of the incident and reflected fields at the point midway between the line conductors. The polarization of the electric field is taken to be parallel to the wires, so that there is no pick up by the terminations. The objective of the study is to determine bounds for the current in specified load impedances in terms of the amplitude of the incident electric field evaluated at the surface of the earth.

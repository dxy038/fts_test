Memory complaints are relatively common in elderly people, although they are not always reported to
the general practitioner (GP). These subjective complaints do not necessarily correlate with objective measures
of memory impairment or cognitive performance, but they may be an early indication of impairment at a state
that is undetectable by standard testing instruments. Memory complaints may also predict future cognitive
decline. The GuidAge study is a secondary prevention trial for Alzheimerâ€™s disease involving non-demented
individuals aged 70 years or older having spontaneously complained of memory problems to their GP. More
than half of participants had a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5 at baseline. The percentage of participants
reporting problems on the McNair and Kahn scale varied from 6.2% to 78.6% per item. Certain specific memory
complaints may be more related than others to the beginning of the neurodegenerative process, and could predict
future cognitive decline. The importance of memory complaints should not be underestimated in clinical
practice.

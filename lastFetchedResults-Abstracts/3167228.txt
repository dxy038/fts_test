Semantic frameworks are more and more used to access knowledge and to enhance cooperation in scientific research. An increasing need of resource sharing and integration is coming out in the electromagnetic domain as well. This paper provides a proposal for an electromagnetic ontology framework, designed with the objective of maximizing knowledge reusability and integrability. It follows a modular, layered architecture, based on a robust sharable conceptualization, given by publicly available well-known top-level ontologies. The implementation of an ontology in the area of radiopropagation modeling is provided as specific example of practical application. Finally, the paper illustrates a simple example of reasoning, which demonstrates how the ontology supports advanced knowledge processing by simple query codification.

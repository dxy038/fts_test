Background and objective: The social development is a key factor in the
treatment of mentally retarded children. One of the proposed methods for
the social development of these children are play therapy. This paper aimed at
determining the impact of primary school games on the social development of
mentally retarded children.
Methods: This quasi-experimental study was conducted among 8-11 yearsold
mentally retarded pupils in Tehran province. Two schools were selected
from Exceptional schools of different districts of Tehran province through
cluster sampling. Then, from the pupils of the two selected schools, 30 male
students were randomly selected and assigned to an experimental group (n
= 15, mean age: 10.7 ± 0.3) and control group (n=15, mean age: 10.5 ± 0.4).
After informing the parents of the pupils and having them fill out the consent
forms, experimental group carried out the school games. Vineland Social
Maturity Scale was used to measure pupils’ social development. Intervention
was carried out among the experimental group in 12 sessions for one month.
Then, a posttest was carried out on both experimental and control group. Data
was analyzed by covariance analysis using SPSS 19.
Results: There was a significant difference (p = 0.001) between the pretest and
posttest mean scores of the total score of their social development and social
development components among the experimental group when compared
with the control group.
Conclusion: These findings emphasized the impact of school games on the
social development of educable mentally retarded children. It is proposed
that through creating appropriate environments for their physical activity and
involving them in social activities, help these children give up their isolation
and solitude.

In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a desktop conference system, called DeskShare, which provides a distributed and real-time conferencing facility for cooperative work. The main objective of our research is to bring users of remote systems together to collaborate in group work using readily available commodity audio and video technology, and currently used networks based on asynchronous communications, such as Ethernet and FDDI, with adaptability in network congestion. Since DeskShare is implemented as a group of cooperating processes with highly modular fashion based on on object-oriented design technique, we can easily accommodate further system configuration modifications, for example changing video and/or audio codec. Even if DeskShare was originally designed for multimedia desktop conferencing, it is possible to apply it to diverse areas, such as remote education, teleshopping, group design, and remote operation, which are necessary for various group activities

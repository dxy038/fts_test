Despite improvements in the techniques, materials, and fixation of total hip arthroplasty, periprosthetic osteolysis, a complication that arises from this clinical procedure and causes aseptic loosening, is considered to be a major clinical problem associated with total hip arthroplasty. With the objective of reducing the production of wear particles and eliminating periprosthetic osteolysis, we prepared a novel hip polyethylene (PE) liner whose surface graft was made of a biocompatible phospholipid polymer—poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC)). This study investigated the wear resistance of the poly(MPC)-grafted cross-linked PE (CLPE; MPC-CLPE) liner during 15×106 cycles of loading in a hip joint simulator. The gravimetric analysis showed that the wear of the acetabular liner was dramatically suppressed in the MPC-CLPE liner, as compared to that in the non-treated CLPE liner. Analyses of the MPC-CLPE liner surface revealed that it suffered from no or very little wear even after the simulator test, whereas the CLPE liners suffered from substantial wears. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis of the wear particles isolated from the lubricants showed that poly(MPC) grafting dramatically decreased the total number, area, and volume of the wear particles. However, there was no significant difference in the particle size distributions, and, in particular, from the SEM image, it was observed that particles with diameters less than 0.50 μm were present in the range of the highest frequency. In addition, there were no significant differences in the particle size descriptors and particle shape descriptors.

sults obtained in this study show that poly(MPC) grafting markedly reduces the production of wear particles from CLPE liners, without affecting the size of the particles. These results suggest that poly(MPC) grafting is a promising technique for increasing the longevity of artificial hip joints.

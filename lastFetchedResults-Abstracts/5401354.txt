The Brazilian television system was inaugurated in 1950 and now is facing its main transformation. In the last half century, it suffered a few modifications in the transmission system. In November 2003, the project for the development of the Brazilian Digital Television System (SBTVD), which has come to be known later as International System for Digital Television (ISDB-Tb), was officially launched. The main objective of the ISDB-Tb project was to define the reference model for the Brazilian digital television standard, which includes not only the technology itself, but also the ways of exploiting the rights to transmit and the transition model from analog to digital. The ISDB-Tb project aims to provide the population with access to the digital television technology, promoting social inclusion and a democratic access to information. This paper presents the technical evolution of television in Brazil.

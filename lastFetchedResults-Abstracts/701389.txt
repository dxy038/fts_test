The Clean Agile Manufacturing of Energetics (CAME) program was directed to identify major pollution sources and to propose life-cycle facility modifications which can reduce pollution burdens (Perry, W. J., Comprehensive Pollution Prevention Strategyâ€”Memorandum for Secretaries of the Military Departments, et al., Department of Defense (11 August 1994). Potential avenues for pollution prevention are the use of advanced energetic and propellant materials, different product formulations, alternate chemical synthesis and load/assemble/pack (LAP) operations, and advanced demilitarization practices. The objective of this study was to compare batch and continuous processing of extruded composite propellant for the production of the motor for the MK-66 Safety Product Improvement Program (MK-66 PIP). The 2.75 inch motor uses an ammonium perchlorate based propellant formulation. Continuous processing of the motor is being developed and demonstrated as part of the Continuous Processing of Composite Propellant (CPOCP) program. The analysis compares an existing batch mixing and extrusion based production of 30,000 rocket motors to a proposed technology upgrade of continuous mixing and extrusion of the same composite propellant. Continuous processing offers a potentially lower cost and safer method of extrusion as the energetic material is subjected to high shear rates for a shorter period of time. Additional benefits include increased mixing efficiency, superior product homogeneity, and reduced wastes. The pollution burden was reduced using the proposed continuous process from 2.6 pounds of waste per pound of product to about one pound of waste per pound of product. This assumed that the product efficiency (number of motors produced to get the production goal of 30,000 certified motors) was the same for the batch and continuous processes. It was felt that the increased mixing efficiency and superior product homogeneity will make the continuous process more efficient.

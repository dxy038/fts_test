Today, many cloud Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS) frameworks exist. Users, developers, and administrators have to make a decision about which environment is best suited for them. Unfortunately, the comparison of such frameworks is difficult because either users do not have access to all of them or they are comparing the performance of such systems on different resources, which make it difficult to obtain objective comparisons. Hence, the community benefits from the availability of a testbed on which comparisons between the IaaS frameworks can be conducted. FutureGrid aims to offer a number of IaaS including Nimbus, Eucalyptus, OpenStack, and OpenNebula. One of the important features that FutureGrid provides is not only the ability to compare between IaaS frameworks, but also to compare them in regards to bare-metal and traditional high performance computing services. In this paper, we outline some of our initial findings by providing such a testbed. As one of our conclusions, we also present our work on making access to the various infrastructures on FutureGrid easier.

We present four abstract evolutionary algorithms for multi-objective optimization and theoretical results that characterize their convergence behavior. Thanks to these results it is easy to verify whether or not a particular instantiation of these abstract evolutionary algorithms offers the desired limit behavior. Several examples are given

atory-descriptive.
g
 in western Canada.
ipants
een relatives of 16 eye donors who had died within the previous 3 to 12 months.
s
es were in psychologic shock after the donor's death, which inhibited their recollection of events. Nurses were found to initiate the possibility of eye donation most often, and the decision to donate was made precipitously. In several cases, it was not stated clearly on the consent form what tissue was to be removed, and whether the family had agreed only to transplantation or transplantation and research. When the tissue was used for research, families had a need to believe this would eventually benefit someone.
endations
ular care needs to be taken when reviewing the consent form with families to ensure that it reflects how they or the donor want the tissue to be used. Families can be prepared for the eventuality that the tissue will be used for research rather than transplantation by the reinforcement that the knowledge gained will help many individuals.

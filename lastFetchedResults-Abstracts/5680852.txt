A description of the design and development of an instrumentation system whose main objective is the measurement of the wind resource and is housed in a met-mast structure is presented. The system is composed by four sub-systems. The first one is the instrumentation sub-system, based on a set of sensors for the wind resource measurement, a set for operational purposes, and a third set of sensors for structural monitoring. The second sub-system is the computer system that contains the data storage, communication management, where and the full system control is performed. Third one is the energy sub-system, which includes all the elements to obtain energy and feed autonomously the met-mast., composed by PV(photovoltaic) modules and a set of small wind turbines to obtain energy, batteries to store it, and all the electronic elements involved in energy conversion and management. Lastly, the communication sub-system, where all the devices, aimed to achieve a redundant and reliable bidirectional communication between the facility and the central office in land, are included.

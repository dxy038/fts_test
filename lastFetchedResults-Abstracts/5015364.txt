An iterative nonlinear algorithm is generated for optimal sizing and placement of fixed and switched capacitor banks on radial distribution lines in the presence of linear and nonlinear loads. The HARMFLOW algorithm and the Maximum Sensitivities Selection (MSS) method are used to solve the constrained optimization problem with discrete variables. To limit the burden of calculations and improve convergence, problem is decomposed into two subproblems. Objective functions include minimum system losses and capacitor cost while IEEE-519 power quality limits are used as constrains. Results are presented and analyzed for the 18 bus IEEE distorted system. The advantage of proposed algorithm as compared to previous works is consideration of harmonic couplings and reactions of actual nonlinear loads in the distribution system.

This study uses an objective analysis (OA) method to obtain more realistic data on ocean surface current estimated via Remote Sensing (RS) by OSCAR. This refinement employs surface current data estimated via drift buoys from PNBOIA. The incorporation of buoy data to OSCAR current fields was performed using an OA method based on the Gauss-Markov Theorem. The results show a slight improvement of OSCAR current fields. The interpolation allowed reducing the difference between OSCAR and buoy vectors an average of 0.0166ms<sup>-1</sup> and 7.7892&#176; for the intensity and direction, respectively. In a specific case, this gain came to 0.45ms<sup>-1</sup> in intensity and 144&#176; in direction, thus proving that the interpolation can change the current direction up to 144&#176; and its intensity up to 0.45ms<sup>-1</sup>, making that the value of the current measured by RS gets closer to the value measured by the buoy.

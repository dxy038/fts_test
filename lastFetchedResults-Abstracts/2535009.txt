Iran and Egypt, as two pivotal countries of the world of Islam, are located in two strategic spots of the world. The cultures of these countries are two effective and outstanding factors. However, political trends have always caused the closeness or estrangement between the two countries. The latest estrangement between the two began on April 29, 1979, which is still standing. But the developments which began in January 2011 could be a reason for cordial bilateral ties. These developments which have led to some formal and essential changes in the Egyptian political system, can be a harbinger of some changes in the regional power equation and balance.  The objective of the present paper is to study the trend of bilateral ties on the basis of constructional approach. Hence, the main domestic and international variables of these relations (the issue of Palestine, historical issues as well as the Shia nature of Iranian state and relations with the US) will be discussed. The main questions of the present paper are: what are the ups and downs in IranEgypt relations on the basis of theory of constructivism? What are the effective variables in their bilateral relations? Descriptiveanalytical method has been used for the present research.

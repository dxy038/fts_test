The traditional modeling method for the grey model GM(1,1) was discussed in some detail. The number-theoretic method was applied to the grey model with the least sum of absolute deviations as objective function in order to make it robust. The proposed method was employed in the study of the relationship between the capacity factors of six polyaromatic hydrocarbons and the compositions of the mobile phase in liquid chromatography, and the relationship between the retention time of the six compounds and the column temperature in gas chromatography. Satisfactory results were obtained.

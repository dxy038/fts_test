An important step of sparse representation technique for under-determined BSS (blind source separation) is the estimation of the mixing matrix. In this paper, a new method to estimate the mixing matrix is proposed. The objective is to find the mixing matrix to minimize the mutual information of the estimated sources. An algorithm for the learning of the mixing matrix is proposed by the natural gradient. Simulation results of speech separation demonstrate the effectiveness o f our method.

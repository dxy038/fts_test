In the CHARTA project operational possibilities are applied in order that companies and environmental authority in practice employ the latest principles on environmental management and cleaner technology. Thus a preventive effort is secured as the leading principle, rather than the ascertaining remedy principle. One of the major elements in the CHARTA project is the development of a new strategy, the main objective of which is to stimulate the industries in the county to implement environmental mangement systems and cleaner technology initiatives. The new strategy is based on the companies' individual responsibility and corresponds to the companies' environmental efforts and abilities to document their environmental performance. Those companies that continually reduce their waste are given more flexibility and liberty of action. On the other hand, companies who act environmentally negatively are met with intensive control and demands.

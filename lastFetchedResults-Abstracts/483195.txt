Background: Jt is reported that 24-40 % of hospital admissions in the world are related to addiction and its complications. Considering hepatitis, AIDS, cirrhosis and various malignancies following these complications, addiction is one of the most important problems in treatment centers worldwide.
Objective: To determine Para clinical disorders and prevalence of viral infections in injection drug users
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in which Para clinical derangements including lab results, chest radiography, and abdominal and pelvic sonography of all patients admitted to infectious diseases ward at Al-Zahra hospital in Isfahan were evaluated during 2005. Also, the presence of HIV, HCV, and HBV infections in these patients during two consecutive years of 2004 and 2005 was taken into consideration.
Findings: The total number of patients during 2 years was 92 among those 53 hospitalized during 2005 and 39 in 2004. The mean age was 31.7 years with an age range between 20 and 53. The mean length of injection was 3.9 years with a minimum of 2 months and a maximum of 21 years. Among patients hospitalized in 2005, 47% were abnormal for chest radiographs and 17% found to have splenomegaly based on sonography. Among these patients, leucocytosis (85.5%), anemia 86%), higher levels of ESR (74%), derangement in liver tests (60%) and coagulation disorders (55%) were also observed. Viral infections in patients admitted during 2004 were HCV (71%), HBV (12.8%), and HIV (7.6%) while 25.6% were negative for viral infection. In patients hospitalized through 2005, the viral infections were due to HCV (74.3%), HBV (14.3%), and HIV (17%) whereas 17% of patients found to be without viral infection.
Conclusion: Based on data found in our study, the high prevalence of viral infection and Para clinical disorders in these patients highlights the importance and the urgency of such laboratory measurements at the very beginning following hospitalization.

This paper proposes an adaptive dictionary learning approach based on sub modular optimization. A candidate atom set is constructed based on multiple bases from the combination of analytic and trained dictionaries. With the low-frequency components by the analytic DCT atoms, high-resolution dictionaries can be inferred through online learning to make efficient approximation with rapid convergence. It is formulated as a combinatorial optimization for approximate sub modularity, which is suitable for sparse representation based on dictionaries with arbitrary structures. In single-image super-resolution, the proposed scheme has been demonstrated to improve the reconstruction performance in comparison with double sparsity dictionary in terms of both objective and subjective restoration quality.

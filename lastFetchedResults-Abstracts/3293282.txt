The objective of this paper is to motivate the development of a Channel-Agnostic Mobile Transaction Platform to support drug adherence in a resource constrained environment, review relevant, existing literature in the areas of ICT4D, mHealth for development, and interventions to improve drug adherence, and propose a Design Science Research approach for the development of the platform. One of the main requirements for the utility of a Channel-Agnostic Mobile Transaction Platform is a high adaptation of mobile cellular technology and e-readiness of the audience, which holds true in South Africa. The platform will address the shortcomings of existing ICT solutions and will support services and transactions over multiple mobile channels to accommodate a variety of device capabilities and patientsÂ´ preferences.

Ozone available in the troposphere is due to its transportation from the stratosphere by air downward movements or due to local processes in the troposphere, including storms. The objective of the research conducted by the team from Space Research Institute at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences is to study total ozone available in the troposphere and its vertical distribution as well as to develop methods for storm and hail forecasting. The team has a long experience in the development of scientific devices for measurement of ozone concentration, such as the Therma satellite photometer, which has been operating successfully onboard the Mir Orbital Space Station since 1986 and the Multichannel Scanning Spectro-Photometer (MSSP), which is also in use. Now, an ultra-violet (UV) spectro-photometer is under development to study total available ozone in the Hartley-Huggins band, which is particularly effective in storm and hail forecasting. In the paper, the developed spectro-photometer is described. The grounds for the method´s selection are enlisted, the overall diagram, operation principle and algorithm of the device are described, and the specific technical and technological implementations of some particular assemblies and details are given. Some important issues related with the photometer´s calibration are commented. The study procedure and methods used in working with the developed device are outlined.

Controller Area Network (CAN) is an effective choice for the automotive industries due to its simplicity, low cost nature, decrease of wiring density and in addition to that it provide connectivity with multiple nodes with single wiring pair. This paper aims in describing an ARM 7 LPC 2129 based Temperature measurement system with Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Objective of this paper is to construct a hardware proposal for communication between nodes with CAN bus. A Node to Node communication link has been established which are connected via CAN bus so as to observe and control the temperature values transferring on the CAN bus and send the command signals onto the another node. The hardware boards are designed to be capable of supporting high speed bit rate up to 1Mbps. The CAN communication module can transmit or receive data following CAN Protocol. With the help of the software used, the CAN-BUS communication would be clear to the nodes of the ARM 7 Controllers in the system. The software part is done in KEIL microvision-4 using Embedded -C.

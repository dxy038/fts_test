FAMA framework (FAMA FW) is a tool for the automated analysis of variability models (VM). Its main objective is providing an extensible framework where current research on VM automated analysis might be developed and easily integrated into a final product. FAMA FW is built following the SPL paradigm supporting different variability metamodels, reasoners or solvers, analysis questions and reasoner selectors, easing the production of customized VM analysis tools. FAMA FW is written in Java and distributed under LGPL License.

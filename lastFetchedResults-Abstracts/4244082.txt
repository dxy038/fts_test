A system to rapidly and automatically assess the performance of numerical ocean modeling systems was developed by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). This includes the calculation of quantitative, objective metrics of the accuracy of ocean forecasts. We will present results from this system, including metrics of surface and subsurface analysis and forecast fields. This work supports the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO), which provides oceanographic products in response to requests for environmental support for Navy operations. The development of a comprehensive automated system that provides model performance information is expected to increase the consistency of results, reduce errors, and reduce time required to generate oceanographie products.

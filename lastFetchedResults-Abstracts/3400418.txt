Multimedia broadcast and multicast services have started to outpace simple data unicast services. A hybrid satellite-terrestrial network can provide a cooperative system in such a way as to provide high-quality seamless MBMS effectively. In this article we discuss two promising techniques that can improve the performance of a mobile satellite broadcasting system with HSTN. The objective of the first technique is to obtain diversity gain from independent signal paths; this can be achieved by using the space-time coding technique jointly operated on both the satellite and terrestrial repeaters. The goal of the second scheme is to obtain power gain by using a layered channel coding scheme with which a user terminal adapts to the channel condition. We demonstrate various simulation results for both schemes on the prescribed network structure, and the results show substantial improvements in performance.

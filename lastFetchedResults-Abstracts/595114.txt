Objective: To determine the frequency of endometrial tuberculosis in biopsy specimens submitted for histopathological examination. Material and Methods: From January 2003 to December 2003, 216 endometrial specimens were investigated for endometrial tuberculosis in the Department of Pathology, Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar NWFP. The specimens were received in 10% buffered formaline. They were processed in auto-processor and were cut 3-5 micron thick, stained with routine haematoxylin and eosin stain.Results: On histopathological examination (n = 216) chronic granulomatous inflammation compatible with tuberculosis was found in 11 (5.1%) cases. The ages of the patients ranged from 16 to 60 years with mean age of 38 years. Among the 11 positive cases, the highest number of positive cases were in the age group of 30-40 years.Conclusion: Endometrial tuberculosis is not infrequent in our setup and has to be looked for in all female patients presenting with infertility and irregular bleeding.

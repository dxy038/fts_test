Objective: In this research, executive functions of bipolar patients and the effect of chronicity on them were investigated. Method: In an ex post facto research, 99 participants were selected via simple nonrandom or convenience sampling, and were divided into three groups: chronic bipolar patients (n=33), first episode bipolar patients (n=33), and healthy controls (n=33). Subjects were evaluated using Color-Word Stroop, Wisconsin card sorting, Continuous Performance, and Digit Span sub scale tests. Results: The results of one way analysis of variance indicated the significant presence of deficits in bipolar groups compared to the normal group; however there was no significant difference between chronic and first episode patients. Conclusion: Results indicated the lack of effect of chronicity on executive functions in bipolar patients.

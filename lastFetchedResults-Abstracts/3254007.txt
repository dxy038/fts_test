The objective to convert hospitals in EU regions to innovative type is of high priority for their economic growth, employment and wellbeing of EU citizens. The results presented in the paper were obtained in Gorenjska region through the implementation of the InTraMed C2C Central Europe project. The system approach consisted of identification of the state of the art in innovation at each of the involved hospitals, SWOT analysis, seminars and workshops related to innovation process and culture. Among large spectrum of ideas gathered at these events the managers of hospitals agreed that first priority should be given to most needed biomedical engineering (BME) prototypes, which were supported also by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) business interest. Finally, through open innovation approach five ideas were selected for development of prototypes and later testing. Some of these selected BME ideas will be presented in the paper.

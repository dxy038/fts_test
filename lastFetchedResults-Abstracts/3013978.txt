In this paper, the 3-input and 2-output water supply system of the controlled watercurtain cooling process in the Steel Plate Mill of Shougang Group (in Beijing, China) is modeled with fuzzy modeling method based on compositional rule of inference. Then, computer simulations are conducted using MATLAB. The simulation results demonstrate that the obtained models can approximate the dynamic response of the objective system very well.

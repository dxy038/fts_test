Objective (s): Iran is among countries with high road traffic accidents. The use of safety belts is known as the most effective in preventing severity of injuries and deaths caused by road accidents. However, many drivers do not wear seat belts while driving. To encourage drivers to use seat belts, providing appropriate messages based on scientific theories is very important. The purpose of this study was to use the extended parallel process model (EPPM) in developing an effective educational program to promote safety belt use among drivers in Tehran, Iran.
Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study and conducted on drivers who were stopped by police officer because of driving without using seat belts. The site and participants of survey were selected by multistage random sampling. The message and educational intervention was developed after analyzing pre-test results.
Results: Among all 209 drivers, 80.4 percent were male and the mean age of participants was 41 (SD =1.3) years. Measuring the Risk Behavior Diagnosis Scale, based on EPPM, the findings showed that drivers were in fear control position indicating that they had a lower level of perceived efficacy comapired to perceived threat. Multiple regression analysis before educational intervention showed that perceived susceptibility and perceived self-efficacy were predictors of self-reporting use of seat belt among drivers (R2=0.38, P <  0.05(. After intervention, participants were moved to danger control position indicationg that they were in a position to adopt protective behavior. Self-reporting seat belt wearing increased about 24% after intervention.
Conclusion: The findings suggest that focusing on messages with high efficacy contents; can promote seat belt wearing among drivers.

<p><strong><em>Background:</em></strong> Toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent people is generally asympto­matic but in immunocompromised patients including HIV/AIDS, can­cer pa­tients, and organ transplant recipients, etc. it can lead to serious pathological problems. The objective of current study was to determine the seroprevalence of <em>T. gondii</em> IgG and IgM antibodies<em> </em>in<em> </em>HIV/AIDS patients using ELISA technique in Mazanda­ran Province, northern Iran.<strong></strong></p><p><strong><em>Methods:</em></strong> Overall, 82 serum samples (61 males and 21 females) were collected from HIV/AIDS patients in Mazandaran Provinces, in 2013. Sera were surveyed employing ELISA assay. Data were analyzed using Chi-Square or Fisher exact test. In addition, before sampling a questionnaire was filled out for each subject.</p><p><strong><em>Results:</em></strong> Overall seroprevalence of examined sera was 96.3% for IgG antibody but none of the sera shown IgM antibody against <em>T. gondii.</em> The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in males and females was 96.7% and 95.2%, respectively. An antibody titer of &gt;1 IU/ml was considered as positive. Furthermore, none of the included variables statistically was significant.</p><strong><em>Conclusions:</em></strong> Seroprevalence of chronic (latent) toxoplasmosis in HIV/AIDS patients in Mazandaran Province is high compared to toxoplasmosis in general population. Consequently, the risk of acquiring <em>Toxoplasma</em> encephalitis in exam­ined seropositive HIV/AIDS patients of <em>Toxoplasma</em> is high.

In this paper, a hybrid approach combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithms (GA) is developed to achieve the cooling system optimal design. Based on the finite element method (FEM) and the finite difference method (FDM), the numerical simulation of the cooling process is realized for part within injection mold. Considering the location, size and number of cooling channels, a mathematical model is constructed in which the part temperature distribution uniformity and production efficiency are taken as the objective function for cooling system design of injection mold. Integrating PSO with GA is presented to solve it, in which the mutation operator of GA is introduced to the PSO for the diversity of particles. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by a design example of injection mold cooling system.

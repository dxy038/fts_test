An inverse KY converter, derived from the KY converter, is proposed herein. And such a converter can be used as a bidirectional converter, whose operating modes are classified into two modes. One is the buck mode and the other is the boost mode. This converter can operate stably between these two modes. In this paper, the detailed illustration of the basic operating principles of the proposed topology is given, along with experimental results to verify its effectiveness.

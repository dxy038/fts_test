Several forward error correction (FEC), interleaving and automatic repeat request (ARQ) schemes are evaluated for transmitting packet data over IS-136 TDMA. The objective is to identify the combination of FEC, interleaving and ARQ that provides maximum data throughput at reasonable computational complexity. The FEC schemes considered are rate-n/n+1 punctured convolutional codes, long constraint length convolutional codes and punctured turbo codes. The ARQ schemes considered are ARQ with majority voting, ARQ with metric combining and ARQ with code combining (or Type III ARQ). The performance of these techniques when used with one-slot and two-slot interleaving is studied. Results show that highest throughput is achieved when a rate-5/6 convolutional code is used with one-slot interleaving and Type III ARQ scheme

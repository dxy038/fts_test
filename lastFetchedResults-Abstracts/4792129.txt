Since the Federal Commission of Communication of the U.S.A. (FCC) has made available the ample spectrum in the band of 3.1 up to 10.6 GHz for Ultrawideband (UWB) technology for transmission of wireless data, many efforts in research and development has been made for the drawing and manufacture of UWB antennas. These types of antennas are used in a great variety of applications. As, for example, high speed wireless systems of communication, vehicle radars, monitoring, detection and localization, biomedical images, generation of images through walls, etc. This work has the objective of determining the performance of the coplanar waveguide - CPW Fed Disc monopole antenna through comparison experimental and of electromagnetic simulation of the parameters S<sub>11</sub>. The antenna, which has a band width of 7.5 GHz, consists of a rectangular conductor of height `h´ of 47 mm, width `w´ of 38 mm and radius of 12, 5 mm. At first, the antenna was drawn by simulation so that it fulfills the characteristics of an UWB antenna and on the second phase it was built to make possible to evaluate the real performance of the antenna while transmitting data in ultrawideband.

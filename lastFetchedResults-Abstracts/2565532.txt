Main objective of this research was production of high fat yoghurt by partial or complete substitution of milk fat with palm oil. Three different types of high fat yoghurts, including yoghurt containing only 8% milk fat (control) yoghurt containing 4% milk fat and 4% palm oil, yoghurt containing 8% palm oil were produced. Samples kept in 4Â°C for 28 days and their physicochemical properties determined at the interval of 7 days. The results of statistical analysis showed that the treatment and the storage had significant difference (P < 0.05) on PH, acidity and syneresis. The lowest and highest pH level respectively belongs to control sample and the sample with 8% palm oil. During storing period pH level of all samples decreased and the amount of syneresis increased during storage. The amount of dry matter, protein and fat of the samples, did not show a significant difference (P > 0.05). Substitution of milk fat with palm oil reduced the levels of saturated fatty acids and short chain fatty acids while the amount of saturated fatty acid of Palmitic acid and unsaturated fatty acids of oleic acid and Linoleic acid showed a significant increase (p < 0.05). This study showed that substitution of milk fat with palm oil aspect physicochemical is advisable and can reduce harmful effects of high intake of saturated fatty acids and high cholesterol of milk fat.

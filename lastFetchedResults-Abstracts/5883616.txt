The objective of this paper is to explore the urban design strategies guiding the three-dimensional use of underground space in China. Through analyzing five problems of the underground space in China, this paper discusses four urban design strategies. The first is to utilize the phenomenon of urban three-dimensional The second is to construct three-dimensional system of underground space form. Besides, how to control the implementation of urban designÂ´s project is the third strategy. Last, using digital technology is playing an important role in helping to analyze the underground space form. This paper demonstrates that the four urban design strategies can avoid the out-of-order development of urban space in China.

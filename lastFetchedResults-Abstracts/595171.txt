Objective: This study hyw aimed to determine anti-HBs antibodies titer in medical and dental students to monitor success of hepatitis B vaccination.Material and Methods: This study was conducted on students of Khyber Medical College and Khyber College of Dentistry. Peshawar. Serum samples from students who were vaccinated were tested for the determination of anti-HRs antibody titer using microparticle enzyme immunoassay (ML!A).Results: Out of 520 students surveyed, only 176 (33.84%) had either one injection or complete course of vaccine. ,\one of them had checked their anti-HRs antibodies titer: 119 students (67.61%) had used lingerix-B. 4! (23.30%) students did not remember the brand of the vaccine while only 16 (9.09%) had used Ueber-hiovac HB Twelve (6 8%) students tested were non-reactive for antibodies (titer <10 0 mlU/mt) while in 36 (20.5%) students antibodies titer was 10 and 100 mlU/ml respectively and 12S (72,7%) had antibodies titer more than 100 mllt/mi Tune lapsed between vaccination and detection of antibody titer was 0 - 6 years, 76 (43.1%) students had been tested after one year and 5 (2.8%) after 6 years and 41 (23.5%) students after 2 years.Conclusion: Only one third had their partial or complete course of their vaccination. Antibody tilers were reactive in majority of students who had completed the course. Students entering medical and dental schools need to be better educated about hepatitis B and its vaccination.

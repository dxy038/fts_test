In this paper, an adaptive patch-based filter for Synthetic aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometric phase in the Fourier transform complex domain is proposed. The proposed filter fully utilizes the properties of locally planar terrain phase noise model so that the noise can be suppressed according to the local level of noise. Moreover, the denoising performance of the proposed filter is further improved by an adaptive selection strategy for patch size. The experimental results show that the proposed method delivers state-of-the-art denoising performance in terms of objective criteria.

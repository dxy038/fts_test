Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems are in nature fully distributed with no centralized coordinator. A peer p<sub>s</sub> has to collect correct object information from trustworthy acquaintances which are considered to hold correct information. We consider two types of trustworthiness. First, the subjective trustworthiness st<sub>st</sub> on an acquaintance p<sub>t</sub> shows how much the peer p<sub>s</sub> trusts the acquaintance p<sub>t</sub>. The objective trustworthiness ot<sub>st</sub> on an acquaintance p<sub>t</sub> indicates how much other peers trust the acquaintance p<sub>t</sub>. In this paper, we discuss three algorithms OT1, OT2, and OT3 for a peer p<sub>s</sub> to obtain the objective trustworthiness ot<sub>st</sub> on the acquaintance p<sub>t</sub>. A peer p<sub>s</sub> collects subjective trustworthiness on an acquaintance p<sub>t</sub> from peers and obtain the average value as the objective trustworthiness. In the algorithm OT1, a peer p<sub>s</sub> tries to find every acquaintance of a target acquaintance p<sub>t</sub> in a type of flooding algorithm. Here, it takes time and more number of messages are transmitted. On the other hand, the peer p<sub>s</sub> sends request messages only to the acquaintances to reduce the number of messages in the algorithms OT1 and OT2. In OT2, only acquaintances which the peer p<sub>s</sub> can trust are considered. We evaluate the algorithms in terms of how correct objective trustworthiness can be obtained.

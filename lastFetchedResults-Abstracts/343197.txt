The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms that govern the variations in the rates of mitochondrial superoxide anion radical (O2−•) generation in different species. The amounts of coenzyme Q (CoQ) associated with mitochondrial membrane proteins were compared in five different mammalian species, namely mouse, rat, rabbit, pig, and cow. Micelles of cardiac mitochondria were prepared using Triton X-100 or deoxycholate (DOC) as detergents, and the micelles containing mitochondrial proteins were sedimented by sucrose density ultracentrifugation. The amount of CoQ present in both types of micelles varied in different species, whereas α-tocopherol, another lipoidal molecule in mitochondrial membranes, could not be detected in the micelles of any of these species. The amounts of CoQ bound to mitochondrial proteins in DOC micelles were higher in those mammalian species where CoQ10 was the predominant CoQ homologue, and the amounts were found to be inversely correlated with the rate of mitochondrial O2−•  generation among different species. Results also indicated that mitochondrial CoQ exists in at least two distinct pools, one of which is associated with the membrane proteins. The degree of association between CoQ and membrane proteins appears to be a factor determining the rate of mitochondrial O2−• generation.

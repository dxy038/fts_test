In this paper a new optimization algorithm is proposed for optimal planning of the Distributed generation (DGÂ´s) with renewable bus available limit constraint. Distribution system objectives considered for optimization are Active and reactive power losses minimization, bus voltage profile improvement, and line flow capacity limits. Power system modeled Distributed generations such as wind, solar and fuel cell and some artificial models like micro turbines are used to study the proposed algorithm. To optimize the objective function with voltage limits and renewable DG bus available limit constraints, Shuffled Bat algorithm (ShBAT) is proposed and compared with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Bat Algorithm (Bat). 84-bus distribution system testing with proposed algorithm is presented with results.

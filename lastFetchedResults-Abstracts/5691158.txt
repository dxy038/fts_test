This paper presents a new control technique for low-power grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) inverters. This device is intended to be a non-expensive solution; it connects directly to a smart meter and does not consider any energy storage device. In this project, the goal is to assure that no power is injected in the electrical grid, due to legal restrictions. Hence, the power produced by the PV panel can never be higher than consumed power. In order to accomplish this objective, two control methods will be used: Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) mode and Power Control (PC) mode. The MPPT mode will be active when the consumed power is higher than the PV maximum available power and the PC mode will be active when the consumed power is lower than the PV maximum available power. In addition, the controller will also decide on which control mode should be active, given the consumed power of the moment.

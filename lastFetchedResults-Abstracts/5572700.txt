This paper highlights the use of measurement uncertainty in decision making for application of specific Test &amp; Measuring (T &amp; M) equipment in the measurement process with certain level of confidence. The study conducted on DMM (digital multimeter) and the uncertainty is estimated focusing on technical &amp; human influences. The test set-up is automated and the measured parameters are traceable to national standards. The poor decision on choosing T &amp; M equipment for the measurement of data causes huge loss, which is irrecoverable. Before taking any final recommendations or decisions, the due importance is to be given to calibrated measurement data &amp; the associated uncertainty. The objective of the case study is to focus on certain potential components instead of all the causes, which are having less importance in the measurement process. This will help in reducing the measurement time with qualitative output.

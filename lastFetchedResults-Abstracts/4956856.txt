Vertical handover (VHO) procedure facilitate service continuity in an heterogeneous wireless scenario under varying network as well as channel conditions. Decision criteria for VHO are, mainly, designed to maximize a combination of network parameters in order to guarantee an acceptable service level and maximize network operators and/our users expectation. The objective of this paper is to formalize the VHO decision criteria as a QoS constrain bound problem and propose two strategies that permits to achieve QoS constrains without wasting resources. The former that minimize the power consumption and the latter that minimize the number of VHO. Numerical results are provided in order to compare the two strategies.

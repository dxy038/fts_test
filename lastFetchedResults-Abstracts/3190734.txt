Nowadays, energy is one of the most misused resources on Earth. This phenomenon is caused because of the continuing technological expansion in different areas such as building automation, oil &amp; power, industry in general, and much more areas where energy consumption is extremely high. In this paper, the State-of-the-Art for Energy Management (EM) is based on the new technological advances which have been summarized in topics, such as: standard ISA 95, Web Services (WS), Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), System of Systems (SoS), European Projects, Industrial Implementations, and the future challenge for EM, ending with some conclusions. The purpose of this document is an analysis of the new technological approaches for EM, integrating from the actual communication protocols, human-machine interfaces (HMI), Supervisory-Control and Data Acquisition Systems (SCADA), Distributed Control Systems (DCS), sensors, actuators, used in different areas such as manufacturing, machine builders, power plants, water pumping systems, etc., beyond to large SoS integration. Finally, it can be summarized that this paper presents the actual State-of-the-Art about SoS technology focused to an EM research based on a topic that today has a lot of importance worldwide. As energy consumption in SoS is increasing, the objective today and in the future is to generate an energy efficient SoS.

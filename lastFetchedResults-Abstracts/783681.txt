Background Although disability in persons
with anxiety and depression disorders has been
measured, the problem with some studies is that they
use tools that measure the state of health, when the
subjective nature of the measuring system does not
permit the exact measurement of disability. The ICF
Checklist provides a new paradigm for measuring
disability that focuses more on the consequences than
on the illness itself. The objective of this study is to
compare the problems in Activities and Participation
observed in patients with anxiety, depressive, and
schizophrenic disorders, using the ICF Checklist.
Methods The ICF Checklist was administered to 72
patients with anxiety or depressive disorders and 28
patients with schizophrenia. They were diagnosed in
accordance with the criteria of the ICD-10. Chi-square
analysis was carried out to determine the differences
between the groups studied with respect to the
Activities and Participation scales of the ICF Checklist
and the nominal data of the socio-demographic
variables. Results The group with anxiety-depression
had a higher percentage of patients with problems
preparing meals (30.6%) and achieving intimate
relationships (59.7%) than did the patients with
schizophrenia. The group with schizophrenia had a
higher percentage of patients who had problems
watching (39.3%), listening (42.9%), undertaking a
single task (60.7%), communicating, fine hand use
(57.1%), using transportation (64.3%), and caring for
body parts (67.9%), among others. Conclusions The
ICF Checklist permits comparison of the impact
mental disorders have on patients. It provides a more
appropriate way of evaluating these illnesses in relation
to others, considering not only the question of
mortality but also the years lived with disability due
to illness.

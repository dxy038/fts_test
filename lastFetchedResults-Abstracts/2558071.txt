Background: Great concern about occupational exposure to chromium (Cr [VI]) has been
reported due to escalated risk of lung cancer in exposed workers. Consequences of occupational
exposure to Cr (VI) have been reported as oxidative stress and lung tissue damage.
Objective: To investigate the feasibility of biological effect monitoring of chrome electroplaters
through analysis of serum malondialdehyde (MDA).
Methods: 90 workers directly involved in chrome electroplating—categorized into three
equal groups based on their job as near bath workers, degreaser, and washers—and 30 workers
without exposure to Cr (VI), served as the control group, were studied. Personal samples
were collected and analyzed according to NIOSH method 7600. Serum MDA level was measured
by HPLC using a UV detector.
Results: Median Cr (VI) exposure level was 0.38 mg/m3 in near bath workers, 0.20 mg/m3
in degreasers, and 0.05 mg/m3 in washers. The median serum MDA level of three exposed
groups (2.76 μmol/L) was significantly (p<0.001) higher than that in the control group (2.00
μmol/L). There was a positive correlation between electroplaters' level of exposure to Cr (VI)
and their serum MDA level (Spearman's ρ 0.806, p<0.001).
Conclusion: Serum MDA level is a good biomarker for the level of occupational exposure to
Cr (VI) in electroplaters.

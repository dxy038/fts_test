2 Dimensional Drawing to 3-Dimensional Conversion is a process in which one tries to convert the 2-Dimensional views of any object in form of 3 Dimensional model. The basic motive of the computer vision is to make computer or machine powerful enough so that it can visualize the external world just like a human does. To represent the visual information present in the real world in a way that they can be analyzed by machines. Initially this visual information was represented with the help of 2-Dimensional drawing views that did not solve the purpose because of the 3-dimensional nature of the real world. So there was a need of reconstructing 3D models of real world scenes and object. Manual reconstruction of the 3D model of an object is quite a challenging problem. To accomplishing the above objective one of the most important tasks is to create a wireframe model of the object.

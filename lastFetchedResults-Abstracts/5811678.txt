A multi-objective mobile robot path planning algorithm based on improved genetic algorithm is proposed. The algorithm aims to achieve three kinds of optimization objects for planned paths: length, smoothness and security by introducing the chaotic sequence and heuristic method based on environmental knowledge to initialize population so as to improve the individuals´ ergodicity and feasibility in the search space. Meanwhile, according to characteristics of path planning, several genetic operators based on domain-specific knowledge are proposed to improve the algorithm´s efficiency. The computer simulation experiments show that the robot can plan a set of optimized smooth paths which can avoid collision from the start to the target point in environment with many obstacles.

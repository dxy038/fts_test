In this paper, a powerful analytical method, called homotopy analysis method (HAM) is used to obtain the analytical solution for a nonlinear ordinary deferential equation that often appear in boundary layers problems arising in heat and mass transfer which these kinds of the equations contain infinity boundary condition. The boundary layer approximations of fluid flow and heat transfer of vertical full cone embedded in porous media give us the similarity solution for full cone subjected to surface heat flux boundary conditions. Nonlinear ODE which is obtained by similarity solution has been solved through homotopy analysis method (HAM). The main objective is to propose alternative methods of solution, which do not require small parameters and avoid linearization and physically unrealistic assumptions. The obtained analytical solution in comparison with the numerical ones represents a remarkable accuracy. The results also indicate that HAM can provide us with a convenient way to control and adjust the convergence region.

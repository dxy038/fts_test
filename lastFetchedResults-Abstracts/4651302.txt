In this paper a pulsewidth modulation based sliding mode controller (PWM SMC) design for a four switch three level bidirectional converter (3L BDC) is presented. The converter nonlinear control design in this structure is complicated because of the existence of two independent switch sets. To overcome this difficulty, an initiative way in defining the control law which utilizes interleaving control of switch sets is proposed. Using this way, the independent switch sets become somehow dependent. The designed controller is analysed and simulated using Matlab (Simulink Toolbox) software. The simulated results show the effectiveness of the designed controller in steady state and transient state of the converter.

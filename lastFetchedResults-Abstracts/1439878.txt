Serum total sialic acid (TSA) concentration is a sensitive marker of excessive alcohol consumption and is the sum of protein-bound sialic acid, lipid-bound sialic acid (LSA), and free sialic acid. The LSA is the fraction of SA attached to gangliosides that are transported in the blood by the lipoproteins. In this article, the effect of chronic alcohol consumption on the serum levels of LSA was evaluated. The objective of the study was to understand the mechanism of elevated serum TSA concentration during alcohol abuse. Additionally, the association of LSA with serum lipid profile was tested. For this purpose, the levels of LSA, TSA, lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins (apos) in the sera of 106 alcoholics were measured. The serum level of LSA in alcohol abusers was significantly elevated. This increase was because of the elevated level of LSA in patients drinking alcohol up to 2 days before sampling. The elevated level of LSA positively correlated with TSA, and also with biochemical indices of hepatocellular injury such as aspartate aminotransferase and Î³-glutamyltransferase, but did not correlate with any lipids, apos, and lipoproteins. The increase in LSA level is not related with the status of serum lipid profile but is related to the liver status estimated by the biochemical markers of liver cell damage. On the basis of our results, we conclude that the elevated level of LSA in alcohol abusers contributes to an increase in the serum concentration of TSA, and contrary to TSA, is affected by the status of liver cells.

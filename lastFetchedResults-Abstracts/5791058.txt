Integration of diagnostics with a memory built-in self-test (BIST) allowing both an effective and efficient manufacturing test as well as an effective diagnostic capability is detailed. Detection of failures within a memory are the primary objective of an embedded memory BIST. Inclusion of comprehensive diagnostics, to isolate faults incurred during the manufacturing or design process, are an extension to the memory BISI, further utilizing the existing circuitry and functionality. Detection and diagnosis of failures within an embedded memory can be realized throughout the entire manufacturing process

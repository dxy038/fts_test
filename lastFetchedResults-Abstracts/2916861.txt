Emeraude V12 is a commercially available product that includes an industrial implementation of the Portable Common Tool Environment (PCTE), the international standard defining the Open Repository for Integrated Project Support Environments (IPSE). A PCTE objective is to provide software developers with a powerful and machine-independent platform allowing integration of applications and cooperation during a software project realisation. PCTE takes into account the recent technologies such as workstations, graphic terminals and local area network. In order to support these technologies, PCTE offers distribution mechanisms providing the users with a transparent access to remote resources located on various types of workstations. The introduction of these mechanisms is preceded by a short overview of PCTE/Emeraude. Information on the Emeraude implementation is provided as well as the underlying mechanisms of PCTE

We give a method of reducing overall power consumption in software defined radio (SDR) receiver for a turbo coding system. Turbo codes are introduced in 3rd generation mobile communication standards for their superior coding gain while SDR will be widely available for various wireless communication applications for itÂ´s multirate, multiband and multimode function in a single hardware platform. It is well known that the iterative decoder structure of turbo decoder results in high power consumption. We take a look at the power consumption in an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) where the number of bits (resolution) used for quantizing the signal determine the power usage. The main objective of this paper is to provide a way to reduce the overall power consumption in SDR for a turbo decoder.

In this paper a hierarchical optimal control problem is considered, which involves an H<sub>&#8734;</sub> cost in the primary problem (arising from a &#8220;one-block&#8221; problem) and a quadratic secondary objective. Using results from super-optimal interpolation theory, it is shown that the problem can be reduced to a multi-disk minimisation in terms of a free parameter of reduced dimension. The problem is finally formulated as a projection onto the intersection of two closed convex sets in L<sub>2</sub> and it is shown that a slight modification of a technique based on the convex alternating projection algorithm, may be employed at this stage to obtain a numerical solution to the problem

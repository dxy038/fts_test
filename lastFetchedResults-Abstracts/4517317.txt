The architectural design is presented of DATAPLEX, a heterogeneous distributed database management system, and a prototype DATAPLEX. The objective of DATAPLEX is to integrate existing diverse databases as well as emerging new databases within an organization for organization-wide date sharing and data consistency. The architecture of DATAPLEX is based on the relational data model as a common data model and the structured query language (SQL) as a standard query language. A method to decompose distributed queries in this architecture is developed. The prototype system interfaces an IMS hierarchical database management system (DBMS) on IBM/MVS and an INGRES relational DBMS on DEC/VMS

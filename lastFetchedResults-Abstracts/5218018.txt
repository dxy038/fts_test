In this work, we present novel VR training strategies that incorporate a hybrid trainer model to train force. For modeling the trainer skill, weighted k-means algorithm in parameter space with LS optimization is implemented. The efficiency of the training strategies is verified via user tests in frame of a bone drilling training application. An objective evaluation method based on n dimensional Euclidean distances is introduced to assess user tests results. It is shown that the proposed strategies improve the student skill and accelerate force learning.

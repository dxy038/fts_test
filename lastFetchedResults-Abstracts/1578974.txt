A protocol is developed for calculation of phytoplankton production from remotely-sensed data in the operational mode. The key element is an objective assignment, on a pixel-by-pixel basis, of the parameters required to implement a primary production model (parameters of the photosynthesis-response function and of the vertical distribution of pigment biomass). In a regional context, the assignment is made by searching the archived data on these parameters according to the (remotely-sensed) chlorophyll concentration and surface temperature. We refer to this approach as the Nearest-Neighbour Method. The procedure is justified on the basis of the known variation of bio-optical properties of phytoplankton with chlorophyll and temperature as well as through consideration of the seasonal variation of watercolumn stratification and its effect on the vertical pigment profile. We illustrate the method, and its justification, using data from the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. Using data from an oceanographic expedition not included in the archive, we find that the parameters estimated in this way are not significantly different from those obtained by direct measurement. We estimate the error associated with parameter assignment on the calculated phytoplankton production to be about 27%. Some potential limitations of the method are discussed.

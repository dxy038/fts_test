Background
tential role of genitourinary infection in the etiology of prostate cancer (CaP) has been extensively investigated for 30 years. Two basic approaches have been used: tissue-based methods (polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization) and serologic assays (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence, etc.). The objective of this review was to answer the question of whether infection of the male genitourinary tract may have a role in the etiology of CaP.
als and methods
e carried out a systematic review of the evidence that was published in the MEDLINE/PubMed database until December 2011. The search terms included “prostate cancer,” “infection,” and the explicit names of the various infectious agents. Additional studies were identified using a reference search. A total of 74 papers were included in the review, which cover the following infectious agents: human papillomavirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus, BK virus, JC virus, chlamydia, mycoplasma, ureaplasma, trichomonas, neisseria, treponema, Propionibacterium acnes, xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus and Candida albicans.
s
e the variable study designs and methodological approaches that were used, most of the pathogens that were studied were unlikely to be directly involved in prostate carcinogenesis.
sions
le of infection in the etiology of CaP has yet to be determined despite 30 years of research efforts. A discovery of an infectious agent that is associated with CaP would be of great medical importance; however, such a link would have to be firmly established before impacting on patient care.

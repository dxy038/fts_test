In the present paper the fuzzy linear optimization problem (with fuzzy coefficients in the objective function) is considered. Recent concepts of fuzzy solution to the fuzzy optimization problem based on the level-cut and the set of Pareto optimal solutions of a multiobjective optimization problem are applied. Chanas and Kuchta suggested one approach to determine the membership function values of fuzzy optimal solutions of the fuzzy optimization problem, which is based on calculating the sum of lengths of certain intervals. The purpose of this paper is to determine a method for realizing this idea. We derive explicit formulas for the bounds of these intervals in the case of triangular fuzzy numbers and show that only one interval needs to be considered.

                            Hepatitis, considering the high prevalence of unsafe sexual behavior.
                            Objective The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness
                            of an educational program based on the theory of planned behavior to
                            improve safe sexual behaviors intention among male substance abusers.

                            Hamadan, the west of Iran. Data collecting tools was a questionnaire

                            behavior variables. The participants in the intervention group
                            participated in four training sessions. Effect of educational
                            intervention on behavioral intention was assessed two months after the
                            last training session. Data were analyzed by SPSS-16 using appropriate
                            statistical tests including paired t-test, independent t-tests, McNemar
                            and multivariate logistic regression analysis Results Significant
                            improvements were found in attitude, subjective norms, perceived
                            behavioral control and behavioral intention for the intervention group
                            (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions Comprehensive implementation of
                            educational courses based on the theory of planned behavior would be

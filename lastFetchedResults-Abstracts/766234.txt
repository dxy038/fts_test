The inhibition of copper corrosion in aqueous
media by inorganic phosphates has been studied
using a chemiometric approach (experimental and
simplex designs). To achieve the objective, four steps
were recognized. When submitted to aqueous aggressive
media, the anion nature and its concentration were
the important variables for the explanation of the
mass loss variation. The most corrosive experimental
conditions were: anion: chloride (Cl–); concentration:
[Cl–] = 1 mol/l; exposure time: 24 h. In the second step,
two inorganic phosphates, Na3PO4 and Na5P3O10, are
tested as copper corrosion inhibitors when the material
is submitted to the severe conditions. The chemical
structure was found to be the most influent factor.
However, %IE varies between 25% and 56%. Then,
we recognized a passivating treatment by submitting
copper to inhibitor solution before immersion in the
aggressive medium. Three parameters were studied:
inhibitor structure, chemical concentration and passivation
time (tp). We concluded that tp is the most
influent experimental factor. The best passivating
conditions are: inhibitor: Na5P3O10; inhibitor concentration:
[Inhibiteur] = 10–2 mol/l and passivation time:
3 h. The inhibition efficiency was 89%. To increase
%IE, a simplex design was also performed starting
by the above obtained conditions and using the
polyphosphate (Na5P3O10) as inhibitor. The optimum
experimental conditions for phosphate inhibition of
copper corrosion in aqueous media are: inhibitor:
Na5P3O10, [Na5P3O10] = 0.017 mol/l and passivation
time tp = 2.17 h. Under these conditions an inhibition
efficiency of 98% was reached.

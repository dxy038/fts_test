The paper presents a new technique to synthesise a dual reflector feed system (DRFS) for compact antenna test ranges (CATR). The objective is to implement the DRFS in an existing single-offset CATR to enlarge its quiet zone size and make more effective use of the CATR reflector aperture. A novel geometric optic synthesis procedure is used to ensure that broadband operation of the CATR is maintained. The millimetrewave CATR at Queen Mary and Westfield College is taken as a design example and computational results show the theoretical quiet zone is enlarged by a factor of 2.2

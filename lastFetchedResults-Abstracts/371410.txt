We have investigated the surface bioactivity of titanium after water and hydrogen plasma immersion ion implantation. Plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) excels in the surface treatment of components possessing a complicated shape such as medical implants. In addition, water and hydrogen PIII has been extensively studied as a method to fabricate silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates in the semiconductor industry and so it is relatively straightforward to transfer the technology to the biomedical field. In our investigation, water and hydrogen were plasma-implanted into titanium sequentially. Our objective is that water PIII introduces near-surface damages that trap hydrogen implanted in the subsequent step to improve the surface bioactivity while the desirable bulk properties of the materials are not compromised. Tiâ€“OH functional groups can be detected on the (H2O+H2)-implanted titanium surface by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. After incubation in simulated body fluids (SBF) for cytocompatibililty evaluation in vitro, bone-like hydroxyapatite was found to precipitate on the (H2O+H2) implanted samples while no apatite was found on titanium samples plasma implanted with water or hydrogen alone. Human osteoblast cells were cultured on the (H2O+H2)-implanted titanium surface and they exhibited good adhesion and growth. Our results suggest a practical means to improve the surface bioactivity and cytocompatibility of medical implants made of titanium.

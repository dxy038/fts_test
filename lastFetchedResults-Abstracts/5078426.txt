This work considers the problem of hosting multiple third-party Internet services in a cost-effective manner so as to maximize a providerÂ´s business objective. For this purpose, we present a dynamic capacity management framework based on an optimization model, which links a cost model based on SLA contracts with an analytical queuing-based performance model, in an attempt to adapt the platform to changing capacity needs in real time. In addition, we propose a two-level SLA specification for different operation modes, namely, normal and surge, which allows for per-use service accounting with respect to requirements of throughput and tail distribution response time. The cost model proposed is based on penalties, incurred by the provider due to SLA violation, and rewards, received when the service level expectations are exceeded. Finally, we evaluate approximations for predicting the performance of the hosted services under two different scheduling disciplines, namely FCFS and processor sharing. Through simulation, we assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach as well as the level of accuracy resulting from the performance model approximations

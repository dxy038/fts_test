The main objective of this work was to develop an adhesive functionally modified in order to have mechanical properties that vary gradually along the overlap, allowing a more uniform stress distribution along the overlap and to reduce the stress concentrations at the ends of the overlap. This allows for a stronger and more efficient adhesive joint. The adhesive stiffness varies along the overlap, being maximum in the middle and minimum at the ends of the overlap.

s study, grading was achieved by induction heating, giving a graded cure of the adhesive along the joint. The functionally graded joint was found to have a higher joint strength compared to the cases where the adhesive is cured uniformly at low temperature or at high temperature. Analytical analysis was performed to predict the failure load of the joints with graded cure and isothermal cure.

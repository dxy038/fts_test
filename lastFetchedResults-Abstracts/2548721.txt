Background and Aim: Considering the lack of information on the occurrence of the epidemic form of Kaposi&rsquo;s sarcoma (KS) and the high prevalence of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients (46%), it was decided to estimate the incidence of KS in this group. Based on the fact that active HHV-8 infection leads to KS development, it is essential to first assess the prevalence of active HHV-8 infection in these patients. Most of the Iranian HIV-infected patients are not aware that they are HIV-positive. If the prevalence of HHV-8 infection is high in these patients, they may spread HHV-8 in the community by high-risk sexual behaviors, which would lead to an increase in the incidence of classic Kaposi&rsquo;s sarcoma. The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of HHV-8 among HIV-infected subjects. 

Materials and Methods: One-hundred plasma samples from HIV-infected patients were collected. Genome was extracted and assessed by the nested PCR assay with specific primers for ORF26. Positive samples were amplified for the ORF K1 region by nested-PCR. Subsequently their products were sequenced and their phylogenic trees constructed. 

Results: HHV-8 was detected in 8 of the patients (8%). No statistically significant associations were found between age and gender on the one hand and HHV-8 infection on the other (p > 0.05). Two genotypes, namely, A and C, were identified, the former in two patients and the latter in one.

Conclusion: Although the prevalence of HHV-8 infection is high among Iranian HIV-infected patients, active HHV-8 infection rate is low among them. Therefore, it seems that the incidence of epidemic KS is likely to be very low in this group. Certainly more research is needed in this area. As regards genotypes, genotypes A and C are found in the samples.

Objective

Most children brought to the emergency department (ED) for evaluation of seizures undergo an extensive laboratory workup. Since results are usually negative, the value of such routine laboratory workups has been questioned. A group of children with unprovoked seizures was prospectively studied to determine the diagnostic values of routine serum chemistries and to identify risk factors predictive of abnormal findings.

Materials & Methods

All patients evaluated at the ED of the Ghaem hospital during a consecutive 12 months period between Jan 2004 through Jan 2005 were studied. We collected data for patient's demographics, details of the history of present illness (including vomiting, diarrhea, apnea), medication use, past history of seizures, family history of seizures, metabolic disorders or other chronic medical illnesses, neonatal history and neurological examination as well as nutritional status, type and time of seizure. The role of abnormal serum chemistries as a seizure trigger factor was assessed in patients with a history of seizure.

Results

A total of 210 patients (mean age 19.2 months) with unprovoked seizures were evaluated. Twenty- three serum abnormalities were noted in the patients (12 cases of hyponatremia, 7 of hypoglycemia, 4 of hypokalemia, 4 of uremia). The incidence of abnormal serum biochemical values was higher in patients with a first seizure, younger patients, and those with gastrointestinal symptoms.

Conclusion

According to the present study, one can conclude that in children younger than 2 years and having no structural CNS abnormality, electrolyte and glucose screening is recommended only for a first unprovoked seizure, when gastrointestinal symptoms or symptoms suggesting electrolyte disturbances are present.

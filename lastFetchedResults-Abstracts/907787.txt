The western diet includes several food items based on wheat. Adherence and obedience to a gluten-free diet requires self-determination on the part of the person with Coeliac disease, as well as their family members. The objective of this research is to identify the main difficulties noted by people with Coeliac disease in their eating habits, the frequency of consumption and their satisfaction with gluten-free products. We employed an adapted already validated questionnaire, with open, closed, and multiple choice questions. Of the 105 participants with Coeliac disease, 90.38% of them followed, where possible, a gluten-free diet; 67.12% consumed food with gluten inadvertently or because of a lack of alternatives and/or information in food found in public places. Seventy percent affirmed that their diet provided all the energy and nutrients they need; 77.67% of the Coeliac participants prepared their meals by themselves or this task was assumed by their caregivers; 77.14% read the manufacturers labels on products, and, 74.49% expressed dissatisfaction regarding the price and availability of gluten-free products. The data show an association only between the energy and nutrients needed for good health and gluten-free dietary tracking (p = 0.0315). That is, people with Coeliac disease who avoided gluten consumed more calories and were more likely to have adequate nutrients in their diet.

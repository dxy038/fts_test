In this paper, we consider the inverse BCC model is used to estimate output levels of the Decision Making Units (DMUs), when the input levels are changed and maintain the efficiency index for all DMUs. Since the inverse BCC problem is in the form of a multi objective nonlinear programming model (MONLP), which is not easy to solve. Therefore, we propose a linear programming model, which gives a Pareto-efficient solution to the inverse BCC problem. So far, we propose a model for improvement of the current efficiency value for considered DMU. Numerical examples are, also, used to illustrate the proposed approaches.

The objective of this paper is to provide a methodology for determining the degree of partial blending in high RAP mixtures. When RAP is mixed with virgin aggregates and virgin binder, partial blending of RAP binder occurs in the hot mix asphalt. Agencies limit the amount of RAP because the degree of blending between the RAP and the virgin materials is not known. The methodology provides a systematic approach for determining the degree of partial blending in the RAP mixture. The ability to accurately determine the degree of partial blending will help in determining the virgin binder content to be added in the mixture. The degree of partial blending measured from this procedure for 25% RAP by weight of aggregates with PG 70-28 and 35% RAP by weight of aggregates with PG 58-28 are 70% and 96% respectively.

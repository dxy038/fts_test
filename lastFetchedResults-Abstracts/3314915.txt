The main objective of the Hybrid Power System is to satisfy the requirements of the electrical loads at the same time as maximizing the utilization of renewable energy sources while optimizing the operation of the battery bank and the conventional generators. The supervisor control determines the operation mode of each generation subsystem for optimised operation. Fundamentally, these operation modes are determined by the energy balance between the total demand (load and battery bank) and the total generation (wind, solar, and grid). To design the supervisory controller, we select the wind subsystem as the main generator role, the complementary roles are in charge of solar subsystem and the grid respectively. Diesel generator is not taken into account as the source because of the nature of the fuel.

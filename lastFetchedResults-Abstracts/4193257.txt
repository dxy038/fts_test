This paper presents the development of a mathematical model applied to medium voltage electrical network planning to give support for capacitor placement decision task. For this goal, a linear mathematical model was developed to determine the location and power of the capacitor to improve the voltage level of the electrical system. The proposed model has linear objective function, linear constraints, continuous and binary variables, being represented by a mixed integer linear programming. The objective function to be minimized includes operational costs of installation, affected consumers and voltage constraints. These constraints are important to reduce the search space of the optimization procedure. In order to evaluate voltage level, the model includes a power flow method based on constant current. The qualitative variables in the objective function are modeled with a fuzzy system, addressing the impacts of applying capacitor related to consumers and network quality indicators.

We consider a Hilbert space, an orthogonal projection onto a closed subspace and a sequence of downwardly
directed affine spaces.We give sufficient conditions for the projection of the intersection of the affine
spaces into the closed subspace to be equal to the intersection of their projections. Under a closure assumption,
one such (necessary and) sufficient condition is that summation and intersection commute between the
orthogonal complement of the closed subspace, and the subspaces corresponding to the affine spaces. Another
sufficient condition is that the cosines of the angles between the orthogonal complement of the closed
subspace, and the subspaces corresponding to the affine spaces, be bounded away from one. Our results are
then applied to a general infinite horizon, positive semi-definite, linear quadratic mathematical programming
problem. Specifically, under suitable conditions, we show that optimal solutions exist and, modulo
those feasible solutions with zero objective value, they are limits of optimal solutions to finite-dimensional
truncations of the original problem.

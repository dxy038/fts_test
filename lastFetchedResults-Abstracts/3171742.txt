By analyzing the principles of One-Cycle Control (OCC) and PWM bridge rectifier circuit, OCC is applied to bridge rectifier circuit and a control strategy of bridge rectifier employing OCC is proposed. Taking the unit power factor as the control objective, the relationship between the duty ratio of IGBT and control voltage is deduced. In order to adapt the time-varying of output voltage error and improve the system robustness, a fuzzy PID controller is used in the control process. Finally the circuit model is established using Matlab. Simulation results indicate that this rectifier control strategy can achieve the stability of output voltage quickly and validate the effectiveness of power factor correction.

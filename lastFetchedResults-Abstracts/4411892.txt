This paper deals with the RCS (Radar Cross Section) acquisition procedure in the anechoic chamber of ENSTA Bretagne. This device will be used in the comparison of RCS measurements organized by a French working group (GTi) [1]. One objective of this group is to determine uncertainties in an anechoic chamber from RCS measurements of different targets. In this paper, we present our experimental system and processing performed on the data to obtain the RCS of the object under test. The measurement results are given for canonical and complex targets. The measurements are then compared with some results of simulations computed with FEKO.

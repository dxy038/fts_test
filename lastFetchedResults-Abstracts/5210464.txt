This paper presents a 3D conflict avoidance algorithm in the presence of uncertainty. The objective of the algorithm is to ensure the safety of the airspace in the event of a failure in the communication, navigation or surveillance systems. The algorithm minimizes the number of maneuvers required to maintain the safety of the airspace under degraded conditions. Uncertainties are modeled as an increase in the required separation distance between aircraft. A single maneuver for each aircraft is chosen to maintain safe separation. Maneuvers include heading change, speed change and flight level change. Maneuvers are simple to execute and guarantee a conflict-free configuration after execution. Their feasibility is constrained by weather avoidance, sector boundaries and aircraft performance. A mixed integer program is used to determine the set of maneuvers to be executed.

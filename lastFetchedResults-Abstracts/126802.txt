Background: ECT is one of the major treatments for psychotic patients.Performing ECT in patients with pre-existing heart disease and hypertension has high risk of cardiac complications. Objective: To evaluate blood pressure and heart rate changes in patients undergoing ECT . Methods: This semi-experimental study was performed on 38 psychotic patients (21 men and 17 women) aged 21-40 years and needing ECT at Bistodoe-Bahman  hospital in 2001. They all had no history of heart disease or hypertension . Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at three stages:initially ,one minute after induction of anesthesia , immediately after completion of convulsions.Using T-test and Paired T-test , the data were statistically analyzed.
Findings: The patients had undergone a total number of 118 ECTs. At first stage the average BP was 103/65mmHg and the average heart rate was 83/minute, at second stage BP 119178 mmHg and heart rate 104/minute and at final stage BP I61/97 mmHg and heart rate 1311 minute. Hemodynamic changes including systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart pressure and heart rate at 3 stages after ECT were improved to be statistically significant (P<0.OOOl) .
Conclusion : ECT increases systolic and diastolyic blood pressure and heart rate in general.

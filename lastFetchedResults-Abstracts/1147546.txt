Achieving an acceptable level of price growth is the main objective of economic policy. Subject to the importance of food, information about food price response to monetary policy is so important. Recent emphasis is on the use of models in which they are used a wide range of economic data. This is possible by supplement to the traditional VAR models and using one or more factors. In the present study, we tried to evaluate the effect of monetary policy on food price by using small scale of FAVAR model. For these purpose 31 macroeconomic variables in periods 1367:1 to 1387:4 has been used. The results showed that the liquidity shock on food price index does not show any reaction approximately ten next seasons but after this period, it makes increasing fluctuations on food price so that in the long-run it doesn't lead to equilibrium. Therefore, a monetary shock will lead to instability fluctuations in long run and it will fluctuate cyclic and increase over time.

The integrated local management interface (ILMI) has been specified to provide any ATM user device with status and configuration information concerning the VP/VC connections available at its UNI. ILMI supports bidirectional exchange of management information between two connected ATM interface management entities (IMEs). ILMI uses SNMP for management and control operations of information across the ATM interface. Unlike the implementation of SNMP used in TCP/IP networks, the SNMP used for ILMI is based on AAL5, thus the SNMP messages are transferred through a certain VCC. In this article, both SNMP(s) over TCP/IP and AAL5 are implemented for the integrity of an ATM network management system

This work objectively evaluates and presents a quantitative analysis of concentrated time-frequency distributions (TFDs) obtained through Network of Expert Neural Networks (NENNs). The objective methods include the ratio of norms based measures, Shannon &amp; Re&#769;nyi entropy measures, normalized Re&#769;nyi entropy measure and Jubisa measure. The introduction of these measures allows quantifying the quality of TFDs instead of relying solely on visual inspection of their plots. Performance comparison with various other quadratic TFDs is provided too.

Background & objective: Laser surgery is one of surgical treatment. The C02 laser been widely used for upper airway surgery. During laser surgery of the upper airways, the anesthesiologists and surgeons have an important role in airway management. The objective of this study was to determine the methods of anesthesia, in patients with upper airway laser surgery in Ghaem hospital.
Methods: In this retrospective study, 77 patients with laser surgery were studied. We used X2 test.
Results: The study findings showed that the methods of ansthesia in 98.6% were G.A and in other were seadatin. Induction anesthtics and muscles relaxant agents were: Nesdonal, fentanyle and succinlycholine in 78.6%, Nesdonal and succinlycholine in 7.1%, nesdonal in 5.7%, nesdonal and atracurium in 4.3%, and in others were fentanyle, thalamonl and diazepam. Volatile agents were, halothane, N2o with 02 in 68.5%. Halothane with 02 in 26.4%. Endotracheal Tubs that used were red rubber tube in 55.2% and in 17.9% with metallic tube, and in others throw the trachoestom. complications were bleeding 1.3%, respiratory distress 1.3% and endotracheal tube ignition 1.3%. There is significant releationship between kind of surgery and induction anesthetics (p < 0/0001).
Conclusion: The laser is precise but potentially dangerous surgical instrument, that must be used with caution so anesthesiologists and surgeons should be used a laser safety protocol.

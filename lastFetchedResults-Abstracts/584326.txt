The present paper seeks to shed light on the obstacles in the way of psychology and counseling students' inclination towards Islamic approach. A semi-structured interview was conducted with thirty students and five professors in the Department of counseling and psychology in Isfahan University for the purpose of pursuing the objective of this research. They were selected according to an available sampling. Qualitative content analysis and QSR NVivo software were used for analyzing the data. The data analysis data gathered from the interviews with the responders have two general headings and eleven categories. They are as follows: 1- intra-personal factors including four categories such as students' general reluctance to discuss new issues; 2- extra-personal factors including seven categories such as lack of educational and research resources.
No doubt, knowing the obstacles in the way of psychology and counseling students' inclination towards using Islamic approach helps to establish a proper procedure for encouraging  students to adopt the Islamic approach.

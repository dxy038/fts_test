This paper presents an inverse design methodology to obtain a required yield strength with an optimal
cooling condition for the continuous quenching of precipitation hardenable sheet alloys. The yield
strength of a precipitation hardenable alloy can be obtained by allowing solute to enter into solid
solution at a proper temperature and rapidly cooling the alloy to hold the solute in the solid solution.
An aging process may be needed for the alloy to develop the  nal mechanical property. The objective
of the design is to optimize the quenching process so that the required yield strength can be achieved.
With the inverse design method, the required yield strength is speci ed and the sheet thermal pro le
at the exit of the quenching chamber can also be speci ed. The conjugate gradient method is used
to optimize the cooling boundary condition during quenching. The adjoint system is developed to
compute the gradient of the objective functional. An aluminium sheet quenching problem is presented
to demonstrate the inverse design method

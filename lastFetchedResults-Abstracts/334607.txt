Brachytherapy delivered within the early post-operative period has been associated with delayed healing and wound breakdown. The objective of this study was to determine whether reconstruction with a microvascular free flap reduced the incidence of wound breakdown after early post-operative brachytherapy and wide excision of soft tissue sarcomas. Four patients with sarcomas underwent excision and free flap reconstruction. Brachytherapy was administered in the early post-operative period using Iridium-192 wires via tubes inserted intraoperatively. In three of the four patients the wounds healed uneventfully, demonstrating that brachytherapy can be delivered in the early post-operative period following free flap reconstruction without an increase in the frequency of wound breakdown. There has been no local recurrence to date in this group of patients.

Management and scheduling of flights and assignment of gates to aircraft play a
significant role in improving the procedure of the airport, due to the growing
number of flights, decreasing the flight times. This research addresses assigning
and scheduling of runways and gates in the main airport simultaneously.
Moreover, this research considers the unavailability of runway’s constraint and
the uncertain parameters relating to both areas of runway and gate assignment.
The proposed model is formulated as a comprehensive bi-level bi-objective
problem.The leader’s objective function minimizes the total waiting time for
runways and gates for all aircrafts based on their importance coefficient.
Meanwhile, the total distance traveled by all passengers in the airport terminal
is minimized by a follower’s objective function. To solve the proposed model,
the decomposition approach based on Benders’ decomposition method is
applied. Empirical data are used to show the validation and application of our
model. A comparison shows the effectiveness of the proposed model and its
significant impact on cost decreasing.

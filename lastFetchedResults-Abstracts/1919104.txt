Clinical and laboratory factors predicting inpatient outcomes, specifically in-hospital mortality and length of stay (LOS), have not been defined for hospitalized patients specifically referred for left heart catheterization and coronary angiography (LHC). The objective of the study was to determine these outcomes and their predictors in hospitalized patients after LHC. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality and Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors determining LOS in 9,420 consecutive patients hospitalized for LHC. Odds ratio for in-hospital mortality and hazard ratio for prolonged LOS were derived. The strongest predictors of mortality were advanced age, left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure (EDP), LV ejection fraction (EF), systemic blood pressure, and renal insufficiency. Predictors of prolonged LOS were LVEDP, LVEF, 3-vessel coronary artery disease, and valvular disease. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with an LVEF ≥50% were also compared with those of patients with an LVEF &lt;50%. Predictors of mortality and LOS remained the same for patients with an LVEF &lt;50%. For an LVEF ≥50%, LVEDP also determined LOS and chronic renal insufficiency provided predictive power to mortality and LOS in this subgroup. In conclusion, several readily attainable clinical and laboratory parameters predict inpatient mortality and LOS in hospitalized patients referred for LHC.

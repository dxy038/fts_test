We have established a theoretical framework for cross-layer optimization in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless networks. In this paper, we focus on effective and practical algorithms for efficient and fair resource allocation in OFDM wireless networks. We have taken various conditions into account and developed a variety of efficient algorithms, including sorting-search dynamic subcarrier assignment, greedy bit loading, and power allocation, as well as objective aggregation algorithms. We have also modified those algorithms for a certain type of nonconcave utility functions. To further improve performance by exploiting time diversity, a low-pass time filter can be easily incorporated into all of the algorithms. Simulation results have confirmed that the utility-based cross-layer optimization can significantly enhance the system performance and guarantee fairness. The gains come from multiuser diversity, frequency diversity, as well as time diversity. The fairness is automatically achieved by the behavior of marginal utility functions.

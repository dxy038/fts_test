Background and objective: Laparoscopy is considered the gold standard for the evaluation
of tubal disease, but it is an invasive and costly procedure. CAT is simple, inexpensive and non
â€“ invasive method. HSG is suffering from positive and negative results. The aim of this study
was the comparison of these three methods in predicting of tubal factor infertility.
Materials and Methods: Anti-Chlamydia trachomatis IgG were determined in 144 infertility
patients' sera by means of ELISA methods. Laparoscopy and HSG were carried out in all
patients. The positive CAT results were compared with HSG and laparoscopy with respect of
their predictive value of tubal factor infertility. The results were analyzed using SPSS software.
For determination of cut off point Roc curve was applied.
Results: In 16(11.1%) of the 144 patients studied the CAT was positive. The statistical
analysis of results revealed the sensitivity of CAT in determining tubal factory infertility 54.1%
specificity 97.5% positive and negative likelihood predictive value was 21 and 0.47,
respectively. The same results in HSG were 62.5%, 91.6%, 7.5 and 0.4, respectively.
Conclusion: Our results indicated that not only CAT is a simple and inexpensive procedure,
but also it is more likely positive than HSG in predicting tubal factor infertility. It is
recommended in predicting of tubal factor infertility CAT should become an integral part of
fertility work-up.

Background: Evidences suggest an association between the prevalence of thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and anti thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) with recurrent abortions and infertility. Iodine deficiency was once endemic in Iran and little data is available about the prevalence of these antibodies in different groups of fertile or infertile individuals.
Objective: This case control study was designed to compare the presence of anti-TPO and anti-Tg in four groups of women to reveal their role in the etiology of recurrent abortion and infertility.
Materials and Methods: Four groups of euthyroid women referring to Avicenna Infertility Clinic in Tehran were selected; 95 cases as fertile controls and 70, 78 and 137 cases with male and female factor infertility and recurrent abortion respectively. TSH, anti-TPO and anti-Tg were evaluated by chemiluminescent immunoassay.
Results: The prevalence of the above mentioned autoantibodies in euthyroid controls was about 25% and the percentage of people with an anti-Tg  > 500 was two times bigger in the abortion group compared to the control group (p < 0.05) and the proportion of people with an anti-Tg  > 500 in younger cases in the abortion group was significantly higher than the rest of the cases (p < 0.05). Anti-TPO distribution had no significant differences.
Conclusion: There were no statistically significant differences among four groups. It seems that more comprehensive studies are needed to reach a common conclusion about thyroid autoantibodies in women with recurrent abortions in different groups and different parts of Iran. In addition, dividing the recurrent abortion and infertility groups on the basis of their etiologies could be effective.

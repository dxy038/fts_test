In order to reduce the solar absorption of pavement and accelerate the downward heat conduction, two bidirectional heat induced structures were designed, one named G-BHIS (only gradient thermal conductivity) and the other named G + R-BHIS (the combination of gradient thermal conductivity and heat reflective layer). Compared with the contrast structure, the heat absorption was reduced by 12.73% for the G-BHIS and 35.02% for the G + R-BHIS, respectively. The heat accumulation within the pavement was reduced by 15.9% for the G-BHIS and 37.6% for the G + R-BHIS, respectively. The coupling effect of the decreased heat absorption and accumulation reduced pavement temperature. The maximum temperature differences, 2.38 °C (for the G-BHIS) and 7.76 °C (for the G + R-BHIS), both appeared at the depth of 4 cm. Rutting results showed that the maximum rutting depth could be reduced by 41.0% for the G-BHIS and 65.0% for the G + R-BHIS, respectively. The two structures are expected to decrease heat accumulation and reduce pavement temperature, and furthermore, reducing rutting.

With the theory of green manufacturing technologies and applications continue to mature, many green manufacturing enterprises focus on establishing an effective method of comprehensive evaluation. In accordance with the objectives of traditional manufacturing industries, as well as five decision-making objectives of green manufacturing (time, quality, resources, costs, environment), 5 first level appraisal targets and 24 second level of appraisal targets are put forward as comprehensive evaluation targets. And then a comprehensive evaluation system is established, combining subjectivity and objectivity, simultaneously considering the economic efficiency and the social efficiency. First, 5 Sub-systems are evaluated comprehensively by using the principal components analytic method; then the weights of each sub-system are determined by using the analytic hierarchy process; finally the comprehensive evaluation value of the entire system extracted by using the weighted sum law. This method fully manifests objective information in the appraisal process and accepts policy-makerÂ´s experience; and green manufacture enterprises is evaluated comprehensively, objectively and accurately. The concrete application of this assessment method has been analyzed through one example.

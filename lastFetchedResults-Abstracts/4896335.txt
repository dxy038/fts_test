Generation-transmission restructuring is necessary to facilitate regional electricity business in vertically integrated structure areas. In the generation-transmission construction, system stability, environmental problems and economic factors must generally be considered. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose a new generation-transmission planning prioritization method using a Pareto optimal set as a multi-objective evaluation. Here, we first consider the system stability, and then evaluate CO<sub>2</sub> emission, transmission loss and heavily-loaded power flow decreases, comprehensively. Finally, we carry out simulations for the IEEJ EAST 107 bus system, and determine the generation-transmission planning priority to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

The main objective of this paper is to establish a general architecture for decentralized supervision of fuzzy discrete event systems (FDES). First, two different types of decentralized supervisory control architectures of FDES are presented, which fuse the locally enabled degrees of fuzzy events using the fuzzy-intersection operator and the fuzzy-union operator, respectively. Both of these architectures possess limitations in information association. Second, to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, a general architecture for decentralized supervisory control of FDES is introduced, in which the decisions of local supervisors are fused by using both fuzzy-union and fuzzy-intersection operators. The proposed general architecture is then implemented to control a tightly coupled multirobot object manipulation task in simulation. A performance evaluation is performed to quantitatively estimate the validity of the proposed architecture compared with centralized FDES-based and decentralized crisp DES-based approaches.

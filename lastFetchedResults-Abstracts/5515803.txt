The objective of this work is to utilize an embedded system to automate the control of a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor via numeric control. The design will be implemented to demonstrate, with precision, how to control multiple BLDC motors simultaneously and with accuracy. The design will be operated with precisely programed commands called G-Codes that will be encoded in LabVIEW. This research can be used to design a machine that can print custom printed circuit boards (PCB). However, in order to demonstrate proof of concept a plotter was constructed as a visual representation of the capabilities in which a machine can operate autonomously to print a PCB. The plotter will feature a myRIO, a fully functional FPGA, and a Seeeduino to control all operations of the system. The system also features a custom communication protocol developed specifically for interaction between the FPGA and microcontroller. The plotter has a Graphical User Interface (GUI); custom designed and built in LabVIEW that allows a user to interact with the operations of the plotter. The user is able to monitor system status and fault conditions and correct them in a timely fashion.

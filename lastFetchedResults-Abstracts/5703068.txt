Hemorrhagic shock is a common cause of death in emergency rooms. The objective evaluation of hemorrhagic shock is very important for early diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of this study is to understand its mechanism by analyzing the changes of bio-signals in hemorrhagic shock using controlled hemorrhage of Sprague-Dawley rats. We constructed an integrated system to be able to control bleeding and to simultaneously measure bio-signals such as ECG, blood pressure, temperature, and respiration. In order to verify the system, we measured the bio-signals mentioned above while hemorrhagic shock was induced by withdrawing blood (2.5ml/100g/15min) from a femoral vein for 10 rats.

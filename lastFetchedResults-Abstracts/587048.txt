Introduction: Despite the many benefits of exercise behavior, lack of physical activity is a health problem in college students. A key issue in exercise behavior research is using health behavior models in order to promote and maintain exercise behavior. Previous research has shown that due to the complex and dynamic nature of exercise behavior change, it seems unlikely that a single theoretical approach can truly capture it. 
Objective: The effect of the integrated model of Transtheoretical model and self-determination theory on the promotion and maintenance of exercise behavior among college students.
Materials and Methods: This study was a randomized controlled trial. The experimental group (66 students) received the intervention based on TTM and SDT, and control group (67 students) did not receive any intervention by the researcher. Evaluation was conducted by tools based on the constructs of TTM and SDT as well as METs, before intervention, post intervention and after 8 months.
 Results: There were no significant differences between the two groups before the intervention regarding the demographic variables, constructs of TTM and SDT and METs. The study findings showed significant differences in the exercise behavior stage of change and METs (P < 0.001) between experimental group and control group in the post intervention and follow up evaluation. Also, significant improvement in the exercise behavior stage of change and METs in the experimental group throughout pre, post and follow up intervention was observed (P < 0.001). 
Conclusion: Education intervention based on an integrated model of transtheoretical model and self-determination theory has effects on the promotion and maintenance of exercise behavior among college students.

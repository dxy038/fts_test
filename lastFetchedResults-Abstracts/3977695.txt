Called the F8, this n-channel microprocessor is aimed at applications that encompass over 80 percent of the available microprocessor market. In the minimum two-chip system, each of the CPU and program-storage-unit (PSU) chips provide two 8-bit bidirectional I/O ports, resulting in a total of 32 available I/O bits. This allows the two-chip system to accommodate directly I/O devices such as keyboards, printers, readers, displays, modems, and magnetic devices.

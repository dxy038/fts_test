The objective of this study was to establish a reference base for respiratory variables (respiratory rate [RR], inspiratory and expiratory time [Ti and Te], peak inspiratory and expiratory pseudoflow [PIF and PEF], tidal volume [VT], minute ventilation [VE] and enhanced pause [Penh]) of healthy cats by use of barometric whole body plethysmography (BWBP). Eighteen healthy European cats (10 male, 8 female) were studied from the age of 3 to 13 months in order to assess growth- and gender-related changes of BWBP variables. Chest radiographs and bronchoalveolar lavage cytology were performed to confirm pulmonary health status. Diurnal changes were investigated every 2 h over a period of 24 h when the cats were adult.

, PIF and PEF significantly increased during somatic growth and were higher in males than in females, whereas RR, Ti, Te, Te/Ti ratio, PEF/PIF ratio and Penh remained unchanged and were not affected by gender. When measured over 24 h, Penh, Te and Ti were significantly increased in the early morning hours (04:00 h), whereas RR, PIF and PEF were decreased at that time. This study provides reference values of BWBP variables for healthy male and female cats and indicates when circadian changes might be observed.

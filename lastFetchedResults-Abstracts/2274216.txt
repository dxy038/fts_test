In this paper the problem of multidisciplinary and multi-objective conceptual design optimization of an air launched projectile (ALP) is investigated. The proposed task is performed using a three degree of freedom (DOF) flight dynamics simulation model and taking into account all the constraints involved in the optimization process. To maximize the payload weight as well as the range of ALP, the vehicle weight and balance, aerodynamics and stability disciplines are selected in the optimization process using a model with moderate levels of fidelity for each subject. The ALP design optimization problem contains 14 design variables and 2 target functions that include the payload weight and the vehicle range. Finally, a performance based comparison of results between the optimized ALP and its non-optimum initial configuration has been made.  In addition, a Monte Carlo analysis is performed over the optimal ALP design to see the effects of launching uncertainties in meeting the mission requirements.

Handwriting analysis is the technique used to understand a person in a better way through his/her handwriting. By examining the handwriting, we can develop a sketch which reflects the writerÂ´s emotional outlays, fears, honesty, mental state and many other personality traits. Emotions include the interpretation, perception and response of the feelings related to the experience of any particular situation. They are the ones which bridge thoughts, feelings and actions. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the handwriting characteristics like Baseline, Slant, Pen-Pressure, Size, Margin and Zone to determine the emotion levels of a person. This will help identifying those people who are emotionally disturbed or depressed and need psychological help to overcome such negative emotions.

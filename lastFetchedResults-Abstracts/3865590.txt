It is shown in this paper that the optimum position of interleaved repeaters for minimum delay and noise is not the midpoint as commonly practiced. A closed-form solution for the optimum position has been derived in this paper and verified by simulation. Bidirectional buses with the optimum interleaved repeater position are compared to commonly used bidirectional buses and shown to provide an improvement greater than 50% in the propagation delay and bit-rate per unit area. The area of the induced noise pulse on victim lines is shown to be zero indicating that the aggressor lines are virtually static with the optimum repeater position. The presented optimum repeater positioning also provides lower noise pulse amplitude as well as lower sensitivity of propagation delay and noise pulse peak to segment length variation, compared to commonly used midway repeater positioning.

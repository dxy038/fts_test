By analyzing the distributed power of the impact of distribution network planning, A new mind evolutionary algorithm based on considerationwith is proposed to solve the selected location problem and selected capacity of the distributed generation. Firstly, the normalized objective function including investment and operating cost, loss cost and purchase is proposed, then the algorithm is achieved by Matlab. The results obtained show that the global search capabilities can achieve balance and the optimal solution can be found quickly.

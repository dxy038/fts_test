Objective: This longitudinal 8-year study assesses potential predictors of major depressive disorder (MDD) in a cohort of healthy adolescent females at high familial risk for MDD. The objective of this study was to ascertain whether risk factors for female onset MDD would differentiate youth at high or usual risk for MDD, prior to the onset of depressive symptomology. Method: Subjects (ages 12â€“15 years) were assigned to a high (n=43) or usual (n=40) risk group according to maternal history of MDD. Depressive symptomatology (Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression), pubertal development (Pubertal Developmental Staging Questionnaire), social support (Social Support Scale), and cognitive vulnerability (Depressive Experiences Questionnaire) were assessed. Results: High risk and usual risk group demonstrated no significant differences in demographic variables such as age, body mass index, and grade. Significantly more youth in the high risk group (n=40, 93%) had started menstruation, compared to youth in the usual risk group (n=31, 77.5%). There were no significant differences between the groups on measures of dysphoric cognitive style, perceived overall number of social supports, or satisfaction with social support. Conclusion: Females at high familial risk for the onset of depression have significant differences in pubertal development, but not in demographics, depressive symptoms, social supports, or dysphoric cognitive style, when compared to females at usual risk for depression. These findings suggest that in prevention trials for depression in asymptomatic young women no non-biological risk factors for MDD aid in identifying females at higher risk for MDD.

The short message service (SMS), a bidirectional service for short alphanumeric (up to 160 bytes) messages, is a unique feature of GSM not found in older analog systems. Multireceiver short message traffic has increased amazingly over the years. We propose a multicast SMS architecture over our backbone network. Then, we demonstrate some approaches to maintain the SMS center location information consistent with the home location register and illustrate our scheme for mobile terminated short message transfer. Finally, we simulate and evaluate this architecture. Our simulation indicates that the proposed strong consistency approaches have optimal efficiency by adjusting parameters, and the proposed architecture efficiently provides self-routing capability and multicast functionality in our cellular backbone network. The study also provides a further insight on the issues of multicast wireless cellular backbone network and demonstrates a referable methodology to propose and analyze a multicast cellular backbone network, which can promote the technology of a personal communication network.

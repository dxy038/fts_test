This paper presents the new reactive power compensation scheme for the Jeju-Haenam HVDC system. Because of changes in the Jeju AC power system configuration from as it was when the Jeju-Haenam HVDC system was built, the need to modify the existing reactive power compensation scheme is rising. In order to consider reactive power supply from new thermal power plants of Jeju AC power system, a new reactive compensation scheme for the stable operation of the HVDC system is proposed using integer programming. Additional objective of the new compensation scheme is to minimize the number of components switching in order to reduce temporary over-voltage. Nonlinear time-domain simulation using PSS/E is used to verify the proposed scheme.

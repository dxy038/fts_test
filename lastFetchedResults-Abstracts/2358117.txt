Objective
Overactivity and behavioral problems are common problems in children with
prelingually profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Data on epileptiform
electroencephalography (EEG) discharges in deaf children with psychological
disorders are so limited. The primary focus of this study was to determine
the prevalence of epileptiform discharges (EDs) in children with SNHL and
overactivity or behavioral problems.
Materials & Methods
A total of 262 patients with prelingually profound SNHL who were referred to
our cochlear implantation center between 2008 and 2010 were enrolled in this
study. Children with SNHL who had diagnosis of overactivity and/or behavioral
problems by a pediatric psychiatrist, underwent electroencephalography (EEG).
EEG analysis was carried out by a board-certified pediatric neurologist. The
control group consisted of 45 cases with overactivity or behavioral problems
and normal hearing.
Results
One hundred thirty-eight children with mean age of 3.5±1.23 year were enrolled
in the case group, of whom 88 cases (63.7%) were boy. The control group
consisted of 45 cases with mean age of 3.2±1.53 years, of whom 30 (66.6%)
cases were male. EDs were detected in 28 (20.02%) children of the case group
(with SNHL) in comparison with 4 (8.88%) in the control group (without
SNHL), which was statistically significantly different.
Conclusion
In this study, we obtained higher frequency of EDs in deaf children with
overactivity and/or behavioral problem compared to the children without SNHL.
Further studies are required to evaluate the possible association of SNHL with
EDs in overactive children.

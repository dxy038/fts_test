A power control strategy for a real variable speed wind turbine system is presented in this paper. The Hinfin-based mixed sensitivity method is applied to realize multi-objective control such as the tracking characteristics for the rated power, poles placement and robustness to disturbances. LMI Toolbox in MATLAB is used to optimize the parameters of Hinfincontroller. First in this paper, a physical model of the fundamental drive-system dynamics of a 300 kW horizontal axis variable speed wind turbine (VWT) is derived. By linearizing this physical model, we can get its linearized state-space form. Second, Hinfin-based S/T/R algorithm is introduced in brief. Finally, the Hinfin controller of mixed sensitivity is designed on the basis of VWT model and simulation is made. The Simulation results show the better performance of the proposed control strategy compared with the conventional PI control.

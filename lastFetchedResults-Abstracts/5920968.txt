Recently, a novel technique to compute sine and cosine has been proposed. By rewriting the expressions using trigonometric equations a weighted sum of bit-products are used to compute the values. This can then be mapped onto a bit-product generator followed by an adder tree. This provides an efficient architecture that can be pipelined to an arbitrary degree. It was shown in previous work that it is possible to remove a large portion of the bit-products and still obtain accurate results. The effects of this removal and also the finite worldlength representation of the weights has also been discussed in previous work. The objective of this work is to study different ways to split the architecture into sub-blocks that may be disabled to decrease the power consumption.

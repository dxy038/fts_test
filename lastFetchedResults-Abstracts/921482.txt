Objective
Gastroenteritis has a diverse etiology; many pathogens can cause this condition. Of the extraintestinal manifestations, one is convulsions, which may be  attributable to fever, type of bacteria, or electrolyte imbalance. To assess the risk of occurrence of convulsions, in this study we investigated the association between the paraclinical and clinical findings of children with gastroenteritis and the risk of occurrence of convulsions.

Materials & Methods
In this prospective study, conducted between March 2004 and February 2005, we studied 50 patients admitted to the Mofid Childrens' Hospital, with gastroenteritis and convulsions.

Stool samples were obtained for investigations of electrolyte imbalances and type of gastroenteritis. A control group consisting of patients admitted simultaneously with gastroenteritis but no convulsions was selected as well.They were matched with the case group in terms of age, sex, and month of admission and number. Data was collected using a specific checklist.

Results
The stool exam (SE) showed 31 cases (62%) had inflammatory diarrhea and 19 (38%) had the non-inflammatory type. In the control group, 21 cases(42%) had inflammatory and 29 (58%) had non-inflammatory diarrhea. Stool culture (SC) results showed 11 (22%) subjects had Shigella, 27 (54%) revealed no organism, and 12 (24%) did not have SCs in their medical records. In the control group SC results revealed Shigella in 2 cases (4%), 38 patients(76%) showed no organism, and 10(20%) did not have SCs. Six cases (12%) had hyponatremia ranging between 125-130meq/lit. In the control group, 4 (8%) had electrolyte imbalances, 3 had hyponatremia ranging between 125-130meq/lit, and 1 had hypokalemia.

Conclusion
No significant relation was found between inflammatory gastroenteritis and the incidence of convulsion (P value=0.0716) Although a significant relation was found between Shigella and convulsion (P value=0.0113), no significant relation existed between electrolyte imbalance and the incidence of convulsion ( P value=0.7389 ).

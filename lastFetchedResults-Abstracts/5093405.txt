Objective: To assess the bone protective effects and mechanism of Polygonatum Sibiricum Polysaccharide(PSP) in ovariectomized rat. Methods: 60 female SD rats were randomly separated into 6 groupsxontrol group (n=10); ovariectomized group (OVX) (n=10); the OVX + E<sub>2</sub> group(OVX + E<sub>2</sub>) (n=10); the high-dose OVX + PSP group (OVX + HZ) (n=10); the moderate-dose OVX + PSP group (OVX + MZ) (n=10); the low dose OVX + PSP group (OVX + LZ) (n=10). PSP was administered intragastrically to the rats. After 35 days, the total body Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed in the rats. All sections were processed for hematoxylin-eosin staining (H.E.) ,and Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), and Bone Gla protein (BGP) immunoreactivity was assessed. Serum tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;) and bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BAFP) levels were assessed using commercially available ELISA kits. Results: The expression of BMP and bFGF were significantly increased in OVX+HP. The expression of TRAP, TNF-&#945;, BGP and BAFP were significantly decreased in OVX+HP. BMD was significantly increased in OVX+HP (vs. OVX, P&lt;;0.05). Conclusion: The results of this experiment demonstrate that PSP can increase the expression of bFGF and BMP while reducing the expression of TRAP, BGP, TNF-&#945; and BAFP. The administration of PSP to ovariectomized rats reverses bone loss and prevents osteoporosis.

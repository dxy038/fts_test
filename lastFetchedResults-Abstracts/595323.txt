Objective: To assess the efficacy of surgical excision in clearing Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC).Material and Methods: Computer data of 100 patients with BCC was retrieved from our database from January 1996 to January 2000. These 100 cases were all exclusive of the drop-outs. Follow up notes were compared for marginal clearance on pathological report and recurrence noted. Subsequent procedure or radiation was recorded.Result: Out of these 100 patients, 45 were male patients and 55 female. Their ages ranged from 18 to 105 years with a mean of 56.3 year. Out of 100 patients, only 2(2%) specimens were reported as having margins involved with tumour and the same showed recurrence over a period of follow up. Five patients had had preoperative radiotherapy and thus had radiorecurrent lesion. A similar number had surgery elsewhere and presented to us with recurrenceConclusion: Surgery is a reliable mode of treatment for BCC provided pathologist can give an accurate assessment of marginal clearance.

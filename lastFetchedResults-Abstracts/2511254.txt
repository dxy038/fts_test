The task required participants to stand on a force platform. Subjects after participating in the pre-test practiced in three sessions and each session 15 attempts for the maintain balance on balancing machine and after 48 hours were participated in the retention test. ANOVA test results showed a significant difference between groups in of test. In addition, both the far external focus condition continued to demonstrate increases in balance performance. (P<0.05). The considering results this study, it is suggested to improve the balance skills in children with mental retardation, the used of instructions external focus attention far.

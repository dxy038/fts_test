The objective in designing a communications network is to find the most cost efficient network design that specifies hardware devices to be installed, the type of transmission links to be installed, and the routing strategy to be followed. In this paper algorithmic ideas are presented for improving tractability in solving the survivable network design problem by taking into account uncertainty in the traffic requirements. Strategies for improving separation of metric inequalities are presented and an iterative approach for obtaining solutions, that significantly reduces computing times, is introduced. Computational results are provided based on data collected from an operational network.

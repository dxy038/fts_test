In this paper a fuzzy control scheme for active suspension design has been considered. The objective of control is to improve the ride comfort and road holding ability under different road condition. A good suspension system should reduce the body (sprung mass) acceleration to improve the ride comfort. The performance of fuzzy logic controller active suspension is compared with optimal controller in several simulations.

Applying program comprehension techniques may render software maintenance and evolution easier. Understanding a software system typically requires a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners working in the area of program comprehension with an emphasis on dynamic analysis. We are interested in investigating how dynamic analysis techniques are used or can be used to enable better comprehension of a software system. The objective is to compare existing techniques, identify common case studies and possible symbioses for existing solutions. Building upon three previous editions of the workshop, we aim to set up a forum for exchanging experiences, discussing solutions, and exploring new ideas.

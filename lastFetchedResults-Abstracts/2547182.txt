Objective: The present study aimed to investigate the relationships between anxiety sensitivity (AS), irritability and intrusive thoughts (IT) and sleep problems in patients diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).
Methods: The study population consisted of all patients with GAD who referred to counseling and psychological centers in Isfahan, Iran, in 2015. A total of 49 patients were selected out of the whole population as the study samples using convenience sampling method. To collect data, a questionnaire covering demographic and clinical information, the anxiety sensitivity index-revised, the thought control questionnaire, the irritability scale, and the sleep problems questionnaire were used. Using the SPSS22 software, the collected data were analyzed by multiple regression analysis and Pearson correlation test.
Results: Results of multiple regression analysis showed &nbsp;that problems of sleep onset, sleep continuity, and waking up could be anticipated by anxiety sensitivity, irritability and intrusive thoughts in patients with GAD. Results of Pearson correlation test indicated significant relationships between AS and sleep problems related to sleep onset, sleep continuity and waking up; also between irritability and sleep onset problems; and finally between IT and sleep waking up problems (P < 0.05). However, no significant relationship was observed between irritability and sleep continuity and waking up problems or between IT and sleep onset and sleep continuity problems (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: According to the results, the anxiety sensitivity has more relationship to sleep onset, sleep continuity, and waking up problems in patients with GAD.

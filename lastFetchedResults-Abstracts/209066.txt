Objective: Research is design ed to determine spee ch respirator y
measure s in spastic cereb ral palsied children versus normal one s, to be
used as an applicable tool in speech therapy plans.
Materials & Methods: Via a comparati ve cross -s ec tional s tudy
(case - control), and through a directive goal oriented sampling in cas e
and convenience approach for controls; twenty spastic cerebral palsied .
and twenty control ones with age (5-12 years old) and sex (F=20 M=20)
were matched and identifi ed. All possible inclusion and exclu sion criteria
were considered by thorou gh past medical , clinical and para clinical such as
chest X-ray and Complete Blood Counts reviews to rule out any possible
pulmonary and/or systemic disorders. Their speech respirat ory indices were
determined by Respirometer (ST l-dysphonia), made and normalized by
Glasgow Univer sity. Obtained data were analyzed by independent T tes t.
Results: There were significant differences between cases and control
groups for "mean tidal volume", "phonatory volume" and "vital capacity"
at a=0/05 value s and these values in pati ents were less (34%) than normal
children (P<O/OOI ).
Conclusion: Mea sures obtained are highly crucial for speech therapi st in
any speec h therapy prim ary rehabilitative plans for spa ctic cerebral
palsied children

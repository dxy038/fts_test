Evolvement of medical education in the past decades has led to emerging of the new concept of “scholarship behaviours in teaching” (1). To evaluate scholarship projects six criteria (Glassick Criteria) have been proposed to make education provision more objective. They include providing clear goals, adequate preparation, appropriate methods, significant results, effective presentation, and reflective critique (2-4).

While this is considered to be a relatively new concept, there is historical evidence in which promoting scholarship behaviours has been promoted. Rich Persian literature reflects the Iranian ideas, customs, traditions and culture which are shaped by social values. These concepts have been expanded and flourished during the 7000 years history of civilisation in this country. Ferdowsi, the epic poet of Persia (940-2020 CE) (5), reflected on the criteria of scholarship behaviours in teaching. His standards are even deeper. He expressed these ideas clearly to be understandable even to the public. For example, he focuses on the capability of expansion of teaching materials and experience to others (6). 

از اين پس نميرم كه من ‌زنده‌ام              كه تخم سخن را پراكنده‌ام
I shall not die; I'll be alive afterwards, as I have spread the seeds of discourse!

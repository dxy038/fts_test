The evaluation of information system (IS) is a perennial decision problem for businesses as they seek to improve their performance and sustain a competitive advantage. The effective implementation of an IS essentially depends upon how effective individual, organizational, task-related, technological, and environmental factors are integrated to the organizational fabric. An important issue rarely addressed in the literature has been the evaluation of the project team during the implementation of IS. This paper demonstrates how the analytic network process (ANP) can be used as an approach to evaluating high-performing IS project teams with the objective of assessing their performance against a stated remit. Through establishing an environment where the performance of an IS project team is evaluated properly, an organization will be better positioned to assess each IS investment and improve the performance of the team through appropriate strategies.

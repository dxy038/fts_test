Fish embryos and hatchlings are exposed to pathogens long before maturation of their lymphoid organs. Little is known about defence mechanisms during the earliest stages of life, but innate mechanisms may be essential for survival. The complement system in fish is well developed and represents a major part of innate immunity. Complement factor 3 (C3) is central subsequent to activation of all pathways of the complement system, leading to inflammatory reactions, such as chemotaxis, opsonisation and lysis of pathogens. Hepatocytes represent the major source of C3, but modern molecular biological methods have confirmed that C3 is synthesised at multiple sites. Our main objective was to study the ontogeny of C3 in Atlantic salmon by mapping the commencement of synthesis and localisation of proteins. Eggs, embryos, hatchlings and adult fish were analysed for the presence of C3 mRNA and proteins. From immunohistochemical studies, C3 proteins were detected at several extrahepatic sites, such as the skeletal muscle, developing notochord and chondrocytes of the gill arch. Immunoblotting revealed presence of C3 proteins in the unfertilised egg, but C3 mRNA was only detected after fertilisation by real-time RT-PCR. Taken together, the results implicated the maternal transfer of C3 proteins as well as novel non-immunological functions during development.

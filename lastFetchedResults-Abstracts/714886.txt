 Flow-shop problems, as a typical manufacturing challenge, have become an interesting area of research. The primary concern is that the solution space is huge and, therefore, the set of feasible solutions cannot be enumerated one by one. In this paper, we present an efficient solution strategy based on a genetic algorithm (GA) to minimize the makespan, total waiting time and total tardiness in a flow shop consisting of n jobs and m machines. The primary objective is to minimize the job waiting time before performing the related operations. This is a major concern for some industries such as food and chemical for planning and production scheduling. In these industries, there is a probability of the decay and deterioration of the products prior to accomplishment of operations in workstation, due to the increase in the waiting time. We develop a model for a flowshop scheduling problem, which uses the planner-specified weights for handling a multi-objective optimization problem. These weights represent the priority of planning objectives given by managers. The results of the proposed GA and classic GA are analyzed by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method and the results are discussed.

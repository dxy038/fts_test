The objective of this paper is applying a technique that transform an operational system (OLTP) to a data warehouse conceptual model (OLAP). To do so, we survey several conversion techniques that were suggested, We choose the moody and Kortink technique according to well-defined criteria and we apply it to design a DSS (decision support system) which targets the administrative task of planning the universityÂ´s educational capacity. The application of the technique on our example points out the need of validating in practice. That will be our perspective in the future work.

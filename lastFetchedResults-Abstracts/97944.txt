Leisure is not a typical theme of analysis in Post Keynesian economics. The analysis of leisure, however, provides an opportunity to critique mainstream economic analysis as well as contributes toward our understanding of an important facet of modern economies. This paper provides an empirical contribution toward this objective by focusing upon leisure demand. As well as drawing upon early Post Keynesian and institutional and sociological analyses, the paper offers original empirical insights from the United Kingdom using a qualitative choice analysis.

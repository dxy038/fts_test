Although there are different classifications for dermatomycosis or fungal infection of skin and its appendages, in this study, we consider only superficial type (tinea versicolor) and cutaneous one (dermatophytosis) under the common title of superficial fungal infections (SFIs). Tinea versicolor commonly affects the outermost skin layer of the young and manifests as reddish-brown or light skin spots. Dermatophytosis can affect deeper layers of skin and hair into the epidermis at the scalp, feet, and groin area. It is caused by only three types of dermatophytes: Epidermophyton, Trichophyton, and Microsporum. Previous studies have already shown the high prevalence of SFIs in military personnel. This is due to the many predisposing factors for these infections in any military system such as poor hygiene, frequent use of gummed shoes, and massive sweating during military maneuvers. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the epidemiologic features of SFIs in Iran Army personnel. This research was a retrospective study from 2005 to 2011. Data were collected from the regional surveillance system of Iran Army and double checked in the Deputy of Health of AJA University of Medical Sciences. Analysis was performed using appropriate statistical functions by Stata Software. During these 7 years, 9707 cases of SFIs were reported. Sixty percent of them were diagnosed during the warm months of spring and summer. About 58% of the cases were reported from four provinces, including Hormozgan, Guilan, Semnan and Khorasan Razavi and finally about half of reports (48%) were from Naval Force. The overall trend of SFIs in recent years has been declining, but it is still a common problem of army personnel, especially in Naval Force and in warm and humid areas. Army health commanders must do their best to decrease the incidence by improving health knowledge and facilities, particularly in the most endemic areas.

Summary from only given. In order to achieve the resolution of a high-NA objective while retaining the field-of-view and the depth-of-focus and the working distance of a low-NA objective, we introduce the concept of imaging interferometric microscopy. We present experimental results of high-resolution images corresponding to /spl sim/3 times the resolution achieved with a low-NA microscope objective. The results are compared to a theoretical calculation.

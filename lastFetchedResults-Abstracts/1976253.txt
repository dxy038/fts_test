The objective of the study was to determine the effect of fatty acid additions to the cells and enzyme extract of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (CCRC14009) on CLA production. Washed cells of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, obtained by cultivation in a MRS broth, were mixed with BSA and each of the three fatty acids: linoleic, oleic, and linolenic acids in sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5. After incubation at 37 °C for 108 h, CLA concentration was analyzed by HPLC. Enzyme extract from the culture was also reacted with each fatty acid at 50 °C for 10 min at pH 5 to test for CLA production. Results showed that linoleic acid addition to the culture improved CLA production, indicating the presence of linoleic acid isomerase activity in the culture. The crude enzyme extract from the culture was observed to be capable of oleic and linolenic acid conversions into CLA, demonstrating the possible presence of desaturase activity in the enzyme extract.

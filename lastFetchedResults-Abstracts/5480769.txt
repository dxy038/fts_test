HIS image fusion model has been widely used in the fusion of multi-spectral image with low spatial resolution and panchromatic image with high spatial resolution. In this paper, a new fusion algorithm is proposed by considering some existing problems in certain algorithms using HIS model, such as spectral distortion and sensitivity to noise. The proposed algorithm adopts gradient pyramid structure and determines fusion rule according to local information entropy and its distribution. Subjective qualitative evaluation and objective quantitative analysis of experiment results prove that this new algorithm can fuse spatial characteristics effectively and introduce less spectral distortion. And it also outperforms some classical algorithms in immunity to the noise in panchromatic image

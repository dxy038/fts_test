It is well known that the primary objective of a world wide business organization is to find a way to improve the delivery of services and facilities for business interactions. Advancements in information and communication technologies especially in the field of networking can be utilized to enhance the co-ordination and enforcement policies of such organizations. The information needed by an organization agency usually involves collecting information that has been captured or owned by other cooperating agencies which are usually situated in geographically separate locations. Sharing of such information typically involves manual requests which could at times be slow and may be subjected to other administrative procedures. With the use of distributed file technologies supported by sound information sharing policies, disparate information from a myriad of geographically separate organization resources could be collected and distributed as if the information is residing on the requestorÂ´s own repository. This paper suggests a framework for file distribution in an environment where files from different geographically separate resources can be shared by the cooperating agencies. The proposed algorithm performs replication on several servers, and updates the servers when data manipulation occurs. In addition, the algorithm can reduce the transfer time for huge files significantly by using Wrapper RSYNC between two replica servers. The experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm reduces the overall file transfer time up to 55% and improves the fault tolerance by 20%.

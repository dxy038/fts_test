In this paper, the optimal cognitive network reconfiguration problem is considered in the presence of jamming interference and delayed signals in a game play scenario. In most previous literature, only one jammer is investigated. However, in practical applications, multiple jammers occur frequently. Moreover, the delay of signals cannot be neglected in the context of network communication, which may result in an unstable system. Therefore, we formulate the optimization problem for network reconfiguration with multiple jammerÂ´s interference and delayed signals. To solve the optimization problem numerically, two types of swarm optimization algorithms are proposed. In the first approach, the dynamic objective method is used via bilevel programming while in the second approach, a hybrid multiagent swarm optimization algorithm is applied. Some illustration results are also provided in the paper.

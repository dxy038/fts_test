This paper investigates the tradeoff problem between power efficiency and nonlinear distortion of amplifiers in OFDM systems. One power efficiency figure-of-merit of the whole system is suggested and used as the objective function to find the optimum working point of the power amplifier. An accurate computation of the nonlinear distortion power is also derived. The simulation results showed that the operating point of PA that provides the optimal trade-off can be easily picked from the proposed method

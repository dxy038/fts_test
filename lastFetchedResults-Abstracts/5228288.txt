Genetic algorithms (GAs) are a class of optimization algorithms. GAs attempt to solve problems through modeling a simplified version of genetic processes. There are many problems for which a Genetic Algorithm approach is useful. It is, however, undetermined if cryptanalysis is such a problem. Therefore, this work trying to explore the use of Genetic Algorithms in cryptography. The focus is to be on substitution cipher. The principles used in this cipher form the foundation for many of the modern cryptosystems. The frequency analysis is used as an essential factor in objective function.

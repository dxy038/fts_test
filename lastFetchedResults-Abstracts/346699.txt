Objective: Intracranial EEG recordings from patients suffering from medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy were analyzed with the aim of characterizing the dynamics of EEG epochs recorded before and during a seizure and comparing the classification of the EEG epochs on the basis of visual inspection to the results of the numerical analysis.
Methods: The stationarity of the selected EEGs was assessed qualitatively. The coarse-grained correlation dimension and coarse-grained correlation entropy were used for the non-linear characterization of the EEG epochs.
Results: High-pass filtering was necessary in order to make the majority of the epochs appear stationarity beyond a time scale of about 2 s. It was found that the dimension of the ictal EEGs decreased with respect to the epochs containing ongoing (interictal) activity. The entropy of the ictal recordings however increased. A scaling of the entropy was applied and it was found that the scaled entropy of the ictal EEG decreased, consistent with the increased regularity of the ictal EEG. The coarse-grained quantities discriminated well between EEG epochs recorded prior to and during seizures at locations displaying ictal activity and classification improved by including the linear autocorrelation time in the analysis.
Conclusions: It is concluded that ictal and non-ictal EEG can be well distinguished on the basis of non-linear analysis. The results are in good agreement with the visual analysis.

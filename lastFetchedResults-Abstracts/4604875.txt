In order to implement the function of collision resolution correctly in the condition of relatively complex nature of the confliction and the flight density, a collision resolution algorithm based on ADS-B and genetic algorithm is introduced in the condition of free flight. Firstly, the algorithm encoding the position of aircraft track points in the conflict sector, using GA to optimize the objective function in the route planning, guiding and realizing the plans and choices for the 2D track of aircraft. Then, planning the no conflict flight paths for each aircraft combined with TCP+1 report from the ADS-B information, to achieve the collision resolution between aircrafts. Take 3 aircrafts which in flight conflict at same time for example, the simulation shows that the GA can search the optimal solution for the no conflict path after 30 generations calculation, and demonstrates the algorithm can provide an ideal program of conflict resolution for each aircraft in a short period of time.

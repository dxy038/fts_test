The objective of this work is to develop a complete inertial measurement unit using sensors and components easy to find in actual market, such as FPGAs, and implement it as a system-on-a-chip. The sensors that are used are gyroscopes and accelerometers, and the FPGA is a system core where the system-on-a-chip is implemented including VHDL drivers to control sensors set, store information in a memory and analyze all captured data. The SoC includes a complete communication system based on an Avalon bus to connect drivers with memory, to a Nios processor and other peripherals communication channels

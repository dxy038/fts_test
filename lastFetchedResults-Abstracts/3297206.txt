Novel circular polarization (CP) design of planar broadband antenna with square slot for UHF RFID system is proposed and experimentally studied. By insetting the arc-shaped strip into the square slot, the proposed CP design can easily be achieved with the impedance bandwidth (RL -10 dB) of about 142 MHz (15.3% @ 931 MHz) and the 3 dB axial-ratio (AR) bandwidth of about 166 MHz (17.7 % @ 940 MHz) for UHF RFID applications. The measured peak gain and radiation efficiency are about 6.8 dBic and 98% across the operating band, respectively, with nearly bidirectional pattern in the XZ- and YZ-plane.

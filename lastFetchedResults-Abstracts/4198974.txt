Summary form only given. Based on the feasible polygon design concept of linear motors, a disc-type surface-mounted permanent magnet (DSPM) motor has been constructed and investigated for its industrial and automotive applicability. A detailed mathematical modeling process, which covers the space harmonics of machine magnetomotive forces, has been developed. Along with adequate field-oriented control scheme implementation, the rotational and axial forces can be controlled simultaneously. Satisfactory results are provided to verify the suitability of the design objective.

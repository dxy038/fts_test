The parametric resonance of functionally graded rectangular plates under harmonic in-plane loading is presented. The objective here is to study the influence of the constituent volume fractions and the effects of configurations of the constituent materials on the parametric instability regions, in particular the positions and sizes of these regions. The material properties are graded in the thickness direction according to a material volume fraction power law distribution. The present problem is formulated based on Hamilton’s principle and the assumed mode method. Bolotin’s method is used here to determine the instability regions.

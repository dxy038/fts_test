The current status and the future trends of thin-film-transistor (TFT) integrated circuits are discussed following a review of their features. TFT devices have been applied to liquid-crystal displays and linear image sensors, both of which incorporate internally integrated driver circuits. From the viewpoint of TFT advantages, the low-temperature (&lt;600 degrees C) fabrication of TFT circuits is essential to their future progress. The main objective is to realize sufficient electrical characteristics of TFT devices below 600 degrees C, using methods such as MOS interface control, crystalline grain growth, and trap passivation at grain boundaries. This will make it possible to apply TFT circuits not only to much larger substrates but also to concepts such as three-dimensional LSIs.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

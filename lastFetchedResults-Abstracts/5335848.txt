The paper presents a new coupler design approach which enables carrier frequencies in the vicinity of 15 MHz to be transmitted through domestic as well as distribution power networks. Results from laboratory prototype under simulated loading shows that the circuit is able to facilitate bidirectional bandpass transmission

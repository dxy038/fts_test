Cephalexin is a constituent of the cephalosporin group used for the treatment of bronchitis and other heart diseases due to its enhanced oral activity. The effluent from these industries contains a disintegrated form of the drug contributing high chemical oxygen demand (COD), volatile solids and organic solvent. A laboratory-scale study was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of a fluidized bed reactor operated under anaerobic condition with bioaugmentation to treat the cephalexin containing pharmaceutical factory effluent. The main objective of the study was to show that bioaugmentation could be used to promote biological treatment to applications where conventional operation might be difficult or unfavourable. The effluent, with COD of 12,000–15,000 mg/l, was diluted and studied in single and multiple inoculation experiments with hydraulic retention times of 3–12 h. The removal efficiency after inoculation from an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor was related to influent concentration, mass of inoculum and hydraulic retention time characterized by calculating the initial food to microorganism ratio. Continuous COD removal efficiency attained a maximum value of 88.5% using bioaugmentation through periodic addition of acclimated cells every 2 days with 30–73.2 g of cells from an off-line enricher-reactor.

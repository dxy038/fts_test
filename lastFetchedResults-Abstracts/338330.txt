Objective
The Ikaros gene has been implicated in lymphoid development and proliferation from the results of gene targeting studies in mice. Recently we reported that the Ikaros gene may be involved in the disease progression of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In this report, we investigated Ikaros isoforms in human non-lymphoid leukemia cell lines and normal granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) and erythroid (BFU-E)-derived colonies.
Materials and Methods

We evaluated Ikaros gene expression by RT-PCR, Southern blotting, sequencing analysis, Northern blotting, and immunoblotting.
Results

Ikaros isoforms Ik-1 and Ik-2,3 were predominantly expressed in human non-lymphoid leukemia cell lines. Ik-4 and Ik-8 were also detectable as a minor population. In contrast to the previous report in mice, multiple Ikaros isoforms were expressed in human CFU-GM and BFU-Eâ€“derived colonies, and the dominant-negative isoform Ik-6 was not detectable. We also showed that human Ikaros isoforms contained an additional coding sequence in the N-terminal region, which was highly homologous to the sequence reported in mice.
Conclusion

These observations suggest that the Ikaros gene may play some role in the development of human non-lymphoid lineage hematopoiesis. Moreover, the finding that the dominant-negative isoform Ik-6, which was overexpressed in patients with blast crisis of CML, was rarely detectable in non-lymphoid lineages supports its pathogenetic role in human hematologic malignancies.

Attainment of a sustainable and self-replenishing source of energy is one of the primary aims of mankind. In this light a lot of researches are being performed on various energy sources. The objective of this work is to simulate a fluidized bed air-steam gasification using thermodynamic equilibrium model with rubber seed shell as the feedstock. A thermodynamic equilibrium model considering char conversion and tar formation is developed using MATLAB software to predict the composition and heating value of product gas. The prediction capability of the model is enhanced by multiplying the equilibrium constants with suitable coefficients. The optimum values for equivalence ratio, steam to biomass ratio, and temperature for maximum hydrogen generation of 33.15% and maximum efficiency of 55.97% are found to be 0.15, 4, 1500 K and 0.15, 0, 1200 K, respectively.

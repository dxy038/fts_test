The promosion of Iran to the first economic rank among South East Asian
nations through implementation and materialization of 2026 visionary program is
achievable only if fundamental changes in economic planning and economic
effectiveness take place. The relation between the economic developments
planning and economic gap in Iran is the subject of analysis in this paper. To
explore this issue, economic development after Islamic Revolution was first briefly
assessed and then the structural gap in developing nations and also the effects of
economic development in Iran was studied. To achieve this objective, Loonâ€™s
theory was employed and effort was made to explain the disequilibrium indicators.
One of the disequilibrium indicators is the income gap which is calculated by Gini
Coefficient. It is also tried to assess the economic development trend in Iran based
on factors such as expected values, government effectiveness and Iranian economic
rank among nations.

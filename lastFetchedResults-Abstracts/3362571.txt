A frequently discussed phenomenon within the context of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is range anxiety. Range anxiety is defined as a domain-specific form of psychological stress, which can occur in a critical range situation. The objective of the present study is to better understand user experience in critical range situations (i.e. range anxiety). After driving a BEV in a critical range situation on an unaccompanied trip of 94 km length, 68 participants were asked about experienced stress-inducing and stress-reducing factors, as well as ideas for additional stress-reducing strategies. The available range safety buffer and the uncertainty regarding the energy consumption of the BEV could be identified as central factors related to user experience in critical range situations. The obtained results can be utilised to formulate design recommendations to help future BEV users to better handle critical range situations. Installing displays which allow for accurate tracking of the range safety buffer or providing knowledge to reduce uncertainty might be a good starting point for improving user experience.

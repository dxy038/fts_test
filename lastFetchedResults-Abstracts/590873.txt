Introduction & Objective: Mechanisms underlying migraine precipitation are largely unknown. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has recently been associated with various extraintes-tinal pathologies and migraine. The relation between Helicobacter pylori and Migraine is controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of the H. pylori infec-tion with migraine.
Materials & Methods: In a case-control study, a total  of 80 patients with migraine with aura and without aura who came to neurology clinic of ّFarshchian hospital affiliated with Hamedan Medical University were enrolled in the study and compared with a group of 80 controls. The patients with the history of anti h. pylori medication, chronic inflammatory dis-eases and malignancy were excluded. Helicobacter pylori infection was diagnosed by ELISA test for IgG. The diagnosis and classification of migraine were made according to the Inter-national Headache Society (IHS) criteria. The serum level of IgG was compared in each group by student t test.
Results: The mean age in migraine and control groups were 27.26±8.99 and 29.04±9.75 years respectively. The serum level of anti-Helicobacter pylori IgG were 39.75±45.09 and 24.93±27.88 Uarb/ml in migraine and control groups respectively (P=0.013). The mean of IgG based on the demographic data were not different in both group (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: This study demonstrated a higher level of anti-Helicobacter pylori IgG in patients with migraine.

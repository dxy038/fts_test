Background: Auto antibodies to zona-pellucida (AZA) seem to be important autoantibodies
implicated in reproduction, with substantial role in both endocrine and reproductive functions of the
human ovary. There are some debates on the relation of AZA with infertility, repeated In Vitro
Fertilization (IVF) attempts, and outcome of it.
Objective: In this study, we assessed the presence of AZA in the follicular fluids (FFs) of women
who underwent intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), in relation to etiology of infertility and
multiple puncture of ovaries.
Materials and Methods: In this prospective study, follicular fluids were evaluated from 96 infertile
women, (19-40 years old, 31.5Â±5.1), who were candidates for ICSI based on the etiology of
infertility. From these 80 women had explained infertility whereas 16 had unexplained infertility.
All FFs were evaluated for presence of AZA by ELISA test.
Results: Twenty patients (20.8%) were positive for AZA in follicular fluid. In patients with
unexplained infertility, AZA antibody in follicular fluid, was significantly higher than the group
with proven etiology of infertility (p=0.001). In addition, 20.4 % of patients who had been
punctured previously showed AZA in their FFs which is statistically similar to the patients who
were punctured for the first time.
Conclusions: The high incidence of AZA in infertile women, especially women with unexplained
infertility has to be considered. Relation of the presence AZA and repeated puncture of ovaries is
still debatable. Determinations of AZA are highly recommended in evaluation of infertile couples
especially in patient with unexplained infertility.

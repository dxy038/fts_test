The objective of this study is to propose a simple methodological approach, based on the Limits of Acceptable Change process, to support the formulation of management measures for recreational boating in bays. Management measures have been determined using statistical and geospatial analyses of data of biophysical characteristics, use, and user perceptions in a bay on the island of Mallorca. The results suggest that the optimal use level of the study site is being surpassed and a range of potential management options is provided. This methodology is applicable to additional management scenarios where balancing social and environmental needs is necessary and should be implemented as part of a broader Integrated Coastal Zone Management framework.

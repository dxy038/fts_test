Objective: To determine the rate of complications associated with tracheostomy and to study it in relation with age, type of tracheostomy (emergency: elective) and type of tracheostomy tube (metallic: portex).Material and Methods: 50 patients, aged 4-80 years undergoing tracheostomy in a tertiary care hospital and fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria, were selected. It included both elective and emergency tracheostomy. Open surgical technique was adopted. Metallic or portex tube was used. A preformed Performa was used to document any complication occurring per operatively or post operatively.Results: Our study included 28 males and 22 females. Age range was 4-80 years with mean age of 39.2 years (SD Â± 23.05). Elective tracheostomy was done in 72% and emergency tracheostomy in 28%. Metallic tube was used in 74% and portex tube in 26% patients. Total complication rate of 56%was recorded. These were 32% immediate, 14% intermediate and 10% late complications. Complication rate was higher in children. Infection (12%) was the commonest complication followed by emphysema, dysphagia, aspiration (6% each). Forty four percent complications occurred in emergency and 22% in elective tracheostomy. Portex tube was associated with 32% and metallic tube with 24% complications.Conclusion: Complication rate is much higher in emergency tracheostomy and in children than older age groups. Portex tube was also associated with higher rate as compared to metallic tube.

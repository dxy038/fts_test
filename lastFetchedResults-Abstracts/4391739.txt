In Romania, the LTE infrastructure is currently in development. This paper provides an objective QoS and QoE evaluation of the VoIP performances in an LTE cell deployed in a 3D-modeled urban area. The simulation results provide useful insights for the operators regarding an efficient LTE network planning considering the characteristics of the area, the number of users per cell and the VoIP performance requirements.

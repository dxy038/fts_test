System of systems (SoS) is quite a new approach in the practical field that is on the verge of transcending the boundaries of the defense system and ready to be applied in the industrial sector. This paper attempts to answer the important question of whether a production system falls under the scope of SoS by using a general framework proposed by the system theory. This also unearths the need to radicalize lean manufacturing with state-of-the-art tools. In order to achieve this objective, we design and elaborate a new management framework for an SoS lean or smart lean system by applying the SoS approach to lean manufacturing.

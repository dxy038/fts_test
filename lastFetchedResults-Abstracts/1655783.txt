Currently, guidelines for safely using shipping containers for building applications do not exist. The shipping container’s structural integrity, modification properties, foundation limits, building code regulations, and reinforcing limits are mostly unknown. As a result, this research begins the investigation of shipping containers’ structural limitations thus aiding the development of container building construction and design requirements. The main research objective is to develop structural guidelines for International Organization for Standardization (ISO) shipping containers used for non-shipping applications. This paper provides insight into the ISO shipping container’s structural strength which is further investigated using finite element computer modeling. The finite element analysis shows how both modified and unmodified container models respond under given loading scenarios. The loading scenarios incorporate the effect of gravity and lateral loading, and the computer simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the container walls and roof to resist the loads. Structural engineering considerations, foundations, and connections for shipping containers used in building applications are presented.

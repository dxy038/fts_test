This paper proposes the maximum thrust design of slotted permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) using equivalent magnetizing current method (EMCM) considering slot effect. The genetic algorithm is used for optimization. The objective functions are selected for the maximum thrust and the minimum detent force. In this paper, design parameters are set as permanent magnet (PM) width, PM height, and slot width. Thrust is increased from 272[N] to 295[N] and detent force is decreased from 5[N] to 2.43[N] greatly in optimum design. Therefore, most thrust ripple has not been generated. Also, the results of 2D EMCM considering slot effect are compared with ones of experimental and finite element analysis

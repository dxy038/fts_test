A novel approach to the bidirectional beam propagation method, which can treat multiple dielectric interfaces, is developed and implemented using iterative methods. Comparisons with two previously published results demonstrate its accuracy, as well as its efficiency in computation time and memory. Finally, its capability in simulating and designing complex structures is also demonstrated via a three-channel add-drop multiplexer.

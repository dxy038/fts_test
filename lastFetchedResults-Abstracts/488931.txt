Background: Oral manifestations of HIV infection are common and include oral lesions and novel presentations of previously known opportunistic diseases. Some risk factors are significantly contributed to probability of developing opportunistic infection of oral candidiasis. We have performed the current survey to evaluate their role in Iranian patients with HIV infection. Materials and methods: Totally, 377 documented HIV infected patients were included. Oral candidiasis was investigated with clinical observation, direct smear, and culture. Meanwhile, CD4 count was determined at the first visit and following antiretroviral therapy.
Results: The study population included 316 males and 60 females with a mean age of 36.5Â±8.7 years. Patients were diagnosed for a mean duration of 2.9 years. The most common route of infection transmission was shared needles (117 cases or 31%). In serologic tests, 11 cases (2.9%) were positive for HBsAg, 206 cases (71.5%) for HCV nucleic acid and 53 cases (14.1%) for tuberculosis infection. At the first visit 52 cases (13.9%) and following HAART 31 cases (8.2%) were revealed to have oral candidiasis. Mean CD4 count in patients with oral candidiasis was significantly less than other patients (193.8 vs. 349.7 cells, P=0.0001); however, the difference was not significant at follow up. Conclusion: Prompt diagnosis and treatment of HIV infection may have a significant role in prognosis and clinical course of patients with HIV infection and could decrease the rate of opportunistic infections.

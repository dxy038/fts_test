Remotely sensed estimates of the foliar biochemical content of vegetation canopies could be used to derive indicators of ecosystem functioning at regional to global scales. In the past decade, a number of studies have reported strong correlations between the reflectance spectra of vegetation canopies and their foliar biochemical content. However, these studies have commonly employed multiple regression techniques or spectral indices to determine biochemical content, which have been found to be highly sensitive to variation in canopy architecture [such as leaf area index (LAI) and canopy closure] and understory. To date, these effects combined with the low signal-to-noise ratios of airborne spectrometers have inhibited the development of robust and portable spectral techniques for the estimation of canopy biochemical content. This paper reports on a theoretical study in which a leaf model, LIBERTY (leaf incorporating biochemicals exhibiting reflectance and transmittance yields), characterized specifically for conifer needles, was coupled with a hybrid geometric/radiative transfer bidirectional reflectance distribution function FLIGHT (forest light) model. By varying leaf biochemical content, LAI, canopy closure and understory, we analyzed the simulated canopy reflectance spectra to determine if the biochemical absorption features in leaf spectra were preserved at the canopy scale. Absorption features or wavelength regions that were both related to a specific biochemical of interest (water, lignin-cellulose) and persistent at the scale of both the leaf and the canopy were identified at a number of wavelengths or wavelength regions.

We will discuss in this paper predictive current control strategies for power electronic circuits with natural commutations, for voltage source - and current source - inverters. Due to the different behavior of these circuits we have to realize different strategies, but the general objective is to achieve the best dynamic behavior of the current control loop, independent of whether the current is continuous or discontinuous. This paper describes the state of the art at the end of the eighties for comparison of todays state of the development.

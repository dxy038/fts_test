This paper proposes an ITS system that uses not only integrated cellular and ad hoc relaying technologies, but also usersÂ´ mobility profiles. It focuses on a subsystem where cellular bandwidth is used mostly for control signals, and an ad hoc distribution network (ADN) is used for file downloading and video streaming. The paper formulates an optimization problem with the objective being to maximize the amount of data to be delivered to a moving vehicles via the ADN, and thereby minimizing the usage of the costly cellular bandwidth for data transfer. Three approaches based on non-linear and linear programs are described and compared, and simulation results indicate that a satisfying performance for file download applications can be achieved.

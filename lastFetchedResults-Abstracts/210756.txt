OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of ultrasound and CT scan in the management of patients with blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) and to assess the diagnostic efficacy of ultrasonography in these patients.
MATERIAL & METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in the Department of Diagnostic Radiology LUMHS, Jamshoro - Pakistan from July 2006 to June 2008. Ultrasonography was performed in 1000 patients with blunt abdominal trauma to detect the free fluid in peritoneum (haemoperitoneum) and visceral injuries. Sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography were calculated by comparing the results with findings from computed tomography (CT) scan, diagnostic peritoneal levage and laparotomy.
RESULTS: Out of 75 males and 25 females 60% had history of assault and 40 patients came with the history of road traffic accident. Ultrasonography was found to be 96.97% sensitive and 100% specific in detecting haemoperitoneum whereas it was 82.47% sensitive and 100% specific in diagnosing visceral injuries. Twenty-nine patients underwent laparotomy while the rest of the patients were managed conservatively.
CONCLUSION: The ultrasound and CT scan play important role in making appropriate decision to select management option for patients with blunt abdomen trauma (BAT) and can reduce negative laparotomy rate.

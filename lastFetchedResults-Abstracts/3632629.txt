The objective of the paper is to present a general mathematical formulation for matching electromechanical loads connected to a photovoltaic array. An optimization method is then used to solve the matching problem with the objective of maximizing the gross mechanical energy. The analysis is extended to obtain the sizing of the array and the battery in the direct-coupled system. Results show that optimum matching can be achieved by carefully selecting the PV array rated parameters with respect to the load parameters. The rated power of the array is twice that of the load. The field constant that maximizes the gross mechanical energy can be obtained given the parameters of the load and the array temperature. The separately excited motor offers higher matching performance compared to the series motor. The rotodynamic load offers better matching compared to the viscous friction load

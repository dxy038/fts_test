Recently, multi-phase bidirectional dc-dc converters are widely used in the field of power electronics such as renewable energy systems, hybrid electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles because they have many advantages over singlephase counterparts. The advantages are reduced output current ripple and conduction loss in both switching devices and passive elements. Although output current ripple is reduced significantly due to interleaving effect but the inductor current ripple is not reduced. One of the solutions to this problem is to use coupled inductor. Bidirectional dc-dc converter is able to achieve high efficiency by using negative inductor current for zero-voltage switching. In this paper, two-phase bidirectional dc-dc converter is analyzed and designed for zero-voltage switching by using negative inductor current, which results in less switching loss. Also, a coupled inductor is analyzed and designed for the proposed two-phase soft switching bidirectional dc-dc converter.

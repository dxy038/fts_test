The Bamei gilt is a Chinese native breed located in northwest China, which adapts to the extremely dry and cold environment and is distinguished for its excellent reproductive and maternal characters. To ensure sufficient numbers of embryos for transgenic and nuclear transfer research, hormonal induction of gilt estrus and superovulation may be necessary. The objective of this study was to compare the superovulation effects of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG, Group A) and FSH (Groups Bâ€“D) in Chinese Bamei gilts. The results show that though eCG could produce more corpora lutea (CL, 14.3) than the control (CL, 9.2), and the FSH treatments had significantly increased the number of CL compared with the eCG treatment. Within the different FSH protocols, the numbers of CL were significantly greater in Groups B (CL, 77.8) and C (CL, 66.8) than in Group D (CL, 42.7), however, ovarian cysts were observed in Groups B and C, but not in Group D. These data suggest that Group D (280 IU FSH) is a suitable protocol to facilitate the development of ovarian follicles and increase the number of useful embryos per gilt for embryos recovery. The optimal FSH protocol of superovulation in Bamei gilts appears to be: D13/100 IU, D14/80 IU, D15/60 IU, D16/40 IU plus prostaglandin (PG) 0.2 mg, D17/hCG 1000 IU.

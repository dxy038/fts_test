Binaural hearing aids use microphone signals from both left and right hearing aid to generate an output signal for each ear. The microphone signals can be processed by a procedure based on speech distortion weighted multichannel Wiener filtering (SDW-MWF) to achieve significant noise reduction in a speech + noise scenario. In binaural procedures, it is also desirable to preserve binaural cues, in particular the interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD), which are used to localize sounds. It has been shown in previous work that the binaural SDW-MWF procedure only preserves these binaural cues for the desired speech source, but distorts the noise binaural cues. Two extensions of the binaural SDW-MWF have therefore been proposed to improve the binaural cue preservation, namely the MWF with partial noise estimation (MWF-eta) and MWF with interaural transfer function extension (MWF-ITF). In this paper, the binaural cue preservation of these extensions is analyzed theoretically and tested based on objective performance measures. Both extensions are able to preserve binaural cues for the speech and noise sources, while still achieving significant noise reduction performance.

A model for an impulse radiating antenna (IRA) has been developed in WIPL-D. A scene using a bistatic pair of these IRAs is modeled with a sphere target and is simulated in the frequency domain. The input to the antenna is a Gaussian pulse, and the current on the receive antenna is plotted vs. frequency. This receiver response is proportional to the scattered field from the sphere. The frequency domain data are processed to give the time domain response. The objective of this work is to deconvolve the signature of the scatterer from the receiver transient response. Additional separate simulations for each scene component and electromagnetic interaction were needed and were performed using WIPL-D. The process is successful for this scene, which does not include a ground plane. The analysis of the simulated data and deconvolution of the target signature are done in Matlab.

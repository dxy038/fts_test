Large-scale, highly-concentrated wind power integrated into grids through long transmission lines will bring significant challenges to power system operation during steady-state and dynamic processes. Tremendous research has been conducted in this critical area. However, few, if any available testing systems have been established to meet the requirements of the research on different time-scales. The objective of this paper is to identify the functionality requirements of the testing systems for the comprehensive studies, which covers different time-scale problems of power systems. For this purpose, the realistic Gansu power grids in China and wind farms in Jiuquan area are selected. As a typical power grid with large-scale highly-concentrated wind power integration by long-distance transmissions, the characteristics of the selected wind farms and power grid are discussed first. Two simplified systems are constructed associated with the major characteristics. The critical functionality requirements of the testing systems for different research purposes, i.e., system planning, operation, control, and protection, are identified. As the first step, this paper scopes the key requirements and, ultimately, a complete testing system is expected.

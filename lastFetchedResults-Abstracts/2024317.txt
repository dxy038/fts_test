Background and objective: Reluctance of dentists to treat HIV/AIDS patients
represents a major concern.The present study was aimed to determine predictive
factors of intention of dentists for providing dental care to HIV/AIDS-infected
patients based on Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) constructs.
Methods: In this descriptive-analytical study, 80 dentists in the city of Shahriar,
near Tehran, were selected through census .A scale based on PMT constructs
was developed and validated through qualitative content analysis by a panel of
experts and its reliability by Alpha Cronbach. Data was analyzed using SPSS16
and tests such as Pearson correlation, one-way ANOVA, independent-samples t
tests and multiple linear regression using the stepwise method.
Results: The mean age of participants was 38.21 (7.57±) years old; 31 (38.8%) of
the participants were women. Participants had an average of 117.98 (71.83 ±)
months of working experience. Among PMT constructs, self-efficacy could predict
54% variance of intention among the subjects (R2= 0.54, F= 24.28, p <  0.001)
Conclusion: For increasing the intention of dentists willing to provide dental
care to HIV/AIDS-infected patients should be focused on developing interventions
aimed at to increase their self-efficacy.

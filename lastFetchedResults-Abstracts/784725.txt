Objective: To identify Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) severity measures for use in cost-effectiveness
models that effectively capture the impact of AD on costs. Methods: A review of the literature and data
abstraction from papers that present 1) mean AD costs (direct, indirect, or total) by disease severity, defined
using measure of cognition, functional status, and behavior; and/or 2) the results of regression analyses that
estimate the strength of the association between AD costs and disease severity. Results: All papers reviewed
showed that mean total costs increase with disease severity regardless of severity-measurement method. The
relative difference in mean total costs between patients with severe disease compared to those with moderate
disease, or moderate disease compared to mild disease, was fairly consistent across studies, suggesting that any of
the disease-severity measures may be used to broadly categorize patients by cost. However, when regression
analysis included multiple disease-severity measures, independent associations with costs were noted for the
different measures. Cognitive and functional status measures were consistently associated with direct costs,
whereas functional status and behavioral measures were consistently associated with indirect costs and caregiver
hours. Conclusions: Either multidimensional disease-severity measures, or a single disease-severity measure, that
capture the impact of cognition, functional status, and behavior on costs are needed for cost-effectiveness models

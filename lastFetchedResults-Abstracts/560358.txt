Objective: Rosa damascena mill L (R. damascena) is a medicinal plant mostly known in the world for its perfume. It also has beneficial effects on stress, tension and depression. In this experiment antidepressant effect of ethanolic extract of R. damascena by forced swimming test (FST) was evaluated. 
Material and Methods: Animals received ethanolic extract (15, 60 and 90 mg/kg, i.p), imipramine (15mg/kg, i.p; positive control), or saline (negative control). Thirty min post- injection, immobility and swimming times were measured and compared in the different studied groups. 
Results: Intraperitoneal injection of lower concentration of extract (15 mg/kg) did not change swimming and immobility times compared to the control group. The higher concentrations of extract (60 and 90 mg/kg) significantly increased immobility time and decreased swimming time. Therefore ethanolic extract at tested doses had no antidepressant effect in this study.
Conclusion: Although ethanolic extract did not have antidepressant effect, we cannot rule out this effect altogether. In our opinion, antidepressant effect is masked by CNS depression effect of ethanolic extract of R. damascena.

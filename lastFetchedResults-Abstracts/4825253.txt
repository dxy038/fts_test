The objective of this paper is to present a sensorless position estimation technique for switched reluctance machines (SRM) operating in constant dynamic mode over a wide speed range including zero speed. The technique combines two different methods to deliver high resolution position information over the wide speed range. At zero and low speeds, a voltage pulse injection method is used to estimate the rotor position in all four quadrants. For higher speeds, a sliding mode observer (SMO) based algorithm is used and combined to work with the low speed algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this new combined technique that has four-quadrant operation capability.

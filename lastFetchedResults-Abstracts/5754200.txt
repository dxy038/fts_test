A hybrid solid-state ballast is described that operates the HPS (high pressure sodium) lamp at mains frequency with constant power through rated life. The system utilizes two series-connected inductors and a bidirectional semiconductor switch connected in parallel to one of them. A lamp starting circuit has also been included in the ballast. The static switch, with phase angle control provided by power feedback, actuates on lamp current compensating variations of the mains voltage and/or the increase of lamp voltage. The system offers: a) an increase of lamp life and system lumen maintenance; b) power factor and total harmonic distortion of line current comparable to conventional lag ballasts; and c) operating cost savings, both in terms of energy cost and lamp replacement cost

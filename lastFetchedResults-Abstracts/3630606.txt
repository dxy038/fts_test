Buried-crescent 1.3 &#956;m InGaAsP/InP lasers are used as emitters under forward bias and as detectors under reverse bias in an optical transmission experiment over a 7.5 km single-mode fibre. The dual use of the diodes greatly simplifies the design and operation of time-shared bidirectional half-duplex single-mode-fibre links.

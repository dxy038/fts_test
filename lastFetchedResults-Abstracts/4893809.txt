This paper proposes a simple methodology for placing two principal types of DG units - synchronous machine and induction machine with an objective of enhancing loadability of distribution system. The proposed methodology is based on the concept of reactive power margin. Buses have been ranked based on the reactive power margin and grouped as &#8220;strong&#8221; and &#8220;weak&#8221; buses for finding suitable location of DG units. The effect of size of DG unit on loadability is also examined along with grid loss measure which leads to suitable size selection. The proposed methodology is successfully applied to a modified 16 bus primary distribution system using a commercially available analytical tool and the results are verified using a research analytical software tool.

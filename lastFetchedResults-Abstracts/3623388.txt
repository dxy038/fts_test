An algorithm for optimal shape design of the coil of an electromagnetic flowmeter is presented. Using the finite-element approach, the cross-section of the coil has been discretized. Some of the nodes of this discretization have been assumed as design variables. A generalized nonlinear Newton algorithm is used to minimize the objective function. The length of the coil is calculated by the end-shorting method

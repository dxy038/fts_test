There are many students who can not afford higher education due to any of the reasons. If some teachers who are expert in his/her subject can upload their material on web then the students who cannot afford education from good academic institution can take benefit out of this. For e-learning to be effective students must also be given assignment and test. And their work must be evaluated online. However evaluating large number of students online is very tedious and cumbersome task. Expert teachers are coming forward and uploading their material online so that the large number of students benefit out of it. But when the number of student is very large, nobody is interested or very few teachers are readily available for evaluation. This paper describes the tool named Use Case Extractor developed by us towards achieving our research objective of Automate evaluation of the Use - Case diagram. Use Case Extractor fetches the Use - Case diagram created in StarUML by user and is available in the form of XML file and successfully stores the fetched diagram in the database appropriately to be used further for the automatic evaluation.

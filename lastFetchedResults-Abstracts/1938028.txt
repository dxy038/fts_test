For urban transportation development there are a lot of annual costs, such as fuel importation, roads development, car repairing. Also environmental transportation impacts like energy consumption, noise and air pollution, increase the mentioned costs. Along  rapid urban development it has become a considerable concern in the urban environmental management.  Therefore, urban transportation is an important area in the field of environment. Hence it is required to pay more attention to environmental management of urban transportation. One of the useful management methods is development of Non-motorized Urban Transportation (bicycling and walking). The overall objective of this study is to develop a GIS model to plan suitable locations for non-motorized urban transportation. Arak, a developing city in Iran has been chosen as a case study. Methodology of this study helps to select suitable sites for development of non-motorized urban transportation. GIS as a powerful tool is applied for layers overlaying and interpretation of several scenarios. The results as the accessibility map and analysis for 3 transportation options (motorized transportation, bicycling and walking), shows high suitability of the study area for development of non-motorized urban transportation. Regarding fuel consumption issue, there are a lot of non-suitable location of main destinations in urban transportation network. This research has successfully managed development of a scientific approach for current and future development. It can be employed in transportation planning and suitability assessment at the local and national structure plan levels.

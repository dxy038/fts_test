In this paper, we propose a complex-valued unitary filter bank for multicarrier (MC) transmission to suppress the interference introduced by fading channels. The filters of proposed filter bank are orthogonal, have asymmetric frequency responses and are adaptive to different applications. The advantage of the proposed filter bank is that it is more suitable to deal with complex-valued signals and can be optimized towards various objective functions. We show that, in terms of the total interference power over two sample fading channels, the MC systems based on proposed filter banks has superior performance over discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and discrete wavelet multitone (DWMT).

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that affects the way the body handles basic food components like carbohydrates, protein and fats. This is mostly due to lack or abnormality in action or effect of the hormone insulin. So much attention is being given recently to Communicable diseases like HIV, Tuberculosis and Malaria at the detriment of the emerging epidemic of Non-Communicable disease like Diabetes, hypertension and heart disease .Incidentally, over the past 30years the prevalence of Diabetes has been increasing steadily .Conversely, when there is reduction in ATP production  as it is the case in most chronic diseases  .There seem to  be  increase in  urate production in  purine nucleotide cycle .It was on this basis that we monitored the  serum glucose and uric acid, urine uric acid and transminases activities in fifty diabetic patients on drugs, another fifty not on drugs and twenty healthy individuals  who served as control. However the individuals were 20 to 60 years. Randox kits were used for the biochemical parameters monitored after the blood was collected from each group and serum separated. The results obtained were subjected to statistical analysis using one-way analysis of variance. The result of the study revealed a slight increase in the levels of uric acid both serum and urine in diabetic patients compared to control. Though, this was more notable in urine uric acid level in diabetic patients not on drugs. However the hepatic enzymes were significantly raised in diabetic patients on drugs compared to the other two groups. The finding of this work suggests that diabetic patients are more likely to develop arthritis later in life if the uric acid is not checked and managed properly.

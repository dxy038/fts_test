
The main objective of this study was to assess the effects of different levels of vermicompost and nitrogen on qualitative and quantitative yield of chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L.). The experimental design was factorial based on Randomized Complete Blocks Design (RCBD) with three replications, conducted in Research Institute of Forests and Rangelands during spring 2010. Treatments were consisted of four levels of vermicompost (5, 10, 15 and 20 tons per hectare) and nitrogen of four levels (30, 60, 90 and 120 kg per hectare). The measured traits included number of flowers per plant, diameter of flower, dry and fresh flower yield, essential oil percentage and Chamazulene content in essential oil. Results showed that vermicompost had significant effects on dry flower weight and essential oil percentage (? ? 0.05%). In addition, it had significant effects on dry and fresh flower yield and Chamazulene (? ? 0.05%).  The effect of nitrogen on the number of flower (? ? 0.05%) and essential oil percentage (? ? 0.01%) was significant. The results of interaction effects showed significant differences for the number of flower, dry flower yield, dry flower weight, essential oil percentage and Chamazulene.

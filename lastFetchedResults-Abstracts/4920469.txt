This paper presents a new QoS multicast routing algorithm TPMA for MPLS-TE. The algorithm first modifies the evolution equation to improve standard PSO, and then utilizes TS technique to realize the balance of global and local search, further combines Fitness function to enhanced the global search ability, simultaneously considers other QoS parameters. The main objective of TPMA is to build a QoS multicast tree which having the minimum cost. The simulation shows the algorithm is improved greatly compared to both GA and PSO in routing success rate and total cost of multicast tree, is an efficient and quick routing algorithm.

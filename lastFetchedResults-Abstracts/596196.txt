Objective: The primary goal of this study was to determine the difference of abun¬dance of CD4+, CD8+ and CD56+ bron- choalveolar fluid's lymphocytes and their subpopulations between cancerous lung and healthy lung from the same patient. Methods: Mini-bronchoalveolar lavage was taken from 55 patients from lung with cancer and healthy lung. After laboratory processing and addition of CD4, CD8, CD27, CD28 and CD56 antibody, the material was analyzed by flow cytometer. Results from lung with cancer were compared to the ones from the healthy lung. The examined pa¬tients were the test and the control group at the same time. Results: CD27+28+ forms of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes are more activated in the cancerous lung compared to healthy lung, while the CD27-28- forms are less activated in diseased lung. CD4+ forms of CD56+ lymphocytes are more activated in cancerous lung compared to the health lung, while the CD8+ forms are less activated in diseased lung. Conclusion Immature helper and cytotoxic T lymphocyte response, as well as regulatory NK and NKT cell response are more activated in cancer-ous lung compared to the health lung of the same patient.

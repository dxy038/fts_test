Objective: The neural crest is a transient structure of early vertebrate embryos that generates
neural crest cells (NCCs). These cells can migrate throughout the body and produce
a diverse array of mature tissue types. Due to the ethical and technical problems surrounding
the isolation of these early human embryo cells, researchers have focused on in
vitro studies to produce NCCs and increase their knowledge of neural crest development.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we cultured human embryonic stem
cells (hESCs) on stromal stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) for a
two-week period. We used different approaches to characterize these differentiated cells
as neural precursor cells (NPCs) and NCCs.
Results: In the first co-culture week, hESCs appeared as crater-like structures with marginal
rosettes. NPCs derived from these structures expressed the early neural crest marker
p75 in addition to numerous other genes associated with neural crest induction such as
SNAIL, SLUG, PTX3 and SOX9. Flow cytometry analysis showed 70% of the cells were
AP2/P75 positive. Moreover, the cells were able to self-renew, sustain multipotent differentiation
potential, and readily form neurospheres in suspension culture.
Conclusion: SHED, as an adult stem cell with a neural crest origin, has stromal-derived
inducing activity (SDIA) and can be used as an NCC inducer from hESCs. These cells
provide an invaluable resource to study neural crest differentiation in both normal and
disordered human neural crest development.

Finally, weight and importance of each urban service’s objective was identified, using the questionnaire. Analysis results indicate that in urban services area, mission of municipal services and beauty is the most important and mission of providing crops and protein for citizens is less important. Also suitable mechanisms to coordinate the relationship between municipalities and related organizations were determined separately for different objectives.

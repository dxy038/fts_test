Background
cidence of vascular complications (VCs) after femoral sheath removal following a percutaneous coronary intervention procedure (PCIP) occurs variably (5%-30%) depending on gender, body size, and comorbidities. VCs after a PCIP are distressful for subjects and increase costs and nursing care. Evidence on which subject characteristics contribute to VCs is inconsistent.
ives
udy objective was to determine which subject characteristics and comorbidities contribute to VCs post-PCIP.
s
orrelational study included 306 subjects. Groin areas were assessed for the presence of VCs before, immediately after compression released, and 12 and 24 hours after femoral sheath removal for the presence of VCs. Subject characteristics and comorbidities were recorded.
s
st frequently occurring VCs were ecchymosis, hematoma, and oozing. Age was significantly associated with ecchymosis, whereas hypertension was associated with a decreased level of ecchymosis. Body surface area significantly influenced hematoma formation.
sions
 caring for subjects' post-PCIP who are older and have a smaller body surface area may require extra vigilance and tailoring of nursing care to prevent development of VCs.

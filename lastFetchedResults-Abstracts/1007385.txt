In order to prepare ceramic brake linings with higher friction performance and lower cost, combinatorial friction materials research was conducted. Raw materials used were screened by four criteria. Latin square coupled with Golden Section approach was utilized for experimental formulations design. Sensitivity series and comprehensive index of raw materials obtained from the relational grade analysis were used to rank the influence of each ingredient on friction performance. The evaluating merit of each formulation received from the fuzzy overall merits method was utilized to judge the best formulation. Both comprehensive index and evaluating merit are two novel parameters established and applied to the multi-objective optimization of friction material formulations. Optimization of ceramic friction formulations was implemented in three phases: (a) screen out the optimal one from the initial nine formulations in terms of their friction characteristics; (b) according to the comprehensive evaluation index, the volume fraction of the most advantageous ingredient for friction performance was increased and the most disadvantageous one was decreased correspondingly; and (c) the volume fraction of binder was varied and other ingredientsâ€™ amounts were also changed proportionally. Eventually, the best one was obtained after performing 16 formulations.

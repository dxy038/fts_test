In this paper, we propose a novel objective approach which utilizes the wrinkles on the lower eyelid image of the human to estimate the corresponding skin aging level. Although the face is a small part of the human body and the lower eyelid occupies only a little area on the human face, it possesses important information for aging level identification owing to its vulnerability and fragility to the outside stimuli. Since the wrinkles are the symbol of the aging, it comes naturally that we would pay most attentions to them. With the help of the techniques of image processing, the proposed skin wrinkle analysis algorithm has achieved fairly good performance.

The main objective of this work was to develop laboratory-scale versions of (a) multilayer thin film coated energy-efficient glass windows for applications in warm climates. For this purpose a three-layer system of dielectric/metal/dielectric (D/M/D) on glass was used to achieve the above mentioned spectrally selective coatings. The design parameters for optimum performance of D/M/D on glass systems for various dielectrics, such as TiO2, WO3, and ZnS, were obtained theoretically. Based on these parameters, D/M/D systems on glass were fabricated. Upon testing these systems, it was concluded that the system with any of the three dielectrics performed well and the efficiencies of the systems with different dielectrics were nearly the same.

A novel day-ahead generation scheduling and spinning reserve determination model was proposed for power grid with large-scale wind power. The load shedding losses and the wind curtailment losses were estimated by using the probability density function. And they are taken as two operation risk costs integrated into the generation cost objective function. While fully meeting the unit ramp rate constraints and the network security constraints, the day-ahead generation schedule of conventional units and the up/down spinning reserve capacities were solved simultaneously. The priority list method and the minimum marginal cost based economic dispatch algorithm are used to solve the proposed model. Numerical results of modified IEEE reliability test system show that the proposed model and method are effective.

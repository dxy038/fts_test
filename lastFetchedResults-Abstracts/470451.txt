Objective
This study developed a lifelike amniocentesis model to allow effective acquisition of the stereotactic skills necessary and comfort level with this procedure.
Study design
An amniocentesis model is constructed using a formalin preserved gravid pig uterus. A large Ziploc freezer bag (Dow, Indianapolis, Ind) filled with ultrasound gel is placed on the uterus to simulate the skin and subcutaneous layer.
Results
Amniocentesis can be performed in the usual fashion using this lifelike model. No leak was observed in the Ziploc bag (Dow) or gravid uterus despite more than 50 needle insertions. The cost of 4 to 5 learning stations is approximately $50.00. This model enjoys the advantages of being changeable to reproduce a variety of real-life situations, including poly/oligo/anhydramnios, varied fetal positions and different thickness of subcutaneous tissue.
Conclusion
This low-cost novel model provides realistic tissue resistance and yields a sonographically accurate amniocentesis-training tool. The use of this model permits resident instruction in a nonthreatening environment.

Four short sediment cores from the Oder estuary, south-western Baltic Sea, were studied with respect to their siliceous microfossil and organic carbon content. The sediments were dated by210Pb. The objective was to detect and date changes in the composition of the diatom flora and link these changes to increased human impact in the drainage area during recent centuries. Two of the cores showed an unperturbed sedimentary sequence representing a complete historical record. A change in the composition of the diatom assemblages attributable to anthropogenic factors was recorded. This was dated to about 1900 in the Oderhaff. The change consisted of an increase in species that thrive in eutrophic waters and those indicating increased salinity or the availability of inorganic nutrients.

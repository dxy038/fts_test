Objective Previous epidemiological studies have revealed
a high prevalence of mental disorders among primary care
(PC) patients. However, most studies have methodological
limitations (e.g. absence of structured clinical interviews,
two-phase designs) that affect the generalizability of their
results. The main objective of the present study was to
estimate the lifetime and 12-month prevalence of mental
disorders in the PC of Catalonia (Spain), using structured
clinical interviews and a one-phase design.
Methods One-phase cross-sectional survey. A representative
probability sample without replacement of individuals
aged 18 years or older attending PC for a medical visit
were interviewed between October 2005 and March 2006.
The interviews included SCID-I for depressive and anxiety
disorders and the MINI interview for other mental disorders.
A total of 3,815 patients from 77 PC centres were
included in the statistical analyses.
Results 45.1% of respondents reported at least one lifetime
mental disorder and 30.2% reported at least one
mental disorder in the previous 12 months. The most
common mental disorders were major depression (9.6%),
panic disorder (7.0%), specific phobia (6.6%), and generalized
anxiety disorder (3.8%). There was a high
comorbidity between mood and anxiety disorders, as well
as between mental disorders and some chronic physical
conditions.
Conclusions There is a high prevalence and comorbidity
of mental disorders in the PC of Catalonia. Public health
policies should reinforce the role of family physicians in
the detection and treatment of persons with mental
disorders.

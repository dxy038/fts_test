This paper describes the development of computer software designed to assist in the process of conceptual air- crap design. A Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) optimizer and an aircraft performance simulation package was developed and integrated with an aircraft component database to produce useful suggestions to aircraft designers during the conceptual design phase. The results include the conceptual design of two types of aircraft; a Very Light Jet (VU) and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

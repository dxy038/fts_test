BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Measles and rubella are included vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. Despite vaccination coverage, there is the possibility of sporadic cases and mortality, especially in developing countries. The aim of this study was to examine the levels of antibodies to measles and rubella among medical students.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 236 students who were randomly selected in 2012. After filling out a questionnaire containing demographic information and medical records, 5 cc venous blood was collected from each individual and IgG antibody against measles and rubella were tested by using ELISA.
FINDINGS: The mean age of 236 students was 22.12Â±3.35. 81 cases (34.3%) were male and 155 students (65.7%) were female, 169 (71.6%) and 67 students (28.4%) were native of Mazandaran province and non-native, respectively. Rate of IgG antibody levels against measles in 123 students (52.11%), 40 cases (16.94%) and 73 students (30.93%) were positive, suspected and negative, respectively. This ratio for Rubella were identified in 233 (98.72%), 1 (0.42%) and 2 (0.84%) students, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that the immunity level against rubella was acceptable, but it seems that the immunity level against measles is not enough to prevent sporadic and small outbreaks of measles. It is recommended that the serological status of measles should be evaluated for preventive measures

The objective of this research was to investigate and study the clinical, laboratory and pathologic complications following needle biopsy of the prostate. This study was conducted on 10 male dogs. Prior to biopsy, urine and blood samples were collected and compared with those taken on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12 and 15 after the biopsy. The biopsy was done under ultrasound guidance using No. 20 Vim Tru~ Cut needle. Fifteen days after the biopsy, the animals were euthanized and their prostate glands collected for pathologic evaluations. Results of the blood examinations were analyzed statistically. Clinically, there were no complications other than edema of the biopsy region. Also, significant hematological alterations were not observed and the increase in the levels of acid phophatase was not statistically significant. Pathologic evaluations revealed capsular and glandular hemorrhage and also the process of healing. In light of the clinical, laboratory and pathologic findings and statistical analysis, it can be stated that the observed complications were limited and this technique does not induce any necrotic complications in the gland and the tissue architecture of the prostate is maintained. Because sufficient tissue samples are obtained for pathologic investigations, this technique provides the possibility for better diagnosis of prostatic diseases.

This paper deals with the introduction of bidirectional electric substation (ESS) for railway power supply. These new ESSs are based on switching power converters instead of traditional diode bridge rectifiers. The idea proposed in this paper is the application of these converters to supply traditional 3 kVDC railway network. After a model description some simulation will be reported.

It is a pleasure to introduce to the Canadian electrical engineering community its own technical journal. The Canadian Electrical Engineering Journal is sponsored jointly by the Canadian Society for Electrical Engineering, a constituent society of the Engineering Institute of Canada, and by the Canadian Region of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The primary objective of the Journal is to publish refereed papers of current interest to electrical engineers in Canada. Recognizing that the IEEE and the parent organization of the CSEE, both have existing publications programs, the CEEJ is designed to complement these publications. The CEEJ will tend to publish papers which have a distinctly Canadian connotation and which satisfy the wide spectrum of interests within the CSEE and the Canadian Region of IEEE. This first issue consists of invited papers which are representative of the broad scope and the advanced level of electrical engineering in Canada, fulfilling the special needs of Canadian engineers. Future issues will contain offered papers and prospective authors are invited to submit their offerings in accordance with the general guidelines described elsewhere by the Editor. This issue is being distributed to members of Region 7 of the IEEE above the grade of associate member, and to all members of CSEE.

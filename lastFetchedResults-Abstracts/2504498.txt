Background: Acyclovir (ACV), a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue, is known to be toxic to gonads. Objective: The current study evaluated cytotoxicity of ACV on histopathological changes in testis tissue and serum testosterone and lipid peroxidation concentrations of male rats. Materials and Methods: Animals were divided into five groups. One group served as control and one group served as control sham. In the drug treated groups ACV administered for 15 days. 18 days after the last injection, animals were sacrificed. Histopathological and histomorphometrical analysis of the testis was carried out. Serum levels of testosterone and Lipid Peroxidation and potential fertility of animals was evaluated. Results: Male rats exposed to ACV had significant reduction in serum testosterone concentrations at 16 and 48mg/kg dose-levels (p < 0.01). ACV induced histopathological changes in the testis and also increase the mean number of mast cells in peritubular or interstitial tissue in the testis at at 16 and 48mg/kg dose-levels (p < 0.01). In addition ACV caused increase of serum level of Lipid Peroxidation at 48mg/kg dose-level (p < 0.05). As well ACV decreased potential fertility in male rats. Conclusion: The present results highly support the idea that ACV has adverse effect on the reproductive system in male rat.

This paper studies the relations of individuals in evolutionary populations, and then investigates some features of the relations. The goal is to find efficient methods to construct the non-dominated set. It is proved that the individuals can be sorted by quick sort. To demonstrate the efficiency of our new method, we propose a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) based on quick sort, which is called QKMOGA. We apply QKMOGA on automatic negotiation for agents. A simple negotiation model between two agents is described, and the negotiation protocols are constructed with QKMOGA. Two experimental results show that the performance is satisfactory on the diversity and efficiency of the solutions.

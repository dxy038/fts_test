Entirely devoted to chemical thermodynamics, ThermoSuite is a set of softwares and databanks whose objective is to allow chemists and materials engineers to have a global thermochemical approach of their complex problems. ThermoSuite makes thermodynamic calculations fast and easy: with only few clicks the user can look at the properties of a substance or a reaction, calculate complex equilibria, plot the results, display phase diagrams, etc. It is the result of more than 30 years of experience in the field.

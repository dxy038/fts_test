Novel acetic acid processes and catalysts have been introduced, commercialized, and improved continuously since the 1950s. The objective of the development of new acetic acid processes has been to reduce raw material consumption, energy requirements, and investment costs. At present, industrial processes for the production of acetic acid are dominated by methanol carbonylation and the oxidation of hydrocarbons such as acetaldehyde, ethylene, n-butane, and naphtha. This paper discusses advances in acetic acid processes and catalysts according to the following routes: (1) methanol carbonylation; (2) methyl formate isomerization; (3) synthesis gas to acetic acid; (4) vapor phase oxidation of ethylene, and (5) other novel technologies.

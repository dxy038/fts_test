A Particle Swarm Optimization with Time-
Varying Acceleration Coefficients (PSO-TVAC)
algorithm is proposed to design of the Power System
Stabilizer (PSS) for improvement of power system low
frequency oscillations in this paper. It has a strong ability
to successful control the local search and convergence to
the global optimum solution. The problem of robustly
PSS parameter tuning is formulated as an optimization
problem according to the time domain-based objective
function for a wide range of operating conditions and is
solved by the PSO-TVAC technique which is simple,
robust and capable to solve difficult combinatorial
optimization problems. The effectivness of the proposed
method is tested on a Single-Machine Infinite-Bus
(SMIB) power system through the nonlinear time domain
simulation and some performance indices in comparison
with the other version of PSO based tuned stabilizer and
conventional PSS to illustrate its robust performance.
Results evaluation confirm that the proposed stabilizer
achieves good robust performance for wide range of
system operation conditions and is superior to the other
PSSs.

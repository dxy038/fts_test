A voltage sourced reversible rectifier (VSRR) which achieves bidirectional power flow between a 3-phase AC supply and a DC bus voltage is described. The device features a pulse width modulated voltage control strategy that confines unwanted harmonics to known frequency bands where they can be easily filtered out while operating at near unity power factor, with sinusoidal currents, and maintaining a constant DC bus voltage. The authors consider both the steady state and transient response of such a device, and develop mathematical models to describe its performance under both analogue and digital control. Experimental results obtained with a microprocessor controlled prototype VSRR are presented and compared with theoretical predictions

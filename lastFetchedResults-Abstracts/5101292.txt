A method of non-rigid image registration was developed and evaluated for the purpose of quantifying myocardial displacement and strain from cine MRI using DENSE MRI as the reference standard. The objective of this paper was to study the potential use of cine MRI with image registration, as a means of measuring strain. The local displacement of the left ventricle was modelled by free-form deformations using b-splines. Cardiac MRI images were obtained from four healthy volunteers at 1.5T and analysed by the implementation of image registration algorithms in cine data and with DENSE view in DENSE data. The results indicated there was less than 3% difference between the strain values obtained from cine and DENSE scans averaging across the regions of the left ventricle in healthy subjects (n=4). There lies great potential in the implementation of cine MRI as a means of strain estimation. As such the measurement of strain from standard cine MRI poses an appealing and potentially clinically useful new option for assessing patients with myocardial dysfunction.

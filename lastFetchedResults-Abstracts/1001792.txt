The possibility of applying antimony-film modified glassy carbon electrode in sequential-injection analysis (SIA) was investigated with the objective of determining Pb(II) and Cd(II) by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). The conditions of antimony-film deposition concerning composition of the plating/carrier solutions, concentrations of Sb(III) and hydrochloric acid, effects of different supporting electrolyte salts, and plating potential were optimized. It was found that the antimony-film deposition on glassy carbon substrate in a sample solution consisting of 750 μg L−1 Sb(III), 0.5 mol L−1 HCl at −1.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl/3 mol L−1 KCl) yielded a modified electrode suitable for the determination of Pb(II) and Cd(II) at the μg L−1 level. The reproducibility of the analytical signals was characterized by a relative standard deviation lower than 2.8%, and the calculated values of detection limits were 1.2 μg L−1 for Pb(II) and 1.4 μg L−1 for Cd(II). The presence of KSCN in the sample solution offers the possibility of detecting ions with more negative oxidation potentials like Zn(II), Mn(II) or Cr(III). The developed SIA-ASV procedure was compared with the commonly used batch method, and its applicability was tested on a spiked tap water sample.

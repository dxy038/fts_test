Results are reported of 1.3 &#956;m bidirectional optical transmission over 31 km of installed cabled fibre at transmission rates of 34-650 Mbit/s using fused biconical tapered couplers manufactured at BTRL. With the introduction of 6 dB extra path loss it is possible to double the system capacity incurring only a small additional penalty at 34 and 140 Mbit/s and no other penalty at 320 and 650 Mbit/s.

However, HDP has close relationship with cardiovascular system. It is of significance to detect HDP by monitoring the related information with dynamic hemodynamics. Methods: MP system which was used to monitor HDP had some advantage such as that it was portable to take and flexible to use. MP system also had characteristic clinical applications such as HDP prediction, hemodynamic classification and HDP treatment monitoring. Results: MP system got a lot of achievements of research and product. Conclusion: MP system test is simply operating, continuous dynamic observing and suitable for prenatal care and HDP patients hemodynamic monitoring in general hospitals. MP system provides an understanding of hemodynamic changes of HDP for clinical obstetrics and gynecology doctors and contributes to reduce the incidence of HDP.

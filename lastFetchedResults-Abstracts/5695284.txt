Image segmentation is an important task in many medical applications. One family of segmentation algorithms is based on the idea of clustering pixels with similar characteristics. C-means based approaches, in particular fuzzy c-means has been shown to work well for clustering based segmentation, however due to the iterative nature are also computationally complex. In this paper we introduce a new mean shift based fuzzy c-means algorithm that we show to be faster than previous techniques while providing good segmentation performance. The proposed clustering method incorporates a mean field term within the standard fuzzy c-means objective function. Since mean shift can quickly and reliably find cluster centres, the entire strategy is capable of optimally segmenting clusters within an image.

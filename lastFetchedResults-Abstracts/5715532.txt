Firstly, according to the investment and using time of equipment, calculate basic readjusting cost. Then use zero interference cycle as equipment actions´ interactional threshold time interval, and further to get the dynamic adjusting cost. And put it into the objective function of dynamic optimal reactive power dispatch, keeping coordination between cutting of the power losses and reducing of the operation times, to avoid frequent action in optimal reactive power dispatch, make the reactive power dispatch more reasonable.

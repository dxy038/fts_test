In power system emergency control, the active-splitting control is the last measure when it faces the severe cascading contingency. Its objective is to maintain the stability of the sub partitions and reduce the total loss of load of the whole system to the minimum. A 2-way dynamic partitioning and active-splitting strategy in power system emergency control has been discussed in this paper. On the basis of the Laplace partitioning strategy, a novel weight index has been proposed to measure the "distance" of two adjacent nodes and improve the Laplace partitioning strategy. Combining these two partitioning strategies and considering the directions of the active power, a heuristic neighborhood searching partitioning strategy has been raised to search the possible cut-sets with smaller net generation-load imbalance around the neighborhood of the cut-sets found by the previous two partitioning strategies. A heuristic load-shedding approach has been applied on all these possible cut-sets to calculate the amount of load-shedding of each partition. All these constitute the hybrid partitioning strategy of this paper. The applications on the IEEE118 system validate the effectiveness of the improvement of the weight index and the proposed hybrid Laplace partitioning strategy proposed in this paper.

Visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) is an important safety issue in stereoscopic 3D technology. Accompanying subjective judgment of VIMS with objective measurement is useful to identify not only biomedical effects of dynamic 3D contents, but also provoking scenes that induce VIMS, duration of VIMS, and user behavior during VIMS. Heart rate variability and depth gaze behavior are appropriate physiological indicators for such objective observation. However, there is no information about relationship between subjective judgment of VIMS, heart rate variability, and depth gaze behavior. In this paper, we present a novel investigation of VIMS based on simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ), electrocardiography (ECG), and 3D gaze tracking. Statistical analysis on SSQ data shows that nausea and disorientation symptoms increase as amount of dynamic motions increases (nausea: p&lt;;0.005; disorientation: p&lt;;0.05). To reduce VIMS, SSQ and ECG data suggest that user should perform voluntary gaze fixation at one point when experiencing vertical motion (up or down) and horizontal motion (turn left and right) in dynamic 3D contents. Observation of 3D gaze tracking data reveals that users who experienced VIMS tended to have unstable depth gaze than ones who did not experience VIMS.

This study is performed on the four 2.5 MWe emergency diesel generator (EDG) sets of Hydro-Quebec Gentilly-2 Nuclear Power Station. EDGs are safety related systems for the case of the loss of off-site power. This study establishes the basis of an enhanced preventative maintenance and periodic testing program with the objective of improving the long-term reliability and availability of the EDG. It is also the first step to a PSA program based on the real historical data of the system.

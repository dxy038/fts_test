Objective: To find out the frequency of hepatitis B and C among the patients visiting out patient department. Methodology: A total of 1443 subjects were screened for HBs Ag and anti-HCV in this descriptive study conducted from 1" January 2008 to 31 December 2008 in out patient department (OPD) District Headquarter Hospital Lakki.

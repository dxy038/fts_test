A 2.45-GHz RFID tag chip was designed on standard 0.25- &#956;m CMOS process. Using only MOS devices, the low-Vt rectifier circuit produces 100 &#956;W of power with 2 dBm input. The tag IC with bidirectional communication and anti-collision features can be read from a distance of up to 15 cm under a reader power of 250 mW. The die area of 0.79 mm<sup>2</sup> includes a 128-bit rewritable non-volatile memory.

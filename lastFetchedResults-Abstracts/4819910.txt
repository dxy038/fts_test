A software environment called Parade (PArallel And Distributed Environment) for parallel programming is proposed. Its main objective is to make the programming as easy as possible. The development, debugging, execution, monitoring and optimization of parallel programs have been addressed. Several aspects of parallel program execution, such as task assignment to the processors, task synchronization and communication, are addressed by the system automatically. Two types of parallel system architectures have been considered: tightly coupled (i.e. multiprocessor systems) and loosely coupled with distributed memory (i.e. multicomputer systems). A user-friendly visual interface, realized with OSF/Motif, is provided for all phases of parallel program development. A prototype of our environment is running on a Meiko Transputer-based system and on a network of Unix-based workstations

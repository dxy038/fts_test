Abstract

Back ground and objective: This  study was done to determine the recent resistance rate of E.coli strains isolated  from urinary tract  infections of patients  of Imam khomanin hospital to common antibiotics especially quinolons  and screening the  frequency of qnrA gene  among them.
Materials and methods: During 6 months, 100 E.coli strains collected randomly from urine samples. All confirmed based on bacteriologic tests and their sensitivity to common antibiotics were determined based on CLSI 2011 protocol.  Continuously, DNA extraction was done and frequency of qnrA gene  was determined by PCR.
Results: Based on antibiogram, their resistant was 100% to amoxicillin and penicillin, 77% to amoxiclauve, 72% to ceftazidim, 69% to cephotaxim, 51% to ciprofloxacin, 47% to cefexim, 46% to ceftriaxone, 43% to cephalexin, 27% to axtreonam, 14% nalidixic acid and 2% to imipenem. Among 39.5% of E.coli isolated a 516bp band related to qnrA was detected by PCR.
Conclusion: Doing antibiogram in all clinical laboratories as a simple and cheap test before any antibiotic prescription especially quinolons to prevent drug resistant is recommended.

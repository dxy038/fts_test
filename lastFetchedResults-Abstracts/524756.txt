In the first decade of the twentieth century, a child was born who subsequently became an influential figure in the Iranian contemporary medicine. He was the late Dr. Mostafa Habibi-Golpayegani (1904 – 1948), pioneering professor of the modern pathology in Iran. Herein, a brief account of his life and career is presented. Dr. Mostafa Habibi-Golpayegani was born on September 24, 1904 in Tehran. His father, Mirza Mohammad Ali Khan, was a well-educated teacher. Mostafa attended the Aqdasieh School and then in 1925, he graduated from the Dar al-Fonun High School. He initially worked at Tehran's high schools as a teacher of the natural sciences. Despite his success in his job, he wished to study medicine. So, he enrolled, the School of Medicine in Tehran. Then, he was trained at the State Hospital (Marizkhaneh-e Dowlati) in 1927. From the beginning of his medical training, Mostafa was highly interested in histology and photography.1 He made a microscope with a magnifying power of 150. He used a camera lens as its ocular and a burning glass as its objective lens. This hand-made microscope was appreciated by Dr. Hossein Gole-Golab (1875 – 1945), a master of plant biology.

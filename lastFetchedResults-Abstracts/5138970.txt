The protection of vulnerable road users (VRU) remains one of the most challenging problems for our society and several governmental and consumer organization has set targets to reduce the VRU fatality and injury rates. The automotive industry is, therefore, developing pedestrian and cyclist detection systems that combine pre-crash sensing, risk estimation and vehicle dynamics control (braking, steering) with the objective to meet the challenging VRU accident reduction targets set by various governments. The complexity of VRU detection makes the development process of these systems a complicated and time-consuming activity. Simulation software can help to overcome these difficulties by providing an efficient and safe environment for designing and evaluating VRU safety systems. This paper outlines the use of a software packages that provide the ability to cover all critical aspects of VRU safety design. It focuses on the sensing and control systems, as well as the evaluation of these systems for a range of different traffic scenarios. The presented system model uses fused information from radar model for collision estimation and vision sensor model for object classification, to deploy autonomous braking and thus mitigate the effect of collision with VRUs.

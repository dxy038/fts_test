In the present study, a vibrotactile feedback device for spatial guidance was evaluated in a tracking task paradigm. Participants (N = 18) had to translate and rotate virtual objects according to the vibrotactile vs. verbal cues without visual information. Both types of spatial guidance were evaluated using objective performance data (i.e. speed, accuracy) as well as subjective judgments. Results indicate that distinguishing spatial cues during the translational task was more difficult when being guided by vibrotactile feedback compared to verbal feedback. Nevertheless, individuals with vibrotactile guidance showed better performance at rotational tasks. Implications for the further design process and other areas of application are discussed.

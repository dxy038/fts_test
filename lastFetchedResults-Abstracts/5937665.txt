The objective of this paper is to provide improved real-time noise canceling performance while keeping the high quality of enhanced speech by using new robust adaptive beamformer. The proposed beamformer uses a new adaptive blocking matrix, which consists of linear prediction error filters (LPEFs). It also employ a multi-channel noise canceller with adaptive noise estimation filters (ANEFs) used for inverse modeling. The entire proposed system has been implemented in real-time in a real environment using National Instruments NI- PXI-1042Q controller system and data acquisition card NI-PXI-4472. Practical results show that the proposed beamformer produces results that are significantly favorable than standard GSC beamformer.

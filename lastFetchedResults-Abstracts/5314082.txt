The paper presents an example of a linear, parameter varying (LPV) controller synthesis for a generic nonlinear missile. It is based on obtaining a parameter dependent Ljapunov function, in order to ensure stability of the system. The LPV model of the missile is constructed by means of Jacobian linearization at fixed parameter values. Performance requirements of the control system are specified in an induced L<sub>2</sub>-norm framework, which is similar to the H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-synthesis in the linear time invariant (LTI) case. The suitable weighting functions are found using a multi-objective optimization approach. Finally, the LPV controller is assessed by a comparison to a classical PI controller.

Background and Aim; Health and access to health facilities are now regarded as basic human rights and a fundamental social objective. Reproductive health is essential to promote quality of life and satisfy the need for an enjoyable parenthood.
Material and Methods: This was a descriptive-analytic study on 430 women of reproductive age who were receiving health services from urban PHC clinics run by Tehran, Beheshti and Iran medical universities. With the help of a questionnaire we gathered data on factors related to reproductive health knowledge and attitude and analyzed the data using %2, OR, Pearson correlation coefficients.
Results: Knowledge and attitude was found to be significantly related to education and employment (p<0.00). There was also an association between knowledge and attitude on one hand and husband's education and employment on the other (p<0.00). Age was not found to have an influence on knowledge and practice (p<0.757).
Conclusion: This research shows that education can have a major effect on empowering women to demand and exercise their basic rights, including those related to reproduction and childbearing.

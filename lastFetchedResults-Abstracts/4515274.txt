The aim of this work is to design and build by 2015 an electric four-seater equipped with an autonomous extension device. The project was born from two observations: in a context of necessary diversification of energy sources and the development of electric vehicles, the main problem remains the battery life and availability of charging stations. The issue of our work lies both in the optimization of energy consumption and improving the electric vehicle. Our team was tasked to develop and implement an Energy Management System of Electric Vehicle. The objective of the mission is to create a program that calculates the set speed to minimize the cost of energy consumption and maximize battery life. This calculation is done by taking into account prevention parameters are: vehicle speed, real-time parameters from Maps (elevations in the path, wind speed, etc.), the forces applied to the vehicle.

In this paper, we propose a methodology for recording the signal strength of Wi-Fi signals to provide a benchmark for offline use. The parameters which are studied and seem important are the input data of the recording system. These parameters are classified into three categories, the type of packets transmitted, the propagation context and the environment. From the recorded measurements, comparing similarity functions between the reference map and measurements will be based on the same observed values. The analysis will therefore be reliable and reproducible. Signal measuring is always done with the same hardware to be objective. A set of factors is studied in order to measure the real impact on the received signal strength signal accurately.

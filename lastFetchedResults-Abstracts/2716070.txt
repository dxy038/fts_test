This paper presents an adaptive multi-mode power control algorithm for the converter of a direct-drive permanent magnetic wind generation system in a microgrid. The strategy is implemented in a field-oriented control machine drive system, with a two-level IGBT full-power rated ac-dc machine-side converter. The objective of this paper control is to operate the wind generation either in maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode or non-MPPT mode with enhanced tracking performance. The simulation proves that the proposed MPPT algorithm is faster, more robust, and adaptive to changes of the environment than the conventional variable-step hill climbing search algorithm, while the non-MPPT module has a fast dynamic response to the change of the power command and the environment, and an accurate steady-state response as well. Moreover, the result shows that the control strategy can automatically switch between the MPPT and non-MPPT modes.

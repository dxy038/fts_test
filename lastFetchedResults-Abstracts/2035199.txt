The application of Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices shows that they can control the power
system technical parameters effectively. However, optimal placement and sizing of them are difficult problems
and analytical methods cannot be used to solve these problems. To solve such problems, some evolutionary
algorithms are employed. The efficiency of these algorithms is related to their objective function. In this paper,
two multi objective optimization algorithms, namely: Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II)
and Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) are used to solve the congestion problem in power
system. To verify our proposed method, simulations are performed to modify IEEE 14-bus and modified IEEE
30-bus test systems. Firstly, load of the system is increased uniformly until congestion occurs. Then,
optimization algorithms are used to find out the optimal location and size of FACTS devices, as well as the
optimal amount of changes in active power generation. Two types of FACTS devices namely: Static VAr
Compensator (SVC) and Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) are used for congestion elimination. The
obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed objective functions.

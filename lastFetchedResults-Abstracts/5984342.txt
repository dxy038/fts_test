Auto-feeding soup machine based on six-bar linkage, which is a kind of feeder mechanism in die casting industry, is simulated and optimized in this paper. By kinematic analysis of six-bar linkage, the design variables and constraints are determined, and objective function and mathematical optimization model are established, that is to pursue the minimum extreme value of acceleration of soup ladle in motion as design object. The six-bar linkageÂ´s parameters are optimized by using the software ADAMS and a set of relatively reasonable configurable parameters are obtained. Meanwhile, such method can be applied to other mechanisms and parameters optimization.

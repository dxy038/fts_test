This work deals with the planning of the broadband power line communications networks. The design process of these networks is subdivided into two main sub-problems; namely the generalized base station placement problem and the channel allocation problem (CAP). This CAP is the focus of this work. It is modelled as a multi-objective optimization problem and solved by multi-objective optimization algorithms. Based on our previous investigations in this field, we propose in this paper the application of a dispatching method, in order to allocate better and fairly the available set of channels to PLC cells. The advantage of this dispatching is reflected by the improved algorithms convergence. The algorithms performance is evaluated using some network reference scenarios.

PID controller is widely used for main steam temperature control of boiler unit in thermal power plant. To avoid the drawback of current PID design methods, this paper presents a new design method for multi-objective PID controller to synthetically consider system requirement in speediness, reliability and robustness. NSGA-II algorithm with the elite strategy is applied to the parameter optimization design. The simulation results on an actual main steam temperature control system indicate that, the multi-objective PID controller designed by presented method, can improve the dynamic performance of main steam temperature control system, with good robustness and anti-interference ability.

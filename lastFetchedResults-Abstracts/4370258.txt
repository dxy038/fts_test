The topology design of campus networks is a hard constrained combinatorial optimization problem, dictated by physical and technological constraints and must optimize several objectives. Furthermore, due to the non-deterministic nature of network traffic and other design parameters, the objective criteria are imprecise. Fuzzy logic provides a suitable mathematical framework in such a situation. We present an approach based on a simulated evolution algorithm for design of a campus network topology. Three variations of the algorithm are presented and compared. Results show that the third variation, namely, simulated evolution with tabu search characteristics gives the best result

Background and Objective: The clinical curriculum of medical teachers has to be in line with the theoretical curriculum. The present study has compared five aspects of the teachers' interaction between theoretical curriculum and the clinical curriculum.
Materials and Method:  The method was a descriptive survey. From the stager and intern students of Shahed University, in the academic year 1391-92 (N=175), and with recourse to Krjsy and Morgan table, 120 samples were selected. The researcher-made questionnaire on the interactive aspects of the professors (with reliability confirmed by the experts) was used. Two sections of clinical and theoretical education with recourse to Cronbach alpha presented a validity of 0.97 and 0.95.
Results: There existed a meaningful difference between the way of interaction of the professors with students, with their colleague, with people and with the two theoretical and clinical curriculums. The rating average of professors' interactions in both types of curricula included the interaction of professors with the patients, with students, with themselves, with society and with colleagues. Thus, the differences in the various types of interactions in two curriculum types did not change the ratings.
Conclusion: The decline in the interaction of professors with the students, society and themselves in clinical curriculum compared to that of the theoretical curriculum is the result of professors' paradoxical actions. Interestingly, the interaction with the college in clinical curriculum increases, which by itself is the sign of a paradox between the teaching and practicing of professors and bears various meanings from students' viewpoints.

This paper is the part of feasibility study of non invasive blood glucose monitoring using electrical bioimpedance spectroscopy. The objective of reported experiment is to estimate the change in dielectric properties of ringer lactate solution with respect to D-glucose and to optimize the frequency spectrum for glucose monitoring. The dielectric properties of the ringer lactate solution have been measured with respect to the D-glucose. The experiment shows that there is a significant change in dielectric properties of the ringer lactate solution (equivalent to physiological fluid) with respect to D-glucose (equivalent to blood glucose).

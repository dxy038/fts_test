Objective Numerous studies of both clinical and largescale
population based samples have demonstrated that
adverse childhood events are risk factors for subsequent
psychosis. This study assessed the relationships between
adverse childhood events and auditory and visual hallucinatory
experiences.
Method The study analysed data from the National
Comorbidity Survey Replication conducted in the US that
assessed (all before age 16) rape, sexual assault and
physical assault. Psychosis symptomatology was represented
by lifetime experience of auditory and visual hallucinations.
Control variables included gender, age,
urbanity, ethnicity, marital status, education, employment
status, alcohol dependence and drug dependence.
Results All three adverse events were significantly related
to both types of hallucinations. Those who had been
raped as children were 3.3 times more likely to have
experienced visual hallucinations and 3.5 times more likely
to have experienced auditory hallucinations compared to
those who had not been raped in childhood. Both rape and
physical assault significantly predicted visual and auditory
hallucinations. A significant doseâ€“response relationship
was also found.
Conclusions Previous findings indicating that adverse
events in childhood may be causally related to subsequent
psychosis are supported. The psychological and biological
mechanisms underlying the relationship are already the
subject of investigation. Repeated recommendations concerning
routine enquiry about adverse experiences in
childhood in order to facilitate comprehensive formulations
and appropriate treatment, also receive support from these
findings

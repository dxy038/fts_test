Objective: Our purpose was to investigate the metabolic background of the expression of sulfoglycolipids in human endometrium during the luteal phase.
Study design: We investigated the expression of sulfoglycolipids by thin-layer chromatography immunostaining and the activities of galactosylceramide sulfotransferase and arylsulfatase A, which regulate the synthesis and degradation of sulfoglycolipid. In addition, arylsulfatase A messenger ribonucleic acid was studied by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Results: Sulfoglycolipid expression showed a marked increase in the luteal phase but not in the follicular phase, whereas sialoglycolipids remained relatively constant. The increase of sulfoglycolipids was found to be due to 4.5-fold increased activation of sulfotransferase and a concurrent reduction of arylsulfatase A activity in the luteal phase. Arylsulfatase A messenger ribonucleic acid was detected in both phases and showed no significant changes.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that increased sulfoglycolipid expression in the luteal phase is due to the simultaneous regulation of sulfotransferase and arylsulfatase A, probably by sex steroid hormones.

Objective(s): Biological effects of MSCs on aligned and random nanofibrous scaffolds of PCL/PVA/nHA were investigated in this study. 
Materials and Methods: Aligned and random nanocomposite nanofibrous scaffolds were electrospun from polycaprolactone (PCL), poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (nHA). The morphology and mechanical characteristics of the nanofibers were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy and tensile testing, respectively. 
Results: Scanning electron microscopy revealed fibers with an average diameter of 123 ± 32 nm and 339 ± 107 nm for aligned and random nanofibers, respectively. The mechanical data indicated the higher tensile strength and elastic modulus of aligned nanofibers. The in vitro biocompatibility of aligned and random nanofibrous scaffolds was also assessed by growing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and investigating the proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) on different nanofibrous scaffolds. 
Conclusion: Our  findings  showed  that  the  alignment  orientation  of  nanofibers  enhanced  the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells. The in vitro results showed that the aligned biocomposite nanofibrous scaffolds of PCL/nHA/PVA could be a potential substrate for tissue engineering applications, especially in the field of artificial bone implant.

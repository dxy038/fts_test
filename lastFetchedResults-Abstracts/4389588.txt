A Modular DC-DC converter with a high-frequency link and bidirectional power flow capability is presented in this paper. Zero voltage switching (ZVS) operation without using any auxiliary circuit, is one of the most important specifications of the proposed modular DC-DC converter. Also, compatibility for high power applications and less number of switching devices are the other merits of the proposed converter. ZVS analysis of the modular converters is necessary because of their high power applications and high number of power switches. The ZVS condition of the proposed modular DC-DC converter is studied and its criteria are derived in detail. The operation principle of the proposed converter, and its ZVS operation are verified using both simulation and experimental measurement.

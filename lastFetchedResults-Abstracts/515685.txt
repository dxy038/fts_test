With the objective of improving the impact of multi-enzymes feed additives on cecal fermentation pattern andrabbit metabolism, sodium bentonite was co-supplemented with “Kemzyme”, a multi-enzyme blend of KeminAgrifoods Europe. Co-supplementation decreased cecal pH value, increased total VFAs concentration, increasedpropionate at the expence of acetate and butyrate, increased fermentation efficieny and VFAs utilization. Additionally, co-supplementation increased serum glucose concentration and decreased serum triglycerides andcholesterol concentrations. Cecal ammonia nitrogen and serum urea concentration were also decreased byco-supplementation while no change was recorded in serum total proteins concentration. The study therefore, suggested that, coupling bentonite to multi-enzyme feed additives could improve the impact of such enzymes oncecal fermentation pattern and rabbit metablism

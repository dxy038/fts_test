In industrial practice, constrained steady state optimisation and predictive control are separate, albeit
closely related functions within the control hierarchy. This paper presents a method which integrates predictive
control with on-line optimisation with economic objectives. A receding horizon optimal control
problem is formulated using linear state space models. This optimal control problem is very similar to the
one presented in many predictive control formulations, but the main difference is that it includes in its
formulation a general steady state objective depending on the magnitudes of manipulated and measured
output variables. This steac:y state objective may include the standard quadratic regulatory objective,
together with economic objectives which are often linear. Assuming that the system settles to a steady state
operating point under receding horizon control, conditions are given for the satisfaction of the necessary
optimality conditions of the steady-state optimisation problem. The method is based on adaptive linear
state space models, which are obtained by using on-line identification techniques. The use of model
adaptation is justified from a theoretical standpoint and its beneficial effects are shown in simulations. The
method is tested with simulw:ions of an industrial distillation column and a system of chemical reactors.

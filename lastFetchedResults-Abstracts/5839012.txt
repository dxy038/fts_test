Multi-objective synthesis technique is proposed to improve disturbance attenuation for uncertainty systems with input saturation. The main results rely on a multi-objective approach which can handle various closed-loop specifications, such as disturbance rejection, robust stabilization and saturation constrains, on different channels within the LMI synthesis framework. A saturating observer-based output feedback controller is derived using the linear matrix inequality optimization. The validity and applicability of the proposed method is illustrated by an example.

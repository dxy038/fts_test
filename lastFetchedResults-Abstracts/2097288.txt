In the present study, we have followed up Leishmania infantum infection in dogs: (1) naturally infected; (2) experimentally infected with amastigotes; and (3) experimentally infected with culture promastigotes. The main objective was to evaluate the differences of the humoral and cellular immune responses of each group. Sera from 12 beagle dogs were analysed for total anti-leishmanial antibodies and IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Lymphoproliferation to L. infantum antigen was also performed. All naturally infected animals were symptomatic with a marked humoral response. Dogs inoculated with amastigotes were asymptomotic and presented lower antibody titres than naturally infected. Dogs inoculated with culture promastigotes were asymptomotic with no significant humoral response. Strong proliferative responses to Leishmania antigen was observed in dogs inoculated with promastigotes. In our experimental model, IgG1 antibody levels presented a similar pattern in all infected animals, and IgG2 reactivity was high in naturally infected dogs.

The objective of public health surveillance is to systematically collect, analyze, and interpret public health data (about chronic or infectious diseases) to understand trends; detect changes in disease incidence and death rates; and plan, implement, and evaluate public health practices. Recently, studies have been conducted to develop methods and algorithms for health surveillance and disease detection. This paper attempts to review recent research on temporal and spatiotemporal surveillance methods. We have addressed specific challenges and research gaps in the relevant research. Lastly, we discuss a comparative example using a dataset of male thyroid cancer cases in New Mexico.

The patients were followed in post operative period for urinary retention.
Results: 1.8% of patients who had mild symptoms (IPSS=O-7) had urinary retention in 2nd 24 hours of post operative period, 20% of patients who had IPSS =8-19 and 53.3% of patients with IPSS=20-53 had urinary retention at same period (P<0.05).

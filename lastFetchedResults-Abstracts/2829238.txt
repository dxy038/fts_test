The main objective of this paper is the enhancement of power system stability by using complex structure of Power System Stabilizers (PSS) in the voltage regulation loop of synchronous generators. The PSS uses multiple local and remote input signals. The remote signals are provided by Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) and measure the frequency at different buses and active power flows on different tie-lines. The parameters of the PSSs (gains and time constants) are optimally tuned using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to damp inter-area and local power oscillations.

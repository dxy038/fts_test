This study examines two major late Quaternary coastal dune systems situated in the southwestern-most extremity of Africa. The False Bay and Duinefontyn dune plumes formed in close proximity, but under contrasting oceanographic regimes (warm Agulhas and cold Benguela oceanic current systems respectively). The False Bay and Duinefontyn dune plumes have hitherto lacked the objective, numerical chronology required to realize their full potential in unraveling the complex palaeo-oceanographic and palaeoclimatic history of the region. Here we present a dual amino acid racemizationn (AAR) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) chronological framework from the extensive three dimensional exposures in sea cliffs.

se Bay, three generations of dune deposition, corresponding with orbitally forced climatic/sea level cycles (MIS 7, MIS 5 and Holocene) were resolved, whereas the Duinefontyn Plume is dominated by MIS 5 and Holocene sedimentation. At False Bay and Duinefontyn, glacial periods are marked by the development of mature palaeosols, confirming the link between glacio-eustacy and dune deposition determined previously on the west and southern coasts of South Africa.

the west coast dune plumes typify dunefield morphology, whereas shoreline-parallel dune cordons are commonly developed on the southern coast. These regional variations in dune system morphogenesis are largely controlled by contrasting wind and rainfall patterns. The attenuated dimensions of the MIS 5 plumes at False Bay and Duinefontyn may indicate a weakening of the South Atlantic Anticyclone during the Last Interglacial. At False Bay, stone artifacts illustrate a human presence in the region during MIS 7.

Objective
 function among testicular cancer survivors is a concern because affected men are of reproductive age when diagnosed. We conducted a case–control study among United States military men to examine whether testicular cancer survivors experienced impaired sexual function.
s
l of 246 testicular cancer cases and 236 ethnicity and age matched controls were enrolled in the study in 2008–2009. The Brief Male Sexual Function Inventory (BMSFI) was used to assess sexual function.
s
ed to controls, cases scored significantly lower on sex drive (5.77 vs. 5.18), erection (9.40 vs. 8.63), ejaculation (10.83 vs. 9.90), and problem assessment (10.55 vs. 9.54). Cases were significantly more likely to have impaired erection (OR 1.72; 95% CI 1.11–2.64), ejaculation (OR 2.27; 95% CI 1.32–3.91), and problem assessment (OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.43–3.90). In histology and treatment analysis, nonseminoma, chemotherapy and radiation treated cases risk of erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation, and/or problem assessment were greater when compared to controls.
sion
tudy provides evidence that testicular cancer survivors are more likely to have impaired sexual functioning compared to demographically matched controls. The observed impaired sexual functioning appeared to vary by treatment regimen and histologic subtype.

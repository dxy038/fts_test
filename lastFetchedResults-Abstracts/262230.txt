Because of the need for an efficient and inexpensive reforming catalyst, the objective of this work is to determine the feasibility of employing Mo2C catalyst for the steam reforming and oxy-steam reforming of the higher hydrocarbons typical of transportation fuels such as gasoline. It is shown that bulk Mo2C catalysts can successfully reform 2,2,4-trimethyl pentane (isooctane) to generate H2, CO and CO2 at very low steam/carbon ratios, without coke formation, eliminating the need for pre-reforming. Maximum hydrogen generation was observed at a S/C ratio of 1.3 and 1000 °C during SR reactions and S/C of 0.71, O2/C of 0.12 at 900 °C during oxidative steam reforming reactions.

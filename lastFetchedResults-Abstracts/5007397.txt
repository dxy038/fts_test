A Fuzzy Preference Framework for the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution is employed to analyze the sustainable development conflict in order to gain strategic insights. This framework is a novel methodology to identify outcomes favorable for all parties in a multiple-participant multiple-objective decision making setting with both certain and uncertain preference information. When applied to the sustainable development conflict, in which a developer plans to build or operate a project inspected by an environmental agency, the methodology identifies stable outcomes and thus clarifies the necessary conditions for sustainability.

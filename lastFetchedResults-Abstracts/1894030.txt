Summary
aper presents the findings of a two phase mixed methods study. Phase 1 investigated whether simulation could support the development of a range of clinical skills amongst pre-registration adult and children’s nursing students. The second phase of the study gathered mentors’ views and experiences of the use of simulation in the preparation of students for practice.

sioned by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, the United Kingdom (UK) professional body, the study is reported as one of 13 pilot sites using designated practice hours for simulation. The commission resulted from a call to review the current pre-registration nursing curriculum that includes 4600 equally divided theory and practice hours delivered across the programme. Phase 1 included a sample of 69 adult and children’s pre-registration students from years one and three of their programme, studying at one UK University. The group attended five simulation sessions including basic life support, manual handling, infection control, clinical decision making and managing violence and aggression. Students completed pre- and post-tests in basic life support and manual handling, and vignettes and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) covering the five areas of simulation. Phase 2 included interviews with six mentors who were supervising students involved in the study. Simulation was positively received by both students and mentors as it was apparent that it offered scope for interdisciplinary learning that could be broadened to inter-professional applications. The study also identified that the use of simulation could provide scope for collaborative working between education providers and clinical staff.

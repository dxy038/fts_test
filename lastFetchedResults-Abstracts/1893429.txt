The objective of the study was to investigate the mitogenic and genotoxic effects of He:Ne laser irradiation (632.8 nm) on human peripheral lymphocytes in vitro. We used the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay, which incorporates cytochalasin B to inhibit cytokinesis while karyokinesis proceeds normally leading to the appearance of proliferating lymphocytes as binucleated cells. Also micronuclei will appear in cases of genotoxicologically-affected cells. Buffy coat leukocytes were exposed to 10 mW He:Ne laser at energy densities of 1, 2, 3 and 5 J/cm2. Cells were then cultured in media 199 without any supplementation for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h adding cytochalasin B 24 h before harvesting of cells. Our results showed that laser-induced lymphocytes proliferate throughout the four consecutive days post-laser irradiation. The difference in the frequency of micronuclei between pre- and post-laser irradiation indicates that a He:Ne laser at such energy densities 1, 2, 3 and 5 J/cm2 does not induce micronucleus formation. These results shed some light on the mechanism encountered by lymphocytes in the process of He:Ne laser-induced biostimulation.

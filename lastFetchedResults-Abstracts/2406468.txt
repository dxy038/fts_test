Nowadays, a great portion of researches research and industrial innovation is about the electric vehicles (EV) and also EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) that play an important role in this context. EVSE requires standardization via effective communication protocols. In this paper, we propose to customize the existing Internet standard Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) to facilitate the communication among networked EVSEs. RPL is a flexible protocol that has special specifications to support many low power and lossy nodes, which makes it self-healing and ideal to support the differing traffic activity in EVSE systems. Our idea to improve the Quality of Service (QoS) in this vehicular network is using classification of data type. Hence , we propose a Customized RPL which support supports classification and also two different Objective Functions (OF) that the simulation results shows show , effectively reduce the end to end delay for special kind of data packets. We study our proposed method under different scenarios to see how successful this idea is.

Bidirectional cable TV networks using hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) systems are good examples of broadcast environments where a contention resolution algorithm is needed in order to allocate the multiaccess medium (in this case the upstream link) among the various nodes. Recent activities of the IEEE 802.14 working group aimed at defining the physical and medium access control (MAC) layer protocols for HFC cable networks have focused on the study and evaluation of several contention resolution solutions for inclusion in the MAC protocol specifications. In this article several contention resolution algorithms considered by the IEEE 802.14 group are reviewed. Different implementations for several well known contention resolution algorithms such as tree-based and p-persistence are presented. Their performance is evaluated in the HFC context with respect to upstream channel allocation, roundtrip delay, various traffic types, and number of stations in the network. Simulation results for configurations and scenarios of interest are also presented.

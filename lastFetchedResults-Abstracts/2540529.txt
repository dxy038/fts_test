Background and Objective: patients with loss of consciousness experience pain concerning the invasive procedures, mechanical ventilation and physical situation of ICU. The current study was conducted to determine the effect of instrumental music on pain intensity in patients with loss of consciousness in intensive care unit.

Materials and Method: In this clinical trial study, study population was the intubated patients under mechanical ventilation who hospitalized in intensive care unit in one of the hospitals in Zahedan 2015. 60 eligible patients were selected conveniently and  then were randomly allocated through permuted blocks into two music therapy and control groups of 30 persons. Intervention was carried out through playing instrumental music of Arnd Stein in 3 sessions of 30 minutes via headphone. Control group only received the routine care about pain relief. Measuring the pain was done through BPS, 5 minutes before and immediately after the music therapy. In control group, measurement was done with the same interval and frequency. Data were analyzed in SPSS 15 and using independent Ttest, paired Ttest, chisquare and ANCOVA.

Results: Every three days after the intervention, the mean score of pain was significantly reduced in intervention group (p<0.0001), and pain relief in the first day was more than the next days of intervention and this difference was significant between the intervention and control groups (p<0.0001), while this difference was not significant in control group.

Conclusion: According to results, the application of instrumental music can reduce the intensity of pain in patients with loss of consciousness. Thus, it can be used as a simple, practical and low costs method in pain relief of patients with loss of consciousness in the intensive care unit.

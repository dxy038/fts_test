This paper aims for the conductive common-mode noise reduction by system balance improvement on three phase inverter. The main objective is to improve the system balance on three phase inverter based on passive balance and active balance for common-mode noise reduction. As a result, the common-mode current which is generated by PWM switching voltage will be cancelled in frame ground. The concept of system balance and equivalent circuit on double-switch converter for three phase inverter is proposed. Furthermore, the experimental results of three phase induction motor drive by three phase inverter, that is both of time domain measuring and spectrum of common-mode noise measuring are employed respectively.

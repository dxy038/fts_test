Recently the remarkable development of NAND flash technology makes possible the advent of SSD (solid-state device) that is considered to replace traditional HDD, due to its potential benefits such as low-power usage and reliability. In this paper, we present a hybrid file system, called hybridFS, whose primary objective is to put together attractive features of both HDD and SSD devices, to construct a large-scale, virtualized address space with a minimum cost. The hybridFS was designed to alleviate SSDÂ´s flash memory-related problems while providing a flexible internal structure to utilize excellent sequential performance of existing file systems. A series of experiments was conducted to verify the performance of the hybridFS.

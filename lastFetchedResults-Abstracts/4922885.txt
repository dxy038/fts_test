This paper gives a very short summary of an survey of software testing practices and techniques. It summerizes the software development process on the W-model, one of the available development processes which include testing phases as an essential part of the process. Many other software processes are known, however, testing phases are in many cases treated similar. For as much software testing is dealing with software quality, but custermers, mostly non-technicals need to have an objective comparison about quality. Software metrics are applied to get comparable values of the degree of particular software quality features. A short summary of metrics is shown how different metrics can be applied. As a software testing and more general quality assurance becomes more desired in the industry efficient methods of testing, automated test generation and the support of test execution issues challenging topics to the research community.

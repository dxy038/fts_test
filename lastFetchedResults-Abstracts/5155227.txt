The IEEE 519 engineering recommendations is possibly one of the most well known and widely used documents in the power quality area. The objective of the recommendation is, however, many times misunderstood and consequently erroneously interpreted and applied. This panel reviews and discusses common misinterpretations and distortions in the application of harmonic distortion recommendations with particular reference to IEEE 519. The panelists will attempt to clarify several different issues and misconceptions related to parameters, point of application, and nature of the recommendations. The issues will be presented and discussed in a contrasting / dichotomy approach (A versus B) of the alternatives practices. Suggestions will then be made for improving the implementation engineering recommendations and the communication process. This paper deals with the issue of current versus voltage limitation.

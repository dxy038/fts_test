Precise determination of reservoir parameters is an important issue in study and management of reservoir. Among these parameters, one the important and effective parameters is Archie's parameters due to their key role in reservoir prediction. Even slight variations in the value of these parameters results in significant errors in mentioned calculations. Cementation factor has great importance and is controlled by type of porosity, the shape of grains and pores, tortuasity factor, type of grains, heterogeneity, and compaction. This parameter normally varies in range of 1 to 5. Despite of great importance of these factors in reservoir studies, there is no general and precise relationship for Iran reservoirs and saturation calculations are carried out by equations usually with great error. Laboratorial measurements also are available just for few cases. The objective of this study is to evaluate the error of some of these common correlations. Comparison the results of the classic correlations with the experimental data resulted in low correlation coefficients(0.3060, 0.3025, 0.2819 and 0.2831, For Shell, Borai and Ragland(Type 1&2), respectively). This shows that these correlations are associated with high error in calculations of Iran reservoirs. Thus, gathering enough experimental data and introducing general models for Iran's reservoirs in case studies to enhance the reservoir studies, is essential and inevitable

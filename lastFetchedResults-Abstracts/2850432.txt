We present a new framework to fit a path to a given finite set of data points on a Riemannian manifold. The path takes the form of a continuously-differentiable concatenation of Riemannian Bezier segments. The selection of the control points that define the Bezier segments is partly guided by the differentiability requirement and by a minimal mean squared acceleration objective. We illustrate our approach on specific manifolds: the Euclidean plane (for sanity check), the sphere (as a first nonlinear illustration), the special orthogonal group (with rigid body motion applications), and the shape manifold (with 2D shape morphing applications).

The paper applies the GSA methodology to the study of mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) rpoB gene variability. The rpoB gene encodes the beta subunit of RNA polymerase and can produce rifampin (RMP) resistance, A segment comprising the codons 509-595 of the gene has been analyzed. Mutations occurring at specific sites along the gene strand can be put in direct correspondence to RMP resistance.

Objective(s): To measure Body Mass Index (BMI) in Afghan immigrant children in 2005.
Methods: In this survey we selected 606 Afghan children aged 6-14 years and measured their weights and
heights. After calculating body mass index (BMI), we categorized the subjects as underweight, normal, or
obese.
Results: This study showed that 97 cases (16%) had low weight, 429 (81.2%) fell within the normal range and 17 (2.8%) were over-weight. Low weight was more common in girls than in boys (15.2% vs. 16.9%) but the difference was not statistically significant. Also, the prevalence of low weight was greater in children born in Iran (17.3%) than in those born in Afghanistan (15.2%). Children with birth ranks of >3 were more likely to have low weight in comparison to first- and second-born subjects (17% vs. 15.3%), but the difference was not statistically significant.
Conclusion: In light of the high prevalence of malnutrition in Afghan immigrant children, interventional and educational programs are needed to improve health and nutrition status in Afghan immigrants.

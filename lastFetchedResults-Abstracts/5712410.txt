Universities are increasingly large in size, with non-traditional students, inadequate student-teacher ratios, declining financial support from the state, increased competition for external funds and increased competition for limited student demand. The main objective of this ongoing research is to investigate existing decision support systems capable of supporting the provisions of higher education institutions, such as Universities, and to propose and develop an interactive decision support system in the form of a simulation model for university processes with case studies from Mamoun Private University for Science and Technology in Syria.

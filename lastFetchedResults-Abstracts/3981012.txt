A novel method of microwave frequency up/downconversion is proposed for microwave/millimetre-wave-based radio-over-fibre (RoF) systems. The uplink and downlink are both based on dual-wavelength single-longitudinal-mode fibre laser modulation and heterodyning, which provides the possibility to realise bidirectional RoF transmissions.

The objective of medical information systems is to enhance the efficiency of the medical process, especially as it relates to patient interaction with the health care system. Due to the development of Web service technology and the spread of mobile devices, mobile Web services have become an essential element of ubiquitous healthcare. However, there are few applications currently based on mobile Web services. This paper proposes a system for supplying Web services on medical information on a wired/wireless network according to using resources of device. When a mobile device requires Web services, mobile context server rewrites and offers the equivalent contents provided from the Web server to suit the required deviceÂ´s resources. This system services the same medical information data after its recomposition according to the network and devices of user. This paper describes the prototype of a wired/wireless integrated medical information system using Web services and mobile Web services as the basis of a ubiquitous healthcare system.

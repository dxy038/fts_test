Objective: The distribution of plasma total homocysteine concentrations in a population of South West of Iran Shiraz is described to test for differences in homocysteine concentrations among gender and age groups and those levels reported in other populations.
Design and methods: Two hundred one healthy males and 201 healthy females aged >15 years from Shiraz, Iran, were randomly selected. Plasma total homocysteine concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography.
Results: The mean plasma homocysteine level was significantly higher in men (geometric mean, 7.3μmol/l) than in women (geometric mean, 6.3μmol/l, P< 0.001). The geometric mean levels for ages 15–25, 26–36, 37–47, and 48–58, 59–69, and 70–80 years, were 5.9, 5.4, 5.2, 6.7, 7.3, and 7.6 μmol/l in women and 7.5, 8.7, 5.9, 5.9,7.2, and 9.1 μmol/l in men, respectively.
Conclusions: The homocysteine distribution in a representative sample of people of southwest of Iran indicates age and gender differences, as is found in other populations.

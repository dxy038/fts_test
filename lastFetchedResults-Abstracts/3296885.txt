Web services composition enables the business to dynamically and seamlessly integrate business applications on the web. The performance of an overall composition is a function of its individual component services. Hence, both functional and nonfunctional properties of Web services are important when negotiating component service for a system. Automated negotiation helps speed up this process and often improves the overall quality of the composite system. In this paper, we present a negotiation Web service that would be used by both the businesses searching for a Web service as well as the providers of Web services for conducting negotiations for dependent QoS parameters. We present the detailed architecture and system engineering view of our framework and use a genetic algorithm (GA) based approach for finding acceptable solutions in multi-party and multi-objective scenarios. Experimental results indicate the applicability and improved performance of our approach in facilitating the negotiations involved in a Web service composition process.

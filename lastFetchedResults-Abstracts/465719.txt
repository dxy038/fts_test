Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate granisetron, droperidol, and metoclopramide for efficacy and safety in the treatment of established postoperative nausea and vomiting after major gynecologic surgery. Study Design: One hundred twenty postoperative female patients were monitored for the first 3 hours after anesthesia in the postanesthesia care unit and for the next 24 hours after anesthesia in the ward. Patients who had postoperative nausea and vomiting within the first 3 hours after anesthesia received intravenously, in a randomized double-blind manner, 40 μg/kg granisetron, 20 μg/kg droperidol, or 0.2 mg/kg metoclopramide. Patients were then observed for 24 hours after drug administration. Results: Complete control of established postoperative nausea and vomiting, defined as no emesis and no need for another rescue antiemetic medication, was more frequent among the patients who had received granisetron (88%) than among those who had received droperidol (55%) or metoclopramide (50%) (P< .05). The severity of nausea was less in patients who had received granisetron than in those who had received droperidol or metoclopramide (P< .05). No clinically adverse events were observed in any of the groups. Conclusion: Granisetron is more effective than droperidol or metoclopramide for the treatment of established postoperative nausea and vomiting during the first 3 hours after anesthesia in patients undergoing major gynecologic operations.

This paper presents a systematic approach for static Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) problem solution technique. TEP problem is formulated as an optimization problem and solved by a method based on a novel algorithm. The aim of TEP is to establish when and where to install new equipment and line for economic and reliable supply of the predicted load. Here the objective is to reduce the cost of proposed routes. The power balance at buses and line loading limits constraints are considered for selecting the new line connections. The proposed method has been applied to six bus representative system and result obtained is satisfactory. This method has been then applied to a real system i.e. 400KV, 8 bus system of West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Corporation Limited (WBSEDCL).

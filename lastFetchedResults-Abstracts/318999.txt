Objective: to review the clinical features and management of tuberculosis of the head and neck and
to identify those features which may aid diagnosis. Design: retrospective study. Setting: teaching hospital, England,
UK. Subjects: Twenty-three patients with tuberculosis of the head and neck diagnosed by culture of specimens
obtained by fine needle biopsy (n = 8) or by open biopsy of the lumps in the neck (n = 15) who presented between
1990 and 1993. Main outcome measures: methods of diagnosis and management. Results: thirteen of the 23
patients (57%) presented with either a flu&rant mass or a discharging sinus in the neck. Nine (39%) had
uncomplicated enlarged lymph nodes and 12 (55%) had systemic symptoms. The supraclavicular region was the
most common site (n = 11) and 8 of these 11 had abnormalities in the chest radiograph. In 3 patients the disease
was resistant to treatment with standard antituberculous treatment. Conclusions: atypical mycobacterial lymphadenitis
is usually resistant to standard antituberculous treatment, so it is essential to obtain a microbiological
diagnosis. Excision is usually the treatment of choice for such patients.

Objective
To compare pelvic floor symptoms at three years following instrumental delivery and cesarean section in the second stage of labor and to assess the impact of a subsequent delivery.
Study design
We conducted a prospective cohort study of 393 women with term, singleton, cephalic pregnancies who required instrumental vaginal delivery in theatre or cesarean section at full dilatation between February 1999 and February 2000. 283 women (72%) returned postal questionnaires at three years.
Results
Urinary incontinence at three years post delivery was greater in the instrumental delivery group as compared to the cesarean section group (10.5% vs 2.0%), OR 5.37 (95% CI, 1.7, 27.9). There were no significant differences in ano-rectal or sexual symptoms between the two groups. Pelvic floor symptoms were similar for women delivered by cesarean section after a failed trial of instrumental delivery compared to immediate cesarean section. A subsequent delivery did not increase the risk of pelvic floor symptoms at three years in either group.
Conclusion
An increased risk of urinary incontinence persists up to three years following instrumental vaginal delivery compared to cesarean section in the second stage of labor. However, pelvic floor symptoms are not exacerbated by a subsequent delivery.

This work studies the possibility of constructing an automatic control system capable of investigating itself and its environment by following a systematic experimentation algorithm and constructing a logical theory to explain the results of these experiments. It is proposed that the behaviour of the world must obey a logical theory. This logical world is equivalent to an &#8220;objective&#8221; world. On the basis of this second approach, an algorithm is proposed to enable any control system to systematically perform experiments and progressively construct a model of the world. The application of this algorithm is presented step by step in a simple example

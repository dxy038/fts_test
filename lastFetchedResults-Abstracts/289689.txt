Objective
To investigate association between cerebral microbleeds (CMB) and prior intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) on MRI and topographic correlation of the two types of lesions.
Patients and methods
Two hundred and sixty consecutive patients (67.0 Â± 11.1 years) with ischemic stroke were included. CMB and prior ICH were assessed on T2-gradient-echo MRI. The presence and number of CMB as predictors for prior ICH were examined. Topographic correlations between CMB and ICH lesions in patients with prior ICH in the infratentorial, basal ganglionic/thalamic and cortico-subcortical regions were tested.
Results
CMB were observed in 113 (43.5%) patients and a total of 50 prior primary ICH lesions were observed in 39 (15.0%) patients. Among the ICH lesions, 39 (78%) were asymptomatic. Presence of CMB (odds ratio 2.53, p = 0.015) and number of CMB (odds ratio 1.11, p < 0.001) were independent determinants for prior ICH. Topographic correlation between CMB and ICH was significant in the basal ganglionic/thalamic region (p = 0.017), but not in the infratentorial (p = 0.548) or cortico-subcortical regions (p = 0.389).
Conclusion
CMB were associated with prior ICH on MRI of patients with ischemic stroke. CMB in the basal ganglion or thalamus was associated with prior ICH in the same region.

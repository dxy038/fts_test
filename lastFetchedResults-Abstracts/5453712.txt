In this paper, a scheduling algorithm suitable for independent heterogeneous tasks on heterogeneous computing has been studied. With the objective to find the best point between matching and load balancing , the concept of task priority has been used to improve the existing algorithm, and the simulation of our algorithm has been performed .The results demonstrated that through prioritizing tasks, a balance between load balancing and shortest execution time has been reached, and better scheduling performance has been achieved.

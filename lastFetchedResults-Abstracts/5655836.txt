The next generation of simulations must directly support the architecture and architecture validation phases for complex systems. In order to achieve this objective an enterprise simulation environment is needed that meets the requirements of being highly scalable across different platforms and operating systems, uses architectural as well as classical constructs, can be used for multiple domains, is capable of integrating existing systems of many types and is relatively straight forward to use. The Enterprise Architecture Simulation Environment (EASE) is an attempt to develop an environment framework that meets these requirements. EASE is a service oriented development environment that contains four distinct organizations: connectivity specification, component development environments, general-purpose run-time tools, and a development library. Application types for EASE include enterprise architecture prototyping, system architecture validation, domain integration and distributed system development. Specific modeling and simulation developments might be multiple satellites, terminals and operations, port security, UAVs in commercial air space, asset allocation, data fusion, etc.

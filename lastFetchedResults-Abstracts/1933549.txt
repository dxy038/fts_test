The Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, is one of the most important species for commercial fisheries and a promising candidate for aquaculture. Precocious sexual maturation of males is one of the major issues compromising large scale production. The potential approaches to this problem include production of all female populations. Consequently, the objective of this study was to develop an effective protocol to induce meiotic gynogenesis in the Atlantic cod by using hydrostatic pressure shock. Our first experiment tested the relevance of gamete quality on achievement of chromosome manipulation and identified the best time interval between fertilization and pressure shock. Our second experiment was designed to determine the optimal pressure value and duration of the pressure shock. Eight combinations of pressure values and durations were tested. Among them, the 34.47 MPa/6 min combination gave the best survival rate (23.6 ± 3.9%), the highest percentage of normal larvae (15.7 ± 3.6%), and the highest percentage of meiotic diploids (88.89%). In both experiments, haploid controls served as an indirect reference for paternal DNA inactivation. Chromosome counting confirmed the restoration of diploidy in gynogenetic fish. The present study optimizes a procedure for the induction of meiotic gynogenesis in the Atlantic cod, thus laying the basis for further applications towards producing monosex and defining the sex determination system.

To minimize the cost, a mathematical model of multi-objective optimal design of 1-MJ superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) is proposed. With this model, the optimal shapes of the solenoidal coils and magnetic shields of eight configurations are explored simultaneously by means of finite-element method and evolution strategies. The occupied areas by undesired stray magnetic flux are also calculated for the active, passive, and combined shielding structures, respectively. Based upon above analyses, a design scheme, which has both acceptable technical performance and the lowest cost, is derived.

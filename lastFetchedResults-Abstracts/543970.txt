Hes1, a hairy and enhancer of split homolog, negatively regulates inner ear hair cell differentiation. The main objective of this study was to investigate the status of the Hes1 gene in the noise-damaged cochlea in relation to the degree of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Adult albino guinea pigs were exposed to white-band noise (115 dB sound pressure level). Noise exposure for either 1 or 3 hours induced significant elevations of threshold in auditory brainstem response (ABR) compared with unexposed controls. Succinate dehydrogenase staining showed that white-band noise exposure caused significant outer hair cell losses. In addition, we found significant up-regulations of cochlear Hes1 mRNA and protein expressions following acoustic trauma, and Hes1 mRNA expression was positively correlated with NIHL. These findings suggest that up-regulation of Hes1 expression in response to noise exposure may be one of the underlying mechanisms of NIHL.

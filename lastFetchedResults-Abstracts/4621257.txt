This paper introduces the fixed broadband wireless access (FBWA), being the cost effective solutions for wide area coverage and last mile delivery of a wide range of data, voice, video, multimedia, and high-speed Internet services. Its objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the FBWAS as follows. The first section provides reasons for introducing the FBWAS. The system definition, frequency reuses strategy, operation, network architecture, and various other FBWAS systems are discussed and explained in section 2. In the 3rd section, a typical digital radio system is first reviewed to point out the key parameters of the FBWAS. Based on this information, the equipments of all vendors, having participated the field trial, are considered and discussed. A detailed performance comparison is given. The 4th section proposes the key system performance metrics for evaluating a large FBWAS, having hundreds of cells and covering the entire country. Last is the conclusion and recommendation.

Under the service-oriented circumstances, each service may be offered by different providers with different non-functional Quality of Service (QoS) attributes. Since many existing services have similar QoS attributes, the efficiency of web service selection inevitably decreases with the increase of available services. Therefore, a selection process is needed to identify which constituent services are to be used to construct a composite service that best meets the QoS requirements of its users. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm can be used to resolve this multi-objective optimization problem. This paper presents a PSO-based web service selection method (PSOWSS) to resolve dynamic web services selection with QoS global optimal. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that PSOWSS is feasible and efficient in the process of service selection.

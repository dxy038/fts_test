Introduction: Lepotospirosis is most widespread zoonosis in the world and is prevalent in tropical and temperate regions. Diagnosis of leptospirosis by clinical symptoms is difficult due to lack of specified pathogenic signs and similarity of its clinical symptoms to some bacterial and viral febrile disease, so laboratory plays an important role and ELISA is a common serological method. Animal leptospirosis is common in regions of Iran where traditional and un mechanized husbandry are used. But human leptospirosis is only prevalent in Guilan and Mazandaran and is endemic in Giulan. Factors such as climate conditions, wild animals, rice plantations, environmental water and finally keeping pets by traditional ways all contribute to this disease in Guilan.
Objective: This study was done to determine the epidemiological characteristics of leptospirosis in Guilan. Materials and Methods: The sample of this study consisted of all suspected persons who referred to general hospitals of Guilan province. Blood samples were taken from these patients. All blood samples were examined by a commercial ELISA kit to detect positive cases and determine epidemiological features of this disease in this province.
Results: Findings show that most of positive cases belong to males (62.37%) than females (27.23%), and in farmers (86%) and in warm months (90% from first of Khordad to end of Sharivar), and its frequency in middle age (20 -- 50 year olds) was almost 65%.
Conclusion: The geographical spread of the disease was more in big cities of Guilan province where had more villages and were crowded as well. This study showed that most cases of disease was detected in people who are somehow involved in farming.

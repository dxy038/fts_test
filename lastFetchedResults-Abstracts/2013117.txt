 Introduction: Non-adherence to medical regimen has remained a challenge to the medical profession as well as to social sciences. To achieve positive results, the factorsnegatively impacting patient adherence to medical regimens (i.e., diet, drug andexercise regimen) must be scrutinized in detail. The objective of this research was toexplore the relationship between cognitive appraisal and adherence to medicalregimens in type 2 diabetic patients. Methods: In this correlational study, 218 type 2 diabetes patients receiving treatment atthe Diabetes Clinic affiliated with Gonabad University of Medical Sciences wereselected through non-probability (convenience) sampling from April 2012 to May2013. Two valid and reliable questionnaires of cognitive appraisal and adherence tomedical regimens were completed by each patient. The data were analyzed using SPSSver 13.Results: A relationship was observed between perceived cognitive and adherence tosome aspects of medical regimen. Also direct relationship was observedbetweenperceived cognitive in form challenge and adherence of diet in patients with diabetes.There was no statistically significant relationship between aspects of cognitiveappraisal and adherence to the drug regimen.Conclusion: The results suggest that interventions undertaken to improve adherence tomedical regimen, particularly to drug regimen in patients with type 2 diabetes, shouldbe focused on enriching cognitive appraisal. Nurses need to help patients perceivediabetes as less of a threat and in fact should empower them, so as to look upon it asmore of a challenge.

This paper presents development of Power Conditioning System(PCS) for a microturbine in vehicle. PCS is consist of a boost converter, a inverter for motoring a engine, a rectifier and a buck converter for 28 VDC generation. In vehicle application, PCS requires a optimization aspects of size, weight and efficiency. So, in this paper, PCS employed a high power bidirectional buck-boost converter by 4-2 kW converter in parallel and a inverter with sensorless vector control scheme. Also, for stable engine start-up under an extremely low temperature(-32degC), new start-up logic by constant current and constant output power control are proposed and ignition recognition logic is applied. Finally, experimental results are presented to verify performance of PCS.

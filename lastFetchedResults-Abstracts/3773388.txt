Scheduling is the process of devising or designing a procedure for a particular objective. Because of the dynamic domains that certain scheduling systems must solve, we have proposed an eight layer scheduling model that would aid in developing general scheduling systems. In the article our model is presented together with current scheduling systems researched. From these systems we have developed an object-oriented scheduling system, which is described from the design phase to the object implementation phase

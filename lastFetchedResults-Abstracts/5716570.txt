We study an interval scheduling problem in which each job j is associated with a time interval I<inf>j</inf>, a minimum a<inf>j</inf> and maximum b<inf>j</inf> required bandwidths, and a weight w<inf>j</inf>. We are given W colors. We need to assign to each job j between a<inf>j</inf> and b<inf>j</inf> colors, such that each color is assigned at each time to at most one interval. The weighted bandwidth allocated to job j is the number of colors allocated to it times |I<inf>j</inf>|, and the weighted bandwidth of a coloring is the sum of the weighted bandwidth of all jobs. The objective is to find a coloring with maximum weighted bandwidth. A coloring is (circularly) contiguous if the set of colors for each job forms an (circular) interval.

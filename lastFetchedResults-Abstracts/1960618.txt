The main objective of the present study is aimed to optimize the process parameters for the production of glucose from karanja seed cake. The Taguchi robust design method with L9 orthogonal array was applied to optimize hydrolysis reaction conditions and maximize sugar yield. Effect of temperature, acid concentration, and acid to cake weight ratio were considered as the main influencing factors which effects the percentage of glucose and amount of glucose formed. The experimental results indicated that acid concentration and liquid to solid ratio had a principal effect on the amount of glucose formed when compared to that of temperature. The maximum glucose formed was 245 g/kg extractive free cake.

The single-Sequence (SS) is simply a sequence of integers 1, 2, 3, ..., n. But it leads a unique set of ABLR-relations (above. below, left-of, right-of) that hold among n objects on a plane. In this paper, we propose a fast packing algorithm based on SS, For an SS, we generate direct relation set (DRS) for each room. The module packing is directly obtained from DRS in linear time. DRS can be reused for all packing under the same floorplan. This will dramatically speed up the computation. As a feature of SS, this algorithm covers all possible placements. if our objective is in bounding-box area minimization. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is pretty fast and efficient compared with the performances attained by conventional algorithms.

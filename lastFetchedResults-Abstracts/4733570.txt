For the prevention and mitigation of geological hazards such as earthquakes, landslides, floods and land subsidence, techniques for geological hazard management, assessment and prediction must be developed. To enable this, geological hazard prevention related data must be constructed, analyzed and distributed to customers. The objective of this study is to construct a geological hazard related spatial database (SDB), and develop an information system to use that database (DB). To achieve this objective, an SDB including geological hazards, basic maps, damageable objects, satellite imagery, meteorological data and terrain analysis data was constructed using GIS, and a geological hazard spatial information system was developed. Except for the landslide and mine map DB, the SDB covered most of South Korea. The SDB was formed at national (1:1,000,000), regional (1:250,000) and medium (1:50,000) scales separately, and related to each map index and administrative district unit. To retrieve the SDB, a geological hazard prevention spatial information system was designed and developed. In this information system, the SDB output can be selected according to scale and locality, and different types of data and can be retrieved

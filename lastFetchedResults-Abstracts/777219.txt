This paper presents a new method for the optimisation of the mirror element spacing arrangement and operating temperature of linear
Fresnel reflectors (LFR). The specific objective is to maximise available power output (i.e. exergy) and operational hours whilst minimising
cost. The method is described in detail and compared to an existing design method prominent in the literature. Results are given
in terms of the exergy per total mirror area (W/m2) and cost per exergy (US $/W). The new method is applied principally to the optimisation
of an LFR in Gujarat, India, for which cost data have been gathered. It is recommended to use a spacing arrangement such that
the onset of shadowing among mirror elements occurs at a transversal angle of 45 . This results in a cost per exergy of 2.3 $/W. Compared
to the existing design approach, the exergy averaged over the year is increased by 9% to 50 W/m2 and an additional 122 h of operation
per year are predicted. The ideal operating temperature at the surface of the absorber tubes is found to be 300  C. It is concluded
that the new method is an improvement over existing techniques and a significant tool for any future design work on LFR systems.

We present a bidirectional, occlusion-aware temporal frame interpolation (BOA-TFI) scheme that builds upon our recently proposed highly scalable video coding scheme. Unlike previous TFI methods, our scheme attempts to put &#8220;correct&#8221; information in problematic regions around moving objects. From a &#8220;parent&#8221; motion field between two existing reference frames, we compose motion from both reference frames to the target frame. These motion fields, together with motion discontinuity information, are then warped to the target frame - a process during which we discover valuable information about disocclusions, which we then use to guide the bidirectional prediction of the interpolated frame. The scheme can be used in any state-of-the-art codec, but is most beneficial if used in conjunction with a highly scalable video coder. Evaluation of the method on synthetic data allows us to shine a light on problematic regions around moving object boundaries, which has not been the focus of previous frame interpolation methods. The proposed frame interpolation method yields credible results, and compares favourably to current state-of-the-art frame interpolation methods.

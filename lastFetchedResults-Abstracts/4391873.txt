The implementation of a Power Quality monitoring system can be a complex task. Number of instruments, selection of sites and monitored parameters as well as the final presentation of results strongly depend on the objective of the monitoring. Six major monitoring objectives are identified by the CIGRE/CIRED joint working group C4.112 &#8220;Guidelines for Power quality monitoring - measurement locations, processing and presentation of data&#8221;: compliance verification, performance assessment, site characterization, troubleshooting, advanced applications and studies and active PQ management. Based on the intensive work and discussion within the working group the paper describes possible implementation processes for selected objectives by particular case studies. For each case the key aspects for a successful and efficient implementation are summarized. The main intention of the paper is to provide some guidelines to network operators with less experience in the field of Power Quality monitoring.

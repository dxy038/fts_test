This paper presents an experimental approach for the selection of the encoding configuration providing the highest PQoS in the context of DVB-H mobile television application. The approach is based on the classification of the video program genre and takes into account external constraints, such as network bit rate capacity available. The approach is established by using an objective method for measuring the quality of video as perceived by an end-user (perceived quality of service - PQoS). This objective video measurement method builds on earlier developments, which are improved to be applicable to MPEG-4/AVC and MPEG-4/SVC encoding formats following a no reference design. Numerous encoding configurations have been applied to many video program types in the framework of IST ENTHRONE project, in order to establish experimentally the mapping between PQoS and encoding configuration, and validate the approach.

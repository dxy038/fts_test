Objective: The aim of this study ‎was to evaluate suicide ‎probability in Iranian males with ‎substance abuse or dependence ‎disorder and to investigate the ‎predictors of suicide probability ‎based on trait mindfulness, ‎reasons for living and severity of ‎general psychiatric symptoms‏. ‏
Method: Participants were 324 ‎individuals with substance abuse ‎or dependence in an outpatient ‎setting and prison. Reasons for ‎living questionnaire, Mindfulness ‎Attention Awareness Scale and ‎Suicide probability Scale were ‎used as instruments. Sample ‎was selected based on ‎convenience sampling method. ‎Data were analyzed using SPSS ‎and AMOS‏.‏
Results: The life-time ‎prevalence of suicide attempt in ‎the outpatient setting was35% ‎and it was 42% in the prison ‎setting. Suicide probability in the ‎prison setting was significantly ‎higher than in the outpatient ‎setting (p < 0.001).  The severity of ‎general symptom strongly ‎correlated with suicide ‎probability. Trait mindfulness, not ‎reasons for living beliefs, had a ‎mediating effect in the ‎relationship between the severity ‎of general symptoms and suicide ‎probability. Fear of social ‎disapproval, survival and coping ‎beliefs and child-related ‎concerns significantly predicted ‎suicide probability (p < 0.001). ‎
Discussion: It could be ‎suggested that trait mindfulness ‎was more effective in preventing ‎suicide probability than beliefs ‎about reasons for living in ‎individuals with substance abuse ‎or dependence disorders.  The ‎severity of general symptom ‎should be regarded as an ‎important risk factor of suicide ‎probability.‎

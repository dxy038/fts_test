In this paper we investigate Multi-Objective Integer Linear Programming (MOILP) problems
with unbounded feasible region and introduce recession direction for MOILP problems. Then
we present necessary and sufficient conditions to have unbounded feasible region and infinite
optimal values for objective functions of MOILP problems. Finally we present some examples
with unbounded feasible region and finite and infinite efficient solution.

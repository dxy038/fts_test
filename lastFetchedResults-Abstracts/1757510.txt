Aim: Myostatin gene or growth and differentiation factor 8 (GDF8) which has been identified as the factor causing muscle doubling, undergoes a series of mutations that causes gene inactivation. In bovine the loss of gene activity has been associated with double- muscled phenotype.. Due to the role of myostatin gene in muscle development, the objective of this study was to analyze the coding region containing mutations which potentially altering the myostatin gene expression in Farahani sheep.
Material and methods: DNA from blood samples of eighty six Farahani sheep was extracted and used to amplify a 337-bp fragment in myostatin gene. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the PCR product was performed by addition of  enzyme and then PCR-RFLP genotypes were analyzed.
Result: Genotype frequencies of MM, Mm and mm were characterized as 0.046, 0.127 and 0.827, respectively. In addition the allelic frequencies for alleles M and m was estimated as 0.11 and 0.89 respectively.
Conclusion: The results of this study indicated that the Farahani sheep was polymorphic for myostatin, but this population was not at Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium.

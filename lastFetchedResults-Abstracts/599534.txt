Background and Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional outcome of unstable pelvic ring factures (Tile B and C) and to compare the outcomes of surgical and non- surgical treatment methods in the patients admitted to Emam Khomeini and Razi hospitals in Ahwaz, Iran. 
Subject and Methods: This prospective–cross sectional study was carried out during five years period from 2006-2010. Patients with unstable pelvic ring fractures (Tile B and  C types) treated by open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) or closed reduction and skeletal traction. The mean follow up time was 22 months and the results of both groups were evaluated by Majeed scoring system.
Result: A total of 40 patients with unstable pelvic ring fracture (20 patients had type B and 20 others had type C (Tile classification) were included. The mean score in type B fracture treated non-operatively was 78.36±9.01 (good) and in surgical group was 83.55±7.53 (good). In type C, mean score in non- surgical group was 64.11±8.3 (fair) and in surgical group was 75.81±12.36 (good). Mean score in all patients treated surgically was 79.3±11.11 and in non-surgically treated was 71.95±11.19 that shows a significant difference (P=0.044).
Conclusion: No significant difference was observed between surgical and skeletal traction treatment for type B pelvic ring fractures, but surgical treatment was associated with a rate of more good results than skeletal traction in type C pelvic fractures.

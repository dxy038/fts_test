The present work shows a real case of an industrial plant in Mexico and the solution of problems in the electric system caused by the damage of a static VAr compensator. With help of a power system simulation we could evaluate several alternatives of solution and determine which is better from the technical and economic point of view to be applied. The objective was to improve the conditions of electric system through a low cost solution and quick application.

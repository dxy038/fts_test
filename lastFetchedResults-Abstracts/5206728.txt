This paper presents new tuning rules for fractional PI control of processes that are typically found in process control. The rules are based on characterization of process dynamics by three parameters that can be obtained from a simple step response experiment. The rules are obtained by minimizing a frequency objective function subject to a constraint on the maximum sensitivity. Comparisons with classical tuning rules show that they are very simple but give substantially better performance.

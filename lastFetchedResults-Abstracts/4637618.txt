The problem of accurate parameter estimation of elliptical shapes is addressed. Three methods based on elliptical Fourier descriptors, area moments, and perimeter moments of 2-D elliptical shapes are presented. The mathematics of these methods is discussed and, for area moments, a set of new formulas based on GaussÂ´s theorem is given. To implement a comparative performance study, a method developed by R. Safaee-Rad et al. (1990), the weighted minimum-square-error (MSE) function, is included, and an objective and independent measure of goodness of fit is used. The performance of these methods is compared for two different cases, that of a perfect simulated ellipse and an imperfect imaged ellipse

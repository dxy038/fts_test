The most economical operation of modern power systems is to provide the power generation optimally from different units with possible lowest cost by trying to meet all the system Constraints. This work necessitates an answer to security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem with an objective function incorporating equality and inequality constraints of the system. The objective of the problem will be solved using multiple optimization function. The constraints such as real power operating limits, power balance, minimum up and down time, emission, spinning reserve etc. will be subjected to project a solution to the problem by using BAT procedure. The performance of the proposed method is implemented in MATLAB working platform and the performance is evaluated with the testing system of 3-unit and 10-unit system.

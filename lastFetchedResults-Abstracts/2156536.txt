Today, quantitative methods for prediction are become the most important tools for decision making in major investments in the market and capitalism. The most important parameter in prediction is the method of prediction. The main objective the current study is to accurately predicted earnings management using neural networks and decision tree is compared with linear models. For this purpose, nine affecting variables on earnings management considered as independent variables and accruals used as the dependent variable in the current study. In this study, both agriculture and the textile industries are selected for the study during 2008-2012. For testing the hypotheses the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, feed forward neural network and decision tree data mining techniques were used to evaluate Cart. The results of this study showed that the neural network approach and linear decision tree methods adopted towards more accurate prediction of earnings management with error level is less obvious. Relationships between the dependent variable with the independent variables can be said, discretionary accruals prior period earnings management variables (DAI), nondiscretionary accruals prior threshold function (THOD) and pay for performance sensitivity (PPS) method, regression, neural networks and Cart had most relation. With respect the results of the study that revealed the existence of earnings management, it is strongly recommended to the financial statements users to employ alternative in order to monitoring to management decisions; so more monitoring as well overnighting may reduce opportunistic incentives of management for the earnings management.

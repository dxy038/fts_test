In this paper, we propose a method of combining some interacting multiple model-extended Viterbi (IMM-EV) algorithms for target tracking. The objective of the proposed scheme is to take the maximum advantage of the combined strengths of some IMM-EV algorithms so as to achieve better performance and/or computational efficiency than the IMM and some tracking algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate the aforementioned goal can be achieved.

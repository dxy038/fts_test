The paper focuses on the synthesis and evaluation analysis of nuclear safeguard relevant information based on linguistic assessment. After a hierarchical analysis of StatesÂ´ nuclear activities on the basis of the IAEA Physical Model, the objective addressed is divided into several less complex levels. We then focus on the aggregation process in every level with consideration of the different kinds of qualitative criteria, like the strength degree of indicator and reliability of information, while we consider symbolic approach acts by direct computation on labels instead of the approximation approach using an associated membership function. In this context, several kinds of presented aggregation operators within the symbolic approach are analyzed. The overall evaluation of objectives can be obtained step by step, from aggregation of several lower levels. A case study on the application of these aggregation operators to the fusion of safeguards to relevant information is provided

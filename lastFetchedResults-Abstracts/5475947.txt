Since 2002, improving road safety has been a main issue in policies for transport and mobility in Europe. In Belgium, the Federal Commission for the Road Safety had defined an objective of reducing the number of deaths on Belgian roads to 500 by 2015. Then, this research aims to improve road safety on Belgian roads by developing a multicriteria decision aid model for the evaluation of sustainable road safety on secondary rural roads. In this preliminary study, we describe the approach which led us to the development of the first elements of our methodology. At first, we define the set of criteria that structures the problem, and then, we apply them to a specific case study - the redevelopment of the N243a. Finally, we analyze the results to prove the complexity of this type of problems and to point out the usefulness of a multicriteria decision aid methodology to resolve them.

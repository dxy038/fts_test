In this paper, we examine an adaptive deblocking deringing filter for mobile video sequences in H.263 format. The considered filter has been designed with reference to the constraints of computational complexity and working memory of mobile terminals. The post filter suggested by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in Recommendation H.263 App. III is also included as a reference. Given that fidelity metrics such as the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) do not necessarily correlate well with video quality as experienced by the user, we consider in this paper objective quality metrics that can incorporate knowledge about the userÂ´s perception into the quality assessment. Guidelines for choosing filter parameters in relation to user-perceived video quality are obtained from the numerical results

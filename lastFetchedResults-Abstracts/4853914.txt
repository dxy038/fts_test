Coordination is one of the key issues in cooperative multiagent systems and it also plays an essential role in disaster management. Task allocation is an important part of the coordination problem since the decomposition of the objective into tasks is the most natural way to organize work among agents. Therefore, in this paper we propose a task allocation approach that considers the existence of local and global information in order to coordinate the agents in the RoboCup Rescue. Moreover, we present a comparative analysis between the results obtained by the agents which implement our approach and the sample agents provided in the RoboCup Rescue simulator.

In most research papers, the industrial car sequencing problem, as defined during the ROADEF 2005 Challenge, has been tackled by organizing objectives in a hierarchy. However from a decision-making viewpoint it would be interesting to tackle this problem in a Pareto sense. Indeed, tackling the problem in Pareto sense can offer greater latitude to a manager by presenting him several alternative solutions. In this paper, we suggest to adapt the GISMOO algorithm to solve the industrial car sequencing problem. A comparison of the performance is carried out using well-known published algorithms and proves an advantage for GISMOO. As well, we aim to demonstrate the relevance of handling applied problems such as the industrial car sequencing problem using a Pareto multi-objective approach.

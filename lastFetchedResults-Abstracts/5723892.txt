Two of the most significant video quality degradations produced by digital compression in codecs are image blurring and distortion of edges in areas of motion. These degradations become more evident at reduced transmission rates. Two objective measures of video quality, one based on Laplacian and the other on Sobel gradient operators, are proposed. They are validated with desktop video teleconferencing (VTC) data for digital networks with sequences containing significant motion and complex detail. The measured results are compared over a range of transmission bit rates. The sensitivity and reliability of the measures are enhanced by determining the optimum Gray level thresholds for computing the measures. Both measures correlate well with transmission rate and subjective opinion of the video quality, particularly for blurring

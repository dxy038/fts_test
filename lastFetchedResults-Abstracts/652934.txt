In spring, windblown dust storms originating in the deserts of Mongolia and China make their way to Taipei city. These occurrences are known as Asian dust storm (ADS) events. The objective of this study was to assess the possible associations of ADS on the hospital stroke admissions of residents in Taipei, Taiwan, during the period from 1996 to 2001. We identified 54 dust storm episodes, which were classified as index days. Daily stroke admissions on the index days were compared with admissions on the comparison days. We selected two comparison days for each index day, 7 days before the index days and 7 days after the index days. The study results indicated a statistically significant association between ADS events and daily primary intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke admissions 3 days after the event (relative risk of 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01â€“10.10). We also found a positive but nonsignificant association between ADS events and ischemic stroke admissions 3 days following the dust storms. This was due mainly to PM10. We conclude that more attention be given to ADS events and health in the future.

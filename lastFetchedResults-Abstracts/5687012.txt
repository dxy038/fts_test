The main objective of this research is to study the effect on gold nanostructures (~10 nm diameter size) deposited in highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), by measuring coherent phonon spectroscopy with ultrashort (7.5 fs) laser pulses. The gold average thickness d was varied from 2 to 40 &#8491;. We focused on the influence of gold nanoparticles in the interlayer shearing mode E<sub>2g</sub>, whose energy is about 1.3 THz. We found a destructive interference of the phonon oscillations to decrease the intensity spectral peak which was critical for d=1.8 nm.

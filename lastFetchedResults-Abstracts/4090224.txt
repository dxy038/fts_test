Multiterminal converters are used in hybrid energy systems as a replacement for several conventional two-terminal converters to reduce volume and cost. This paper proposes a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) based on a bidirectional z-source nine-switch inverter. A unidirectional z-source nine-switch inverter, which was proposed by the authors, has been improved to allow bidirectional power flow. The proposed converter has two ac and one dc bidirectional terminals that can be used in HEV. Performance of the proposed HEV has been verified by simulation and experimental results.

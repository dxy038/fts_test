The Navy\Â´s Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) program is the next-generation UHF satellite communications system for the US Department of Defense. General Dynamics and Ericsson Inc. (as part of the Lockheed Martin (LM) team) has-for the Component Advanced Development (CAD) phase of the program-installed a 3G (third generation) cellular "trial system", that was used as a testbed for demonstrations of MUOS communications services. To support the MUOS communication demonstrations, a global telecommunications network was constructed interconnecting several system nodes in the continental United States, as well as the global DSN (defense switched network), PSTN and two satellite systems. The heart of the system resides in Scottsdale, Arizona, and consists of two trailers that contain the core network (CN) and radio access network (RAN) of the "trial system". Three radio base stations (RJBS) were connected to the radio network controller (RNC) in the RAN to allow users to communicate wirelessly and securely through the cellular system to other wireless users, DSN phones, PSTN phones, Navy legacy communication systems, public internet, plus public and private servers. The Lockheed-Martin/General Dynamics Team won this competition, and has recently completed the integrated baseline review. The team is now working on implementing the MUOS Program.

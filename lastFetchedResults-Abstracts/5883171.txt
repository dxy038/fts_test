This paper presents a new algorithm for subspace clustering for high dimensional data. It is an iterative algorithm based on the minimization of an objective function. A major weakness of subspace clustering algorithms is that almost all of them are developed based on within- class information only or by employing both within-cluster and between- clusters information. The density of cluster is lost. The new function is developed by integrating the separation and compactness of clusters. The density of cluster is introduced also in the compactness term. The experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm gives good results on different types of images by optimizing the runtime.

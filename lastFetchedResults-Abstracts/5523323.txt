The paper discusses an idea of representing brand image on a computer and simulating associations and interactions among multiple pieces of brand image. Brand image is represented using a fuzzy set based on the theory of brand personality, which is a theory to represent brand image indirectly by a set of human characteristics associated with a brand. An convenient feature of the representation is generality that image of any kind of brands could be defined on the same universal set. The interactions among multiple pieces of image are simulated using the framework of conceptual fuzzy set which is realized as combination of two fuzzy bidirectional associative memories.

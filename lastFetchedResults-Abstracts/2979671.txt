This paper presents a new data path synthesis algorithm which solves two important design problems: scheduling and allocation with power minimization as a key design objective. Based on the observations found in prior work on synthesis for low power we derive an integer programming formulation for solving the problem. We then develop a stepwise approximation algorithm utilizing the formulation to carry out the scheduling and allocation in an integrated fashion. Our experimentation results show that the algorithm is quite effective, producing designs with significant savings in power consumption

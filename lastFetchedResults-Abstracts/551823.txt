Background and Objective: Antibody secretion in human may be the result of the changes in protein structure. Probably these changes in protein structure or polymorphism in human thyroid peroxidase (TPO) gene is the reason for presence of the anti TPO. In this study, we examined the association of T2229/C exon 12 polymorphism of TPO gene in respect to anti-TPO level.
Materials and Methods: In this study 168 individuals (47±2 years) were selected as case and control groups based on anti-TPO titer above and below 100 IU/L. PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain reaction- restriction fragment length polymorphism) was used to amplify the segment of exon 12 polymorphism. Results: In exon 12 the allele frequencies were 0.8698 for C allele and 0.1301 for T allele and there was no significant association between this polymorphism and anti-TPO level (CC=127.5± 308 IU/ml vs. TT=126±224 IU/ml).
Conclusion: This study indicated that there is no significant association between anti-TPO levels and T2229/C exon 12 polymorphisms. Meanwhile, selected SNP of exon 12 directly has no effect on anti-TPO levels.

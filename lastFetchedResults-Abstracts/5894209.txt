This paper proposes an informative differential evolution with self adaptive re-clustering (IDE-SAR) technique to solve the optimal energy and spinning reserve scheduling problem of a wind-thermal power system. The goal of the paper is to solve an economic dispatch problem, and to find optimal allocation of energy and spinning reserves among the thermal and wind generators available to serve the demand. The stochastic behavior of wind speed and wind power is represented by Weibull probability density function. The total cost minimization objective includes cost of energy provided by conventional thermal generators and wind generators, cost of reserves provided by conventional thermal generators. It also includes costs due to over-estimation and under-estimation of available wind power. In order to show the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed frame work, various case studies are presented for conventional and wind-thermal power system considering the provision of spinning reserves.

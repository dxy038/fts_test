 Background Due to variability of pleural fluid ADA measures in
                            pleural tuberculosis, researchers have recommended the necessity of
                            regional studies for determination of specific regional values.
                            Objectives The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the values
                            of pleural fluid ADA in diagnosis of Tuberculous pleural effusion in
                            South Khorasan province. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted
                            on patients &gt; 12 years old with exudative pleural effusion in
                            South Khorasan province (east of Iran). Light criteria were used to
                            define exudative effusion. Total ADA was determined calorimetrically by
                            Diazyme ADA assay. The data were analyzed using t test, ANOVA and
                            χ<sup>2</sup> tests through Spss 16 version software.
                            Results We studied 255 cases including 139 (54.5%) males and 116 (45.5%)
                            females with mean age of 63.8 ± 18 years. There were 36 (14.1%) cases
                            with Tuberculous pleural effusion and 219 (85.9%) cases of
                            non-Tuberculous pleural effusion. Malignant and acute bacterial
                            infection comprise 106 (41.6%) and 29 cases (11.4%), respectively. The
                            mean levels and optimal cut off point of ADA in Tuberculous pleural
                            effusion were40.2 ± 24.7 and 30 IU/L respectively. ADA in Tuberculous
                            pleural effusion showed negative correlation with age (r = -0.40, p =
                            0.01), but weak positive correlation with fluid protein(r = 0.44, P =
                            0.007) and LDH (r = 0.32, P = 05). Conclusions Mean and cut off point of
                            ADA was relatively low in patients with Tuberculous pleural effusion in
                            South Khorasan province. The age of patients and fluid levels of
                            protein, and LDH must be considered in interpretation of pleural fluid
                            ADA levels.

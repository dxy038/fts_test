The matching of electromechanical loads to a photovoltaic array is analyzed. The main objective is to present a relatively simple procedure to obtain the optimum sizing parameters (voltage, current, power) of the photovoltaic system in direct-coupled systems. An optimization algorithm is used to solve the problem with the objective of maximizing the mechanical energy developed by the motor. The approach is used in a system comprising a separately excited motor driving two mechanical loads: a viscous friction load and a rotodynamic load. In either system the rated power of the array should be two times the rated power of the load. The rated current and voltage of the array are selected based on the load torque constant

Hybrid wind-photovoltaic-storage system is a promising way to integrate grid for wind and solar energy. In this paper, a scheme that can help the hybrid system operate in a high efficient mode is proposed. Generation scheduling curve of the hybrid system and minimum charge-discharge times of battery are taken as objective functions, while the state-of-charge (SOC) of the battery and the change rate of the active power are taken into account in the constraints. In order to utilize the overload capability of battery fully and get a better control performance, the output of battery energy station is dependent on the SOC and its current state. The validity of proposed scheme is illustrated by models in SIMULINK.

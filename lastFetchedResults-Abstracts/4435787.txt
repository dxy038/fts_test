TINA (Telecommunications Information Networking Architecture) is a world-wide initiative with the objective of defining an architecture for the future telecommunications infrastructure, which should be able to handle multimedia services. This paper investigates and discusses the concepts currently available in the TINA architecture to model multimedia services. The focus of the paper is targeted towards the support for describing, requiring and setting up the necessary multimedia connections between the parties involved in distributed multimedia services. By means of an example, we illustrate how the TINA modeling concepts can be successfully applied to the description of a multimedia conferencing service scenario

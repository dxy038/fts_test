The authors present two optimization models for decision support tools for selecting available programs in the market. Information on reliability and cost of the available programs are considered as basic criteria for the selection. These models apply to software packages that consist of several programs where each, upon execution, performs a different function as required by the user. The objective is to maximize the average reliability of the software package, considering the tradeoff between reliability and cost of the programs. In model one, redundancy of the programs is not considered; thus, the authors select one program for each function. In model two, redundancy is considered: thus, the authors identify the optimal set of programs for each function. They begin with a discussion of the underlying concepts that rationalize the composition of the models

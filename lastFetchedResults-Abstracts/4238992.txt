Many different quality metrics have been proposed an order to evaluate the reconstructed quality of compressed sequences. The most used measures are quantitative metrics based on a simple difference between frames. Their main drawback is that they do not correlate well with subjective quality evaluations. Up to now the only standardized method used to estimate the perceived quality of a coding system is the subjective assessment: a series of test scenes is shown to a number of selected observers, in a controlled environment. This method of quality evaluation shows limits in term of time consumption and results´ interpretation. The purpose of many recent studies is to develop objective measures having good correlation with subjective quality scores in relation to the same video system and test scenes. A number of parameters influence the viewers´ judgment of the sequence quality; in this paper we analyze the sequence motion effects on the viewers video quality perception. This paper proposes preliminary results in terms of the correlation between a linear model, that takes into account the &#8220;criticality&#8221; of the scene motion, and the results of formal subjective assessments.

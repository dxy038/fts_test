A CSCL environment provides support to manage collaborative tasks. However, these systems do not usually provide the personalization features required to adapt the learning experience to the student needs, a drawback that can affect the collaboration objective and ultimately a successful learning. To alleviate this disadvantage we propose an architecture that provides adaptive collaboration support for a CSCL environment framed in an open and standards-based LMS. Our proposal combines adaptation rules defined in IMS Learning Design specification and dynamic support through recommendations via an accessible and adaptive guidance system. The implementation offers CSCL courses following a methodology called Collaborative Logical Framework. This system has been tested on a real world scenario at the Madrid Science Week 2009.

This paper introduces a new development for modelling the time-dependent probability of failure on demand of parallel architectures, and illustrates its application to multi-objective optimization of proof testing policies for safety instrumented systems. The model is based on the mean test cycle, which includes the different evaluation intervals that a module goes periodically through its time in service: test, repair and time between tests. The model is aimed at evaluating explicitly the effects of different test frequencies and strategies (i.e. simultaneous, sequential and staggered). It includes quantification of both detected and undetected failures, and puts special emphasis on the quantification of the contribution of the common cause failure to the system probability of failure on demand as an additional component. Subsequently, the paper presents the multi-objective optimization of proof testing policies with genetic algorithms, using this model for quantification of average probability of failure on demand as one of the objectives. The other two objectives are the system spurious trip rate and lifecycle cost. This permits balancing of the most important aspects of safety system implementation. The approach addresses the requirements of the standard IEC 61508. The overall methodology is illustrated through a practical application case of a protective system against high temperature and pressure of a chemical reactor.

This paper investigate the cross-layer design for the packet scheduling and adaptive resource allocation for multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The proposed algorithm executes fair scheduling at MAC layer and makes efficient use of wireless resource at PHY layer. Our objective is to develop a MAC-PHY layer scheduling mechanism in a more practical environment that users receive signal with different SNR level in a cell. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme satisfy most users in various SNR and have better average performance in packet drop rate, packet delay and total throughput.

Advanced interference mitigation techniques relying on multipoint coordination have attracted significant attention from the wireless industry and academia in the past few years. In 3GPP LTE-Advanced, a work item on Coordinated Multiple Point transmission and reception (CoMP) was initiated in September 2011, and it is one of the core features of Release 11. The objective of this work item is to provide the necessary specification support to efficiently realize the benefits of cooperative transmission in the downlink and cooperative reception in the uplink. This article discusses the specification support for CoMP and the motivations behind the specific design choices. The deployment scenarios that were considered for the application of CoMP in Release 11 are also presented.

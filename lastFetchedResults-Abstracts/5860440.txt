In this paper, a model that combining cell population and genetic regulation within a single cell by using stochastic hybrid systems is proposed. The objective is to study the response of a population of cancer cells to various drugs that targeting the proliferation and survival pathways. The proposed model captures both the dynamics of the cell population and the dynamics of gene regulations within each individual cell. We use drug Lapatinib applied to colon cancer cell line HCT-116 as an example to validate the proposed model. Simulation results demonstrate the phenomena that observed in TGen experiments.

The primary aim was to study the association between preoperative depression and long-term survival after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Our secondary objective was to analyze the association between depression and cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality. In a nationwide, population-based, cohort study, all patients who underwent CABG in Sweden from 1997 to 2008 were included from the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies registry. Individual-level data were cross-linked from other national Swedish registers. Depression status and outcomes were obtained from the National Patient Register. The study population was 56,064 patients who underwent primary, isolated, nonemergent CABG. We identified 324 patients (0.6%) with depression before CABG. During a mean follow-up of 7.5Â years, 114 patients (35%) with depression died, compared with 13,767 patients (25%) in the control group. Depression was significantly associated with increased mortality and the combined end point of death or rehospitalization for myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke (multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals] 1.65 [1.37 to 1.99] and 1.61 [1.38 to 1.89], respectively). In conclusion, we found a strong and significant association between depression and long-term survival in patients with established ischemic heart disease who underwent CABG. Depression was also associated with an increased risk for a combination of death or rehospitalization for heart failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke.

 : Detection of subclinical recurence after surgical resection of esophageal cancer would allow earlier treatment of recurrent disease and potentially offer a better outcome for rescue therapy.
 : The utility of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assay was evaluated in the management of patients with esophageal cancer.
 : Serum carcinoembryonic antigen was measured preoperatively in 74 patients. Elevation of the CEA level (>5 ng/mL) was present in 14 patients (19%). There was no relationship between preoperative CEA elevation and the stage of the tumor or the patients' survival. Eighty-three patients had CEA assay at regular follow-up intervals after resection. Objective evidence of recurrent disease was determined at similar intervals by chest radiography and abdominal and thoracic computed tomography scans. During follow-up, 53 of 83 patients developed recurrence. Postoperative elevation of CEA levels occurred in 32 patients, resulting in a sensitivity of 55% for detecting recurrent disease. Twenty-nine of the 32 patients who developed CEA elevation had objective evidence of metastatic disease. In 13 patients, the rise in CEA levels predated objective evidence of recurrence by a median of 4 months (range 3 to 35), and in 16 patients, it occurred concomitantly. The specificity with which an elevated postoperative CEA level indicated recurrence was high, 90%, with a positive predictive value of 91%.
 : Postoperative CEA elevation is highly predictive of recurrent disease. In 16% of patients, elevation of CEA was the earliest objective sign of recurrence; such elevation should prompt consideration of adjuvant therapy

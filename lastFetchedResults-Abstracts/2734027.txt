Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are seen to be a step forward in transportation electrification, to replace internal combustion engine (ICE)-based conventional vehicles. However, to consider the vehicle-to-home (V2H) and home-to-vehicle (H2V) capabilities, new energy control strategy has to be developed to avoid new peaks consumption. This paper presents a novel controller based on fuzzy logic, which integrates an objective state-of-charge (SoC) for V2H application. The V2H capability is used when the PHEV is connected to the home to help the grid to meet the household loads during peak period. The SoC objective is the minimum SoC that the PHEV has to have when the driver connects the PHEV to the home. The proposed controller is applied on fourth different scenario.

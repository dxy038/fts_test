An objective methodology for the specification and synthesis of communicating processes is presented. It is demonstrated that algebraic operators can be used to formulate communicating processes in terms of behavioral constraints and that the corresponding state-machine-type process descriptions can be derived automatically or synthesized from these formulations. The behavioral constraints serve as high-level specifications for communicating processes. These constraints indicate the desired behavior of a process, possibly embedded in a system, by defining its range. The proposed approach is shown to be applicable to a common problem which concerns the synthesis of the central module serving a number of clients in a specific distributed system configuration

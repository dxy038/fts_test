Supplier selection and assignment of orders to potential suppliers are among the most important functions of supply chain management. In this research, a multi-objective supplier selection and assignment of orders to the suppliers under uncertainty is presented.  The first objective is minimizing the total cost including purchasing cost of products, shipping and ordering cost. The second objective aims to minimize the delay by the supplier due to the uncertainty, while the third objective tries to maximum the weighted risk of the selected suppliers. Suppliersâ€™ weights are obtained using Fuzzy TOPSIS method because of uncertainty involved. In the proposed model, products are purchased under quantity discounts where sign function is exercised to obtain an efficient formulation. Due to the complexity of the proposed model, two meta-heuristic algorithms i.e., NSGA-II and MOPSO are applied for solving it. Finally, efficiency of the algorithms are evaluated using quantitative measures.

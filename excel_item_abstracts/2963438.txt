A way of integrating the different information processing methods is discussed. The types of integrations are defined by the relations between the different information processing methods to be integrated. By classifying these methods the type of integration is classified. This discussion reveals the most feasible way of integrating the different schemes. It is a sequence of integrating the methods via knowledge processing. Based on this discussion two important types of integrations are studied

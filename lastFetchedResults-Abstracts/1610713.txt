The objective of this paper was to present a comprehensive analysis including analytical and numerical models which were developed to predict the performance of a solar chimney power plant in Kerman, Iran. The numerical model results including air temperature, velocity and electrical power output were validated by comparing with experimental data of the Manzanares prototype power plant. Also the mathematical model was verified with the practical power output of the Kerman pilot plant. Also in this paper, a novel approach to evaluate the influence of the site altitude on the potential of solar chimney power plants was presented and thereby a coefficient called altitude effectiveness was defined using Manzanares prototype geometrical parameters in different site altitudes. The developed model was applied to improve the performance of a solar chimney pilot power plant built in Kerman, Iran. Based on an approximate cost model, the thermo-economic optimal configurations of the pilot power plant were illustrated; and also it was found that the chimney diameter was the most important structural dimension to improve the performance of this pilot power plant.

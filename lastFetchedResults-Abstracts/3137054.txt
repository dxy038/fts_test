Aiming at the shortcoming and weakness of the present regional eco-environmental quality evaluation model and on the basis of detailed analyze of the multidimensional space of regional eco-environmental quality, a new multi-objective comprehensive evaluation method for regional eco-environmental quality is presented and a calculation formula for multi-objective comprehensive level of regional eco-environmental quality. The regional eco-environmental quality assessment indicator and standard are presented on the basis of specification and certain statist data. As a case, the projection model is used to assess the eco-environmental quality of Chaohu Lake basin.

In recent years, morphology and hydrogeology of the Castel di Sangro plain have undergone significant man-made changes. The plain is located in a very complex geological area where the Latium-Abruzzi carbonate platform, the Morrone-Rotella-Pizzone carbonate platform and the Molise nappe meet. Hydrology, hydrogeology, morphology and neotectonics of the area are conditioned by interlocking and overlapping of such palaeogeographic units. Some of them can be clearly recognised in the upper and middle Sangro area.

outlining the geological, structural and geomorphological features of the area, the authors discuss the morphological changes which occurred in the Sangro River pattern and its alluvial plain from 1875 to 1992 as a result of construction of major hydraulic structures (dams, river bed cementation, urbanisation of flood plain and spring areas, wells). Elements inferred from comparison of maps and aerial photographs were also considered. The study provides a concise description of objective observations on both natural and man-induced fluvial processes and groundwater flows.

Background: Lower lung field tuberculosis is atypical presentation
of pulmonary tuberculosis which often causes confusion
in diagnosis. HIV/AlDS epidemic has considerably increased
its incidence. This study was designed to identify the
prevalence and different clinical conditions of lung tuberculosis
in conjunction with its common clinical and radiological
presentations and its treatment.
Methods: The patients diagnosed as having pulmonary tuberculosis
with lesions below an arbitrary line across the hila of
their chest X-rays, considered lower lung field tuberculosis, are
included in this study. Laboratory testing was done on sputum
for acid-fast bacillus. HIV testing, blood sugar and other relevant
examinations were performed in each patient.
Results: Out of a total of 2 I7 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis,
J9.8% had lower lung field tuberculosis. The majority
of the patients (41.8 0/'0) were over 60-yrs of age. It was
more common in female (21.8%) than in male patients
(J 7.7%). Unilateral disease was more common (52%) and
the right side involvement was more frequently affected
(60%). Consolidation (47%) and cavitations (26%) were the
main radiological findings.
Conclusion: Lower lung field tuberculosis is fairly common
in central part of Iran. Its clinical presentation is similar to that
of classical upper lung field tuberculosis

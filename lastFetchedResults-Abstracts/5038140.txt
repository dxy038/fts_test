The objective of this paper is to realize analytic studies and applications in oriented engineering, especially in maintenance, reliability and security of the big technical installations, particularly for the nuclear domain. Software applications were developed to permit the online automatic computation of the reliability, maintenance, availability and predictive maintenance parameters. This paper presents a task of an integrated application that accomplishes structural and dynamic analysis computation, geometric simulation, software for monitoring on-line predictive maintenance for the installation meant to tritium elimination, all based on scientific methods.

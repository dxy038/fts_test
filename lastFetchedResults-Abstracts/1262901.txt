Objectives The aim of this study was subjective and objective evaluation of changes in acoustic features of voice before and after septoplasty surgery. Study Design Prospective. Methods Twenty patients scheduled for septoplasty procedure were included in the study. Before and 1 and 3 months after septoplasty surgery, acoustic analysis were performed. The recordings of /a/ vowel were used to evaluate average fundamental frequency (F0), Jitter percent, and Shimmer percent. In spectrographic analyses, F3â€“F4 values for the vowels /i, e, a, o, and u/, nasal formant frequencies of the consonants /m/ and /n/ in the word /mana/, and four formant frequencies (F1, F2, F3, and F4) for nasalized /a/ vowel following a nasal consonant /n/ in the word /mana/ were compared. For the perceptual evaluation, the patients were asked to read the Turkish â€œDereâ€‌ passage. The differences in nasal resonance and subjective evaluations were rated. Results A statistically significant change was not observed in F0 (Pآ =آ 0.307), Jitter (Pآ =آ 0.919), and Shimmer (Pآ =آ 0.024) values measured before and after the operation for vowel /a/. Nasal formants measured before and after the operation for nasal formant /m/ and nasal formant /n/ in the word /mana/, which contains nasal consonants, and nasalized vowel /a/, which comes after a nasal consonant, did not differ statistically significant (Pآ =آ 0.096 and Pآ =آ 0.034, respectively). Comparisons among F1, F2, F3, and F4 values did not reveal a statistically significant change for nasalized vowel /a/, which comes after a nasal consonant in the word /mana/. Conclusions Our study shows that a complete therapeutic approach to patients affected by nasal septum deviation do not reveal significant voice abnormalities.

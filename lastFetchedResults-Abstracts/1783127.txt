Introduction: Epidemiological studies show that consumption of dairy products plays an important role in prevention and treatment of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). The objective of this study is to examine the relation between dairy intake with MetS and its components in Tehranian adolescents. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 785 adolescents, aged 10 to 19 years, participants of the fourth phase of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study were selected. Usual dietary intake was assessed using a valid semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Total dairy, low fat and high fat dairy, milk, yoghurt and cheese were and anthropometrics, biochemical measurements and blood pressure were assessed. MetS was defined according to the de Ferranti criteria. Results: Mean age of subjects was 14.8 Â± 2.9 years. The prevalence of MetS was 22.2% (girls: 19.5% and boys: 25.2%). The most prevalent component for MetS among boys was high waist circumference (53.4%) and among girls was low HDL-C (53.1%). Energy density and intake of protein, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, calcium and phosphor were higher in the highest quartile of dairy consumption, than in the lowest quartile. After adjustment for confounders, odds ratios with 95% confidence interval for MetS in the highest quartiles of total dairy, low fat dairy, high fat dairy, milk, yoghurt and cheese were 0.97 (0.57-1.66), 1.44 (0.83-2.49), 0.97 (0.56-1.67), 0.70 (0.42-1.18), 1.62 (0.99-2.64), 0.72 (0.44-1.18) respectively, compared to the lowest quartile. Conclusions: Results of this study do not support the hypothesis that consumption of dairy products protects against MetS and its components.

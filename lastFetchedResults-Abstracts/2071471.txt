The objective of this study was to estimate some mineral elements (Ca, Na, K, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) of two traditional leafy vegetables: Corchorus Olitorius (Tiliaceae) and Sabdariffa Hibiscus (Malvaceae) and investigate the nutritional intake and the roles of these micro nutrients in the human body. The vegetable material studied was purchased on Abobo market in Abidjan and analyzed with regard to these mineral elements by atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) after its identification in the Floristic Laboratory of Abidjan Houphouët Boigny University. The obtained results revealed that these samples of Corchorus Olitorius (Tiliaceae) and Sabdariffa Hibiscus (Malvaceae) analyzed contain more Macronutrients Potassium (K: 13.33 to 26.00 mg / g d.m), Calcium (Ca: 12.74 and 14.02 mg / g d.m) and the trace element iron (Fe: 0.54 to 0.92 mg / g d.m).
Nutrient intakes of these nutrients abundant in these leafy vegetables were: 4.7 g/ day for potassium; 0.8 to 1 g / day / for Calcium and 9-16 mg / day for Iron. Contents of Micronutrients of traditional vegetables studied, are on the whole a little higher than leafy vegetables from abroad, such as, spinach, but the variability of the concentration of Micronutrients leafy vegetables in general would be due to external factors such as soil fertility, season, maturity, growing conditions, etc. We should also note that the nutritional intakes of these Micronutrients in the human body evolve from the fact significant and rapid changes in lifestyle and eating habits. All these highly valuable Micronutrients data dosed in these two Leafy vegetables make these important nutritional food supplements for certain segments of the population in Côte d'Ivoire.

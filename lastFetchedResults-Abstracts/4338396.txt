The objective of this paper is to present a new method to implement the algorithm of non-linear control (Direct Torque Control) on FPGAs. This method itÂ´s the tool added to Matlab / Simulilnk: Xilinx System Generator (XSG). This tool can automatically generate the VHDL code without resorting to a painful programming without being obliged to do approximations and more we can visualize the behavior of the machine before implementation which is very important for not damage our machine In this paper we will compare the simulation results obtained using XSG and the simulation results using Simulink and conclude.

A Transimpedance Amplifier (TIA) is a device commonly used in applications that require current-voltage conversion as well as the possibility of signal shaping. The most commonly used solution is to use an Avalanche Photo-Diode (APD) as radiation detector with a feedback TIA, but since the upcoming of the most recent Silicon Photo-Multiplier (SiPM), other TIA topologies have proven to be good alternatives. Our main objective in this paper is to show, evaluate and compare the behavior of a regulated common-gate (RCG) TIA when the light sensitive device is an APD or a SiPM. We will also study the usage of this circuit in a RF front-end, providing there is a passive mixer at the TIAÂ´s input. The proposed circuit is simulated with standard CMOS technology (UMC 130 nm), using 1.2 V power supply.

Dry eye is a common disturbance of the tear film that is due to inadequate secretion or over evaporation of the tear film. A decrease of aqua's layer may cause instability of the tear film, leading to the injury of the ocular surface. The objective of this study is to evaluate the fre¬quency of dry eye in patients by using Shirmer and Basic tests.This is a cross-sectional descriptive study on 100 patients who were complaining about eye diseases. The eye symptoms were recorded and all the subjects were examined for the poten¬tial eye diseases using a slit lamp. In order to determine the prevalence of diy eye, both tests of Schirmer I and Basic Tear Secretion were used. Those subjects that were not cooperative enough as well as some other patients who mentioned a history of eye surgery or those who were suffering from either lid anatomical or anterior segment derangement were excluded from the study.Among all the eye symptoms, itching and foreign body sensation were found to have signifi¬cant correlation, according to the results obtained from Schirmer I test (P<0.04). The only symptom that had a significant correlation, as found by the Schirmer I test, was abnormal meibomian secretions (p=0.025). Also, foreign body sensation symptom showed significant correlation based on the results of the Basic Test (P<0.016).According to the results obtained from Schirme 1 test, 25% of the patients were determined as abnormal while the Basic Test determined only 4% of the patients as abnormal and the results for 25% were suspected. Thus, it can be concluded that in order to prevent injury to the surface of the eye, it is recommended that special attention be paid to the clinical signs and symptoms of dry eye as well as the proper use of tests.

Internet traffic has been exponentially growing with the increasing demand of content dissemination. This explosive growth in traffic poses a significant challenge to the networks, especially backbones. To address the challenge, the emerging content-oriented Named Data Networking (NDN) has been proposed due to its attractive advantages, such as network load reduction, low dissemination latency and energy efficiency. To achieve these benefits from NDN paradigm, the content caching strategy plays the most important role. In this paper, we present a popularity-based coordinated caching scheme with the objective of eliminating both the inter-domain and intra-domain redundant traffic of a backbone network. In this design, the global content popularity is obtained by the weighted aggregation of local content popularity at the routers, then the cache placement can be calculated based on the access cost guided by the global content popularity. We test our caching scheme on the publicly available backbone networks: Abilene and GEANT. Simulation results show that the proposed caching scheme achieves around 30% higher cache hit rate and 20% more traffic reduction, compared with the widely used Leaving Copies Everywhere (LCE) and Random Cache (RanCache) scheme.

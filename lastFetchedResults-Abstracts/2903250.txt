Results: We have identified potential technologies that have been utilized to address seniorsÂ´ daily life difficulties in three areas: independent living, social isolation, dementia and medication taking. We have also extracted the theoretical lenses used for studying the adoption of these technologies and available empirical evidences for the theories. Conclusion: Having put the findings of this review together, we have identified factors impacting adoption of technologies among elderly. These have been classified as factors related to technologies, allocated tasks, individuals and social influences.

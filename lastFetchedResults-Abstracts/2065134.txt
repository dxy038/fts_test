Background & Objectives: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major infectious diseases in Iran and has pulmonary and extra-pulmonary manifestations. Considering the differences in the distribution of the cases across different regions, we decided to study the geographical distribution, epidemiologic characteristics, and disease pattern in Lorestan.Â Methods: This ecologic (descriptive analytical) survey was done in Lorestan between 2002 and 2008. The data was collected from the Health Department of Lorestan University of Medical Sciences and included the history of 1481 patients suffering from TB. The study variables were sex, disease type, residential location, age, and year. The data were analyzed using statistical package SAS 9.2 and descriptive and inferential statistics were applied. Results: From 1481 registered patients 58.4% were male and 41.6% were female among which 68.74% and 29.98% lived in urban and rural areas and 1.28% were nomads. The mean age of the patients was 41.87. The highest and lowest incidence rates were observed in Khoram Abad (19.38 per 100000) and Azna (7.04 per 100000), respectively. Using Poisson regression, it was observed that the effects of age structure and residency on the incidence rate were significant. Conclusion: The percentage of nomads was identified as the most important demographic factor in the incidence rate of TB in Lorestan. Allocation of better resources and appropriate training can be effective in controlling and preventing the disease.

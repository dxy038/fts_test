Introduction: To assess the efficacy and safety of bronchial artery embolization in the treatment of massive hemoptysis.
Materials and Methods: A retrospective study on 46 patients (26 males and 20 females) who were referred to the Razavi Hospital from April 2009 to May 2012 with massive hemoptysis and had bronchial artery embolization procedures. General characteristics of the patients including age, gender, etiology, and thorax computed tomograms, findings of bronchial angiographic, results of the embolization, complications related to bronchial artery embolization and clinical outcome during follow-up were reviewed.
Results: The etiology included previous pulmonary tuberculosis in 20 cases, previous tuberculosis with bronchiectasis in 16 cases, bronchiectasis in 6 cases, and active pulmonary tuberculosis in one case. No identifiable causes could be detected in three patients. Moreover, massive hemoptysis was successfully and immediately controlled following the embolization procedure in all patients.
One patient developed recurrent hemoptysis during one month following the procedure and was treated by re-embolization.
No major procedureâ€“related complication such as bronchial infarction was identified
However none of the patientsexperienced neurological complications.
Conclusions: Bronchial artery embolization is a safe and effective means of controlling massive hemoptysis and should be regarded as the first-line treatment for this condition.

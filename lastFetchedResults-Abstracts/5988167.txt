The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) can determine the weights of all assessment factors. The fuzzy-AHP comprehensive evaluation model is built in this paper to translate the multi-objective design problem into a single objective design problem. This paper takes the example for the column of XK717 CNC milling machine. The hierarchical structure is established and the weights of all assessment factors are calculated. The structural parameters of a column are taken as the design variables. The orthogonal array is designed by Taguchi method. The X, Y, Z displacements and the first three natural frequencies are calculated by the finite element method. The comprehensive scores are calculated by a fuzzy-AHP comprehensive evaluation model. The optimum combination of structural parameters is obtained and the result is satisfactory. It shows that the fuzzy-AHP comprehensive evaluation model is an effective method.

Phenolic compounds are known to form soluble and insoluble complexes with proteins. The objective of this study was to determine if phenolics such as caffeic, chlorogenic and ferulic acids form insoluble and irreversible complexes with major peanut allergens, and if such complexation reduces immunoglobulin E (IgE) binding. After adding each of the phenolics to peanut extracts and liquid peanut butter, the soluble materials were analysed by SDSâ€“PAGE and inhibition ELISA. Results showed that addition of the phenolics precipitated most of the major peanut allergens, Ara h 1 and Ara h 2, and that complexation was irreversible. IgE binding was reduced approximately 10- to 16-fold. We concluded that reducing IgE binding by phenolics is feasible. The research, if proven by clinical studies, could lead to the development of less allergenic liquid peanut-based products.

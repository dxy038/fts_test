This paper classified the evaluation system of transformer substation construction project into 4 indexes of grade A and 13 indexes of grade B. The weight of each index is decided reasonably by the Improved Analytic Hierarchy Process. The gray number and the gray evaluating weight of each index are obtained by the gray theory, the gray fuzzy weight matrix is formed, and the grey fuzzy comprehensive evaluating matrix is obtained. Then the grade of the evaluated subject can be calculated, to get the evaluation outcome. The Improved Application of Gray and Fuzzy theory can minimize the impact of subjective factors and make the evaluation outcome more objective.

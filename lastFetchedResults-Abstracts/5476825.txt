This paper presents a thorough scope of a wide-used single-phase bidirectional battery charger which composes of a pulse-width modulation (PWM) converter in the front-end and a dual active bridge (DAB) converter for high power applications. The computer simulations of PWM converter and DAB converter are separately shown to support theoretical analyses. A prototype converter was built and tested at different operating conditions. Experiment results at 3.3 kW are given to verify theory and simulation results as well.

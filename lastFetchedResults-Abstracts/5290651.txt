This paper proposes a novel online business-driven adaptive Service Level Objective (SLO) maintenance approach which can adaptively maintain the SLO metrics in a reasonable range in order to achieve the optimal overall business result during the service operating. The approach can dynamically capture the business impact variation caused by the effect factor of client side, and adaptively provide the resource regulation strategy according to the well defined business impact weight and SLO reference value to obtain the optimal overall business result.

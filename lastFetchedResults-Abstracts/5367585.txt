The objective of this study is to develop and test an integrated conceptual model of the electronic commerce adoption based on the two dominant theoretical paradigms - the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) - to validate the research model we collected data from 226 top managers/owners of SMEs and data analysis is conducted by using a structural equation modeling with LISREL. The findings present a support to the existing theoretical links of integrated model except the effect of subjective norm on behavioral intention for adopting/using of electronic commerce.

In the past decade, the use of thermal meters has increased rapidly for the measurement of demand. The measurement of kilovolt-ampere demand by thermal means has been an objective of the metering industry for years. A few years ago, a polyphase thermal-ampere demand meter was developed. Using such a meter as a basis, voltage compensation has been added. The result is a combination polyphase watthour and thermal kilovolt-ampere demand meter as described in this paper.

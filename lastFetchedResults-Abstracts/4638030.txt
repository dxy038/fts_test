Summary form only given, as follows. In a 2D wire-cylinder reactor, the Poisson equation for the electric field and continuity equation is simulated using the FEM-FCT method. The gas used is atmospheric pressure air with 1% water content. The influence of electric field and charged particle density is calculated to find the temporal-spatial evolution of the streamer corona. Also the temporal distribution of radicals is calculated with the rate equations. For the efficient removal of a noxious flue-gas, a bidirectional pulsed voltage is used. First, a positive pulsed voltage is applied to the wire electrode and the external cylinder electrode is grounded. Then a negative pulsed voltage is applied to the wire electrode.

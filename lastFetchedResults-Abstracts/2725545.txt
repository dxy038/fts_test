The nonlinear magnetic properties of an iron core should be considered when topology optimization (TO) is applied to a realistic problem. However, a scheme for introduction of the magnetic nonlinearity to material-density-based TO has not been rigorously established. In this paper, TO by using material density with magnetic nonlinearity is proposed. The numerical instability of the sequential linear programming method is a well-known topic. The stabilized sequential linear programming method, which realizes the stabilized convergence characteristics of an objective function, is proposed and investigated in the 3-D design problem of a magnetic circuit.

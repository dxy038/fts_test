Objective
The pathogenesis of eosinophilic otitis media is not yet fully understood. The purpose of this paper is to describe the clinical course of our two patients with eosinophilic otitis media and to discuss the pathogenesis and treatment of this intractable condition.
Methods
Two cases of eosinophilic otitis media were treated with ramatroban.
Results
The middle ear effusion has been well controlled in both patients for more than 1 year with minimal corticosteroid therapy.
Conclusions
Our experience suggests that the pathogenesis of eosinophilic otitis media is related to the pharmaceutical effects of ramatroban, i.e., inhibition of the thromboxane A2 receptor (TP) and the chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2).

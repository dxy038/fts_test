A multi-objective co-ordinated control scheme for ASVG and synchronous machine excitation to achieve transient stability and voltage regulation enhancement of power systems is presented. First, the new third order nonlinear state-space system model for rotor power angle stability is derived for a single-machine infinite-bus power system with ASVG, the new third order nonlinear state-space system model of ASVG for voltage regulation is given. Then, the non-linear property of the dynamic system is well preserved and utilized, which can meet the requirement of power rotor angle stability and that of ASVG voltage support. with the help of Hamiltonian energy control theory, the variation of system structure, the parameter and the interconnection between the synchronous machine and ASVG are taken into consideration in the multi-objective cocoordinate controller design. In the end, the performance of the proposed multi-objective control scheme is evaluated through a real time test by means of the real time digital simulation. It is shown that the proposed multi-objective coordinated control of excitation and ASVG can provide better system stability and local voltage control.

This paper focuses on the consensus and formation problems of multiagent systems under unknown, persistent disturbances. Specifically, we propose a method that combines an existing consensus (or formation) algorithm with a new controller. The new controller has an integral action that produces a control input based on an error signal locally projected onto the column space of the graph Laplacian. This action allows agents to achieve a consensus or a predetermined formation objective under constant or time-varying disturbances.

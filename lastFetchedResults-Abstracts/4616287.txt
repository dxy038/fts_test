This paper deals with multi-objective problems under uncertainty, using the possibilistic framework which offers a simple and natural way to express uncertainty underlying most of real-world problems. To this end, we propose new Pareto relations for ranking the generated triangular fuzzy solutions in both mono-objective and multi-objective cases. The proposed method is applied to solve a multi-objective Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with uncertain demands.

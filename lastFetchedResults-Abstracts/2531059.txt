Objective: The present study aimed to investigate the selective attention hypothesis in a group&nbsp;of Iranian outpatients with depressive disorder.
Methods: Causal-comparative and correlation methods were used to analyze the data. A&nbsp;total of 60 subjects participated in this study. Of them, 31 patients diagnosed with depression&nbsp;were assigned in the depressive group and 29 nondepressed individuals were observed as&nbsp;control (normal) group. Participation in this study was completely voluntary. Participants&nbsp;were screened by the structured clinical interview for the DSM-IV (SCID), answered to Beck&nbsp;depression inventory&ndash;II (BDI-II), and took part in the Visual Dot-Probe (VDP) task. The data&nbsp;were analyzed by correlation analysis and t test.
Results: The results showed that the depressed group got higher score in BDI compared to the&nbsp;control group and this difference was statistically significant. But the differences between two&nbsp;groups regarding attention biases were not large enough to be significant.
Conclusion: The following results could be because of the different reasons such as culture.&nbsp;Furthermore, there were several limitations to the current study which are discussed.

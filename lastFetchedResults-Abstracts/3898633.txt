A description is given of MicroTool, a programming environment that reports programming errors immediately, blocking their entry into the database from which both executable code and documentation are derived.

Aspects of MicroTool that are discussed include feedback to programmers; smart editing windows; address space layout; the program model; data definition; algorithm definition; combining edit, compile, and link; time and space measurement; and programming style.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

We introduce inverted and shrinkable Pareto archived evolutionary strategies, IS-PAES. This is an evolutionary algorithm for multiple objective optimization with constraint handling. IS-PAES inherits from PAES the use of an adaptable grid to keep diversity, but here this grid can grow and shrink dynamically until the constraints are met. We propose a novel approach to select a mixture of promising individuals. Several examples of the literature are used to show the potential of ISPAES.

Based on the improved model of nonlinear time-varying electric arc resistance, the power supply system model of electric arc furnace (EAF) is established in Matlab/power system blockset, which is used to investigate voltage flicker problem. A flexible power supply strategy is presented, in which static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) is applied to mitigate the voltage flicker produced by EAF. The instantaneous reactive current of EAF impact load is extracted using instantaneous reactive power theory. Then PWM technology is used for current tracing feedback control to make STATCOM produce the required reactive current. The results of simulation indicate that the strategy is valid to mitigate power supply voltage flicker, and the objective of flexible power supply is achieved

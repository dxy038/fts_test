The main objective of this study is to clarify the effect of the outlet guide vane (OGV) on the acoustic treatment design in aeroengine nacelle, which received less attention previously. A model of sound propagation through a lining section and a blade row is developed to investigate the interaction between sound sources of blade rows and liners in a channel of parallel walls containing uniform mean flow. The present method makes it possible to evaluate the performance of liner while a blade row is inserted in the channel and the sound attenuation in a duct with both liner section and cascade. Various numerical results show that the effect of the cascade may have diverse effects on sound attenuation of the liner under different conditions, but the existence of the OGV always enhances the total sound attenuation in the duct due to energy dissipation caused by vortex shedding from the tailing edge of the OGV. To pursue a better design of acoustic liner in aeroengine nacelle, it is thus necessary to include the effect of OGV on the sound attenuation.

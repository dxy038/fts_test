We developed a near-field recording process with a 266 nm blue-violet laser and an objective lens of 1.35 NA. A two-stage servo with air suspension and PZT control sufficiently constrained the gap fluctuation between the supersphere solid immersion lens (SIL) and the glassmaster. As a result, the expected small size of the pit pattern was obtained. We expect that this breakthrough will be refined much more and improve the density of optical recording.

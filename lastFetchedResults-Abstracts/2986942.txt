Shortest path finding is an essential function of a route guidance system (RGS). This shortest travel time is estimated by applying various shortest path algorithms to the traffic network that has deterministic or dynamic link travel times. Because it is difficult to evaluate these shortest path-finding algorithms in real traffic situations, most are evaluated on a virtual traffic network. However, because experimental networks only link travel time statically and ignore the dynamic characteristics of the real traffic situation, so accurate evaluation of estimated travel time can not be performed. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the accuracy of planned shortest travel time in static or dynamic traffic networks using simulation traffic data and the effect of turning movement delay time to travel time

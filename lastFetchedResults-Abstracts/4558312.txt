In this paper, we employ a computer code, developed by the authors, which utilizes the non-uniform and conformal FDTD techniques, to analyze a class of planar antennas, viz., a dual-band microstrip patch radiator, wideband water-drop and triangular slot antennas. Our objective is to illustrate the versatility of the code and to show how it can be applied to general, non-cartesian geometries without staircasing. For the sake of comparison, we also present the results obtained from other commercial software packages such as the IE3D(MoM), HFSS(FEM) and EMPIRE (FDTD).

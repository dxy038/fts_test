The objective of this research is to effectively design a cane interface for assistive and rehabilitative interactions in games. Current 3D interfaces for games are not usable for many populations with physical impairments and are often not adaptable to rehabilitation exercises (e.g., balance exercise, assistive device training). To address this, we present the design of a novel cane-based 3D interface for rehabilitation games. We report results from a user study, which offers insight into the future design and potential effectiveness of canes as rehabilitation game interfaces.

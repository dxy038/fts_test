Background and Objective: Diabetes mellitus mediated by oxidative stress creates serious metabolic disorders in testicles. This study aimed to demonstrate the antioxidant effect of Salvia officinalis (SO) on testicular damage in streptozotocin-induced diabetes in male rats.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 50 male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups of 10. The control group received water and food, stereptozotocine-treated diabetic (60 mg/kg), SO-treated control (400 mg/kg), SO-treated diabetic (200 mg/kg), and SO-treated diabetic (400 mg/kg). After 28 days, the testis was immediately removed and its sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and evaluated.

Results: Comparison of histological sections showed the number of cells spermatogonia, primary spermatocyte, spermatid, Leydig and Sertoli in the diabetic group showed a significant decrease as compared with control group. In comparison of SO-treated control group with control group, a significant increase in the number of these cells was observed except for Sertoli cells. The SO-treated diabetic (200 and 400 mg/kg) groups showed a significant increase in the number of these cells as compared with the diabetic group. (p < 0.05).

Conclusion: Probably, the antioxidant compounds in extracts of this plant, i.e. sage, are effective in reducing the incidence of diabetes in mice spermatogenesis.

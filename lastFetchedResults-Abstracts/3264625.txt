It is a truth universally acknowledged that "a picture is worth a thousand words". The emerge of digital media has taken this saying to a complete new level. By using steganography, one can hide not only 1000, but thousands of words even in an average sized image. This article presents various types of techniques used by modern digital steganography, as well as the implementation of the least significant bit (LSB) method. The main objective is to develop an application that uses LSB insertion in order to encode data into a cover image. Both a serial and parallel version are proposed and an analysis of the performances is made using images ranging from 1:9 to 131 megapixels.

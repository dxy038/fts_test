The surface of nodular graphite cast iron samples was melted by 50% overlapping passes from a 3 kW CW CO2 laser. The objective was to modify the microstructure and improve the hardness and erosion resistance of the surface. The results showed that laser melting led to complete dissolution of the graphite nodules which on solidifying created an inter-dendritic network of ledeburite eutectic with a very fine structure, good homogeneity, and high hardness. Sand particle erosion experiments were carried out at impingement angles of 30°, 60°, and 90° using angular particles of size between 300 and 600 μm. The velocity of the sand particles was 50 m/s, which was controlled by the gas pressure and measured by the double-disc method. The erosion resistance of the laser treated nodular cast iron was 110 times greater than the untreated material. The erosion mechanism of the untreated nodular cast iron under normal and oblique angles was by severe plastic deformation and ploughing; whilst the mechanism for the treated specimens was by fatigue cracking. The improvements of erosion resistance after laser treatment were considered due to the very fine structure, high micro hardness (650 Hv0.1) with the resistance to plastic flow and to the dissolution of the graphite nodules.

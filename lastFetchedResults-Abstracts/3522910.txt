A closed-form solution approach to evaluating the loss of power supply probability for stand-alone wind-electric conversion systems with energy storage is presented. A numerical example is included to illustrate the usefulness of the expressions developed. In particular, the results allow investigation of the relationship between the amount of energy storage and the loss of power supply probability under various operating conditions. These relationships can be used in the design of stand-alone wind-energy conversion systems to optimize certain objective functions such as total capital cost

This article focuses on the revision upon stable sets which are considered elegant representations for belief states of fully-introspective agents. Revising such kind of belief sets is believed to be an interesting part of the topic of belief revision for rational agents that has been studied for decades in Logic, Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science. Properties of stable sets are demonstrated first according to the related literature, and possible difficulties of revising stable sets are analyzed in the case of consistency and new stable sets are expected. By some results from the literature, we show a simple approach for revising the objective part of a given stable set with new information objective as well. After that, with the help of universal models, a possible semantic representation is suggested although it needs to be developed further.

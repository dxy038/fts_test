In this research we have tried to pay attention to the miracles of the Qur'an and nutrition including protection of liver extract of fig, olive and pomegranate and have compared the Quranic ratio of 1,7,3  against  the liver damage induced by carbon tetrachloride.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 30 male Wistar rats divided into 5 groups of 6 and twice a week for 28 days carbon tetrachloride (1 ml/ kg carbon tetrachloride was diluted 1:1 with 50% olive oil) simultaneously they recived daily the combined extract of fruits of fig, olive and pomegranate with the Quranic ratio of 1,7,3 with water doses of 100,250 and 400 mg /kg  of body weight .
Results: One-way analysis of variance test (ANOVA) showed a significant reduction  (P < 0.05) levels of alanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and bilirubin in groups combined extract of fig, olive and pomegranate doses of 100,250 & 400 mg per kg of body weight. Liver histopathology results also represents that the hepatocytes have returned and rebuilt in natural form. The findings have proved the synergistic effects of the combined protective of extracts on liver with Quranic ratio.
Conclusion: The combined extract of the fig, olive and pomegranate with the Quranic ratios probably can protect the liver, due to increased activity of antioxidant compounds in the extract and thus reduce oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation induced by carbon tetrachloride.

A new linear predictive modelling technique is introduced based on using a high-order lattice filter with only a few nonzero reflection coefficients. The objective of this modelling is to provide a better matching to the speech spectrum while keeping the number of bits for encoding the filter parameters low. An efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming techniques has been developed to find the nonzero coefficients and their corresponding delays for the thinned lattice filter.

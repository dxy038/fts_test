Emergency situations require specific needs in particular in terms of communications, data transmission and sharing. Of particular concern are the transmissions of the patientpsilas medical history to the emergency physician, the transmission of medical streaming data collected by devices (ECG, stethoscope ...) to the emergency services. This will make it possible to get real time second opinion from experts, but also to retrieve medical history of the patient, and to initiate a medical file with objective data as collected for that emergency. The relevance is to benefit from a second opinion in real time; the physician can remotely consult the patientpsilas medical history, or add new information. Protocols exist to transfer medical information. Thus, according to the state of the art, nowadays, we assist to the emergence of communication protocols adapted to medical domain: the Bluetooth device medical profile. Likewise, Dicom is a commonly format use to transfer medical data (images) on the network. Nevertheless, new needs appear that are not considered in the existing protocols. For instance, the case of the stethoscope or auscultation sounds has not been considered. So, we propose to use the existing protocols (Bluetooth medical device profile, Dicom) and to integrate these data that are not considered today. It should allow to homogenize the communications medium and better share auscultation sounds. The final aim will be the creation of the ldquoSchool of Auscultationrdquo whose goal is to reposition auscultation as a fundamental non invasive exam, thanks to the new technologies.

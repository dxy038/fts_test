The objective of this paper was to design controllers for a pressurized water reactor using model based control techniques. To this end, the physical system was identified from experimental data using a multi-input multi-output state-space description; an H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controller was designed using a lower order model of the plant. Of particular importance, the frequency weighting functions were chosen to reflect the robust stability and nominal performance requirements. Although a nonlinear controller is required, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller in a relatively wide operating range

Increasing public interest in the electronic media for news and information coupled with declining public trust in business leaders is creating opportunities for executives to be interviewed to tell &#8220;the corporate story.&#8221; To ensure that interview time is not wasteful or destructive, interviewees should prepare seriously. For example: Have a communications objective; consider the reporterÂ´s style, interests, and audience; anticipate, and develop answers to, the worst-case questions; keep language simple, informal, and friendly; practice turning negative points into positive statements; present a neat, natural, alert, and controlled appearance.

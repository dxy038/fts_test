This paper deals with the modeling and control of a reciprocating linear motor connected to a mechanical load that varies slowly in time. The control objective is to keep the upper and lower dead-points of the oscillatory movement of the motorÂ´s armature at predetermined values, where these predetermined values may also vary slowly in time. Furthermore, the control algorithm should be implementable on a 16-bit integer processor, it should be robust against motor and load parameter changes, and it should result in a high electromechanical efficiency of the overall system. In the paper, a control algorithm is proposed that meets all of these requirements

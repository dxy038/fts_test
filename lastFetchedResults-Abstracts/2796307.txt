Small antenna arrays can provide dynamic signal gain and interference rejection enabling wireless networks to communicate in difficult radio environments. Optimal array design has focused on simplified objective functions to facilitate solution. We extend previous research by using fitness functions more directly related to network performance. Particle swarm optimization is used to design new array geometries, and performance is evaluated using randomized array designs and fitness distributions. Robustness to interference from multiple directions is evaluated while accounting for array angle dependence.

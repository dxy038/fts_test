Information on ice cover extent, distribution, concentration, ice surface temperature and other physical parameters of the ice pack is needed in numerical weather prediction, ship navigation, water management, and regional/global climate change impact assessment. Ice cover is also a sensitive indicator of climate variations. Ability of satellites to provide global observations at high temporal frequency has made them the primary tool for the ice cover monitoring. The main objective of this research is to explore the potentials of mapping ice cover with the future GOES-R ABI and to develop an automated ice-mapping algorithm, which would make maximum use of ABIÂ´s improved observing capabilities. Data collected by SEVIRI instrument onboard of Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite have been used as a prototype. The Northern region of the Caspian Sea has been selected for algorithm development and calibration. The approach used in the algorithm development includes daily cloud-clear image compositing as well as pixel-by-pixel image classification using spectral criteria. All available spectral channels (reflectance and temperature) have been tested and used in a statistical-based approach to accurately discriminate between water, cloudy pixels and ice. The preliminary results have been assessed using the interactive maps of snow and ice cover produced within NOAA Interactive Multi-sensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS). The preliminary results are promising. An additional screening is undergoing in order to reduce some remaining confusions related to water properties and presence of fractional ice.

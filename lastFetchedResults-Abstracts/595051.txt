Objective: To compare the outcome of MAGPI and Mathieu Procedures in the treatment of distal penile hypospadias in children.Material and Methods: This prospective comparative study was conducted in the Department of Paediatric surgery Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar from Jan 2002 to Dec 2002. A total of 40 children with distal hypospadias without chordae were selected. They were divided into two groups. Group one consisted of 20 children with glandular, coronal and subcoronal hypospadias without a groove in the glans penis. For this group MAGPI procedure was performed. Group two consisted of 20 children with coronal and subcoronal hypospadias with a groove in the glans penis. This group was managed with Mathieu procedure. Results of the two procedures were compared. Age of these boys ranged from one to 10 years. 32 children had coronal and subcoronal hypospadias while 8 had glandular hypospadias.Results: Functional and cosmetic results were good in Mathieu procedure but the fistula rate was more as compared to MAGPI procedure. Meatal stenosis was more commonly observed in MAGPI procedure. Observed P valve of 0.02 between two procedure is significant statistically.Conclusion: The MAGPI procedure was found to have better results as the fistula rate was significantly less in spite of the frequent meatal stenosis

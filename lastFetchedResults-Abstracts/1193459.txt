Various series of experiments were carried out on cements pastes, concretes made with a variety of reactive aggregates, composite specimens made of cement paste and reactive aggregate particles, and a variety of reactive natural aggregates and mineral phases immersed in various Li-bearing solutions. The main objective was to determine which mechanisms(s) better explain(s) the effectiveness of LiNO3 against ASR and variations in this effectiveness as well with the type of reactive aggregate to counteract. The principal conclusions are the following: (1), the pH in the concrete pore solution does not significantly decrease in the presence of LiNO3; (2), the concentration of silica in the pore solution is always low and not affected by the presence of LiNO3, which does not support the mechanism relating to higher solubility of silica in the presence of lithium; (3), the only reaction product observed in the LiNO3-bearing concretes looks like classical ASR gel and its abundance is proportional to concrete expansion, thus is likely expansive while likely containing lithium; this does not support the mechanisms relating to formation of a non or less expansive Si–Li crystalline product or amorphous gel; (4), early-formed reaction products coating the reactive silica grains or aggregate particles, which could act as a physical barrier against further chemical attack of silica, were not observed in the LiNO3-bearing concretes, but only for a number of reactive materials after immersion in 1 N LiOH at 350 °C in the autoclave (also at 80 °C for obsidian); (5), higher chemical stability of silica due to another reason than pH reduction or early formation of a protective coating over the reactive phases, is the mechanism among those considered in this study that better explains the effectiveness of LiNO3 against ASR.

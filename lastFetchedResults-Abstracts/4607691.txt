In this paper, an improved method is proposed for the design of variable fractional-delay (VFD) IIR digital filters. The objective error function is constituted directly by the root-mean-squared error function of variable frequency response and the stability constrained function, so that the root-mean-squared error of variable frequency response can be minimized while the designed VFD IIR filter is stable. Several design examples will be presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

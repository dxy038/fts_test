The increase demand of an intermediate storage of electrical energy in battery systems, in particular due to the use of renewable energy, has resulted in the need of bidirectional DC/DC power converters with galvanic isolation. Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS), battery charging systems, photovoltaic equipment and auxiliary power supplies in traction applications are examples of some fields of application of this kind of converters. A Dual Active Bridge (DAB) bidirectional DC/DC converter is a topology with the advantages of decreased number of devices, soft-switching commutations, low cost, and high efficiency. The use of this topology is proposed for applications where the power density, cost, weight, and reliability are critical factors. In the present paper the steady-state analysis of the converter has been carried out, giving some guidelines for the design (considering soft switching limits and the amount of reactive current) and a small-signal model of the topology. Simulations and experimental results are also presented.

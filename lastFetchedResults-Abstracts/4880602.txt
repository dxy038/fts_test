The advent of distributed generation introduces new challenges and possibilities of controlling reactive power and regulating voltage in distribution systems. In addition, dynamic behavior of the distribution system is influenced by the presence of Distributed Generation (DG). As a result, the impact of DG on distribution system radial feeders and laterals needs to be evaluated in terms of steady state normal and transient conditions before implementation. Several computer programs exist to carry out such simulations and this paper focuses on DigSILENT PowerFactory. Power Factory provides steady state solutions for balanced and unbalanced load flow for both transmission and distribution networks, short circuit calculations and, it also provides dynamic solutions for transient studies. The main objective of this work is to establish a test bench in PowerFactory and report steady state results. The simulation test bench is to be used in ongoing research work for analysis of the impact of various forms of DG on distribution networks. The IEEE 34 Node test feeder is modeled and results are compared with those of the IEEE distribution system analysis subcommittee.

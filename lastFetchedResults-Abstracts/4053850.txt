One objective of seismic signal processing is to identify the layered subsurface structure by sending seismic wavelets into the ground. This is a blind deconvolution process since the seismic wavelets are usually not measurable and therefore, the subsurface face layers are identified only by the reflected seismic signals. Conventional methods often approach this problem by making assumptions about the subsurface structures and/or the seismic wavelets. In this paper an alternative technique is presented. It applies blind channel identification methods to prestack seismic deconvolution. A unique feature of this proposed method is that no such assumptions are needed. In addition, it fits into the structure of current seismic data acquisition techniques, thus no extra cost is involved. Simulations on both synthetic and field seismic data demonstrate that it is a promising new method for seismic signal processing

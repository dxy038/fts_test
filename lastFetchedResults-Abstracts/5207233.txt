Simple kidney cysts analysis from CT images is nowadays performed in a direct visual and hardly reproducible way. Computer-aided measurements of simple kidney cysts from CT images may help radiologists to accomplish an objective analysis of the clinical cases under observation. We propose a semi-automatic segmentation algorithm for this task. Experiments performed on real datasets confirm the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed method.

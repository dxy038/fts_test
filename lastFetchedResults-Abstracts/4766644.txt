Code channel assignment deals with the problem that how different codes are allocated to different connections. In the 3GPP technical specifications, the channelization codes used for spreading are orthogonal variable spreading factor (OVSF) codes. It can preserve the orthogonality between userÂ´s physical channels. OVSF codes are valuable resources in CDMA systems and should be properly managed. The objective of this paper is to find a code channel assignment method to support as many users as possible with less complexity. We proposed a code channel assignment method for user equipment (UE) that has the capability to support multi-rate services using multi-code transmission. A single table is used to allocate codes to a UE according to its requested data rate. Therefore, the allocation and releasing procedures, which can be accomplished in a very short period of time, are efficient

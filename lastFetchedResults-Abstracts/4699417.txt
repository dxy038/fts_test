Building information model (BIM), which will replace the 2D-based modeling method and information managing tools currently widely adopted in AEC/FM (Architecture, Engineering, Construction/Facilities Management) industry in the near future, is applied in managing and controlling durability information of RC structures during the life cycle. 4D theory is adopted together with the object-oriented modeling method to manage and process the time-dependent information, and 4D durability information model is developed and demonstrated by elaborating the objective, architecture and mechanism. Furthermore, an integrate durability information managing computer system base on 4D and BIM technologies is developed as an collaborative environment for various processes related to durability managing and processing. The Industry Foundation Class (IFC) issued by IAI as the international standard for building product expressing and exchanging is extended, applied and integrated into the information managing system to achieve information sharing and interoperability of different software systems.

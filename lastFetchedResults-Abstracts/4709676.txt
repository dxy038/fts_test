Microscopy is an important tool in biology and medicine, but it is often limited to high numerical aperture (NA) with a short working distance(w<sub>d</sub>), such as NA = 0.6 then w<sub>d</sub> &lt; 1 mm. For imaging living cells in culture, a high numerical aperture and long working distance of optical imaging structure is required, and the common microscopy objective is no good here. In order to meet the single living cell imaging, a novel optical design has been performed in this paper, which is character of ultra-long working distance w<sub>d</sub> = 15 mm and high numerical aperture NA = 0.7. An optical imaging system with dual modes information of fluorescence and spectrum can be developed for the subcellular imaging of cells attached on surface of vessel or free-floating in culture.

With the development of smart grids, vehicle-to-grid(V2G) received much attention. The smart charger is needed to serve the control strategy of smart grid to ensure power grid stability. The bi-directional inverter is an important part of the smart charger. In this paper, a bi-directional inverter is integrated in switched reluctance motor(SRM) drive. A novel converter topology is proposed to include the motor driving, the battery charging and inverter of power grid. The integrated bi-directional inverter can reduce the volume, the weight, and is easily to carry within EV. Compare with conventional asymmetric converter, two freewheeling diodes are instead by two power switches, and a relay is inserted between two power switches. This topology can be rebuilt a bidirectional inverter to satisfy the battery charging and the inverter of power grid. The operational modes of three functions are introduced in detail. Some simulation results are done to verify the performance of proposed converters.

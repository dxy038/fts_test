Design of a 3.3 V compatible 2.5 V TTL-to-CMOS bidirectional I/O buffer is proposed. Gate oxide protection was implemented without active voltage degradation, which reduces static and dynamic current levels and improves noise immunity for the low voltage circuit of this kind. Fast removal of stored charge further improves gate oxide protection and circuit recovery from overvoltage condition. A circuit was designed and simulated in 0.25 &#956;m technology

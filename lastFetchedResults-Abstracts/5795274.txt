It is well known that TCP is unfair when connections with different round trip times share the same bottleneck. In the literature TCP fairness in wired networks has been widely studied but little effort has been devoted to this issue in wireless networks where new problems arise. Objective of this paper is investigating on the possibility of achieving TCP fairness through power management in wireless CDMA networks. The basic idea is to allow long round trip time connections, which are usually the most disadvantaged, to have higher signal-to-interference ratio levels. An analytical framework is introduced to calculate, for each mobile terminal, the appropriate transmission power giving fairness. The impact of such power management scheme on fairness and overall throughput performance is evaluated by means of both analysis and simulation.

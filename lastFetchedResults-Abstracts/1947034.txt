Monitoring specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as markers of biosecure carcass degradation is a promising method to test progress and completion of the composting process. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of using existing aeration ducts in composting units as practical sampling locations. The secondary objective was to test the feasibility of using marker VOC concentrations in aeration ducts to elucidate information about airflow patterns inside composting units. Marker VOC concentrations were significantly higher in the upper aeration duct and this duct can typically be used to collect air samples instead of placing special air sampling probes inside the composting units. Occasionally, the airflow direction inside composting units can change. Marker VOC concentrations can be used to decide the airflow direction inside the composting units. In this study, higher VOC concentrations were measured from the upper aeration duct, and this duct was shown to be an outlet.

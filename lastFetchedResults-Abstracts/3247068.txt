We consider the scenario of broadcasting for realtime applications and loss recovery via instantly decodable network coding. Past work focused on minimizing the completion delay, which is not the right objective for real-time applications that have strict deadlines. In this work, we are interested in finding a code that is instantly decodable by the maximum number of users. First, we prove that this problem is NP-Hard in the general case. Then we consider the practical probabilistic scenario, where users have i.i.d. loss probability, and the number of packets is linear or polynomial in the number of users. In this case, we provide a polynomial-time (in the number of users) algorithm that finds the optimal coded packet. Simulation results show that the proposed coding scheme significantly outperforms an optimal repetition code and a COPE-like greedy scheme.

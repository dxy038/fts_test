BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Nowadays, medical equipment are daily used for different patients in hospitals. Contamination can be transmitted by anaesthetic equipment from one patient to another. The objective of this study was to determine the rate of contamination of anaesthetic machine after using cetrimide- C as a disinfectant solution.
METHODS: In this descriptive and analytical study, 48 samples of the two parts of anaesthetic machine were taken in 6 operation rooms of Babol Shahid Beheshti hospital. Sampling from the parts before and after sodalime was taken at the stages before and after washing with cetrimide -C as a disinfectant solution (10%). Data was analysed by chi- square test.
FINDINGS: According to the results, from where the samples were taken before sodalime at the stage before washing 16.7% of samples and after washing 19.4% contaminated to bacteria. Also, from the parts where the samples were taken after sodalime at the stage before washing 37.5% of cases and after washing 33.3% contaminated by bacteria that there was not statistically significant difference.
CONCLUSION: According to the results, there was a bacterial contamination in the anaesthesic machines at the stage before and after washing and it indicates that common method and using cetrimide- C as a disinfectant solution with unstandard concentration are not so effective in the decrease of contamination.

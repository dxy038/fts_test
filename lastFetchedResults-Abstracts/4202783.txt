The objective of this work was to investigate both parametrically and experimentally the properties of the explosive driven ferroelectric generator (EDFEG). The parametric investigaton was conducted using a simulation developed by the Institute of Electromagnetic Research and the experimental investigation using the explosive test facilities at Texas Tech University. Both efforts were conducted synergistically in order to fully understand the characteristics of the EDFEG and to optimize its operation. Results of both studies are presented.

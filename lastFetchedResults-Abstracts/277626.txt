This paper describes the design, evaluation, and preliminary results of a specialized testing device and surgical protocol to determine translational stiffness of a rabbit knee, replicating the clinical anterior drawer test. Coronal-plane transverse pins are inserted through the rabbit leg, two in the tibia and one in the distal femur, to hold and reproducibly position the leg in the device for tests at multiple time points. A linear stepper motor draws the tibia upward then returns to the home position, and a load cell measures the resisting force; force–displacement knee stiffness is then calculated. Initial evaluation of this testing device determined the effects of preconditioning, intra-operator repeatability, rabbit-to-rabbit variability, knee flexion angle (90° vs. 135°), and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) sectioning (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). Knee stiffness generally decreased as ACL sectioning increased. This testing device and surgical protocol provide an objective and efficient method of determining translational rabbit knee stiffness in vivo, and are being used in an ongoing study to evaluate the effect of knee instability (via partial to complete ACL sectioning) on the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis.

Using hybrid renewable energy is one of the best alternatives to supply the electrical energy at remote areas. Renewable energy sources are depended to weather conditions or other factors, so for supplying load with renewable sources appropriate capacity of these sources should be selected. In determining the capacity of renewable energy such as wind and solar, considering the stochastic nature of wind speed and solar radiation is very impressive. In this paper, a new algorithm for determining the capacity of hybrid wind, photovoltaic and battery generation system with considering the uncertainty in wind and photovoltaic power production is proposed. The algorithm of determining capacity of wind, photovoltaic and battery for supplying certain load is formulated as an optimization problem that the objective function is the minimization of the cost and with constrain of having specific reliability. Probability density of wind speed and solar radiation and Mont Carlo simulation method is used to considered uncertainty in wind and photovoltaic power generation. Particle swarm optimization is used for optimal sizing of the system.

A nonlinear optimal power flow (OPF) algorithm is presented which allows to solve the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions using a pure Newton-Raphson solution procedure. The method is similar to interior point algorithms. However, due to a simple transformation, the variable space becomes unlimited (unlimited point) and variables do not need to be forced to stay within the feasible region during all OPF iterations as is the case for interior point algorithms. As a consequence only a pure Newton-Raphson iterative process to algebraically transformed KKT conditions is applied. The algorithm has been successfully applied to various networks up to size 700 buses with the active power loss objective function

In a tactical environment, the rapid, secure, and reliable transmission of data can mean the difference between life and death. Tactical networking technology is useful not only to the military, but also to law enforcement and emergency services. Voice over Internet protocol over wireless (VoIPoW) has had a strong effect on tactical internetworking by allowing human voice and video to travel over existing packet data networks along with traditional data packets. Wi-Fi and WiMax (worldwide interoperability of microwave access), also known as the IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.16 respectively, are the two standard protocols used today for providing wireless access in VoIPoW. In order to provide complete end-to-end connectivity, interworking between these standards is necessary since the WiMax purpose is to expand the range of wireless systems access. Presented here are the VoIP over Wi-Fi network architecture pattern, which describes the structural and dynamic aspects of the wireless network which are relevant for security; followed by a hybrid voice over Wi-Fi/WiMax network architecture pattern that combines Wi-Fi and WiMax standards. The objective is to develop an architectural pattern-based methodology that can be used to guide the design of wireless VoIP systems and products as well as to simulate these systems.

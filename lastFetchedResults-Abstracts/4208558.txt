The Navy´s Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Follow-On (UFO) constellation provides narrowband tactical satellite communications to the DoD warfighter. The UFO constellation, initially launched in 1993, will begin to reach the end of its design life early in the 21st century. The Navy has developed an acquisition strategy to replace the UFO constellation and briefed it to the MILSATCOM Senior Warfighters Forum (SWarF) and the MILSATCOM Senior Steering Group. That strategy consists of three components: (1) procure a UHF gapfiller satellite (UFO F11) for launch in 2003, (2) use commercial satellite assets as much as practical, and (3) procure the mobile user objective system (MUOS) with an initial operational capability in 2007. This paper presents the Navy´s plans for continuing to provide communications to the mobile warfighter and provides the construction details, as currently planned, for the MUOS acquisition

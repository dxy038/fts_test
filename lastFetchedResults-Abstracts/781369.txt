The objective of the present trial was to evaluate the effect of the stage of lactation on somatic cell counts (SCC) in milk
produced by healthy goats. Forty goats that presented no clinical signs of udder inflammatory process, and whose milk was
negative in bacteriological examination were used. All animals were kept in the same management system and received the same
diet. They were submitted to monthly collections of milk for 8 months. Milk was analyzed by means of the California Mastitis
Test (CMT), automatic SCC and bacteriological examination. The following values were recorded from the first to the eighth
month of lactation: 2.56, 4.42, 3.45, 8.52, 5.96, 5.84, 6.41 and 6.51×105 somatic cells/mL of milk, respectively. When the first
trimester and the period between the fifth and the eighth month of lactation were compared, there was an increase in cell counts.
Percentage of 1+, 2+ and 3+ CMT reactions increased from the sixth month of lactation on. Results showed that there was an
increase in the number of somatic cells in milk as lactation went by, which was demonstrated by both counting methods.

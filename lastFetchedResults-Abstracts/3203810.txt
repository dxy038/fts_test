In order to provide the theoretical basis and supports for the designing high-powered broadcasting protocol, based on multi-objective optimization methods, this paper study the relationship between the reliability and the throughput of broadcasting protocol. The numerical simulation result shows that there have two objectives to be optimized simultaneously and normally they conflicting with each other in designing broadcasting protocol. Thus, we cannot find one solution that optimize all the objectives to be optimum, all we can do is to find a adaptive contention window adjusting method that make a good trade-off between the reliability and throughput.

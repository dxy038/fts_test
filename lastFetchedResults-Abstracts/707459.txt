The objective of the study was to evaluate how often intravenous (IV) fosphenytoin is used when oral phenytoin loading is possible. The methods included a retrospective chart review of all patients receiving IV fosphenytoin in the emergency department. We prospectively derived criteria that identify patients with seizures who could receive oral phosphenytoin loading (awake on arrival, alert, no emesis, and lack of endotracheal intubation, repeated seizures, or status epilepticus after arrival). The setting of the study was at an urban, university hospital emergency department with an annual census of 55,000 patients. The outcomes included the number of patients receiving IV fosphenytoin who could have received oral phenytoin loading. From February 1997 to June 1999, 55 patients received IV fosphenytoin. Thirty of these patients (55%, 95% confidence interval 41%–68%) were felt to have received fosphenytoin appropriately. The remaining 25 (45%, 95% confidence interval 32%–59%) patients could have been loaded orally with phenytoin. In a single institution, fosphenytoin administration is inappropriate almost half the time. Oral phenytoin loading is less expensive and safe

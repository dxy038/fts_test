Today the focus on green computing is increasing rapidly as it has a serious impact on the sustainability of both the environment and social life. For governments and business personnel the environmental issues like climate change due to increased pollution, and constant depletion of natural resources are becoming a major concern as this has a direct impact on higher energy demands and thereby causing increase in energy costs globally. The business organizations are taking green initiatives and practices to make their organization, truly a green organization. It has been observed that the employee attitude is the major factor in greening of any organization and thus it needs to be monitored and controlled. This paper proposes a solution to monitor and control the employee attitude by providing an automatic control system based on cybernetics theory. In the proposed system, the top management is the control device, and their objective is to keep the employee attitude in the positive direction to make a green organization.

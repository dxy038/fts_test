A Chair for engineering management was established at the University of Pretoria in South Africa in 1987, with the objective of developing and offering a masters program in engineering management. The first intake of students was in 1989. With the program now in its 6th year, this paper relates the evolution of the program to its present state, emphasizing the rationale underlying the structure and content of the curriculum. Engineering management is viewed as the application of technology for the purpose of achieving economic benefit. Based on this, a morphology for engineering management from an educational viewpoint is developed, forming the framework for the selection and design of courses. A distinguishing feature of the program since its inception is the inclusion of technology management as one of four specialization areas. The paper further contains details about the curriculum, student body, faculty, research areas, and future directions

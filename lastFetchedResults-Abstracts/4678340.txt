The development of a humanoid robot within the scope of the collaborative research centre 588 - &#8220;Humanoid Robots - Learning and Cooperating Multimodal Robots&#8221; - has the objective of creating a machine that can closely cooperate and interact with humans. For designer this development area presents new challenges in mechanic design. Compared to industrial robots - for which high velocities, mechanical rigidity, and precision (also repeat accuracy) are primary requirements - the key aspects here are humanlike motions, a motion space that corresponds to that of human beings and the prevention of hazards to users. In order to meet these requirements, the robot must have a humanlike appearance, motion space, and dexterity which automatically results in the requirement of a lightweight design. Additionally, its kinematics should be familiar to the user, and its motions predictable, so as to encourage inexperienced persons to interact with the machine. This article delivers insight into the design and especially the actuators of a new wrist for the next generation of the humanoid robot ARMAR. The goals of the development project are both to improve the motion space and to achieve a humanlike appearance. The new mechanical design is described in detail.

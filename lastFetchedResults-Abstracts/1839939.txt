Capillary hemangioblastomas (CHB) of the central nervous system, the most common tumor in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, usually show mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 3p25âˆ¼p26. Because little is known concerning the cytogenetic changes in these tumors, we studied 22 cases through comparative genomic hybridization to screen for DNA copy number changes in both sporadic and VHL-associated CHB. Our analysis revealed that 6 of 22 samples (27%) contained DNA copy number losses, whereas no gains were observed. The most recurrent finding was loss of chromosomal arm 6q, seen in five cases. In two of these cases also loss of chromosome 3 was noted. The third aberration observed was loss of chromosome 8, seen in one case. No differences were noted between VHL-associated and sporadic tumors, nor did the cytogenetic aberrations correlate with the clinical outcome. The loss of 6q, seen in this study and previously in other VHL-associated tumors (renal cell carcinomas and pheochromocytomas) and other tumors, suggest that this chromosome area may contain tumor suppressor genes involved in the early steps of tumorigenesis.

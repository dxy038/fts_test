Buried object localization in presence of sensor phase errors is presented in this study. Phase errors are introduced by the moving of the sensor array from their original positions during the experiment which gives an erroneous object localization. To solve the problem, an objective function is defined using the exact solution of the scattered acoustic field in the MUSIC method. The DIRECT algorithm (DIviding RECTangles) is used to seek the minimum of this function. The method provides estimation of the bearings and ranges of all buried objects as well as the phase error of each sensor in the observing array. Performances of the proposed method are investigated on experimental data recorded during underwater acoustic experiments.

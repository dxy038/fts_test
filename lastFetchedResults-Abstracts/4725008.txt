The objective of this paper is to present new approaches in flexible manufacturing technology as applied to the assembly of small electric DC motors. A complete, integrated workcell utilizing the Superbot<sup>TM</sup> family of high speed manipulators for assembly and material handling, and machine vision for locating and orienting different styles of component parts is discussed. The high performance and lower cost of the automation modules used in this system provide a more cost effective approach to flexible manufacturing

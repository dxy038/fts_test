The problem of radiation pattern optimization of regular antenna arrays with the use of the point objective function with taking into account interaction of the radiators in the outer space has been considered. The procedure of including of impedances of radiators into the scheme of optimization in order to obtain suitable voltages of excitation of radiators has been described. The comparison of the results of radiation pattern optimization of the antenna arrays without taking into account mutual influence of radiators and at the direct including of the matrix of the mutual resistances into the procedure of optimization has been made. The examples of the optimized radiation patterns and the voltages of excitation for antenna arrays, consisting of parallel half-wave vibrators, are given. The comparison of the obtained optimal radiation pattern with results of modeling of the antenna arrays with the calculated complex voltages of excitation of the vibrators by the method of moments in the program MMANA-GAL has been made.

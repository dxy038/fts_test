Hot uniaxial pressing of 6082 Al-alloy and AZ31 magnesium alloy is applied in Al-Mg foil-foil technique symmetrical arranged. However, delamination is a major limitation of lamellar composite structure, an emerging methodology introduced with micro laminated and/or delocalized nano particulate interphase. Mitigation of crack as well as toughening mechanisms is an objective. Parametric study (temperature, pressure and holding time) established for the control of interface/interphase kinetics. Hot uniaxial pressing parameters as well as alloying elements have a dominant effect on the kinetic of interface/interphase formation. Lamellar metal matrix composites introduced with new micro laminated composite interphase. Diffusion along with alloy segregation induced the formation of localized metal flow along with the interface as well as, low melting depressant (LMD) Zn. However, LMD induced the localized interphase structure enriched with Al or Mg, Alloy segregation tends to reach eutectic point and induce liquid phase. The formation of localized eutectic liquid tends to form either nano composite structure or micro laminated composite in a solid state processing. Microstructural characterization, mechanical characterization is also established via optical microscopy scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and tensile testing. Chemical and mechanical bonding via inter diffusion processing with LMD are dominant for interphase kinetics. Mechanical characterization with interfacial shear strength is also introduced with hardness testing. HIPing processing is successfully applied on 6082 Al-alloy and AZ31 magnesium alloy for both particulate composite or micro-laminated composite processing. The interphase kinetic established through localized micro plasticity, metal flow, LMD and delocalized Al oxide and Mg oxide. The morphology of interphase is cached with interesting structures that need more studies.

The implantation of intravascular stent (IVS) is a kind of coronary angioplasty to restore the blood flow perfusion to the downstream of the heart muscle tissue. The superior mechanical properties of a stent guarantee the successful implantation. This paper intends to improve the mechanical properties of MAC STENTTM by utilizing optimization theory instead of the conventional trial-and-error approach. In order to achieve this goal, firstly, a reliable procedure of finite element analysis (FEA) is established based on a parametric geometric model. The FEA overcomes the difficulties due to nonlinearities such as elasto-plasticity, large deformation, large strains and contact. It can simulate the stent's deformations during a loading scheme of three phases without any possible failures or irregularities. Secondly, a single objective function, which includes the main mechanical properties of stents, is proposed to replace the initial multi-objective function and then an optimization model is formulated. An optimal design of MAC-J09-3.0 stent is obtained after successful execution of the optimizing process using 41 loops. Its comprehensive mechanical properties are largely improved. It is concluded that the optimization theory is very useful and efficient in the studies of coronary artery stents, although the optimization task encounters many severe difficulties and requires extensive calculation. The result also shows that the single objective function proposed in this paper is practical.

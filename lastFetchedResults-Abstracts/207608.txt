Objective: To investigate the factors that
affect the efficiency of antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide(
AS-ODNs) transfection by insonated gasfilled
lipid microbubbles. Methods: Lipid microbubbles
filled with two types of gases–air and C3F8,
were prepared respectively. An AS-ODNs sequence
HA824 and a breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3 were
used to define the various operating variables determining
the transfection efficiency of insonated
microbubbles. Two mixing methods, three levels of
mixing speed, different mixing durations and various
ultrasound initiation time after mixing were examined
respectively. Transfection efficiency was
detected by fluorescence microscopy. Results: C3F8
microbubbles gave higher levels of AS-ODNs transfection
efficiency than air microbubbles in all test
conditions. Transfection efficiency resulted from
mixing method A (incubation of HA824 and microbubbles
before mixing cells) did not show significant
difference with that of mixing method B (without
incubation of HA824 and microbubbles before mixing
cells). Mixing speed, duration of mixing and
ultrasound initiation time after mixing were central
to determining HA824 transfection efficiency
in vitro. The optimum parameters for SK-BR-3 cells
were found at a mixing speed of 40–50 rpm for 30–
60 s with less than 60 s delay before ultrasound.
Conclusion: Ultrasound-mediated AS-ODNs transfection
enhanced by C3F8–filled lipid microbubbles
represents an effective avenue for AS-ODNs transfer.

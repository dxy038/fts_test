Objective
udy objective was to present a comprehensive literature review on the monitoring of patients with cardiac arrest (CA) and the nursing contribution in this crucial situation. Monitoring techniques during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and in the peri-arrest period (just before or after CA) are included.
s
ches used to access the research studies included a comprehensive search in relevant electronic databases (Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Review, British Nursing Index) using relevant keywords (eg, cardiac arrest, resuscitation, monitoring, nurse, survival, outcome). Books and journals known to the authors were also used.
s
rseâ€™s role in patients with CA is extremely significant and if performed correctly adds great insight to treatment planning and correct management.
sion
recognition of CA and invasive (methods and equipment that require endarterial or intravenous access) and noninvasive monitoring should be prompt and appropriate for early return of spontaneous circulation and improved neurologic outcome in patients.

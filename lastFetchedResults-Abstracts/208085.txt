Introduction and Objective:
Cirrhosis is a pathologically
defined condition, which is
characterized by a combination
of two main lesions, fibrosis
and regeneration nodules along
with a spectrum of clinical
manifestations. In patients with
liver cirrhosis, hepatocyte
damage and necrosis can lead
to abnormalities In laboratory
tests and liver function The
current study was performed in
order to evaluate such
abnormalities in these patients
Materials and MethodS:
Subjects of the study consisted
of 55 HBs-Antigen negative
patients (27 males and 28
females) who were selected
during 2 years. Five ml blood
sample was collected from
each patient for measurement
of liver enzymes, bilirubin,
hemoglobin, blood proteins
level and prothrombine time by
routine diagnostic laboratory
tests
Results: In these patients the
mean of liver enzymes level
and serum globulin were higher
than normal range, and
hemoglobin concentration and
serum albumin level were lower
than normal range but the
prothrombine time was
prolonged. Raising liver
enzyme was lower in aged
patients than in young ones.
Level of serum albumin
decreased and serum globulin
increased in aged patients.
Conclusion: Results of the
study showed, many
abnormalities in laboratory tests
in patients with liver Cirrhosis
which, in turn, can cause many
complications in these patients.
Thus serial laboratory tests are
important for rapid diaqnosis
the management and
prevention of these
complications in patients with
liver cirrhosis.

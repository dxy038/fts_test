A rough road vibration stimulus was reconstructed on a shaker platform to verify if seat effective amplitude transmissibility (SEAT) values can be used as a reliable metric to determine dynamic seat comfort using seven seats and six subjects. The virtual seat method was combined with a paired comparison procedure to obtain reliable subjective dynamic seat comfort data. The psychometric method of constants, a 1-up-1-down Levitt procedure and a 2-up-1-down Levitt procedure were compared experimentally to find the most accurate and efficient paired comparison scheme. A two-track, interleaved, 2-up-1-down Levitt procedure was used for the subjective dynamic seat comfort assessment. SEAT value is an objective metric and has been widely used to determine seat vibration isolation efficiency. There was excellent correlation ( R 2 = 0.97 ) between the subjective ratings and estimated SEAT values on the seat-top when the values are averaged over the six subjects. This study suggests that SEAT values, estimated from averaged seat-top transmissibility functions of six carefully selected subjects, could be used as a reliable metric to select the best seat for a specific road vibration input.

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of the hydroxyl radicals (free and bound) produced by a TiO2 mesoporous coating immobilized on the surface of clay roofing tiles. The efficiency of the coating was determined by microbiological and photochemical tests. In the microbiological test (pour plate method), use was made of the test bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the photochemical test involved the degradation of para-chlorobenzoic acid, monitored by HPLC method. Both experiments were carried out without and with a scavenger (methanol and tert-butanol). The results of the measurement of the photocatalytic efficiency, and the observed changes in the measured contact angle (sessile drop method), imply the existence of a photo-induced hydrophilicity of the TiO2 coated porous substrates. The newly designed coating represents a medium which efficiently hinders bacterial adhesion. The experiments demonstrated the existence of self-cleaning and slight self-disinfecting properties of the mesoporous coating.

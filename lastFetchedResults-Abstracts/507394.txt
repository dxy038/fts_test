In regard to the increasing costs and limitations on the available resources, one of the policy options in the resent years to minimize the constraints of the public extension, has been the privatization of agricultural extension services. In Iranian context, considering the diverse needs of the commercial farmers and inadequacies of the public extensions' services for the small farmers, there is a necessity for searching suitable programs and practices related to private extension. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate and prioritize programs and practices of supplying private extension services to farmers, as perceived by Iranian agricultural extension specialists. A survey research was conducted using a questionnaire which its face validity was confirmed by a panel of related agricultural extension experts and its reliability was established through the administrating of 40 instruments among the extension specialists of the Ministry of Agricultural Jihad (MAJ) and calculating the Croubach's alpha (a=.89). The target population of the study encompassed 125 agricultural extension specialists of MAJ. The gathered data were analyzed using SPSS-win software. The dependant variable was the perception of the agricultural extension specialist regarding the appropriateness of the selected practices of private extension. Based on the findings, the priority of the most important practices for supplying private extension services from the view point of the extension specialists were: farmers' extension organizations, private consultants, and allocating subsides to the farmers. Also, there was a significant difference between the Pb.D and M.Sc respondents as to their perceptions on the appropriateness of the three above-mentioned private extension practices.

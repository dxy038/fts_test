Current harmonics in a PWM bidirectional AC-DC power converter are reduced considerably by using a feedforward artificial neural network. The network calculates the exact switching angles for the power converter to eliminate selected harmonics. The number of switching actions and hence the switching losses, are much smaller compared to the other PWM techniques. The control scheme of the power converter is discussed

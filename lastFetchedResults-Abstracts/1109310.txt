The development of a new parallel framework for integrated modeling of tokamak plasmas is a primary objective of the SciDAC Framework Architecture for Core-Edge Transport Simulations (FACETS) project. The FACETS code will be used to predict the performance of tokamak discharges and to optimize tokamak discharge scenarios. Novel parallel numerical algorithms and solvers have been developed in the FACETS project in order to simulate the multi-scale dynamics of tokamak plasmas. The status of development of modules for anomalous transport in the FACETS code is described in this paper. Mechanisms that are used for coupling 1D anomalous transport in the plasma core together with 2D transport in the plasma edge (in near separatrix and scrape-off-layer regions) are considered. Results of the first verification studies based on predictive modeling of several analytical and experimental equilibria are presented.

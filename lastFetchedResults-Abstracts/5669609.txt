To get much better effect of laser acupuncture, The objective of this work is to design and build a low cost portable laser acupuncture therapeutic apparatus, which can realize the real-time stable control of the power output and temperature of LD. The laser source is 30 mW AlGalnP laser diode with an emission wavelength of 650 nm. Fuzzy- PID control theory is used to control the power output and temperature of LD. The MSP430 microcontroller system is used as the control central of the apparatus.

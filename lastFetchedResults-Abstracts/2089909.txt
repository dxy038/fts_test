This paper proposes a new multi-objective optimization algorithm based on modified teachingâ€“learning-based optimization (MTLBO) algorithm in order to solve the optimal location of automatic voltage regulators (AVRs) in distribution systems at presence of distributed generators (DGs). The objective functions including energy generation costs, electrical energy losses and the voltage deviation are considered in this paper. In the proposed MTLBO algorithm, teacher and learner phases are modified. The considered objective functions are energy generation costs, electrical energy losses and the voltage deviations. The proposed algorithm uses an external repository to save founded Pareto optimal solutions during the search process. Since the objective functions are not the same, a fuzzy clustering method is used to control the size of the repository. The proposed technique allows the decision maker to select one of the Pareto optimal solutions (by compromising) for different applications. The performance of the suggested algorithm on a 70-bus distribution network in comparison with other evolutionary methods such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and TLBO is extraordinary.

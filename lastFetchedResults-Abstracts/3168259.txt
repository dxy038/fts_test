Impact assessment of the thermoelectric power plants (Progresu and Grozavesti) in Bucharest on the environmental air quality is the aim of this paper. The thermoelectric power stations produce as much gaseous (CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, NOx, and SO<sub>2</sub>) as solid (ash and heavy metals) pollutants. The study has been performed for a year, For NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> pollutant for all seasons and the main objective are the comparison of two power plants to see which the impact has in Bucharest and in neighbourhoods. All the input informationÂ´s are provided by the air quality dispersion Gaussian model OML (Operational Local Model): meteorological data, emissions data, point sources (inner and height of stack, speed of gases). The paper also approaches the influence of coal on the environment by transborder SO<sub>2</sub> pollution.

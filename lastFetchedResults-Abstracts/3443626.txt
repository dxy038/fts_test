A surface motor (SFM) that enables bidirectional motion using only one motor has been proposed. Considering the difficulty of obtaining a three-dimensional finite-element method usable for the SFM, the authors set up a method of analysis that is an approximate three-dimensional analysis. For the approximation, the authors corrected the distributions of magnetic field, and then checked for coincidence. As a result, the measured and analytical values of static thrust were almost the same, thus confirming the establishment of an analytical method

Resettlement in water project is a complex and systematic project with multi- level, multi - objective and multi-property characteristics. The evaluation of resettlement result has become the focus of related research. This paper combines the GIS tools and AHP to evaluation of resettlement result in water project. The main steps are: First, the alternative resettlement area in water project will be selected in a variety of constraints by the aid of GIS tools, GIS spatial query method, in order to alleviate the preparatory works; Secondly, weights of evaluation indexes will be determined using AHP; Third, the evaluation effect will be mapped by use of the statistical features of GIS mapping. Finally, take the Zou matang Project Area in Changshu as an example, the evaluation method has been verified by the actual survey data, and the test results shows that this method has the characteristics of simple, intuitive and strongly operational and can be widely extended to other kinds of resettlement evaluation.

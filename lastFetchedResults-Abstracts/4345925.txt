For the operation mechanism of R&amp;D input-output system is imprecision, it is hard to predict the structure optimization of R&amp;D funding investment. This paper confirms contribution degree of scientific and technological output from R&amp;D funding by grey correlation analysis, and establishes objective function. At last, we predict and optimize the R&amp;D funding investment of Jiangsu Province in twelfth five-year, and the best allocation program is given, which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the method.

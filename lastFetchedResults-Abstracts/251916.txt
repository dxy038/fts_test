The objective of this study was to investigate the possibility of representing specific
heat capacities of the three metals comprising Group VA of the periodic
table: vanadium, niobium and tantalum, with polynomials, from ambient temperature
to close to their melting point temperatures. The analysis was based on
available literature data including experimental studies of these metals at the
Thermophysical Properties Laboratory of the ‘‘Vincˇa’’ Institute using millisecond
resolution pulse calorimetry. This work has resulted in recommended
functions obtained by analysis of existing experimental data. A critical analysis
of methods used in obtaining these data, pointing to possible inherent sources of
systematic errors that might influence their reliability, resulted in preferential
weights of different data sets. Possible use of these three metals as candidates for
specific heat capacity standard reference materials is also discussed.

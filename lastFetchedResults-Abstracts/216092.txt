Background: Since embryonic stem (Â£S) cells have the dual ability to proliferate indefinitely
and differentiate into multiple tissue types, ES cells could potentially provide an unlimited
cell supply for human transplantation.
Objective: In order to study the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells, they
were cultured in suspension by using ES media without Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) to
induce spontaneous differentiation. Cellular morphology of differentiated derivatives was
then evaluated.
Materials and Methods: Undifferentiated mES from our laboratory were cultured in three
different settings by using ES media containing 0.1% / 1mM trypsin/EDTA and removing
LIF; in the absence of murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells (group 1), in the
presence of MEF feeder cells with a density of 0.5 <I 05 cells/ml (group 2), and 0.5 <I 06
cells/ml (group 3). Five days after the initiation of cell culture, and inducing mES cells to
form embryoid bodies (EBs), they were removed from dish by centrifugation, and then they
were cultured on collagen coated dishes for 20 days. The dishes were fixed and stained by
Wright-Gimsa method at the end of the study period.
Results: In group 1, mES cells showed spontaneous differentiation to all derivatives of three
germ cells, including: epithelia like, fibroblast like and neron-like cells. In group 2, almost all
ES cells were found to be differentiated into granular progenitor cells including hematopoietic
cell lineages. In group 3, various morphologies including nerve cell lineages and fibroblastlike
cells were detected.
Conclusion: Differentiation of mES cells can be a dose response process, depending on the
factors that may be released from MEF feeder layer toES media in a coculture system. Our
results indicated that in the presence of low numbers of MEF cells, mES cells can
spontaneously differentiate into hematopoeitic cell lineages.

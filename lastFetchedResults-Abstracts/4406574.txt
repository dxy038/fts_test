This paper presents a proximity coupled microstrip antenna, 2&#215;1 microstrip antenna array, 4&#215;1 microstrip antenna array and 4&#215;2 microstrip antenna array design for simultaneous improvement of Bandwidth, Gain, Directivity in 4&#215;1 and 4&#215;2 microstrip antenna array using a dielectric substrate FR4 for 8GHz frequency applications. The main objective of this paper is to improve the Bandwidth and Gain of microstrip patch antenna array although assuring the desired Radiation pattern, Directivity and Efficiency. The proximity coupled microstrip antenna with Air-Gap is used as the bandwidth enhancement technique. By using 4&#215;1 proximity coupled microstrip antenna array technique, a bandwidth enhancement of 57MHz, 98MHz and 117MHz can be achieved when compared to proximity coupled microstrip antenna, 2&#215;1 and 4&#215;1 microstrip antenna array case.

This paper addresses the problem of supporting the software development process through the artificial intelligence. The expert systems could advise the domain engineer in programming without the detailed experience in programming languages. He will use and integrate, with the help of deductive database and domain knowledge, the previously developed software components to new complex functionalities. The service oriented architecture (SOA) and loosely coupled software allow to fulfill these requirements. The objective of this document is to provide the knowledge representation of atomic Web services which will be registered as the facts in the deductive database as well as the inferring techniques. Also, the use of domain specific language (DSL) for modeling domain engineerpsilas requests to the expert system will be considered within this document.

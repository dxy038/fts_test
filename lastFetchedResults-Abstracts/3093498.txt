GALILEO is Europe&#8217;s initiative for a state-of-the-art global navigation satellite system, providing a highly accurate, guaranteed global positioning, navigation and timing service under civilian control. In addition of the Open Services which will provide GNSS performances free of charge but without any guarantee of service, the Public Regulated Service (PRS) will provide position and timing to specific users requiring a high continuity of service and integrity, thanks to its improved robustness to interference and jamming and its incorporated integrity feature. Two PRS navigation signals with encrypted ranging codes and data will be available. The European GNSS Supervisory Authority and an EADS-led consortium have been managing since September 2006 the first PRS project, entitled PACIFIC standing for &#8220;PRS Application Concept Involving Future Interested Customers&#8221;. The main objective of this project is to pave the way towards the introduction of Galileo PRS into User Communities to enable them to benefit from the added value of the Galileo PRS capabilities, whatever they use the GNSS capability for navigation, positioning or timing applications. The PACIFIC presentation will set out the following points: &#9642; Status on the Galileo Programme to date ; &#9642; Results of the PACIFIC project so far including the definition of the benefits and added value to users of the Galileo PRS; &#9642; Role of Galileo PRS in synchronisation &amp; timing applications, in particular by providing a reliable synchronization facility through its continuity of service and its integrity feature. It is anticipated that by the time of the conference detailed results will be available from detailed interactions with user communities to identify the benefits to them that Galileo PRS can bring. Also available at this time will be information about the key technology challenges in Galileo PRS User equipment and the infrastructure that will be necessary to- enable users to use Galileo PRS.

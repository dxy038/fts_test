Introduction: Fasting during Ramadan plus changes in sleep schedule effects the pattern of different hormone secretions. .
Objective: This study was done to determine the effect of fasting on thyroid hormone secretion and in case of satisfactory changes, fasting might be used to promote the function of thyroid gland and in case of unsatisfactory effect, at risk patients may be prohibited from fasting.
Materials and Methods: Fifty-two single male students aging 18- 24 years who had at least a daily abstinence of 12 hours during Ramadan voluntarily participated in the study. Four samples of blood were taken from them: the first sample (Control) was taken two day before Ramadan and the other three samples (experimental cases) were taken at 4 pm on the tenth, twentieth and twenty- eighth of Ramadan. Besides the students had the same diet. Their weight was measured during the experiment days. Concentration of
T4 , T; and TSH were measured by means of "Elisa" device. Then the results were analyzed through ANOVA intra - group method.
Results: The assessment of the results revealed that the serum of T4 increased in the last days of Ramadan (P <0.01). But no changes occurred in serum of T3 and TSH in men as compared to before Ramadan. Also
during Ramadan there was a significant decrease in body weight in every subject.
Conclusion: Overall the study showed that all changes in secretion of thyroid hormones in men during Islamic Fasting month are physiologic and causes no pathologic changes.

In this paper, we solve two problems in a 300-mm wafer fabrication facility (fab). Firstly, for the lot scheduling problem, we propose a multi-objective genetic programming based rule generator (MOGPRG) to evolve useful dispatching rules, which can provide near-optimal lot schedules concerning multiple objectives. Secondly, the overhead hoist transports (OHT) routing problem is considered. As the modern automated material handling system (AMHS) is capable of doing tool-to-tool direct delivery, the congestion of OHTs may happen more often than the past. To deal with the traffic congestion in AMHS, a dynamic routing method is proposed to find the near-shortest and less-congested path for the OHT to travel along. It can reduce the traffic congestion and achieve fast lot delivery by adapting to the dynamic traffic environment. The proposed MOGPRG is integrated with the dynamic routing method to improve two fab performance metrics: mean cycle time and tardy rate. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed MOGPRG and dynamic routing method.

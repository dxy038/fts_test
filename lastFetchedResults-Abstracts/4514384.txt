The objective of this paper is to give an overview of some of the sensor technologies used for nondestructive testing applications. The methods explained are holography, fiber-optic, videography, and ultrasonic. A section on the concept of sensor fusion is added for the sake of systemic considerations and completeness. A listing of a number of good references is also included. The paper discusses the selection of appropriate methods for the specific application

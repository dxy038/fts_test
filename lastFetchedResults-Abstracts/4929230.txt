TCM syndrome simulation teaching platform is a new type of teaching &amp; scientific research simulation platform with human-machine dialogue function established on the basis of borrowing the domestic and foreign relevant research work. It is composed of disease display unit, human-machine dialogue interrogation unit, TCM syndrome diagnosis &amp; treatment unit and feedback unit. This platform is mainly controlled by the computer. It can really display the patientpsilas information such as tongue image, simulated pulse image and point tenderness. Besides, it will be connected with the interrogation unit, TCM syndrome diagnosis &amp; treatment unit and feedback unit so as to realize the realtime simulation to the real patients, attain the objective of realtime simulated diagnosis and treatment and demonstrate TCM diagnosis features. It is featured as convenient operation, risklessness, repeated use, recordability of teaching and training results. It has demonstrated the advantages of simulated teaching.

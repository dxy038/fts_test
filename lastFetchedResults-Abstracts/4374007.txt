The degree of cooperation and level of experts become the crucial standard in computer supported collaborative design, because many decision-makers participating in the design process have different expertise and goals. Our approach is to set up a model based on decision and to seek a better algorithm for conflict resolution. This paper described conflict problem as a multi-objective decision-making optimization model, and presented the concepts of non-cooperation degree and reliability degree. Furthermore, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was employed to resolve the conflict problem. To validate its efficiency, we compared the performance of PSO with genetic algorithm (GA) by a real case of missile collaborative design. The result demonstrates the advantage and effectiveness of the model and the proposed algorithm

We consider a cellular system using frequency division duplexing and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), where the base station has multiple antennas and each mobile terminal feeds back a quantized version of the channel state information. For downlink transmission, the base station performs joint scheduling and beamforming with the objective of maximizing the system throughput. In this letter, we propose an iterative (in the user selection) beamforming algorithm which exploits approximated orthogonality conditions of the scheduled users. By simulation results it is seen that new approach outperforms existing scheduling techniques in terms of outage throughput with similar or lower complexity.

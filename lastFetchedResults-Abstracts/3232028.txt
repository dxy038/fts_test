Image quality assessment delivers an objective (algorithmic) score. This score must be correlated as much as possible to the human visual perception when seeing images distorted by some compression and/or transmission tools, e.g. JPEG compression, white noise, fast fading. The process can be a full-reference or a null-reference image quality assessment depending on if it has the knowledge of the original undistorted image. This paper presents a prospective for building a null-reference image quality assessment, for a given distorted image, its aim is to deliver both the global objective score and the distortion map where each pixel has a distortion measurement.

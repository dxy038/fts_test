Introduction and objective: The World Health Organization estimates that about 8 to 10 million new Tuberculosis (TB) cases occur annually worldwide and its incidence is currently increasing. There are two million deaths from TB each year. The plants are an important source of new antimicrobial agents. In this study, antibacterial activity of Allium ascalonicum against Mycobacterium tuberculosis was evaluated. 
Materials and methods: To extraction antibacterial agent from this plant, 100g of underground root of A. ascalonicum was mixed with 100ml ethyl acetate and shacked gently. Partially purified antibacterial compound was isolated by organic solvents. Antibacterial activity of this fraction against M. tuberculosis was performed using the E test.
Results: Shallot extract showed antimycobacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 500?g/ml.
Conclusion: It is implied that A. ascalonicum extract could be used as an effective antibacterial agent against M. tuberculosis, which is a resistant infection in pulmonary tuberculosis.

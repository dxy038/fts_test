The high intensity pulsed electric field is one of the promising technique for the liquid foods sterilization and the pulse-generating circuit is the most critical part. The objective of this research is to obtain the pulse circuit that is more energy efficient and higher sterilization ratio for the liquid food sterilization. Through analyzing several circuits and calculating the equivalent circuit of liquid food, we designed the pulse-forming network of unipolar square wave pulsed circuit. The modeling and simulation of square wave pulsed circuit using power system block toolbox/SIMULINK were presented. It obtained peak value of 35 kV, flat top pulse and rapidly decline square wave. It showed that the simulation of the pulse-forming network was a feasible approach.

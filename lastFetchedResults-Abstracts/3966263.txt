Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) have been recently attracting an increasing attention from both research and industry communities. One of the challenges posed by the study of VANETs is the definition of a vehicular mobility model providing an accurate and realistic vehicular mobility description at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. Another challenge is to be able to dynamically alter this vehicular mobility as a consequence of the vehicular communication protocols. Many mobility models have been developed by the community in order to solve these two issues. However, due to the large number of available models claiming to be adapted to vehicular traffic, and also due to their different and somehow incomparable features, understanding their true characteristics, their degree of realism with respect to vehicular mobility, and real capabilities is a hard task. In this survey, we first introduce a framework that proposes a guideline for the generation of vehicular mobility models. Then, we illustrate the different approaches chosen by the community for the development of vehicular mobility models and their interactions with network simulators. Finally, we propose an overview and taxonomy of a large range of mobility models available for vehicular ad hoc networks. The objective is to provide readers with a guideline to easily understand and objectively compare the different models, and eventually identify the one required for their needs.

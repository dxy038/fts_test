Common e-commerce websites rely heavily on JPEG images for product presentation. In this paper we present a new coding scheme and file format that is tailored to the presentation of single-color products. A JPEG image file can be transcoded into this new format leading to substantial reduction in file size (Average of 28%) with practically no quality degradation. We describe how we can take advantage of several features found in images for product presentation to improve coding efficiency. Objective and subjective performance measurements are presented to demonstrate that little quality degradation is incurred after transcoding.

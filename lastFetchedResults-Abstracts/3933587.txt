A coherent, heterodyne-detection, optical time-domain reflectometry technique suitable for an all-optical repeater system is proposed. Rayleigh backscatter measurement through a 309-km bidirectional optical transmission line with six cascaded in-line semiconductor laser amplifiers is demonstrated using this technique. The possibility of fault localization on an optical amplifier system with optical isolators is shown.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

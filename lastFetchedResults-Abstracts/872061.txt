In this paper we present a duality approach for a multiobjective fractional programming
problem. The components of the vector objective function are particular ratios involving
the square of a convex function and a positive concave function. Applying the Fenchel–
Rockafellar duality theory for a scalar optimization problem associated to the multiobjective
primal, a dual problem is derived. This scalar dual problem is formulated in terms of
conjugate functions and its structure gives an idea about how to construct a multiobjective
dual problem in a natural way. Weak and strong duality assertions are presented.

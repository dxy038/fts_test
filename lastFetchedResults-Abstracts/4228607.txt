In this paper we present a new approach for the stabilisation of non linear polynomial systems within the framework of linear matrix inequalities (LMI). The major objective is to show how a non linear polynomial state feedback can be formulated to stabilize the polynomial systems using the LMI approach. The proposed result is based on previous results on the global stability of autonomous non linear polynomial systems.

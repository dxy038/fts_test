From a systematic perspective, the connotation and evaluation of manufacturing enterprise competitive strength are analyzed and studied. Using the AHP method and considering the characteristics of manufacturing enterprises, an indices system for manufacturing enterprise competitive strength evaluation is established based on innovation achievement, productivity, and marketing competitive strength. In the evaluation process, subjective weights are determined through expert investigation method and objective weights are determined through entropy weight method. Then, using no dimensional processing method and convergence processing method, a corresponding evaluation model is established through combining the subjective weights and objective weights. Finally, based on the evaluation model, the comprehensive manufacturing enterprise competitive strength is determined. The evaluation system of enterprise competitive strength analysis and evaluation is developed on Delphi 7 platform and is validated by an instance.

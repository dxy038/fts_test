In order to estimate the quality of degraded audio processed by wireless communication networks, a new paradigm has to be designed since conventional objective audio quality assessment methods such as PEAQ are not targeting at the applications. This paper presents a new intrusive objective audio quality assessment method using localized loudness difference based Jitter Distortion Measure (JDM) approach for Quality Assessment of AMR_WB+ (Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband Plus) codec. We show that including Jitter Distortion Measures and Energy Equalization parameters as additional Model Output Variables (MOVs) of the PEAQ basic version show superior performance in the mobile audio quality assessments.

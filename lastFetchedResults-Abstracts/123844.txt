Objective: Forward head and rounded shoulder are common causes of malalignment. Vertebral alignment affects shoulder posture and shoulder girdle function. The effects of neck and shoulder girdle stabilizing exercises versus traditional exercises, on its functional indices i.e midthoracic carvature, and forward head posture, were studied.
Material and Methods: Thirty 18-40 year old females with abnormal upper quarter were selected and alternatively were divided in to two treatment groups, one receiving stabilizing exercises and the other traditional exercises, treatment continued for 18 session. 5 times study indices were objecively measured: once before treatment, three times fortnightly and once two weeks after the final session, as follow up. Shared session inclued stretching shortened muscles, and streangthing and facilitating of the weak muscles.
Results: Before treatment, no significant relationship in functional indices with in groups. In both group, sequential evaluations indicated significant differences as to postural indices. Both groups showed no significant difference regarding functional indices. Stabilization group had greater tendency toward maintanace of the forward head posture. where as traditional group had greater tendency toward midthoracic curvature improvement.
Conclusion: After restoring neck- shoulder girdle complex flexibility to improve and retrain movement patterns and maintain achivements, stabilizing exercises can be used.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the outcome of patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma after extreme drug resistance assay-directed therapy.
Study design
Fifty women who were treated with chemotherapy based on extreme drug resistance assay guidance were compared with 50 well-balanced control subjects who were treated empirically.
Results
In the platinum-sensitive group, patients with extreme drug resistance–directed therapy had an overall response rate of 65% compared with 35% in the patients who were treated empirically (P = .02). The overall and progression-free median survival were 38 and 15 months in the extreme drug resistance assay group compared with 21 and 7 months in the control group, respectively (P = .005, overall; P = .0002, progression free). In the platinum-resistant group, there was no improved outcome in the patients who underwent assay-guided therapy. In multivariate analysis, platinum-sensitive disease, extreme drug resistance–guided therapy and early stage of disease were independent predictors for improved survival.
Conclusion
In this retrospective analysis, our results indicate an improved outcome in patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma who have platinum sensitive disease and who underwent extreme drug resistance–directed chemotherapy. Randomized, prospective, controlled trials are needed.

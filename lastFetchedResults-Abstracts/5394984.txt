This paper presents interim results with respect to an objective metric for the accessibility dimension of data quality. It builds on a conceptual framework developed in previous research. This framework examined the dimensions of data quality and in particular the accessibility dimension. A definition of the accessibility dimension was presented based on its objective attributes as outlined by both practitioners and academics. The findings suggest that it is possible to measure this dimension objectively. The attributes are measured in a controlled environment and have been compared with traditional survey methodologies. The results indicate a relationship between the level of data quality and each of the accessibility attributes examined in the controlled environment. The overall measure of data quality can be it is argued improved by measuring these objective attributes and applying the necessary improvements identified. Future research intends to examine all of these attributes, their impact on data quality and possible remedies for overall improved data quality.

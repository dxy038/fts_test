The design of buildings is a multi-criterion optimization problem, there always being a trade-off to be made between capital expenditure, operating cost, and occupant thermal comfort. This paper investigates the application of a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) search method in the identification of the optimum pay-off characteristic between the energy cost of a building and the the occupant thermal discomfort. Results are presented for the pay-off characteristics between energy cost and zone thermal comfort, for three design days and three building weights. Inspection of the solutions indicates that the MOGA is able to find the optimum pay-off characteristic between the daily energy cost and zone thermal comfort. It can be concluded that multi-criterion genetic algorithm search methods offer great potential for the identification of the pay-off between the elements of building thermal design, and as such can help inform the building design process.

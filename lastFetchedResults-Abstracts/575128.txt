Introduction & Objective: Despite mild and self limited manifestation of rubella , involvement of fetus as a consequence of prenatal infection is very important and can lead to congenital rubella syndrome (Cs). The aim of this study was the evaluation of immunity rate against rubella virus in women who were in child bearing ages.
Materials & Methods: This survey was performed with cooperation of health center on 248 cases of women who are offered for pre marriage serologic test and their titers of IgG antibody against rubella with Elisa method was measured.
Results: Out of 248 specimens , 41 (16.5%) were non immune against rubella and 207 (83.5%) were immune. The frequency of immune serologic titer was highest in the age groupof 18-23 years and was lowest in the age group of 30-34 years. Of 138 cases that lived in the urban area, 121 cases (87.7%) were immune and 17 cases (12.3%) were non immune and out of 110 cases that lived in rural areas , 86 cases (78.2%) were immune and 24 cases (21.8%) were non immune. Education level of most women were graduated from high school (50.8%) , whereas the rate of illiterate women was least (1.6%). In this study nobody had a history of vaccination against rubella and 16 cases (6.5%) had a history of rubella infection.
Conclusion: On the basis of this study 83.5% of subjects in studied group were immune against rubella and 16.5% were non-immune. This study showed that women in child bearing ages should be checked for rubella and vaccinated against it, if they are non immune.

A genetic algorithm is used to optimize a CO2 laser resonator. Three optimal parameters of a CO2 laser resonator (the diameter of the laser discharge tube, the curvature radius of the concave reflector and the transmissivity of the output-mirror) are obtained with the maximum output of the laser power as the objective function in the genetic algorithm. After the optimization, the calculated laser power with the fundamental mode increases by 62% and the measured value increases by 35% in an experiment as compared to a non-optimized case.

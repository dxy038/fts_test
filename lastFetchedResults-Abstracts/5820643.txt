Radar emission betrays transmitter presence and position. In hostile environments this will endanger the transmitting platform and may even exacerbate strained international relations. Bistatic (and multistatic) radars dissociate transmitter and receiver to allow the receiver platform to remain silent. The objective of the programme described herein has been to develop a non-cooperative bistatic radar which simply comprises a passive receiver system. Even the enemyÂ´s own radars found operating in the vicinity can be used as incognizant transmitters of opportunity. Not even a standoff cooperating transmitter is put at risk, yet surveillance and navigation can still be achieved in hostile areas. Within security restrictions imposed upon the programme, this paper describes the basic principles and techniques employed to prove the feasibility and operational usefulness of such a system. In addition to investigating specific receiver and analysis techniques during the programme, significant emphasis has been placed on proving the practicability and typical availability of suitable opportunity donor transmitters in several environments

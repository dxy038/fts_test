The objective of this paper is to present an algorithm that allows us to record the movements and metrics that the surgeon does for placement of intrapedicular screw in lumbar region, and also provides de visual feedback that simulates the fluoroscope imagery. This algorithm is intended for be used with a model of the lumbar area in order to develop a simulator of a minimum invasive surgery, that will allows the resident training in this procedure.

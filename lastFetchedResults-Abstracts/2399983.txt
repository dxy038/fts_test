Objective
M ceramic restorative material is routinely bonded to tooth substrates using adhesive cement. This study investigates micro-crack growth and damage in the ceramic/dentin adhesive interface under fatigue shear testing monitored using the acoustic emission (AE) technique with optical coherence tomography (OCT).
s
c/dentin adhesive samples were prepared to measure the shear bond strength (SBS) under static load. Fatigue shear testing was performed using a modified ISO14801 method. Loads in the fatigue tests were applied at 80%, 70%, and 60% of the SBS to monitor interface debonding. The AE technique was used to detect micro-crack signals in static and fatigue shear bond tests.
s
sults showed that the average SBS value in the static tests was 10.61 ± 2.23 MPa (mean ± standard deviation). The average number of fatigue cycles in which ceramic/dentin interface damage was detected in 80%, 70% and 60% of the SBS were 152, 1962 and 9646, respectively. The acoustic behavior varied according to the applied load level. Events were emitted during 60% and 70% fatigue tests. A good correlation was observed between crack location in OCT images and the number of AE signal hits.
icance
 technique and OCT images employed in this study could potentially be used as a pre-clinical assessment tool to determine the integrity of cemented load bearing restored ceramic material. Sustainable cyclic load stresses in ceramic/dentin-bonded specimens were substantially lower than the measured SBS. Predicted S–N curve showed that the maximum endured load was 4.18 MPa passing 106 fatigue cyclic.

Background
LDL-cholesterol therapeutic objectives attainment under lipid lowering therapy remains inadequate. The correlates of LDL-cholesterol therapeutic objective attainment have not been thoroughly explored in an observational setting.
Methods
Patients under lipid lowering therapy and managed by general practitioners were included. LDL-cholesterol therapeutic objective was defined according to the number of cardiovascular risk factors associated with dyslipidemia (AFSSAPS-2005 guidelines).
Results
Most of the 2727 patients (mean age: 64.7 ± 11.0) received a statin (70.0%) or a fibrate (24.3%) in monotherapy. 58.5% of patients at high cardiovascular risk did not reach therapeutic objective. Compared to simvastatin, patients receiving fibrates were less likely to be at therapeutic objective (OR = 0.38, 95% CI = [0.26–0.54]). So were patients receiving fluvastatin (OR = 0.41, IC95% = [0.26–0.64]) or pravastatin (OR = 0.49, IC95% = [0.35–0.70]) at the dosages used by GPs.
No significant difference appeared with atorvastatin (OR = 0.99, 95% CI = [0.71–1.39]) or rosuvastatin (OR = 1.25, CI95% = [0.77–2.02]). Patients with LDL-cholesterol levels < 0.7 g/L tended to be prescribed high doses of lipid lowering therapy.
Conclusions
In real conditions of lipid lowering therapy use, LDL-cholesterol therapeutic objective attainment was inadequate in high-risk patients, and TO differences were observed between drugs at prescribed doses.

The objective of the Smart Rollator project is to enable health care monitoring through embedding electronic sensing systems. This paper examines adding an ECG system to a rollator, designed specifically to interface with two gel-less electrodes. The focus is to develop a circuit with minimal filtering of the signal, just sufficient to extract valuable ECG information reliably using digital processing techniques. A prototype system is built and evaluated, its performance compared to a conventional three-electrode ECG amplifier. Preliminary results demonstrate that the proposed circuit can be used for the Smart Rollator application.

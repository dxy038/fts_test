The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of silica fume on the hydration heat of concrete. Portland cement was replaced by silica fume in amounts from 10 % to 30 % by mass in concrete with w/(c+sf) ratios varying between 0.25 and 0.45. A superplasticizer was used to maintain a fluid consistency. The heat of hydration was monitored continuously by a semi-adiabatic calorimetric method for 10 days at 20 Â°C. The calorimetric study indicated that the hydration was modified by the presence of silica fume. In the early stages, the silica fume showed a high activity and accelerated the hydration rate as compared to that of the reference concrete. The fine silica fume particled provided nucleation sites for hydrates growth. Then the pozzolanic activity took over and increased both strength and the hydration heat. A substitution of Portland cement by 10% with silica fume produced greater strength and cumulative heat of hydration as compared to that of the reference concrete.

The main objective of this study is to develop the injection control strategy for high pressure common rail diesel engine based on the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) with the micro-controller MPC555. The control software was designed by modularization method according to various working conditions of diesel engine. The software modules include the fuel quantity control module, rail pressure control module, point of the engine operation (POP) management module, four stages of the start procedure control module, and so on. Finally, experiments were carried out on test bench to verify the control feasibility and reliability of the strategies and optimize the emissions, Experimental results showed that the anticipated control effects were achieved and the engine reached the EURO-square exhaust emission standard.

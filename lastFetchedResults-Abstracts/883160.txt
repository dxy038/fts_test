Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the profile of the diabetic subjects reporting to tertiary care hospitals
at Ahmedabad, Western India.
Methods: From August 2006 to Jan. 31, 2009, a cross-sectional observational study was performed on diabetic
subjects attending the Department of Diabetology, All India Institute of Diabetes and Research, and Yash Diabetes
Specialties Centre (Swasthya), Ahmedabad. Case histories were recorded on a semi-structured, close-ended proforma
basis and simultaneously anthropometric measurements and blood pressure were recorded and urine and
blood tests were carried out. Data analysis was performed through SPSS (11.5).
Results: A total of 709 diabetic subjects were enrolled through a simple random sampling methodology. Of the total
study population, 88 percent hade Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Almost all were literate. More than 40 percent of the
study subjects had hypertension, 70 percent had dyslipidemia, 62 percent were obese, and 42 percent had
uncontrolled glycemic status (HbA1c  > 9 percent). Hence their overall risk profile, notable obesity, lipid profile,
hypertension and glycemic status were very unfavourable.
Conclusion: Our findings suggest a relatively unfavourable risk profile of the diabetic subjects who also suffered
from diabetic complications. We recommend modifying the risk profile through early screening, education, and
lifestyle modification strategies to improve the quality of life for diabetics.

Until recently, the problem of how to design survivable optical networks under single link failure has been studied quite extensively. However, the study on the design of optical networks for single node failure has been rarely discussed. This paper proposes 3 methods to reconfigure multicast traffic in WDM network for single node failure based on integer linear programming (ILP) technique by reconfiguration of entire network, reconfiguration of traffic traversing through failure node and reconfiguration of traffic adjacent to failure node. The last two methods, we used node-disjoint share protection path between primary path and backup path to reconfigure multicast traffic. We used multicast routing and wavelength assignment (MC-RWA) namely, light-tree (LT) and virtual light-tree (VLT) to design multicast traffic in WDM network for a single node failure. The objective of this paper is to design WDM network which supports multicast traffic for a single node failure in order to minimize fiber for survival network, given a static multicast traffic set, the number of wavelength per fiber can support and the network design approach (LT and VLT).

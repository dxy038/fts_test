The objective of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is to produce civilian standards. This is of interest world-wide for the electronics and power industries in order to harmonise methods of protection and the development of protection devices. All information used and developed is unclassified. The intention of SC77C is to use existing IEC EMC standards wherever possible. Preparation of SC77C standards is consistent with the development of EMC standards and thus structured according to &#8220;IEC Publication 61000&#8221; which is divided into seven major parts. Only parts 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 are included at present. The present development of standards includes eleven active projects. This paper discusses progress of work on high altitude EMP on civil equipment and structures

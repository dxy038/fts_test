Background and Objective: Studies showed that Aloe vera extract can influence reproductive functions in animals. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of immobilization stress and Aloe vera extract on serum LH, FSH and testosterone levels in male rats.

Materials and Methods: In this study, male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 9 groups including control, Aloe vera extract receiving, Aloe vera extract and normal saline receiving, acutely or chronically immobilized, acutely or chronically immobilized and normal saline receiving and acutely or chronically immobilized and Aloe vera extract receiving animals of 5 in each group. Chronic immobilization was exerted 2h/day for 3 weeks and acute immobilization was exerted 8h/day for one week. Aloe vera extract (625 mg/kg/body weight) was taken by gavage feeding. Finally, blood samples were collected using cardiac puncture method. Following serum collection, LH, FSH and testosterone levels were measured by radioimmunoassay method.  Data were compared between groups using ANOVA. 

Results: Serum LH or testosterone level significantly decreased in chronically or acutely immobilized rats compared to control animals (p < 0.001); however, LH or testosterone serum level did not significantly change in Aloe vera extract receiving and acutely or chronically immobilized Aloe vera extract receiving animals compared with control rats.

Conclusion: Our findings showed that immobilization stress reduces serum level of LH and testosterone; however, intake of Aloe vera can withstand against.

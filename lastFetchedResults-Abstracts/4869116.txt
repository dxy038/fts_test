The objective of this paper focuses on a study of a collective design process of scenarios describing pedagogical situations. Our aim is to show, in the framework of a project named AEB (apprenticeship electronic booklet) how the design process analysis can be driven by the intermediary objects produced and mobilized in such a process. In particular, we show how the analyses of these intermediary objects give us comprehension elements of the contents and organization of collective design activities. This will allow us to propose conceptual and technical tools to facilitate and support the design process adopted by the designers

Phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) are essential nutrients for plants. Iron availability is low in calcareous soils of Iran due to the excessive amounts of CaCO3 and high pH. Overfertilization of P fertilizers may also decrease Fe availability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of P and Fe on the growth and chemical composition of corn (Zea mays L.) under greenhouse conditions. Treatments consisted of a factorial arrangement of P rates (0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 mg kg^-1 as KH2PO4) and Fe rates (0, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg kg^-1 as Fe EDDHA) in a completely randomized design with four replications. Plants were grown for 8 weeks in a loamy soil, calssified as Chitgar series (fine-loamy, carbonatic, thermic, Typic Calcixerepts).
Results showd that P application up to 80 mg kg^-1increased corn top dry matter. Corn P concentration and total uptake increased by P application but decreased by Fe application. Application of Fe up to 5 mg kg-' increased dry matter but decreased it at higher rates. Concentration and total uptake of Fe increased by Fe application but decreased by P application. Zinc and copper concentrations decresed significantly when P was added. Manganese concentration increased at 40 mg P kg^-1 but decreased at higher rates. Iron application decreased zinc and manganese concentrations but had no effect on copper.

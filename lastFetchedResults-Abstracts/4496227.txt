Solar Array Regulators (SAR) in a satellite Power Conditioning Unit (PCU) are implemented to transfer the power during sunlight from the solar arrays to the power bus. The objective of this paper is to present how Buck Boost Regulators (B<sup>2</sup>R) could be used as Step-Up, Direct Energy Transfer and Step-Down Solar Array Regulators. Control circuitries of a new kind are introduced for regulated and unregulated buses, illustrated by practical results demonstrating that such regulators can be used in satellite power systems.

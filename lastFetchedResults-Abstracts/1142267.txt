The objective of this study was to determine the coagulation properties of pulsed electric field (PEF) treated milk compared with raw and thermally pasteurized milk. PEF treatment was achieved in a continuous chamber using a bipolar square waveform. The maximum 30 kV/cm electric field intensity (E), 120 pulses and up to 50 Â°C treatment temperatures were applied. Dynamic rheological test was conducted to analyze milk coagulation properties. Results indicated that increased E, temperature, and pulse number (N) significantly affected milk coagulation properties. However, in most cases, PEF treated milk showed better rennetability compared to thermally pasteurized milk within the experimental range. Results showed that PEF combined mild heat could be a potential pasteurization method for milk destined for cheese production.

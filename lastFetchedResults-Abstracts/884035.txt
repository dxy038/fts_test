ABSTRACT: Cancer is a disease that occurs due to uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells. Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women and consequently has been extensively investigated in terms of histopathology. Proteomics and bioinformatics are newly developing fields and becoming widely used in cancer research. Generally, one of three main steps of proteomics is separation and identification of proteins in a cell, tissue or organism, to gain objective information about protein characterization and finally, the use in database. Bioinformatics is one of the key components of proteomics technology. Cancer bioinformatics deals with the organization and analysis of the data so that important trends and patterns can be identified the ultimate goal being the discovery of new diagnostic protocols for cancer. This article reviews various proteomics and bioinformatics approaches utilized in breast cancer research.

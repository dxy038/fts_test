Objective
t sealants to prevent erosive tooth wear caused by extrinsic and intrinsic acids under long-term exposition.
s
vine enamel samples were randomly allocated to twelve groups (1–12). Samples of groups 1, 5 and 9 remained unsealed (positive controls), 2, 6 and 10 were sealed with Silicon Seal Nano Mix and 3, 7 and 11 with Seal&amp;Protect. Groups 4, 8 and 12 were sealed with flowable composite (negative controls).

 1–4 were immersed in artificial saliva, 5–8 in hydrochloric acid and groups 9–12 in citric acid for 28 days, respectively. After 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 14, 21 and 28 days, solutions were renewed and enamel wear was quantified by assignation of 32P in the solutions.
s
 immersion solutions, lowest mineral loss was observed for the negative controls whilst highest loss was observed for unsealed positive controls.

ificial saliva and citric acid, the loss from samples sealed with Seal&amp;Protect was not significantly different compared with negative controls whilst loss in groups sealed with Silicon Seal Nano Mix was significantly higher.

rochloric acid, loss from samples sealed with Seal&amp;Protect was not different compared with that of negative controls up to 4 days. Except day 1, the mineral loss in the Seal&amp;Protect group was significantly lower compared with that of the Silicon Seal Nano Mix group.
sion
sted resin based surface sealant is able to significantly reduce the erosive demineralisation of enamel caused by hydrochloric and citric acid even under long-term exposition.

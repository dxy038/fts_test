Objective: Disturbances in sciatic nerves following gluteal injection can lead to varim complications Identification of these disturbances are important in planning treatments and prevention of complications The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the sensitivity and usefulness of H. reflex as method for disturbance in sciatic nerve injection palsies following gluteal injections.
Methods: during a prospective critical study in 4 years, fifteen patients whom suffered from lower extremity paralysis following gluteal injection underwent electrodiagnostic evaluation. After a full-history taking, physical examination and investigation in order to exclude other causes of lower extremity weakness, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and fasting blood sugar, and MRI study of lumbosacral spine were assessed and patients who suffered from lower extremity paralysis three weeks after a gluteal injection were selected for our study. For this purpose, tibial and deep peroneal NCV and tibial H reflexes of both lower extremities at room temprature were recorded .Patients underwent electromyographic examination of extensor digitorurn brevis, tibialis anterior and posterior, gastrocnemus, gluteus maximus and paraspinal muscles in L4, L5 and S I levels to exclude lumbosacrol radiculopathies..
Result: The results showed that peroneal nerve conduction velocity less than 40 mIs were recorded in eleven patients. But, only three patients had tibial nerve conduction decrement less than 40 m/s. Seven patients had H. reflex disturbances (absent or increased H reflex latency)
Conclusion : Measurement of H reflexes disturbances is a more sensitive method in meeting of electrodiagnostic criteria than tibial NCV method for detection of disturbances in sciatic nerve palsies following gluteal injection.

In an assembly line with high labor proportion, the workforce planning and scheduling is a very complex problem. At the background of increasing labor costs, it is very important to increase workforce efficiency. It is essential for companies to remain competitive on global markets. Increasing efficiency is our motivation to work on simulation-based workforce scheduling for complex assembly lines. In this paper, we will focus on the heuristic algorithm in our simulation-based optimization approach. The objective is workforce quantity and slack reduction. To improve the objective, an algorithm assigns the number of workers for activities, scheduled in the simulation run. We will present three different strategies implemented in these optimization algorithms. They basically use the performance indicator slack time, work center utilization and a mix of both parameters. We will compare the algorithms according to their achieved objective and the required computation time.

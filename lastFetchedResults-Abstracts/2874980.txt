Nowadays mobile teleoperated robots are deployed in many branches of human activities e.g. sea submarine robots, military UGVs, rescue missions. Interpretation of visual information to the human operator is still an issue eventhough the technologies of 3D vision are known. The paper presents results of practical experiments with teleoperated robotic arm where the 3D and 2D vision subsystems were used. Even for experienced operators the tasks which have to be done are rather time consuming. The main problem is a perception system which is adapted to human eye (dis)advantages. Humans are able to recognize depth if they can look at a scene directly. The objective of this paper is to find out the ability to use a low cost 3D vision subsystem for improvement of operatorÂ´ efficiency. As a part the methodology the description is included. The experiments were run with many students who manipulated with objects by the robotic arm. Tested hypothesis: is 3D vision for teleoperated robot an improvement contrary to 2D?

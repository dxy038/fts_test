To solve problems of low efficiency, long period and not handling coupling in solid rocket motor traditional design, multidisciplinary design optimization method of solid rocket motor was specified through comparison of typical MDO method and multi-objective collaborative optimization model of solid rocket motor MDO was constructed. Aiming at computation difficulties of CO, paper put forward some approaches to solve the problem. Finally, to reduce solid rocket motor computation expense, three most important disciplinary approximate analysis model of shell, thermodynamic calculation and interior ballistics model were formulated. This research will be valuable for solid rocket motor design using MDO theory.

Autonomous mobility of an agent is the most important feature of mobile agent-based systems. In this paper, we study the reliability of mobility (movement) of an agent in a faulty network environment with invariant (constant) latencies between its nodes. To achieve a reliable agent, we used the integer linear programming model to maximize the route reliability to complete a given task. The suggested criteria could be used as part of the planning module in the planning system of mobile agents. Moreover, we propose a bi-objective planning strategy when the network latencies are highly varied. This leads to a new concept which we call it a mixed planning strategy; it is locally static within each subnetwork but globally dynamic over all connected subnetworks.

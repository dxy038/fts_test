Three-phase to three-phase VSI-PWM rectifier and inverter systems with eight switches have many advantages: capability of unity or even leading power factor; sinusoidal input current waveforms; bidirectional power flow etc. This paper derives a mathematical model of the DC link voltage control for such a system. The transient model for overall and difference voltages of split capacitor DC link is developed, and typical simulated and experimental results for dynamic responses are presented to illustrate important performance characteristics to verify the developed model

Our research investigates cost and performance characteristics for wormhole routers based on HDL designs. Comparison for dimension order routers and turn model based adaptive routers leads to the following conclusions: (1) static and additional routing information which we propose, such as prior dimension specification and in-order delivery, improves the communication performance; (2) an adaptive routing algorithm must be implemented to satisfy the objective speed of the design (the operation speed of the routers significantly affects the network performance); (3) the virtual channels cancel the improvement not only for the dimension order router but also for the naive implementation of the adaptive routers when they degrade the operation speed

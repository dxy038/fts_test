A new method, which integrates the virtue of the probability and mathematical statistics with that of the fuzzy mathematics for power quality assessment, is proposed in this paper. The index showing an aspect of power quality is evaluated using probability and mathematical statistics respectively; the global unique index of these indexes can be obtained. The results obtained from each index unified are unified again using fuzzy synthetic appraisal in order to give an objective, overall and unique index of power quality. The special assessment method for voltage sag using the average sag energy index is also discussed. Finally, a transaction mode makes the maximum benefits for different unit commitment as objective function and takes the power quality into account is presented, and then power energy really becomes a commodity which would be evaluated a price according to power quality

This paper deals with the problem of output-feedback H<sub>&#8734;</sub> control for a class of active quarter-car suspension systems with control delay. The dynamic system of the suspension systems is first formed in terms of the control objectives, i.e., ride comfort, road holding, suspension deflection, and maximum actuator control force. Then, the objective is to the design of the dynamic output-feedback H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controller in order to ensure asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system with H<sub>&#8734;</sub> disturbance attenuation level and the output constraints. Furthermore, using Lyapunov theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, the existence of admissible controllers is formulated in terms of LMIs. With these satisfied conditions, a desired dynamic output-feedback controller can be readily constructed. Finally, a quarter-vehicle model is exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

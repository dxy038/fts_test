This paper presents the concepts and results of high definition (HD) video transport over core IP networks. It discusses the challenges and benefits of broadcasting HD video over core IP network as opposed to traditional methods. The key video codec and network performance parameters, such as packet loss, jitter, latency, and network outages are analyzed. HD MPEG video FEC performance is assessed against certain network conditions. An objective video quality methodology for HD video transport performance is proposed.

Any activity in a computer-supported cooperative working environment produces a set of traces. In a collaborative working context, such traces may be very voluminous and heterogeneous. They reflect all the interactive actions among the actors themselves and between the actors and the system. This paper examines what is required to exploit traces in the context of a collaborative working environment. The objective is to propose a model abstracting the exploiting process from a set of collaborative traces, according to a goal and a specific target framework. The example of the SWOT analysis is described to illustrate the approach.

In this work, we propose an encryption scheme based on the elliptic chaotic maps. The families of one-parameter elliptic chaotic maps of cn and sn at the interval [0, 1] are defined as the ratio of Jacobian elliptic functions of cn and sn types. With the objective of achieving image encryption, an Elliptic Chaotic Maps is applied to permutate the image pixels. Another elliptic chaotic map is used in the diffusion process. In this work, we propose a color and variable size image encryption. The encryption and decryption algorithm presented can fulfill high-level security requirements, large key space, and acceptable encryption speed for a color image. Numerical simulations and graphic representations are executed for image encryption and decryption.

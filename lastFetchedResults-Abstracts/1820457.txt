Objective
tudy evaluated the effects of amalgam restorations on plasma mercury levels and total antioxidant activities (TAA).

udy was comprised of 48 subjects ranging in age from 20 to 32 years. Of these, 33 had dental amalgam restorations and 15 had no dental amalgam restorations. In those patients with amalgams, the total number of amalgam restorations and surfaces were counted, and the total and occlusal areas (mm2) of restorations were measured using a Counting Measurement Machine. Blood samples were collected from all participants. Plasma mercury levels were measured using an Atomic Absorption Spectrometer and Hydride System, and plasma TAA levels were measured using an Antioxidant Assay Kit. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 10.01 software program. Data was evaluated by t test and correlation analysis.
s
 mercury (P-Hg) levels were found to be significantly higher in subjects with amalgam restorations when compared to subjects without amalgams (p &lt; 0.01); the differences in P-TAA levels between subjects with and without amalgams were not found to be statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05). No significant correlations were found between P-Hg concentrations and P-TAA levels (p &gt; 0.05). Significant positive correlations were found between P-Hg concentrations and the number of amalgam restorations (p &lt; 0.01), number of amalgam surfaces (p &lt; 0.05), total amalgam surface area (p &lt; 0.05) and amalgam occlusal surface area (p &lt; 0.01). However, no significant correlations were found between these parameters and P-TAA (p &gt; 0.05).
sions
sults of our study showed that dental amalgams are a major source of plasma mercury; however, amalgam restorations were not found to have a significant effect on plasma-total antioxidant activities.

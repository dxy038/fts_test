The modeling, simulation, sizing and implementation of a range extender for an existing electric vehicle are presented in this paper. The objective is to re-engineer an existing E-truck built with a Li-ion battery pack to increase its initial range of 67 miles to 100 miles. The range extender has been incorporated along with a compact and fault-tolerant battery charger to increase the range. Considering the performances of the different energy sources such as engine-generator set, fuel cells, photovoltaic panels etc., the engine-generator set is selected as a range extender. Different charging schemes are simulated to increase the range of the E-Truck, and a particular charging scheme has been implemented experimentally. The simulation and the experimental results for the developed range extender to charge the battery pack, and the simulation results of the range extended electric truck are presented in the paper.

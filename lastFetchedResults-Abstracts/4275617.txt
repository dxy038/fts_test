Using the achievement files of Chinese nature science basic research in management department, we construct the network of domain knowledge elements (NDKE) to represent domain knowledge. In NDKE, two knowledge elements are considered to be connected if they have the same word or phrase except the stop words. The analysis of the real data shows that domain knowledge elements are finite, that the density of NDKE is stable, and that the cliques in NDKE are numbered. These statistical characteristics illuminates that the domain knowledge of Chinese natural science basic research is limited.

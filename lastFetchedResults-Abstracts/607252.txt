The objective of this study was to determine the effect of calcium borogluconate injection 24, 48 hours prepartum and immediately postpartum on Dry Matter intake at day of calving, milk yield, and as well on blood metabolites during the first 21 days of postpartum in cows fed anionic diets. Thirty six lactating dairy cows were arrenged by parity (1, 2, 3+) and allocated to three subcutaneous injection treatments of 15.2 gr calcium as borogluconate at different times of pre and postpartum ot the expected calving date control. Along with a Treatment 1 consisted of cows (n= 9) receiving no treatment before or after parturition. Treatment 2 consisted of cows (n= 9) receiving 15.2 gr of ca as borogluconate immediately postpartum. Treatment 3 consisted of cows (n= 9) receiving calcium borogluconate 24 h prepartum. Treatment 4 consisted of cows (n= 9) receiving calcium borogluconate 48 h prepartum. Dry matter intake in treatments 1, 2, 3 and 4 were recorded as 10.87, 15.03, 12.63 and 12.32 kg in the first 24 h after calving, respectively and indicating significant differences among treatments. Milk yields in treatments 1, 2, 3 and 4 were recorded as 36.03, 40.35, 38.9 and 38.77 kg/ d  in the first 21 days in milk, respectively with the yield in treatment 2 being significantly greater than that in the control. Serum calcium concentrations in treatments 1, 2, 3 and 4 amounted to 7.77, 9.31, 8.67 and 8.41 mg/ dl, respectively so, the concentration in treatment 2 was significantly than those in the other treatments. Blood glucose concentrations in treatments 2, 3, and 4 were significantly higher than that in  treatment 1.There were no differences observed in the concentrations of serum Ca, Mg, B-hydroxybutyrate and cortisol among treatments. Overall, it was proved that calcium borogluconate injection immediately postpartum can improve performance and many other health indicators than the case when non-injected.

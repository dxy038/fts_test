Digital temporal and spatial filtering of fluoroscopic image sequences can be used to improve the quality of images acquired at low X-ray exposure. In this study, we characterized a nonlinear edge preserving, spatio-temporal noise reduction filter, the bidirectional multistage (BMS) median filter of Arce (1991). To assess image quality, signal detection and discrimination experiments were performed on stationary targets using a four-alternative forced-choice paradigm. A measure of detectability, d´, was obtained for filtered and unfiltered noisy image sequences at different signal amplitudes. Filtering gave statistically significant, average d´ improvements of 20% (detection) and 31% (discrimination). A nonprewhitening detection model modified to include the human spatio-temporal visual system contrast-sensitivity underestimated enhancement, predicting an improvement of 6%. Pixel noise standard deviation, a commonly applied image quality measure, greatly overestimated effectiveness giving 67% improvement in d´. We conclude that human testing is required to evaluate the filter effectiveness and that human perception models must be improved to account for the spatio-temporal filtering of image sequences

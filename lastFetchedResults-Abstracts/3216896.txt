Odours emitted from Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) create nuisance in the surrounding. The odour comes from the mixture of volatile organic compounds present in the sewage gas, leachate, leachate treatment systems, sewage sludges and waste materials. The research objective is to develop a quantitative Odour Assessment and Control Scheme (OACS) describing various methods for the assessment and control of odour. Assessment of Odour Intensity is done by the standard Sniffer Panel method of Olfactometry. Psychophysical laws are applied and validated to evaluate odour concentrations in the semi solid, liquid and gas phases. Parameters of these laws are estimated by a robust non-linear least square technique. The time-variant odour concentration profile goes at par with the time variant VOC concentration (GC/MS outputs) for all the three components like n-Propyl Mercaptan (1-Propanethiol) Ethyl-Methyl Sulphide (Methylthio Ethane) and 3,6 Dimethyl 2,4,5,7-tetrathiooctane (bis 1- [{methylthio} ethyl] disulphide).

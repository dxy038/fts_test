Renewable energy sources, such as offshore wind farms, require high voltage gains in order to interface with power transmission networks. These conversions are normally made using bulky, complex, and costly transformers and high-voltage ac-dc converters with unnecessary bidirectional power flow capability. Multiple modules of single-switch single-inductor dc-dc converters can reach high gains without transformers in these applications due to low semiconductor conduction loss in high-power devices. This paper describes a new approach for high-gain high-voltage dc-dc converters using multiple modules of single-switch single-inductor transformerless converters. Results for low-voltage experimental prototypes show gains of up to 29 p.u. and demonstrate the potential of the approach as high-gain dc-dc converters for offshore wind farms. This paper then demonstrates the viability of multiple-module converters compared to a conventional high-voltage dc converter and a theoretical full-bridge converter due to fewer devices and valves, comparable isolation levels, and ease of interleaving for increased reliability.

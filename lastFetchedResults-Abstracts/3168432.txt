An improved state estimation algorithm based on branch current is put forward to revise leverage-point measurements with gross errors in distribution systems. Using the inherent characteristic of leverage-point measurement, this method introduces structure robust factors into the objective function of the weighted least absolute value (WLAV) estimator for weakening the masking effect of bad leverage-point measurements. Meanwhile, a new approach is proposed to deal with voltage-magnitude measurements on the branch-current-based state estimation so that it can increase the measurement redundancy and the estimation precision, and enhance the observability. An analysis is done for the IEEE 123-bus systems and the tested results show the advantages of each one of new ideas.

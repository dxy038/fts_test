Objective(s): This paper describes synthesisPolyvinyl Alcohol/CaF2:Er nanofibers because of  its  photoluminescence properties. Materials and Methods:  First, CaF2:Er nanocomposite synthesized with co-precipitation method. In order to prepare polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/CaF2:Er nanofibers, CaF2:Er nanocomposites were added to the polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) polymer. PVA/CaF2:Er composite nanofibers were successfully prepared by electrospinning technique. Results:  X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) pattern and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images indicate that the CaF2:Er nanocomposite was formed with cubic phase and the average crystalline size was calculated using the Scherrer's equation is about 26-28 nm. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images show that the diameters of the fine nanofibers are in the range of 60-110 nm. For studying luminescence properties of the nanofibers, the samples excited with different wavelengths and show excellent Up-Conversion luminescence transition. Conclusion: Photoluminescence spectrums of the PVA/CaF2:Er nanofibers illustrate                up-conversion luminescence process. This unique property can have high potential for laser application and bio-imaging in medical technology.

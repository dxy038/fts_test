Uncertainty plays an important role on many engineering problems and there is a growing interest in having reliable solutions especially for problems with sensitive parameters. The paper presents a robust optimization (RO) model for multi-objective operation of capacitated P-hub location problems (MCpHLP) under uncertainty set. There are, at least, two parameters in any P-hub problems, which are under uncertainty. The first one is associated with demand and the second one is the amount of time required to process commodities. We present a scenario based robust optimization technique, where these two items are considered under various scenario and a RO is implemented to find reliable solutions. The implementation of the proposed RO model is demonstrated for an example using weighting method.

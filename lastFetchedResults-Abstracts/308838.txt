There seems to be a lack of a coherent and integrative theory and theoretically informed manuals in cognitive behavioral therapies that could negatively impact both the program of CBT as a platform for psychotherapy integration, as well as its efficacy and effectiveness. Although CBT is the golden psychological treatment for various disorders, overall, about 30â€“40% of the patients are still non-responsive to these interventions and various schools debate their status as promoters of the best theoretical view. The objective of the present paper is to use cognitive psychology/science as a tool to clarify several theoretical confusions in CBT, with impact on a coherent science and practice of CBT. As a general conclusion, we believe that CBT has reached preeminence in the clinical field betting on cold cognitions. Despite obvious advantages and accomplishments, this approach seems to loose its heuristic value. We believe that the next phase of CBT development lies in the construct of hot cognitions (which would increase its effectiveness) and in cognitive psychology (which would contribute to a coherent science of CBT beyond various schools). These developments could offer CBT the chance to be a platform for the integration of psychotherapy.

Background: In the field of mammalian embryo culture, the putative influence of autocrinel
paracrine factor(s), produce by the embryos itself, is under investigation. A smaller medium drop
can prevent dilution of this factor(s) .
Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the effect of culture medium volume on in
vitro development of mouse 2-cell embryos.
Materials and Methods: The embryos were obtained from female NMRI mice. To evaluate the
effect of medium volume, groups of 16-20 late 2-cell embryos were cultured in 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and
100 JlI of drops of Ham's FlO medium for 72 h.
Results: Development to blastocyst stage in 50 and 100 JlI of drop were significantly higher than
this in any other volume (p<0.001). Almost a similar pattern was also observed for hatched
blastocyst formation. However, the total number of cells in blastocysts, developing in different
volumes, were not significantly different.
Conclusion: These results indicate that the optimal volumes of Ham's FlO medium for mouse early
embryo development are 50 to 100 ul. However, volumes as small as 2 JlI can successfully support
mouse 2-cell embryo development to blastocyst and hatching stages.

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of 8 weeks Pilates exercises on testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) of women with type 2diabetes.
Materials and Methods: This study was conducted in Shahid Sadoughi University Hospital. This clinical trial performed on 24 type 2 diabetes women. Twenty four patients divided in 2 groups randomly, included Pilates exercises group (n=12) and control group (n=12).The height, weight, fat percentage, body mass index (BMI), FBS, HbA1C, SHBG and total testosterone were measured before and after intervention. Kolmogorov-Smirnov and student test was use to analyze inter and intra group differences by SPSS 16 software. 
Results: Total patients that completed this study were twenty four. Mean±SD of age, weight, height and body mass index of patients was 47.92±0.76 years, 74.03±3.56 kg, 157.33±4.8cm, and 30.09±1.37 km2, respectively.
Body weight, BMI and Waist hip ratio (WHR) decreased significantly in intervention group (P-value:0.02). Testosterone decreased (P-value:0.01) and SHBG in Pilates exercises group (P-value:0.01) increased significantly in comparison with control group.
Conclusion: Body weight, BMI, WHR and the fat percentage in experimental group decreased significantly. The increase of SHBG and decrease of testosterone in experimental group are related to the decrease of BMI and WHR due to Pilates exercise.

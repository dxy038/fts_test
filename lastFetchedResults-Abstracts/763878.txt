The women’s image in literary works appears to have a brighter manifestation. Therefore ,the poem is one of the research grounds about women. The study of old poems can show the changing process of women’s image in historical progression .The works of Motanabbi and Sadi in the classic Arabic and Persian poetry, which contain similar mental dispositions and artistic techniques, provide good examples and data for this subject. The main objective of this research is a comparative study of Motanabbi and Sadi’s works through a library method. This study shows that both kinds of poems reflect the realities of life in their era. In describing theire society , both poets have consciously or unconsciously compared, honored, or despised the contemporary men and women ; they have portrayed the woman’s role as a mother, sister, and mistress in their society .The poems relate positive and negative attributes such as : affection and spite ,love and hate, loyalty and deceit, to women. The women’s elegance has become an example of the taste of their era. Their descriptions have created beautiful similes.    The two poets’ viewpoints about women are not very different.     Sadi ’s extensive description of women shows that, in his view ,they have an important role in life. But the low frequency of women in Motanabi ’s poems shows that he does not pay much attention to women.

Objective
The objective of this research was to determine whether sexual complaints, such as dyspareunia, are associated with pelvic floor disorders.
Study design
We used data collected for the Maryland Women's Health Study. Among adult women scheduled for hysterectomy, we used multiple logistic regression analysis to identify characteristics associated with 4 sexual complaints: decreased libido, vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and anorgasmia.
Results
Among 1299 participants, 495 (38.1%) had evidence of pelvic floor disorders. Sexual complaints were significantly more common among women with pelvic floor disorders (53.2% vs 40.4%, P< .01). In the multiple regression model, urinary incontinence was significantly associated with low libido (odds ratio [OR] 1.96), vaginal dryness (OR 2.11), and dyspareunia (OR 2.04), independent of age, educational attainment, and race. In contrast, pelvic organ prolapse was not associated with any sexual complaint.
Conclusion
In a cohort of women planning hysterectomy, women with urinary incontinence were significantly more likely to report sexual complaints.

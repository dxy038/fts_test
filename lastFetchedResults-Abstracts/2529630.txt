Objective: In recent decades, researchers have designed various tools for assessment and study of the interpersonal relationships from an attachment perspective. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the relationship scales questionnaire (RSQ), which is one of these tools.
Methods: A total of 368 female undergraduate students of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (academic year 201213) were selected by quota sling method from all colleges of the university and were tested by RSQ. Internal consistency method was used to check the reliability of the questionnaire and exploratory factor analysis to assess its construct validity
by SPSS 19.
Results: The exploratory factorial analysis of RSQ showed 2 different patterns. The Collins and Read 3factor model showed 40.16% of the total variance, and Simpson 2factor model determined 35.36% of the total variance. The Cronbach alpha  coefficients were 0.67 for 2factor model, and 0.57 for 3factor model.
Conclusion: Both analyzed models showed a relatively average validity for the Iranian version of this questionnaire. Moreover, the 3factor model had a higher acceptable validity.

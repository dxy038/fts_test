Secure Flow is a holistic, integrated methodology that addresses all security vectors (paths that a terrorist may take to enter a threat object into the transportation system), allowing people, baggage, and cargo to move via various transportation systems in a secure fashion, while maintaining an "ease of access" to these diverse systems through innovative technology, procedures, and training. Secure Flow is a totally integrated transportation security system. It is a strategic program with multiple integration projects each being a vector such as: checked baggage, checkpoint, cargo/mail, airport, aircraft, port terminal, and cruise ships. Secure Flow identifies requirements for the establishment of protocols, standards, communications, and development of technologies to link deployable security equipment into a totally integrated transportation security system. The objective of Secure Flow is to secure the flow of passengers, baggage, and cargo from origin to destination to meet the operationally viable needs of the future seamless US Transportation System for the traveling public.

An antenna for a Signal Identification System has been designed. The objective of this design is to detect the angle of the arrival signal by electronic sweeping and a monopulse system in the horizontal plane. The antenna frequency performance is fixed at 1.06 GHz with an 80 MHz bandwidth (7.54 %). A &#194;&#177;60&#194;&#176; sweeping of the aiming angle signal with a 3 dB loss level in the edges is desired, as well as a 22 dB maximum gain of the total antenna, but the minimum coverage is &#194;&#177;45&#194;&#176;. For all these reasons, a planar array antenna is designed with a number of 40 radiating elements and divided into 10 columns and 4 rows. Each column is connected to a phase shifter and all columns are fed through a hybrid stripline network.

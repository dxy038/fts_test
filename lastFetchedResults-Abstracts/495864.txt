Introduction: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women in worldwide. 53P the suppression gene tumor has a principal role in genomic stability and its function is variated by the codon 72 polymorphism. Objective: Investigate the codon 72 polymorphism of P53 and the effect of menopause on the development of invasive breast ductal carcinoma.

Materials and Methods: A case-control study was conducted on 96 patients with invasive breast ductal carcinoma and their 96 matched controls in Isfahan. The different genotypes of the codon 72 of P53 gene were identified by using allele-specific polymerase-chain reaction. Breast cancer patients were divided into two groups: postmenopausal and premenopausal. Statistical analysis was performed by using x2-test.

Results: In control group, the distribution of Arg/Arg, Arg/Pro and Pro/Pro genotypes were 36.5%, 45.8% and 17.7% respectively. The distributions of Arg/Arg, Arg/Pro and Pro/Pro in case group were 70.8%, 21.9% and 7.3% respectively. There is significant statistical difference in the distribution of P53 codon 72 polymorphism between case and control groups (P<0.001). In addition, 76% of patients with Arg/Arg genotype were in post-menopause age group (P=0.05).

Conclusion: The findings of this study indicated that the polymorphism of codon 72 P53 is a genetic predisposing factor for the development of invasive breast ductal carcinoma in the studied sample in Isfahan and most of the patients were in postmenopausal age group.

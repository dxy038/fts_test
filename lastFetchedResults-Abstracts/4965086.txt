This paper presents a novel technique for resource allocation in Multiuser Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. So far, classical approach for OFDM resource allocation has been using computationally intensive iterative algorithms, whereas evolutionary technique has been restricted to single objective optimizing function by combining conflicting objectives. We propose the use of multi objectives optimization of the conflicting parameters of the OFDM system by using non domination based genetic algorithm. The simulation results reveal improved performance with faster rate of convergence than previous algorithms.

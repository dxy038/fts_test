This paper proposes a dynamic semi-centralized resource partitioning algorithm to mitigate the problem of co-tier interference in dense femtocell deployments. This algorithm incorporates graph-colouring and network utility concepts to address inter-cell interference in femtocell networks. The aforementioned scheme acts as a multi-cell coordination mechanism on top of intra-cell scheduling by applying a low complexity graph-based algorithm. The objective of the coordination mechanism is the efficient management of resource conflicts due to interference in a multi-cell environment consisting of femtocells. This coordination mechanism defines a novel category of graph-based ICIC algorithms that uses bipartite graph colouring to avoid resource conflicts by randomizing them in time domain.

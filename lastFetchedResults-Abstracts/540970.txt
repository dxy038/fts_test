Background: Steroid hormones play an important role in the treatment of menopausal complications; therefore, nowadays there are new drugs having protective effects on endometer. The objective of this study was to compare the amount of uterine bleeding and spotting in patients who consume tibolone versus classic HRT.

Material and Methods: This clinical trial has done on 150 menopausal women divided in to three therapeutic groups. Each group took either of three regimens: tibolone, classical HRT and calcium supplement (control group) for six months. The number of the times and length of bleeding and spotting was recorded at the end of the first and second quarterly of treatment.

Results: Wilcoxon test did not reveal any meaningful differences between the tow groups of tibolone and calcium group. In terms of above mentioned variables in the two mentioned periods. However, in the HRT group, spotting duration had decreased (p=0.04) in the second three months regarding the first quarter. Kruskal-Wallis test indicated a significant difference in all the variables during the first three months of treatment and Mann-Whitney U test, used to determine discrepancy between the involved groups. It has been shown that the average number of the times (p=0.03) and spotting duration (p=0.008) in the HRT group in comparison with tibolone, also the number of the times (p=0.02) and the length of bleeding (p=0.003) in the HRT group was more than that of calcium group. It also revealed that the average of the length of spotting in the tibolone was more (p=0.001) but less in terms of the number of times of spotting in calcium group (p=0.001).

Discussion: The findings of the study indicated decease in the number of the times and the length of bleeding and spotting period in tibolone group in comparison with classical HRT. [ZJRMS, 12(2):29-35]

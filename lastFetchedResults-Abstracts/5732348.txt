The objective of this paper is to study grey relational analysis of the series similarity and approximation. Application the generating procedure produces new data series which physical properties similar the velocity and acceleration. With the original data there are total of three sets of data series. Respectively, the application of traditional DengÂ´s grey relational grade calculates grey relational grade by two loops computing that has real relational response. With several simulations are validated the model that have the result of feasibility and effectiveness.

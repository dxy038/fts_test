A topology optimization technique called ON/OFF method has been applied to optimization of magnetic structures, because it can obtain a new one that we could not image beforehand. In this paper, ON/OFF method is improved by cell sensitivity redistribution method and mutation theory of the genetic algorithms (GA) to overcome the grid discontinuous phenomenon and improve the objective function value extremely. The topology optimization of 2-D magnetic actuator is performed by using the improved ON/OFF method, and the results verifies the validity of the improved method. This indicates that the proposed improved ON/OFF method can be used in the design and optimization of electromagnetic devices such as motors, transformers and so on.

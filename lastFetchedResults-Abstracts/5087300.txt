This paper implements optimal PMU placement to make the network observable, and guarantees the observability of network under probabilistic events. With regards to the high cost of PMU units, another objective of the paper is minimizing of PMUsÂ´ installation cost. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the propose method, it is applied to IEEE 14-bus test system using a binary artificial bee colony algorithm (BABC) and compared with genetic algorithm (GA).

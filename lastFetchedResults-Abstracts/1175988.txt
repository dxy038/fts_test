Abstract
Background and objective: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are the most common cause in bacterial pneumonia. Also these agents can cause bacterial superinfection in patients with influenza. Aim of this study was Simultaneous specific detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in sputum samples from patients with suspected influenza by Multiplex-PCR.
Materials and methods: In this study, 170 sputum samples in patients with suspected influenza with age from 3 months to 70 years, received the Influenza Reference Laboratory â€“ Tehran Medical university were tested by Multiplex PCR. Amplified DNA fragments size was 394 bp for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 199 bp for Haemophilus influenzae and 416 bp for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. 
Results: of all 170 samples, 30 samples were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza. Of the 30 positive samples, 27 samples (15/8 %) and 3 samples (1/7 %) were positive for S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza respectively. 
Conclusion: This study showed that Multiplex-PCR able to diagnosis desired bacteria in short time and so this molecular method can use as complementary technique especially when the results of gram stain, culture or serological test are negative.

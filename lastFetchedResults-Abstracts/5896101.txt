In the recycling process of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) the disassembly process has a central role. Disassembly is not the reverse of the assembly process, real difficulties occur in the tasks assignment process of the disassembly operations. Since this is a multi objective optimization problem, we prove that genetic algorithms provide a useful multi-criteria decision tool in the industrial disassembly process.

Objective
The present study aimed at evaluating different restoring configurations of a crownless maxillary central incisor, in order to compare the biomechanical behavior of the restored tooth with that of a sound tooth.
Materials and methods

A 3D FE model of a maxillary central incisor is presented. An arbitrary static force of 10 N was applied with an angulation of 125° to the tooth longitudinal axis at level of the palatal surface of the crown. Different material configurations were tested: composite, syntered alumina, feldspathic ceramic endocrowns and glass post resorations with syntered alumina and feldspathic ceramic crown.
Results

High modulus materials used for the restoration strongly alter the natural biomechanical behavior of the tooth. Critical areas of high stress concentration are the restoration–cement–dentin interface both in the root canal and on the buccal and lingual aspects of the tooth–restoration interface.

Materials with mechanical properties underposable to that of dentin or enamel improve the biomechanical behavior of the restored tooth reducing the areas of high stress concentration.
Significance

The use of endocrown restorations present the advantage of reducing the interfaces of the restorative system. The choice of the restorative materials should be carefully evaluated. Materials with mechanical properties similar to those of sound teeth improve the reliability of the restoartive system.

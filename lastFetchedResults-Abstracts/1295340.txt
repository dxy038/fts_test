This paper focuses on the problem of determining locations for long-term care facilities with the objective of balancing the numbers of patients assigned to the facilities. We present a branch and bound algorithm by developing dominance properties, a lower bounding scheme and a heuristic algorithm for obtaining an upper bound for the problem. For evaluation of the suggested branch and bound algorithm, computational experiments are performed on a number of test problems. Results of the experiments show that the suggested algorithm gives optimal solutions of problems of practical sizes in a reasonable amount of computation time.

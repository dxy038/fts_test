The aim of the present study (part of an EU AIR programme on boar taint) was to make objective the perception of boar taint in entire male pork, and to relate the perception to skatole and androstenone levels. Trained analytical sensory panels in seven European countries assessed pig meat with known levels of androstenone and skatole. The panels performed a sensory profiling using the attributes pig, urine, manure/stable, naphthalene/mothballs, rancid, sweet, sweat and abnormal, both for odour and flavour in separate sessions. It turned out to be difficult to harmonise sensory methodology for seven sensory panels throughout the EU, especially with respect to the exact level of training the panellists received. Sensory panels in general were able to differentiate between the two compounds and between different levels of the compounds, though substantial differences between the panels in the different countries existed. Androstenone was found to relate mostly to the urine attribute, while skatole related mostly to manure and, to a lesser extent, to naphthalene

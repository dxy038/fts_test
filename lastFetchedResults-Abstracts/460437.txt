Background: The teaching of infection control is gradually being introduced at dental schools in Mexico. However, most practicing dentists have limited access to current infection control standards. Deficiencies of knowledge with regard to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis B virus may influence attitudes toward infected individuals and reduce compliance with infection control recommendations.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess (1) attitudes toward HIV-infected patients and hepatitis B virus-infected patients and (2) infection control knowledge and practices among dental practitioners in Mexico City.
Method: A total of 196 dentists were interviewed by means of a questionnaire with Likert-type scales and open-ended questions (response rate, 86.1%).
Results: Most respondents had no previous social or professional contact with HIV-positive individuals. Nine percent indicated that they had knowingly treated HIV-positive patients. Perceived professional and moral obligations to treat HIV-positive patients were high. Thirty-five percent of the respondents perceived the risk of HIV infection as “considerable” to “very strong.” The risk of hepatitis B infection was considered significantly higher than the risk of HIV infection (P<.01); however, 78% of the respondents had not been immunized against hepatitis B. Reported use of personal protective equipment was high. Most respondents used dry heat sterilization. The principal disinfectants used were quaternary ammonium compounds, bleach, and glutaraldehyde. Fifty-four percent of the respondents acknowledged that clinical precautions reduced occupational risks.
Conclusions: This survey revealed contradictory attitudes toward HIV-positive individuals and limited understanding of infection control recommendations. Educational and regulatory efforts are needed to promote better adherence to current infection control standards.

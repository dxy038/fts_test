This paper presents a hip joint motion simulation method using accurate hip joint center (HJC) and hip range of motion. We calculate the extreme hip joint range of motion centered on the HJC that is located by an automatic calculation algorithm on 3D reconstructed surface models. We make 3D bone surface models from computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The medical objective is to quantify hip kinematics in the function of hip morphology. Since only extreme ranges of motions are evaluated from bones, we can estimate the motions that are restricted by bones impingements by comparing the computed values with real extreme range of motion

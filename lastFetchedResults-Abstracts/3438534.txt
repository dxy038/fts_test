This paper describes the design, construction, and testing of a 150-kVA closed-loop vector-controlled matrix converter induction motor drive. The primary objective of this research effort is to evaluate the utility of the matrix converter in electric vehicle applications, primarily for motor control. A prototype converter has been built using 600-A 1400-V insulated gate bipolar transistors. Closed-loop vector control has been implemented and tested using a 150-hp induction motor load. This paper presents the design of this converter along with practical test results, representing the largest matrix converter built to date.

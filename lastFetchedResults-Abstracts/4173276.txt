A power-constrained contrast-enhancement algorithm for emissive displays based on histogram equalization (HE) is proposed in this paper. We first propose a log-based histogram modification scheme to reduce overstretching artifacts of the conventional HE technique. Then, we develop a power-consumption model for emissive displays and formulate an objective function that consists of the histogram-equalizing term and the power term. By minimizing the objective function based on the convex optimization theory, the proposed algorithm achieves contrast enhancement and power saving simultaneously. Moreover, we extend the proposed algorithm to enhance video sequences, as well as still images. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce power consumption significantly while improving image contrast and perceptual quality.

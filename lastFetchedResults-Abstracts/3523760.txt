The objective is to develop a general theoretical framework for a class of spread slotted ALOHA (SSA) systems. The contributions include: modeling of a generalized spread slotted ALOHA (SSA) system; derivation of computationally efficient closed form expressions for the SSA system throughput and delay taking into account receiver complexity; and presentation of numerical results to validate the derivation as well as to substantiate the superior performance of the proposed scheme. The results demonstrate that SSA schemes offer significant improvements in terms of throughput, delay, and network stability against excessive loading at very acceptable levels of receiver implementation complexities. Also, SSA is found to be highly robust to errors in the time of arrivals and eliminates the need for a guard time

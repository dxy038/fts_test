Background and Objective: One of the most common bacterial infections in the children is urinary tract infection (UTI) that its early diagnosis and proper treatment has high importance and analysis of typing and antibiotic resistance of isolated bacteria from urine of children with different sex and ages can help empirical therapy of UTI before preparing lab data.
Materials and Methods: The data of positive urine culture of children before 15 years old in laboratory of Pars hospital in Tehran in spring of 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. These data were sex, age, type of admission of patients, type of isolated bacteria and also antibiotic susceptibility pattern of isolates. P value of ?0/05 was considered statistically significant.
Results: Among 136 randomized clinical isolates, the most frequently isolated bacteria were E. coli (51.5%), Klebsiella (11.5%), Enterococci (8.8%) and coagulase negative Staphylococci (13.2%). There was differences in frequency of isolated bacteria in both sex and group of ages below 2 years old and 2-14 years old. The result of antibiotic susceptibility test showed resistance of most isolates of Klebsiella and E. coli to commonly used antibiotics and also there were differences in sensitivity of isolated bacteria in different sex and ages.
Conclusion: The results of this study like other studies showed that gram-negative bacteria, especially E. coli are most frequently bacteria in urine of children. Difference between two sexes and different ages is shown regarding prevalence of UTI, type of bacteria and antibiotic resistance that can help in empirical therapy.

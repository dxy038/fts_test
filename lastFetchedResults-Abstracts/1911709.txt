Objective
luate presentation and outcome of patients with metastatic RCC to the gallbladder from our institution and published literature.
s
ts with a history of gallbladder metastasis from RCC were selected from our institution's prospective database. A systematic PubMed search was performed to identify articles describing patients with metastatic RCC to the gallbladder. The final cohort included 33 patients: 4 from our institution and 29 from 28 previously published cases. Survival analysis was conducted using log-rank Kaplan-Meier analysis.
s
 patient age was 63 years and the majority of patients were male. Most patients were asymptomatic and diagnosed with gallbladder metastasis on imaging performed for surveillance or staging. The median time to gallbladder metastasis following nephrectomy was 4 years. Metastasis to the gallbladder occurred both synchronously (33%) and metachronously (67%). Of the patients with available histology, all had clear cell RCC (n = 28). Of all patients, 13 (39%) had metastasis only to the gallbladder, while 20 (61%) had additional sites of metastasis. The most common sites of additional metastasis were contralateral kidney (30%), pancreas (21%), lung (18%), adrenal (18%), and lymph nodes (9%). All patients underwent cholecystectomy. At a median follow up time of 1.5 years after cholecystectomy, 54% of patients had no evidence of disease, 14% were alive with metastasis, 23% had died from metastatic RCC, and 9% died from causes unrelated to their cancer.
sion
adder metastasis from RCC is a rare event that may occur synchronously or metachronously with most patients being asymptomatic. Clear cell carcinoma appears to be the primary pathology associated with gallbladder metastasis. High rates of bilateral RCC and pancreatic metastasis suggest novel associations in patients with RCC and gallbladder metastasis.

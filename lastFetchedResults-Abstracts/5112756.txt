Design of circuitry for implantable neural prostheses requires the use of novel VLSI techniques that deviate from those commonly used for commercial mixed-signal application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC). Often implant designers are faced with competing requirements for low-power and high data-bandwidths with a growing need for increased functionality in smaller implantable packages. Combining transcutaneous powering of neural prostheses with bidirectional telemetry challenges conventional communication circuits commonly found in modern wireless devices. Using the consumer electronics industry as a model, a method of modular design for neural prostheses is discussed.

In this paper an evaluation of different modulations techniques that combine switching frequency modulation and interleaving is presented. The objective of these modulations is to cancel certain harmonics of EMI and to reduce the amplitude of the remaining harmonics. A four channel parallel buck converter has been used in order to evaluate the modulations proposed. According experimental results, significant reduction of EMI is possible by combining both techniques instead of using them separately.

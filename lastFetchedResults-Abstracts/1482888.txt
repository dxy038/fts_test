Dry-cured ham, “Protected Designation of Origin (PDO)” Teruel, is a high quality meat product processed using a traditional dry-curing procedure. The objective of this paper was to study the microstructure of the Biceps femoris and Semimembranosus muscles during “PDO Teruel” dry-cured ham processing using electron microscopy techniques (Cryo-SEM, SEM and TEM).

mimembranosus and Biceps femoris muscles from raw ham show the typical structure of muscle tissue in meat. The muscle fibres appear firmly attached to one another by the endomysial connective tissue; the myofibrils inside the cells are strongly attached to each other and to the sarcolemma. In raw ham, the typical structural elements that constitute the sarcomere can be observed by TEM. Important microstructural changes are observed following salting; reflected in the fact that the Z-disks inside the myofibrils are no longer in line and there is important degradation of the cell membranes in this stage. At the end of the process, an accumulation of solutes, which could be products from proteolysis occurring mainly in the last stage of ripening, could be observed in both muscles. Thus the proteolysis and dehydratation phenomena that take place during “PDO Teruel” dry-cured ham processing occur at an ultrastructural level, and this is the basis to produce a product with the sensory features appreciated by consumers.

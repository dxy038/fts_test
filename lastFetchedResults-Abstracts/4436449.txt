The concept of Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) appears to be one of the different ways to reduce the electric production peaks and off-peaks by storing some energy in electric vehicles batteries. As a matter of fact, deciding when a battery have to be charged or discharged by/to the grid is a real problem which can be modelled using mathematical programming. In this work, we propose several mathematical programming models which goal is to decide when to charge and discharge each vehicle with the objective of smoothing the electric production curve to reduce its peaks and off-peaks. The first model uses as input an explicit vehicle reservation planning which express for each vehicle when it is parked or used. The second model uses as input the reservation planning (which only provides who has reserved a vehicle and when) and then try to smooth the production curve by deciding which vehicle would be associated to each reservation and when to charge/discharge it.

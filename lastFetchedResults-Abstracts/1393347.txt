A study on the energy dissipation characteristics of granular materials flowing/sloshing in a rotating container is presented here. The objective is to develop a configuration for control of excessive structural oscillations, similar to those of tuned vibration absorbers and tuned sloshing absorbers. The effectiveness of energy dissipation through granular flow is primarily determined experimentally. A computational model is developed to understand the flow behavior and energy dissipation in this system. A promising kinematic match of the particle behavior is demonstrated between the numerical predictions and the experimental observations. The use of the granular flow in a rotating drum for vibration control is being investigated for the first time.

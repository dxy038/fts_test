This paper presents a new approach via
improved version of genetic algorithm to solve optimal
unit commitment (UC) problem. Fast Messy Genetic
Algorithm (FMGA) is applied to the calculation of
optimal unit commitment problem. The test results
demonstrate that not only the FMGA procedure consider
is the constraints very well, but also has some advantages,
such as good convergence, fast calculating speed and high
precision. A ten unit power system was used as a
numerical example to test the new algorithm. The optimal
scheduling of on line generation units could be reached in
the testing results while satisfying the constraints of the
objective function. Numerical results indicate that the
performance of the FMGA algorithm outperforms the
other algorithms and achieves minimum generation cost.

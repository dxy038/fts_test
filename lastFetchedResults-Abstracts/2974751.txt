The sufficient conditions of exponential stability of singularly perturbed nonlinear stochastic systems are established. The excitations are assumed to be parametric white noises. In this case the objective is to analyse the full order system in their lower order subsystems i.e., the reduced order system and the boundary-layer system and in terms of their interconnecting structure and the perturbation parameter &#949;. The exponential bounds depend on the moments of norms of trajectories are given for the &#8220;slow&#8221; and &#8220;fast&#8221; components of the full-order system. It is also shown the estimation of the rate of convergence of the full-order system

In this study, we looked at whether social anxiety
is socialized, or influenced by peers’ social anxiety, more in
some peer crowds than others. Adolescents in crowds with
eye-catching appearances such as Goths and Punks (here
termed Radical), were compared with three comparison
groups. Using data from 796 adolescents (353 girls and 443
boys; Mage=13.36) at three timepoints, the results show that
adolescents affiliating with the Radical crowd tended to
select peers from the same crowd group. Being a member
of a crowd in itself did not predict socialization of social
anxiety, but adolescents in the Radical crowd were more
influenced by their peers’ social anxiety than adolescents
who did not affiliate with the Radical crowd group. The
results suggest that through a bidirectional process,
adolescents affiliating with Radical crowds may narrow
their peer relationship ties in time, and in turn socialize
each other’s social anxiety.

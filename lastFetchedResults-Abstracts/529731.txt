The Narmada Gelatin produces Lime sludge during its manufacturing operations located at Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. Narmada Gelatin is being disposed their wastes through environmentally sound technologies. ACC has being co-processed lime sludge waste through co-processing in their kiln at Kymore. Toward this objective, both ACC and Narmada Gelatin have worked together in the past few months to evaluate the feasibility of co-processing the waste in the kiln at ACC Kymore Works. Earliar it was difficult to dispose of lime sludge for the industry. The quantity of lime sludge is being generated 300 ton per month from the process of deliming it is the process where lime get used for ossein maturation for 40 to 65 days. The huge quantity generation of lime sludge was disposing in open areas or low laying areas. That was being created surface and under ground water pollution. ACC has analyzed the lime sludge sample and has being at Kymore works. The cement process perforce requires high temperature in the kiln around 1400-1450 oC with a high residence time of 4-5 see such high temperature conditions ensure that no noxious emission take place during the co-processing of the waste materials.

The objective of this study was to determine the chemical composition and ruminal degradation kinetics of dry matter and crude protein of poultry by-product meal (PBPM) of Ardabil province using nylon bag technique, in vitro DaisyII and the precision-fed cecectomized rooster. Chemical composition including dry matter, crude protein, ether extract and ash were 95.27, 56.5, 28.67 and 7.33 %, respectively. Degradation experiment was performed by two eunuch Moghani fistulated ram and incubation at times 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 48 hours. Water soluble fraction (a), slowly degradable fraction (b), constant rate of degradation (c) and potential degradability of crude protein of poultry by-product meal calculated 27, 37, 0.032 and 64 percent and also for dry matter 37, 41.6, 0.024 and 78.6 percent, respectively. Effective degradability of crude protein and dry matter with 2 percent per hour outflow rate, were 50 and 59.8 percent, respectively. These results indicated that poultry by-product meal can be used as source of undegradable intake protein while it contributes to an adequate supply of degradable intake protein that can be used for microbial crude protein synthesis. Intestinal digestibility of crude protein PBPM by use the precision-fed cecectomized rooster assay was taken more than in vitro DaisyII.

This paper introduces a new and efficient mixed-integer linear program (MILP) formulation for dynamic lightpath allocation in survivable WDM networks, using both shared and dedicated path protection. The objective is to minimize the amount of additional optical resources (wavelength-links) needed for the new connection. The formulation can handle multiple levels of service and traditional shared and dedicated path protection schemes can be treated simply as a special case of the formulation. Experiments carried out on a number of different networks demonstrate that this approach can improve performance and is feasible for practical sized networks

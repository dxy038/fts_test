The link between Mixed Finite Element (MFE) and Finite Volume (FV) methods applied to elliptic
partial di erential equations has been investigated by many authors. Recently, a FV formulation of the
mixed approach has been developed. This approach was restricted to 2D problems with a scalar for the
parameter used to calculate  uxes from the state variable gradient. This new approach is extended to
2D problems with a full parameter tensor and to 3D problems. The objective of this new formulation is
to reduce the total number of unknowns while keeping the same accuracy. This is achieved by de ning
one new variable per element.
For the 2D case with full parameter tensor, this new formulation exists for any kind of triangulation.
It allows the reduction of the number of unknowns to the number of elements instead of the number
of edges. No additional assumptions are required concerning the averaging of the parameter in heterogeneous
domains. For 3D problems, we demonstrate that the new formulation cannot exist for a general
3D tetrahedral discretization, unlike in the 2D problem. However, it does exist when the tetrahedrons are
regular, or deduced from rectangular parallelepipeds, and allows reduction of the number of unknowns.
Numerical experiments and comparisons between both formulations in 2D show the e ciency of the
new formulation.

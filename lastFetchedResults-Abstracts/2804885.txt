The matrix converter (MC) is an attractive topology for the more electric aircraft because of its high-power density and bidirectional power flow features. One of the challenging issues in MC is the current commutation. The commutation process in a matrix converter (MC) is more complex as compared with that of the traditional AC-DC-AC converter due to the lack of natural free-wheeling paths. Multi-step commutation methods along with various voltage clamp circuits, connected at input and output, have been proposed for the MC. These methods are complex and require accurate real-time information about direction of current and input AC system voltages. Reducing the commutation time and process is a main objective of using MC in aerospace applications where the range of frequency is between 360-800 Hz. This paper presents a robust commutation circuit for reliable single-step commutation of the MC, and demonstrates its feasibility through computer simulations and experimental results obtained from a laboratory scale prototype.

Dual active bridge phase shift converters have attracted a lot of research interest due to their excellent capabilities such as simplicity in structure and control and bidirectional power flow ability. They are employed in a wide range of renewable energy systems due to their distinguished features. Although there are lots of research on theoretical analysis and practical operation of these converters, research on limitations and boundaries of operation still requires more attention. This paper provides a brief review on power transfer range, soft switching operation and converter currents in different operation modes of dual active bridge converter. It provides more detailed information on appropriate range of converter parameters such as voltage transfer ratio, duty ratio and phase shift angle and their effect on power transfer range via numerical simulations.

This work presents a novel design for a simultaneous bidirectional multilevel wireline transmission system with adaptive pre-emphasis and trellis coded modulation. The incorporation of a trellis encoder and a Viterbi decoder provides coding gain to offset the loss of SNR caused by the multilevel pulse amplitude modulation. Furthermore, the feedback loop inherent in a simultaneous bidirectional link provides a natural opportunity to use adaptive pre-emphasis to compensate for channel characteristics. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.

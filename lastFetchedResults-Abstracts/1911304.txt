Objectives
tudy addresses the relationship between cell cycle control protein p53, apoptosis inhibitor gene survivin, and chemotherapy resistance protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression, and their prognostic impact in renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
s
p consisting of 104 patients with RCC was included from a predefined period of time. The median follow-up was 46 months. Tumor stage was defined according to the 2002 Tumor-Node-Metastasis staging system, and Fuhrman nuclear grading was used. Expression of p53, survivin, and P-gp was assessed on immunohistochemically stained slides of the representative blocks of the tumors.
s
ificant relationship was found between survival and histologic subtype (P = 0.001), tumor stage (P = 0.011), and tumor grade (P &lt; 0.001). Although there was inverse correlation between p53 expression and stage (P = 0.014) and grade (P = 0.04), no correlation was observed with the histopathologic type or survival. There was no correlation between survivin expression and histologic subtype, stage, or survival, but there was a significant inverse correlation between survivin expression and tumor grade (P = 0.018). No significant correlation was found between any parameters tested, and P-gp expression.
sions
in, P-gp, and p53 expression do not play a role in prognosis of RCC. Our results suggest that survivin expression may be positively regulated by mutant p53 in RCC, and this expression may have an impact on resistance to chemotherapy in RCC.

In this brief, we study robust pulse design for electron shuttling in solid-state devices. This is crucial for many practical applications of coherent quantum mechanical systems. Our objective is to design control pulses that can transport an electron along a chain of donors and that also make this process robust to parameter uncertainties. We formulate this problem here as a set of optimal control problems and derive explicit expressions for the gradients of the aggregate transfer fidelity. Numerical results for a donor chain of ionized phosphorus atoms in bulk silicon demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm.

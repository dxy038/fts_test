OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine the performance and clinical feasibility of telesonography for the interpretation of fetal anatomic scans sent from a remote location compared with those obtained at a tertiary care prenatal ultrasonography center.
STUDY DESIGN: Routine ultrasonographic studies from 35 patients were remotely interpreted. Evaluation included a blinded comparison of the sonographer's assessment of 38 fetal structures with that of the physician at the tertiary care center. Technical evaluation included system reliability and the number of digital telephone lines required for adequate real-time visualization.
RESULTS: The mean gestational age at the time of the ultrasonography was 25.84 Â± 6.8 weeks (range 14 to 38). There was complete consistency of interpretation for 25 of 38 (66%) fetal structures. Thirteen structures had discrepancies in visualization, reflecting a difference in the adequacy of visualization, not the normalcy or identity of the structures. Three digital (integrated switching digital network, ISDN) telephone lines were required for real-time visualization.
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary experience supports telesonography as a clinically useful tool for remote interpretation of fetal ultrasonographic examinations. Further studies are warranted for the continued evaluation of this emerging technology. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;177:846-8.)

The problem of implementing a real-time channel simulator that can be used to test mobile communications equipment in the laboratory is considered. The objective of the design is to replicate the statistical characteristics of the multipath fading environment on a single-chip, fixed-point 16-b digital signal processor (DSP). The simulator design permits the user to select the simulation parameters, including vehicular speed, carrier frequency, ratio between the line-of-sight component and the multipath component, and the variance of average power. The design is based on variable-sampling-rate DSP techniques, and offers a novel solution to suppress the aliasing terms at intermediate stages where access to analog filters is cumbersome and costly

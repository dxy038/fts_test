The geometrical factors defining an adhesive joint are of great importance as its design greatly conditions the performance of the bonding. One of the most relevant geometrical factors is the thickness of the adhesive as it decisively influences the mechanical properties of the bonding and has a clear economic impact on the manufacturing processes or long runs.

aditional mechanical joints (riveting, welding, etc.) are characterised by a predictable performance, and are very reliable in service conditions. Thus, structural adhesive joints will only be selected in industrial applications demanding mechanical requirements and adverse environmental conditions if the suitable reliability (the same or higher than the mechanical joints) is guaranteed.

is purpose, the objective of this paper is to analyse the influence of the adhesive thickness on the mechanical behaviour of the joint and, by means of a statistical analysis based on Weibull distribution, propose the optimum thickness for the adhesive combining the best mechanical performance and high reliability. This procedure, which is applicable without a great deal of difficulty to other joints and adhesives, provides a general use for a more reliable use of adhesive bondings and, therefore, for a better and wider use in the industrial manufacturing processes.

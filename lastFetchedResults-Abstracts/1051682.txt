Objective: The present paper aims at investigating psychometric properties of Social Emotional Learning Scale (SELS) among a sample of 4th and 5th grade Iranian male students. Statistical Population: The statistical population consisted of all 4th and 5th grade male students of elementary schools who studied in schools of Isfahan during the school year 2010-2011. To do so, 380 students of Isfahan elementary schools were selected using multistage random cluster sampling method and were asked to fill out social emotional learning questionnaire. The SELS is a self-report questionnaire made up of 20 items, which assesses three criteria: self-regulation (SR), peer relationships (PR), and task articulation (TA). The data were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis. Results: Cronbachâ€™s alpha coefficient for the total scale and its subscales were 0.85 (total), 0.71 (SR), 0.83 (PR) and 0.79 (TA). The confirmatory factor analysis also confirmed the accuracy of the three factors (task articulation (TA), peer relationships (PR), and self-regulation (SR)). The results suggested that SELS is a three-factor, reliable tool for assessing and evaluating dimensions of social emotional learning among elementary students.

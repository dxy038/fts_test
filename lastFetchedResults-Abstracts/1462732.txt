A cold soak filtration test (CSFT; ASTM D 7501-09b) was included in B100 specifications under ASTM D 6751-09, bringing new challenges to biodiesel producers and researchers investigating B100 quality. For a plant breeding program evaluating canola biodiesel quality traits, rapid assessment of biodiesel quality is important. Typically, a limited amount of seed from new canola lines is available; therefore, obtaining the required volume of biodiesel for evaluating cold soak filterability (300 mL) is not possible. In order to rapidly screen canola breeding lines for B100 quality, cold soak filterability must be assessed with reduced volumes of biodiesel. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of saturated monoglycerides, glycerin, and soap on cold soak filterability. Biodiesel filtration time rapidly escalated when the SMG concentration was above 0.28%. The influence of saturated monoglycerides (0.04â€“0.46% w/w) on biodiesel precipitate formation was also evaluated. A regression model was generated to predict the filterability of biodiesel against the concentrations of trace contaminants. The results will be instrumental to scaling down biodiesel CSFT for a canola breeding program.

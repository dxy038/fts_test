Abstract: Background: Plantar ulcers produced by diabetic foot disease are devastating and costly. Better understanding of the ulcer-producing process is important to improve detection of feet that are at risk and to improve intervention. In clinical practice diabetic foot were normally screened for quantitative assessment through tuning fork and biothesiometer which uses vibration sense to asses the neuropathy. There are limited studies on the early assessment of plantar pressure distribution point in the diabetic population. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to find out the changes in plantar pressure in diabetic as compared to healthy individuals.
Method: Thirty Normal individuals with the mean age (28± 10) and twenty five diabetic individuals with mean age (43±4) were selected for the study. The plantar pressure distribution of both populations was recorded using I-Step foot scanner in erect standing position for 30 second on the foot scanning plate. The result analyzed using the t test. The result analysis of the present study showed there is an early change in plantar pressure distribution in type-II diabetic patients as compared to normal individuals.
Conclusion: The finding of the present study indicates that there is an early change in plantar pressure distribution in diabetic population as compared to healthy individuals.

Distributed feeder reconfiguration (DFR) is an operation processand a very important methodfor saving electrical energy and loss reduction in distribution systems. This process is carried out by changingdistribution system topology by opening and/or closing of circuit breakers. Status of the circuit breakers is optimally determined to have an improved system operation and reduced power losses. This paper proposes a multi-objective evolutionary method for distribution feeder reconfiguration. The multi-objectives optimization minimizes power losses and improves reliability of the system. For this purpose a particle swarm optimization algorithm is used for solving the problem. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed method for DFR.

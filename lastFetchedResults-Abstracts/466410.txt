Objective: Our aim was to evaluate human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing after conization in predicting residual disease in the subsequent hysterectomy specimen. Study Design: A prospective study was conducted on 75 patients with grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia who had cone margins or endocervical curettage specimens showing disease and who elected to undergo hysterectomy after conization. All patients underwent high-risk human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing by the Hybrid Capture II (Digene Corporation, Gaithersburg, MD) system before conization and at the time of hysterectomy (within 2-7 weeks after conization). The presence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in cells obtained by endocervical brush before hysterectomy was correlated with residual disease in the hysterectomy specimens. Results: Of the 92 patients enrolled, 75 were eligible. Of these 75 patients, 52 (69.3%) had persistent human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid after conization, and 27 (36.0%) of the 75 patients had residual cervical neoplasia in the hysterectomy specimens. Those with negative results for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid after conization were all (23/23) without residual disease in the uterus (100% negative predictive value). All those who had residual disease (27/27) had positive results for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid at the time of hysterectomy (100% sensitivity). Postconization human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid status (odds ratio, 4.000; 95% confidence interval, 1.531-10.449; P = .005) and grade of dysplasia after endocervical curettage (classified as grade 2 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or less severe disease vs grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: odds ratio, 6.612; 95% confidence interval, 2.837-15.409; P = .0002) were significantly associated with residual tumor in the uterus. Conclusions: This prospective study confirms an excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid testing after conization in predicting residual cervical neoplasia. A strategy of managing patients with grade 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, based on postconization human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid findings and endocervical curettage results, is proposed.

The Space Geodesy Center (CGS) of the Italian Space Agency (ASI), located near Matera (Italy), hosts permanent Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) and Global Positioning System (GPS) systems and manages the other receivers of the Italian GPS Fiducial Network. The presence of these collocated space geodetic systems in the area and the data analysis activities usually carried out at the CGS for each of the three techniques makes the construction of fully integrated solutions a natural objective. This paper describes the preliminary work carried out to assess the consistency of the various geodetic solutions and to explore their compatibility in order to combine the information content from the different techniques. The consistency of the CGS geodetic global solutions providing site positions and velocities is assessed, with particular attention to the Mediterranean and European areas. In addition a direct comparison between baselines and baseline rates for the collocated european GPS and VLBI sites is made.

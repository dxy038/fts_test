In this paper, an optimal control strategy to determine maximum coefficient of performance (COP) is proposed for a multi-evaporator vapor compression system with different cold storage rooms. The structure of the optimal control system is based on a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) and affine nonlinear model, which varies the speed of the compressor to accommodate different cooling loads and changes the opening of electronic expansion valve (EEV) to distribute refrigerant flow among different evaporators. The objective of this is to present a feasible method that can be used for energy optimizing control, and a simulation of system model is used as basis for testing the control method.

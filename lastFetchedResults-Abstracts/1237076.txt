This paper presents the application of immune algorithm to find optimal location and sizing for distributed generation (DG) sources and static series voltage regulator (SSVR) in distribution networks. The proposed objective function for this allocation includes investment costs and profits accrued from reduced losses and also included is a set of quality indexes that show the status of voltage, current and active and reactive power losses. Simulations are performed on IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus test systems for comparing results. Optimal placement of DG and SSVR employed here substantially reduced power loss and improved the voltage profile. Also, over a period of approximately 7 years, profits accrued from loss reduction alone are found to be greater than the investment, maintenance and consequent interest costs.

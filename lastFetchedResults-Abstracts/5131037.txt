In order to solve the problem that the parameters of cloud model are difficult to get and the weight of performance index is difficult to obtain when adopt single objective optimization algorithm. A new design of cloud model controller based on multi-objective optimization is proposed. In the first stage, set the system overshoot, settling time, and ITAE index as the optimization objectives, then a fast non-dominating sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is employed to optimize its output parameters k<sub>up</sub>, k<sub>ui</sub>, k<sub>ud</sub> and characteristic parameters E<sub>x</sub>, E<sub>n</sub>, H<sub>e</sub>. In the subsequent stage, the decision-maker can choose the satisfactory solution from the Pareto optimal solution set according to actual needs. The validity and superiority of the proposed method are supported by simulation results.

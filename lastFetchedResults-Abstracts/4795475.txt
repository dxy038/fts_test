In this article, a hybrid methodology for selecting and location of Distributed Generators (DG) in distribution systems is presented. The mathematical model proposed has a linear combination as objective function, which relates the active power losses reduction, improve the voltage regulation and investment costs reduction. Three DG technologies are considered with the possibility to be penetrated in the distribution system; these technologies are: Wind Generation (WG), Photo Voltaic Powerstations (PV) and Smaller-Scale Hydroelectric Powerstations (SSH), which have been selected according to the topographical and meteorological characteristics of the area where the distribution system is located. A hybrid algorithm between Chu-Beasly Genetic Algorithm (CBGA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used. CBGA is used to determine the candidate nodes to install DG and the optimal level of power injection is determined by using PSO. To reduce the solution space, three heuristic strategies are used, based on knowledge of the operating system. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology, adaptations of IEEE 33-nodes system and Baran and Wu 69-nodes system are used.

This paper describes a new multi-objective evolutionary programming (MOEP) method to solve the combined economic emission dispatch (CEED) problem. CEED is a multi-objective optimization problem by considering the fuel cost and emission as the objectives. It is converted into single objective optimization problem using weighted sum method. Hence the MOEP is proposed by employing the non-dominated solution ranking as selection mechanism for the bi-objective CEED problem. The developed algorithm is tested for a three-unit and a six-unit system. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach to generate well-distributed Pareto optimal solutions of the multi-objective CEED problem in a single run.

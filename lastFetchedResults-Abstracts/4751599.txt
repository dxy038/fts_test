Color filter arrays (CFAs) used in modern single-sensor vision systems are analyzed and evaluated in terms of the demosaicking performance. Of particular interest are commonly used red-green-blue CFAs with various arrangements of color filters in the pattern leading to the different performance and computational efficiency of the demosaicking process. A universal demosaicking framework is used to demonstrate the impact of the CFA on both the objective and subjective quality of the demosaicked full-color image

Our objective in this work was to assess the precision and degree of accuracy with which intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) can deliver highly localized dose distributions to tumors near critical structures using the dynamic sliding window technique. Measurements of dose distribution were performed both in vivo and in vitro using a combination of dosimeters [thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD's), films, and diodes]. In vivo measurements were performed in two groups of purpose-bred dogs: one receiving four-field three-dimensional (3D) conformal treatment and the other receiving IMRT. The algorithms used in the inverse planning process included the Macro Pencil Beam (MPB) model and Projections onto Convex Sets (POCS). Single beam measurements were performed in phantoms to verify the accuracy of monitor unit settings required for delivering the desired doses. The composite doses from the delivery of the seven beam intensity modulated plans were measured in phantoms and cadavers. Biological end points (spinal cord toxicity and neurolgic deficits due to irradiation) were evaluated at the end of one year to determine the spatial accuracy of the IMRT treatments over a fractionated course in live subjects. Results in single beam measurements were used at first to improve the dose calculation and translation algorithms. Results of the measurements for the delivery of all seven beams in phantoms confirmed that the system was capable of accurate spatial and dosimetric IMRT delivery.

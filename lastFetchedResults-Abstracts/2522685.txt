Introduction: The genus Arcobacter is classified together with the genus Campylobacter into
the family Campylobacteriaceae. Arcobacters are gram negative, non-spore forming,
microaerophilic microorganisms that are discriminated from Campylobacter genus by growth
in the presence of the oxygen and low temperatures. They are curved rods, S-shaped or helical
cells. A. butzleri is considered the most common species of the genus being considered as a
zoonotic and emerging foodborne pathogen. The main objective of this study is to determine
the detection and the frequency of A. butzelri from the poultry products retailers in
Tonekabon and evaluate the using culture and PCR techniques.
Materials and Methods: Standard culture technique was used for isolation and for the
purpose of determination and identification, standard phenotyping tests were applied. The
results of phenotyping were carried out by the application of PCR and specific reproduction
of Arcobacter.
Results: Totally, 95 samples of the poultry meat were collected and tested to study the
presence of the species of Acobacter butzelri. On the basis of the culture tests, 12 samples out
of the studied 95 samples (12.63%) were infected with Arcobacter butzelri. PCR technique
also confirmed the results of phenotyping.
Conclusion: Although this bacterium has been almost isolated from all enviromental
reservoirs, poultry can be considered as the main reservoirs of the Arcobacters. For this
reason, the presence of this pathogenic bacterium in the poultry meat increase the possibility
of its transfer to human through consumption of the products.

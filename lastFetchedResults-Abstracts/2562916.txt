Background and Objective: Endothelial function has an effect on blood pressure and meanwhile, the ratio of L-Arginine/Asymmetric Dimethylarginine (L-Arg/ ADMA) is important. In addition, the effect of exercise training on blood pressure has been established. The present study intends to examine LArg / ADMA ratio in patients with hypertensive middle-aged men and the effect of aerobic training on it. 
Subjects and Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, 12 normo-tensive and 24 hypertensive middle-aged men (age: 49.66 ? 2.8 y, height: 174.16 ? 4.66 cm, weight: 81.08 ? 12.65 Kg) were selected. The hypertensive subjects were further sub-divided into two groups. 12 for control (age: 52.08 ? 2.53 y, height: 173.75 ? 5.81 cm, weight: 80.08 ? 8.26 Kg) and 12 for aerobic training (age: 50.54 ? 3.01 y, height: 177.01 ? 5.98 cm, weight: 86.09 ? 13.15 Kg). The training included 12 wks treadmill aerobic running with 60 % heart rate reserve, three times-a-week for 12 min each session. each week up to the 6th week 3 min and then every two weeks 3 min were added to the training time. So that training in the last two weeks was 36 min. Blood pressure and samples for the measurement of L-Arg/ADMA ratio were taken before and after the training period. Blood variables were measured by ELISA method. Normality of distribution of data was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test and between subjects differences was assessed with independent t-test and analysis of variance with repeated measures.
Results: Results showed that the L-Arg/ADMA ratio is more in patients than in healthy subjects (t=5.099, P=0.0001) and sub maximal aerobic training significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (F=8.698, P=0.008) and increased L-Arg /ADMA (F=10.741, P=0.004). 
Conclusion: It seems that endothelial function in patients with hypertension is impaired and these patients can do aerobic training to relieve pressure and improve endothelial function.

It has been argued that political science in Iran is far from practice, has not yet been localized and not found its appropriate status. Apparently, lack of serious attention to criticism is the reason for weakness of political science research in Iran. The objective of this research is to study the status of criticism in political science research in Iran and in this regard, specialized political science journals have been examined in a field study. For this purpose, various types of criticism have been categorized and the number and content of works subject to criticism, compared to the total works, has been evaluated via a quantitative study. For a better recognition of the status of criticism in political science research, findings related to critical subjects in specialized political science journals have been compared to similar findings in some selected journals in the field of literature (which is counted as a local field with a long-lived tradition of criticism flowing in it). Figures show that %8.2 of titles and %4.5 of contents of articles published in specialized political science journals are critical and this is slightly more favorable than the similar figures in Persian literature journals, yet reveals the weakness of criticism tradition in political science research in Iran. Moreover, studying various types of criticism in political science research, shows that %91 of numbers and %89 of contents of critical articles are "book reviews". Similar figures in the field of literature clears that journals in this field pay more attention to other types of criticism than political science journals.

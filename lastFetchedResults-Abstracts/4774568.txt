The concern about electromagnetic field (EMF) effects on human health has heightened public awareness of overhead transmission lines planning and operation. The objective of this paper is to study the effect of EMF constraints on optimal power generation scheduling. This study considers reducing EMF levels associated with critical transmission lines by redistributing the scheduled power generation, while maintaining the minimum operation cost as an objective. The EMF constraints are given in terms of control variables and fuzzy sets are utilized to model the tradeoff between minimizing the objective function and satisfying EMF constraints. Numerical results for the application of the proposed approach to test systems are discussed

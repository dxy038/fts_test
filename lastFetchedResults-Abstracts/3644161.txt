A new water-vapor radiometer is being developed to determine atmospheric path-delay corrections for geodynamics applications. The radiometer has microwave channels at 20.7, 22.2, and 31.4 GHz, and includes new features which should promote radiometric precision while at the same time reduce instrument complexity. The instrument will be compact, portable, and will possess a self-diagnostic capability to ensure reliability. The performance objective is the determination of the line-of-sight path delay though the atmosphere due to water vapor with a one-sigma error less than 0.5 cm at the zenith.

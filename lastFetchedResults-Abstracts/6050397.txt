The authors describe a method for deriving objective measurements of video quality that agree with the human perception of video quality. The development process presented is based on three components. First, a wide-ranging library of video screens is digitized and processed. The second component involves the collection of viewer quality ratings for this same video library. This results in a set of subjective data. The final component of the process is a simultaneous statistical analysis of the subjective and objective data sets. The authors focus on the second component of the process. The facility used to gather viewer quality ratings, the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) video viewing laboratory, is described. The test methodology is presented, along with a discussion of the selection of video scenes for the tests. Plans for the integration of subjective and objective data sets are considered

Background The ‘‘Second Lebanon
War’’ exposed northern Israel to massive missile attacks,
aimed at civilian centers, Jewish and Arab, for a
period of several weeks. Objective To assess prevalence
of acute stress disorder (ASD) and acute stress
symptoms (ASS) in Jewish and Arab samples, and
their correlates with demographic and exposure
variables. Method Telephone survey conducted in the
third week of the second Lebanon war with a random
sample of 133 Jewish and 66 Arab adult residents of
northern Israel. ASD, ASS and symptoms-related
impairment were measured by the Acute Stress Disorder
Interview (ASDI) questionnaire, in addition to
war-related exposure and demographic data. Results
The majority of respondents experienced at least one
of four symptom groups of ASD, 5.5% of the Jewish
respondents and 20.3% of the Arabs met the criteria
of ASD. Higher rates of Arab respondents reported
symptoms of dissociation, reexperiencing and arousal,
but a similar rate of avoidance was reported by
the two samples. Higher mean scores of ASS and of
symptoms-related impairment were reported by the
Arab respondents. According to multiple regression
analyses, younger age, female gender, Arab ethnicity
and experiencing the war more intensely as a stressor
significantly explained ASS variance, while Arab ethnicity
and proximity to missiles exploding significantly
explained the variance of symptoms-related
impairment. Conclusions A substantial rate of participants
experienced symptoms of acute stress, while
for only small proportion were the symptoms consistent
with ASD. Higher ASD and ASS were reported
by the Arab sample, calling attention to the need to
build interventions to reduce the present symptoms
and to help prepare for possible similar situations in
the future.

This paper studies the impact of harvesting, property, and profit taxes on private rotation age in an ongoing rotations model, where the private landowner is interested not only in the present value of harvest revenue, but also in the private amenity services provided by the forest stand. The main finding of the paper is that conventional wisdom about the rotation effects of forest taxes, distilled from the Faustmann model, predominantly ceases to hold. This is because forest taxes distort the relative profitability of timber and amenity production in a way that is sensitive to the precise nature of amenity valuation. Therefore, the design of forest tax policy necessitates good knowledge of the landowner's objective function concerning the type of amenity services.

Evaluation of agility has not kept pace with the actual development of evaluation practice in e-government. However, this is not the result of omission; rather it reflects the degree of difficulty inherent in developing appropriate evaluative criteria and metrics. The difficulty is mostly due to the multidimensionality of the concept of agility, the multiple perspectives involved in evaluation, and sometimes the lack of knowledge about how to measure agility. The objective of this paper is to propose an approach for the evaluation of e-government information systems agility. This approach is based on the interpretive evaluation paradigm and deals with a practical method to evaluate e-government information systems agility. The proposed method is based on methods engineering domain; and thus it is built in the form of method components guiding the process of evaluation.

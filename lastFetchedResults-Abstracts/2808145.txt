A PWM plus secondary-side phase-shift-controlled (PWM+SSPS) full-bridge three-port converter (FB-TPC) is proposed for aerospace power system to interface the solar source, battery and load together and provide stable and continuous power to the load. The FB-TPC, featuring one input ports, one bidirectional port and one isolated output port, integrates two Buck-boost converters into the primary side of the full-bridge topology, and replaces two of the diodes in the secondary full bridge rectifier by two active switches. By reducing the bridge switches, the FB-TPC improves the simplicity and power density of the topology. Single stage conversion between every two ports and ZVS of all primary and secondary switches are achieved to improve the overall efficiency. Centralized control is adopted to provide better dynamic performance and higher reliability with the elimination of the complex communication devices. Operation principles and control scheme are given in detail and verified with a 600W prototype.

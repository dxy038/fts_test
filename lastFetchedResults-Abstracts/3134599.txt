This paper describes a TDMA channel scheduling algorithm in WIA-PA network under the Blacklist technology (Blacklist-TCS). The main objective of this channel scheduling algorithm is to reduce the computation time while maximizing the utilization of the network resources, thereby improving the network throughput, reducing the transmission delay, and decreasing the number of retry. In this paper, we consider the channel scheduling algorithm under the requirements of real-time, reliability, low energy consumption and the character of time-varying channel simultaneously, and present our algorithm as a variant of the coloring algorithm. A performance study is carried out by physical experiment. The results show that our algorithm performs better than non-blacklist algorithm in aspects of transmission success ratio, end-to-end delay, and retry exhausted count.

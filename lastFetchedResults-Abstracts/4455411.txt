In designing the heat pump systems, the reduction of energy consumption for specific heating load is of a great interest. This can not be reached unless the both thermodynamic and economical analysis are being performed for the system. In this paper the equations for the thermoeconomic analysis of a heat pump system are introduced. This system contains evaporator, condenser, compressor and expansion valve. The mechanical, electrical and isentropic efficiencies of compressor, also the cycle superheating and sub cooling degrees are considered. For such a system an objective function which is some of the capital and operational costs is introduced. By applying the numerical search method as an optimization technique, the system design parameters are obtained. The objective function for this optimum design parameters is minimized. The system exergy analyses at the optimum design point show that the system exergy destruction was also reduced. For optimization of the objective function, the GAMS software was used. In and references exergy analyses, and in and references economical analyses on thermodynamics systems have. In this paper both thermodynamics and economical analyses have been worked and there is a comparison with and references that reduction of exergy losses in noticeable here.

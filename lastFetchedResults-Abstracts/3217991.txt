The authors realized a prospective study on a series of 96 patients working in different fields requiring intense vocal effort, analyzing the influence of different environmental factors and of the gastroesophageal reflux in generating pharyngolaryngeal inflammatory pathology followed by a professional dysphonia. They insisted upon the use of the standard including questionnaire and the methods of investigation for the vocal parameters during the gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Alcohol intake, smoking, stress, gastro esophageal reflux and different allergens influenced the symptoms and the objective alterations of the vocal performance (Reflux Finding Score - RFI, Reflux Symptoms Index - RSI). The symptoms, statistically significant, on the studied series were hoarseness (p=0.0l), postnasal drip (p=0.03), globus hystericus (p=0.0l). ENT examination revealed: erythema, congestion (p=0.0l), vocal folds edema (p=0.0l), profuse laryngeal edema (p=0.02), posterior commissure hypertrophy (p=0.02). Environmental factors and gastro esophageal reflux disease had a negative impact on the vocal performances of the vocal professionals.

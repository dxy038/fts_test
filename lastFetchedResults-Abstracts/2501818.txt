Background and Objective: Schizophrenia is a chronic debilitating psychiatric disorder, that one of its causative factors is hypoactive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Quercetin is a flavonoid that has shown several pharmacological activities such as antioxidant properties and is found in vegetables and fruits. This study was performed with the aim of evaluation of the neuroprotective effect of quercetin and its nanocrystal on behavioral impairment induced by ketamine injection in an animal model of schizophrenia.

Materials and Methods: In this study, 49 male mice were divided into 7 groups: control, vehicle, lesioned group that received 10 mg/kg/day of ketamine, i.p. for 10 days and other 4 groups that received 10 and 25 mg/kg/day of quercetin and quercetin nanocrystal orally after injection of ketamine. The quercetin nanocrystal was prepared by the evaporative precipitation of nanosuspension (EPN) method. Open field behavioral test was used at 5th and 15th day during gavage with quercetin and quercetin nanocrystal. 

Results: Results of this study indicated that ketamine injection causes significant behavioral impairment in comparison with control group and treatment with quercetin and quercetin nanocrystal improves the behavioral impairment.

Conclusion: Quercetin and quercetin nanocrystal treatment may have a protective effect on brain neurons against harmful effects of ketamine on behavioral impairment.

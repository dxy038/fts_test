The objective of this work is to examine the complex inter-relationships between zero-voltage switching requirement, component size, cost, operating frequency and conduction losses in high frequency power converters for telecommunications applications. A systematic approach for component selection and loss calculation is devised and explained for the phase-shift PWM and series-parallel resonant converters. The performance of the two topologies is then compared over a range of frequencies for several standard single chip MOSFET switching devices.

Recently, hybrid electrical power sources composed of storage elements and renewable energy sources are known to have made great development. These energy sources are connected to a dc bus and need a dc-to-ac converter to transfer the produced energy to the grid. Three-leg voltage source inverters equipped with an output <i>LC</i> filter are often used. The main objective of this stage is to generate a three-phase sinusoidal voltage with defined amplitude and to ensure the smallest harmonic distortion rate of the output voltage for any load conditions. To satisfy the defined objectives, we present in this paper a new control method based on differential flatness control technique. The main interest of this control method is the possibility to define the behavior of the state variable system in the steady state as well as in transients. The use of only one control loop allows obtaining high dynamic properties of the system which ensure small harmonic distortion rate of the output voltage. Experimental results under balanced, unbalanced, and nonlinear load conditions are presented and validate the effectiveness of the proposed control methods.

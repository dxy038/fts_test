Calibration is a key technology to realize the desired radiation pattern in phased array antennas. Various techniques have been proposed for array antenna calibrations. The main objective is to obtain the complex electric fields (amplitude and phase) of the individual antenna elements and to compensate for the element-to-element variations. A new technique is required for a fast and efficient measurement operation since the measurement time increases in proportion to the number of antenna elements and/or measurement frequencies. In this paper, we propose a novel measurement method using multicarrier signal for phased array antenna calibration. The proposed method can simultaneously measure the complex electric fields of all antenna elements, therefore fast calibration is possible. The experimental result in an anechoic chamber is also demonstrated.

Out of 3944 patients admitted during 2005, 200 case notes were randomly selected and subjected to audit. The clinical notes were broadly analysed for documentation of six parameters. Each parameter's documentation was to be graded as very good, good, average, poor, or not documented.Results: Personal bio-data was documented good in 194(97%) cases; history and examination were good in 22 (11%) cases; diagnosis was very good in 48 (24%) cases; Investigation were documented very good in 18 (9%) cases and good in 134 (67%) cases; Progress notes were good in 156 (78%) cases and treatment was documented good in 186 (93%) cases. In 82 (41%) charts, one or more of the six selected items were not documented at all. Investigations were not written in 20%o, progress notes in 12%0, history and examination in 9%o, diagnosis in 6%, treatment in 3% and bio-data in 1% of the case notesConclusion: Documentation of important clinical information is poor even in the hospital charts of patients admitted in tertiary care hospital.

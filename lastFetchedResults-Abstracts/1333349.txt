This paper presents a multiobjective optimization methodology for composite stiffened panels. The purpose is to improve the performances of an existing design of stiffened composite panels in terms of both its first buckling load and ultimate collapse or failure loads. The design variables are the stacking sequences of the skin and of the stiffeners of the panel. The optimization is performed using a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm specifically developed for the design of laminated parts. The algorithm takes into account the industrial design guidelines for stacking sequence design. An original method is proposed for the initialization of the optimization that significantly accelerates the search for the Pareto front. In order to reduce the calculation time, Radial Basis Functions under Tension are used to approximate the objective functions. Special attention is paid to generalization errors around the optimum. The multiobjective optimization results in a wide set of trade-offs, offering important improvements for both considered objectives, among which the designer can make a choice.

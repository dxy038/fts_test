Forensic phonetics is a subfield of forensic linguistics in which acoustic information and phonetic features of phones are investigated for completing the forensic cases where one of the existing evidences is related to the guilty. One of the most important tasks of a forensic phonetician is forensic speaker recognition. For doing this, the phonetician is asked to estimate the degree of similarity between the given records of the guilty’s and the suspect’s speech, and determine whether these two sound evidences match to each other or not. The objective of this study, which was conducted on the sound data from 10 Persian native speakers of both sexes, was to investigate the possibility of using Logarithmic spectrographs of vowels as a key for forensic speaker recognition tasks. The results showed that using these logarithmic spectrographs may be a useful means with perfect reliability in the tasks related to forensic speaker recognition.

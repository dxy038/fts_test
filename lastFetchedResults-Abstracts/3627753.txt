This paper presents a bipolar narrow-pulse generator with energy-recovery feature for liquid-food sterilization. The generator is formed from a bidirectional flyback converter and active-clamp circuits which are further simplified to the proposed topology with the synchronous-switch technique. In the converter, the leakage inductance of the transformer will resonate with the active-clamp capacitors to recover the trapped energy and to reduce switching loss, improving efficiency by about 13%. In addition, the capacitors can reduce voltage stress significantly. Experimental results obtained from a prototype with the output of plusmn6-20 kV, depending on loads, and the peak power of 1.2 MW has confirmed these discussions.

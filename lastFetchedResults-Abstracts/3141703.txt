Information is also an objective reality like substance and energy. This paper first analysis the process of measurement using the information theory, puts forward the essence of measurement process and builds a information model for the measurement process, which can explain why the interference and error are always existed in the result of measurement. The dialectical relationship between the measurement process and the epistemology are also confirmed in this paper, in order to get the exactly information that can reflect the measured object, the paper put forward many methods following the epistemological principles. At last, The technology of multi-sensor fusion is used to reduce errors in measurement, which displays that the application of measurement information theory in science and technology. The measurement information theory is very important to guide the methods of design and ideas in measurement process.

Incidental exposure to high explosive compounds can cause subtle health effects to which a population could be more susceptible than injury by detonation. Proper source characterization is a key requirement in the conduct of risk assessments. For nonvolatile solid explosives, dissolution is one of the primary mechanisms that controls fate and transport, resulting in exposure to these compounds remote from their source. To date, information describing dissolution rates of high explosives has been sparse.
The objective of this study was to determine the dissolution rates of three high explosive compounds, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX), and octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX), in dilute aqueous solutions as a function of temperature, surface area, and energy input. To determine each variable's impact on dissolution rate, experiments were performed where one variable was changed while the other two were held constant. TNT demonstrated the fastest dissolution rate followed by HMX and then RDX. Dissolution rate correlation equations were developed for each explosive compound incorporating the three aforementioned variables, independently, and collectively in one correlation equation.

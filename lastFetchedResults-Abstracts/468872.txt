Objective
The purpose of this study was to conduct, in a randomized placebo-controlled manner, social behavior testing on mice offspring that were exposed prenatally to alprazolam.
Study design
A previously described, clinically relevant dose of 0.32 mg/kg of alprazolam (n = 8 mice) or a placebo (n = 9 mice) was given to gravid C57BL/6 mice by gavage on gestational day 18. Social play, sleep/wake patterns, and male aggression of the exposed offspring were assessed during prejuvenile, juvenile, and adult periods.
Results
Alprazolam did not produce treatment differences in pregnancy outcomes or in dam-pup interactions. Compared with the placebo group, alprazolam-exposed offspring demonstrated less desire to escape (P<.01), more desire to remain alone (P<.02), and shorter periods of being awake (P<.03) on PND 17. Alprazolam-exposed male offspring exhibited more aggression on food restriction (P<.01) and on cage changing (P<.01).
Conclusion
Mice offspring that were exposed prenatally to alprazolam demonstrated more individual rather than group activities, avoidance of open areas, and aggression in males. Correlation of these findings in humans is encouraged.

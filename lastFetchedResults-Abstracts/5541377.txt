A new DCG-FGT (Dual-Control-Gate Floating-Gate Transistor) transistor model for static and transient simulations is presented. The PSP MOS description is used as a basis for the formulation of the conduction channel behavior. The floating gate potential is implicitly computed with an added charge neutrality relation that ensures a good convergence. The model is running under electrical simulator (ELDO) and is characterized thanks to ICCAP software. It has been validated on an advanced STMicroelectronics technology. The final objective of this work is to provide an accurate and scalable model available in design framework.

A system engineering method for the partitioning of flexible channel assignment problems is examined. The objective is to identify the mutual interference patterns among cell sites located in an irregular terrain before defining an effective flexible channel assignment method. This method can be accomplished through channel borrowing. In order to borrow channels among base stations in a cellular system, it is essential to understand the natural RF boundaries that will divide the system into groups so that the same channel block can be used on both sides. Thus, each group can borrow channels from some other groups without causing excessive interference in the system. Current cell sites, due to the nonuniform traffic density and limited availability of real estate properties, cannot be equally spaced on a hexagon grid. Also, the RF coverage of each cell splitting or channel borrowing usually creates excessive interference and degrades the quality of the voice channels. The mathematical algorithm used to identify, analyze, and control the RF interference patterns of a mobile telecommunications system is given

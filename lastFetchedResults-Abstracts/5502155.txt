The objective of this work is to segment the human left ventricle myocardium (LVM) in contrast echocardiography imaging and thus track it along a cardiac cycle in order to extract quantitative data about heart function. Ultrasound images are hard to work with due to their speckle appearance. To overcome this we report the combination of active contour models (ACM) or snakes and active shape models (ASM). The ability of ACM in giving closed and smooth curves in addition to the power of the ASM in producing shapes similar to the ones learned, evoke to a robust algorithm. Meanwhile the snake is attracted towards image main features, ASM acts as a correction factor. The algorithm was tested independently on 180 frames and satisfying results were obtained: in 95% the maximum difference between automatic and experts segmentation was less than 12 pixels.

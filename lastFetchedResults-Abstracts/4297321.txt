In this paper, we propose a trust model for the open Grid market. Our trust model emphasizes the importance of both direct trust and indirect trust/reputation when evaluating the trustworthiness of a Grid service provider. Since many factors contribute to the direct and indirect trust, we propose a novel method based on multiple attribute decision making (MADM) theory to determine the objective weights of both direct and indirect trust. The simulation results demonstrate that our trust model reflects the trustworthiness of a service provider more accurately than the weighted feedback model and eBay trust model, and thus improves user satisfaction in the open Grid environment.

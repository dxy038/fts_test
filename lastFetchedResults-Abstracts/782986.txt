Background Most people suffering from severe
mental illness (SMI) lack paid employment. This
study investigates the relationship between work status
and objective as well as subjective quality of life (QoL)
in people with SMI. Methods The sample consists of 261
subjects (102 women, 159 men) aged 35 (men) and 38
(women) years on average, of whom 158 suffer from a
schizophrenic disorder (ICD-10: F2) and 103 were diagnosed
as having an affective disorder (ICD-10: F3). Subjective
QoL was assessed with the WHOQOL-BREF
scale. Results Subjects with an occupation in general
have a larger social network at their disposal and receive
more social support.With regard to income, few (12%)
of the subjects with a job on the open labour market live
below the poverty level, but many (28–38%) of those
engaged in sheltered or other work-like activities do.
Occupation ameliorates satisfaction with life domains
referring to social integration (social relationships,
environment),whereas the individual’s well-being (psychological,
physical) is hardly affected. Social support is
an important mediator of the relationship between occupation
and subjective QoL. Income is weakly and negatively
related to subjective QoL.Conclusions Supportive
relationships to colleagues at the workplace mainly explain
the better subjective QoL of SMI people with an
occupation.When designing specific employment possibilities
for people with SMI, we should take notice of
the social support dimension at the workplace.Mentally
ill people have a substantial poverty risk,even when they
are working. In particular, payment for sheltered work
should be ameliorated.

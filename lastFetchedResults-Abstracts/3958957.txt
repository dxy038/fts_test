This paper presents our field experience in data collection from remote sensors. By letting tractors, farmers, and sensors have short-range radio communication devices with delay-disruption tolerant networking (DTN), we can collect data from those sensors to our central database. Although, several implementations have been made with cellular phones or mesh networks in the past, DTN-based systems for such applications are still under explored. The main objective of this paper is to present our practical implementation and experiences in DTN-based data collection from remote sensors. The software, which we have developed for this research, has about 50 kbyte footprint, which is much smaller than any other DTN implementation. We carried out an experiment with 39 DTN nodes at the University of Tokyo assuming an agricultural scenario. They achieved 99.8% success rate for data gathering with moderate latency, showing sufficient usefulness in data granularity.

Abstract

Objective

Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder requiring long-term therapy using antiepileptic medications. Reports have incriminated long-term antiepileptic drugs use in deficiency of vitamin D and bone diseases in all age groups. We aimed to investigate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and pediatric epilepsy in Indian patients.

Materials & Methods

We prospectively recruited 100 pediatric epilepsy patients, on monotherapy for minimum one-year duration, and 50 age and sex matched controls. This study was carried out at Yashoda Hospital, India from 2011-2014. All cases and controls underwent tests for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, alkaline phosphatase, serum calcium and phosphorus levels.

Results

Patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency were significantly higher among cases (45%) than controls (24%). Mean alkaline phosphatase was significantly higher in cases and mean serum calcium was significantly lower (8.3Â±1.5) in cases. Amongst antiepileptic drugs, carbamazepine and sodium valproate were significantly associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency. Risk of vitamin D deficiency was highest with sodium valproate usage (odds:4.0;95%CI 1.4-11.6) followed by carbamazepine use (odds: 2.7; 95%CI 1.0-6.8). After adjustment using multiple logistic regression, antiepileptic drugs showed independent association with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (odds:2.2;95%CI 0.9-4.5).

Conclusion

25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with use of carbamazepine and sodium valproate in pediatric epilepsy.

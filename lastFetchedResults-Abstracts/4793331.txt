The main objective of the present paper is to apply finite element analysis to determine the cogging torque of a PMBLDC motor with changes in stator tooth width and active surface area. Since this cannot be determined analytically, finite element technique is applied on the motor. A comparative study has been made for different stator tooth shapes based on different FEM profiles obtained after simulation.

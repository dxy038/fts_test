We present a new and simple unconstrained optimization based power control algorithm for interference-limited Rayleigh fading wireless networks. We consider optimizing two objective functions, namely, minimizing outage and maximizing utility under bounds on transmission powers. With some transformation techniques, we show that the formulated constrained optimization problem can be converted into an equivalent unconstrained problem. In each case, both the user-centric and network-centric formulation and their iterative solution techniques are given. Our proposed algorithms are very efficient and converge to optimal solution very quickly

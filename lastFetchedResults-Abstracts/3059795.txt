We are presenting the mechanical and electrical system design and system integration of controllers including sensory devices of the humanoid, KHR-2 in this paper. The concept and the objective of the design will be described. We have developed KHR-2 since 2003 which has 41 DOF (degree of freedom). Each arm including a hand and a wrist has 11 DOF (5+2 DOF/hand (finger + wrist), 4 DOF/arm) and each leg has 6 DOF. Head and trunk have 6 DOF (2 DOF/eye and 2 DOF/neck) and 1 DOF respectively. The mechanical part of the robot is designed to have human friendly appearance and wide movable angle range. Joint actuators are designed to have negligible uncertainties such as backlash. To control all axes, distributed control architecture is adopted to reduce the computation burden of the main controller (PC) and to expand the devices easily. We developed a sub-controller which is a servo motor controller and sensor interfacing devices using microprocessor. The main controller (PC) attached on the back of the robot communicates with sub-controllers in real-time by using CAN (controller area network). Windows XP is used for OS (operating system) for fast development of main control program. RTX (real time extension) HAL extension software is used to realize the real-time control in Windows XP environment. KHR-2 has several sensor types, which are 3-axis F/T (force/torque) sensors at foot and wrist, inertia sensor system (accelerometer and rate gyro) and CCD camera. The F/T sensor at the foot is the most fundamental sensor for stable walking. The inertia sensor system is essential for determining the inclination between the ground and the robot. Finally, we used the CCD camera for navigation and stabilization of the robot in the future. We described the details of the KHR-2 in this paper.

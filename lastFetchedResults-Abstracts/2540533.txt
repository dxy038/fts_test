Background and Objective: Poor sleep quality is one of the common problems in patients with myocardial infarction that can affect on quality of life in these patients. The current study aimed to determine the effect of jaw relaxation on sleep quality in patients with myocardial infarction.

Materials and Method: This study was a quasiexperimental study. Population was the patients with myocardial infarction reffered to hospitals in Saveh in 2015. 68 Patients were selected through purposive sling and were randomly allocated into two groups of intervention and control..Patients in intervention group perform the  jaw relaxation techniques 5 times a day for 20 minutes and for a month. While the patients in the control group only received routine treatment. The data were collected through using the individual characteristics form and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index  before and 1 month after the intervention. Data were analyzed by using SPSS19, Fishers exact tests, chisquare, paired ttest and independent ttest.

Results: The mean scores of quality of sleep before the intervention in intervention group was (14.52plusmn  1.39) and in the control group was (14.32 plusmn  1.29), while after the intervention these values was reduced respectively to (12.38 plusmn  1.49) and (14.02 plusmn  2.4) (p=0.001). According to independent Ttest, there was a significant difference between the two groups (p=0.001).

Conclusion: The results showed that the use of jaw relaxation techniques  improves the sleep quality in patients with myocardial infarction. Due to the simplicity and low cost of this method, it can be used as a nonpharmacological method.

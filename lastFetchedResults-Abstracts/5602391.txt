This paper describes the methodology to determine the optimum size and location of reactive compensation equipments. The proposed method is implemented with a new interior point optimum power flow program called IPSO (Integrated Power System Optimizer), developed by Tractebel Engineering. The proposed objective functions achieve the trade off between economic objectives (investment cost) and functional objectives (real power losses reduction or security level requirements). The discrete variables are first modelled as continuous quantities then rounded-off sequentially to obtain a applicable operating point. The efficiency of the proposed methodology has been proven on several studies in different Gulf countries (e.g. Oman, Dubai...).

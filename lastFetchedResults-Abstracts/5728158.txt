The objective of this research is to examine unsupervised change detection methods using multitemporal spaceborne SAR data for urbanization monitoring in Beijing. One scene of ENVISAT ASAR C-VV image was acquired in July, 2008 and one scene of ERS-2 SAR C-VV image was acquired in July, 1998. To compare the two SAR images, a modified ratio operator that takes into account both positive and negative changes was developed to derive a change image. A generalized version of Kittler-Illingworth minimum-error thresholding algorithm was then tested to automatically classify the change image into two classes, change and no-change. Various probability density functions such as Log normal, Generalized Gaussian, Nakagami ratio, and Weibull ratio were investigated to model the distribution of the change and no-change classes. The preliminary results showed that Kittler-Illingworth algorithm applied to the modified ratio image is very effective in detecting temporal changes in urban areas using SAR images. Log normal and Nakagami density models achieved the best results. The Kappa coefficients of the these solutions were of 0.82 while the false alarm rates were 2.7%. The initial findings indicated that the accuracy of the change result obtained using Kittler-Illingworth algorithm varies depending on how the assumed conditional class density function fits the histograms of change and no-change classes.

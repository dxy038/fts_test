Designs and analysis of computer experiments have been widely investigated in the past decade. Engineers often adopt one of the two following approaches: the response surface methodology or the Kriging method. This paper describes and compares them briefly in order to present a methodology for computer experiments based on these two classical methods. The objective is to combine the advantages of the two approaches notably the low cost of the standard experimental designs and the accurate response surface of the Kriging method.

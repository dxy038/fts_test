A nonlinear-noise filtering method for image processing, based on the entropy concept is developed and compared to the well-known median filter and to the center weighted median filter (CWM). The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through subjective and objective criteria. It is shown that this method performs better than the classical median for different types of noise and can perform better than the CWM filter in some cases

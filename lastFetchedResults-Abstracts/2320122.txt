Today, the international trade, as an engine of economic
growth, has attracted the attention of many economists. A prerequisite for
an effective policy to develop export is to recognize the determinants
of export. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the determinants
of exports in developing countries over 2006-2012 using the
econometric approach of Bayesian Model Averaging. According to the results,
degree of openness and ratio of GDS to GDP are the key factors in
explaining exports. The impact of import tariffs and duties, the number of
internet users and inflation rate also are relatively important. In addition,
the share of agriculture in economic activities has a negative impact on
exports with a probability of 32%, while the share of industry has a positive
but insignificant effect. The results also indicate that the variables related to
communication facilities have positive effects on exports. The other variables
have negligible effects on exports of goods and services.
In view of the results, it seems that some policy actions should be taken
to reduce inflation rate and to enhance education system; furthermore,
itâ€™s essential to consider appropriate foreign exchange policies, and also
policies proper to allocate more efficiency labor forces among different
economic sectors, and

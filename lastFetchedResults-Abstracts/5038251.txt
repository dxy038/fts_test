This paper describes the implementation of the NetBIOS and the NovellÂ´s IPX protocols for the server independent, peer-to-peer communications with the objective for real-time control applications. The results of evaluation for both protocols based on the Ethernet data link using the connectionless-oriented communications is later presented. It is shown quantitatively how much more speed efficiency the IPX implementation can offer, compared with the NetBIOS implementation. The work also demonstrates that from the file server dependent communication network software package with a limited number of users the basic routines can be adapted to eliminate these constraints and become more suitable for real-time control applications

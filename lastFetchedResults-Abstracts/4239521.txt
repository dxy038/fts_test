With the rapid development of wind power generation, integrated wind farms will exert a growing influence in the economic operation of power system. This paper build an OPF model with wind farms which includes the stable model of wind generator and the added up spinning reserve and down spinning reserve caused by the uncertainty of wind power. In order to make this model become more reasonable, the cost of wind power generation is added into the objective function and the real output of wind power generator is dealed with a control variable. A quadratic penalty function with variable penalty is employed to realize successive discretization of the discrete control variables in optimization process. The IEEE 118 system is used to analyze the effect of connected wind farm and its spinning reserve demand on the total generation cost and verify the rationality of proposed optimal power flow model and the validity of proposed algorithm.

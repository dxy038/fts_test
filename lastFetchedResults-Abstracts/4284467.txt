The Adaptive Loop Filter (ALF) is a subjective and objective image quality improving filter in the High Efficiency Video Coding standard (HEVC). The ALF has shown to be computationally complex and its complexity has been reduced during the HEVC development process. In the HEVC TestModel HM-7.0 ALF is a 9&#215;7 cross + 3&#215;3 square shaped filter. This paper presents a programmable application specific instruction processor for the ALF. The proposed processor processes 1920&#215;1080p luminance frames at 30 frames per second, when operated at a clock frequency of 311MHz. Low power consumption and a low gate count make the proposed processor suitable for embedded devices. The processor program code is written in pure C-language, which allows versatile use of the circuit and updates to the filter functionality without modifying the processor design. To the authorsÂ´ best knowledge this is the first programmable solution for ALF on embedded devices.

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is the multiple access technology that may be used in the next generation broadband wireless communication systems. We devise some new algorithms which use the linear combination of two variables as the objective matrix. In these algorithms, both cell throughput and user fairness are considered. To guarantee the user quality of service (QoS), we also propose a scheduling algorithm which restricts the maximum user delay less than a fixed number of transmission time intervals (TTIs). To evaluate the fairness of the system, we construct a numerical metric to represent the differences of transmission rates among different users. The commonly used feedback limited scheme named of top-M scheme is modified in this paper to solve the problem that some physical resource blocks (PRBs) may have no channel quality indicator (CQI) report from the users in the traditional top-M scheme.

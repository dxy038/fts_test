TCP Vegas is analyzed and modified in the congestion avoidance phase by using optimization theory. The optimization approach is to maximize the aggregate utility of all sources subject to the capacity constraints of the networkÂ´s resources. The congestion avoidance mechanism of sources and the active queue management in bottleneck routers can be interpreted as finding a solution of the optimization problem with constraints by using the first order method. In this method, we discuss several modifications of congestion avoidance in sources and queue management in routers with respect to 1) what the objective function of TCP Vegas should be, 2) how the active queue management should be designed in the framework of the optimization approach.

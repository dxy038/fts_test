This work presents an adaptive control approach for queue-based Bandwidth-on-Demand (BoD) procedures in geostationary satellite networks. In queue-based protocols, the controller objective is to drive the buffer queue length to a certain target queue length. The proposed protocol is based on the construction of a certain number of models (MRs) that represents a particular statistical network behavior in a way to obtain the above mentioned reference queue length. The reference queue length is computed as a weighted sum of the outputs of the different MRs. By varying on-line the target queue length a trade-off between efficient exploiting of bandwidth and reduction of queuing delay is achieved.

The transmitter identification (Tx-ID) of digital television (DTV) systems becomes crucial nowadays. However, identification of a weak source signal is quite difficult, and therefore pseudo-random (PN) sequences were proposed to be embedded into the DTV signal for the Tx-ID purpose. Kasami sequences are excellent candidates adopted for the Tx-ID PN sequences as they provide a large family of nearly-orthogonal codes. We envision that, in the future, different broadcasting companies may use different Tx-ID sequences (codes) just as different telephone companies have owned different code prefixes or &#8220;area codes&#8221;. Tx-ID sequences may be grouped separately for different companies and hence there is an emerging need to categorize Tx-ID sequences just as ZIP codes are used to categorize postal addresses. In this paper, we are particularly interested in the Tx-ID sequences made of Kasami sequences. Our main objective is to efficiently categorize and address Kasami sequences. We design a new algorithm that can efficiently classify Kasami sequences within O(n<sup>1.5</sup> log<sup>2</sup> n)-time, where n is the sequence length. Simulations show that our proposed algorithm is very fast in practice. Our proposed new blind detection method for determining the addressing parameters for an arbitrary Kasami sequence can save the required huge memory storage space by the conventional correlation-based Kasami sequence classifier (detector).

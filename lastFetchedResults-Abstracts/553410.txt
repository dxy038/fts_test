An optimal procedure for designing
coordinated output feedback damping controllers of
power system stabilizer (PSS) and STATCOM is
developed for achieving and enhancing dynamic stability
in single-machine infinite-bus power system. The
coordinated design problem of STATCOM and PSS with
output feedback controllers over a wide range of loading
conditions is formulated as an optimization problem with
the time domain-based objective function which is solved
by a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm that
has a strong ability to find the most optimistic results.
Only local and available state variables are adopted as the
input signals of each output feedback controller for the
coordinated design. The effectiveness of the proposed
controllers for damping low frequency oscillations are
tested and demonstrated through nonlinear time-domain
simulation and some performance indices studies. The
coordinated design has been demonstrated to provide
extremely good damping characteristics

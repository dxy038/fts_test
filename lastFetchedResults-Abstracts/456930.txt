Objective
We postulated that in type 2 diabetes, the postprandial phase is a pro-inflammatory state that can be modulated by PPAR-γ agonists. For this purpose, we determined the effects of rosiglitazone (8 mg/d) on postprandial leukocyte counts and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Methods and results
A randomized, 8-week, cross-over, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was performed in 19 patients with type 2 diabetes. Standardized 6-h oral fat-loading tests were performed after each treatment period. During placebo treatment, blood leukocytes increased to a maximum 6-h postprandially, due to significant increases in neutrophils and lymphocytes. Concomitant postprandial increases were observed for IL-6 and IL-8, the major chemokines responsible for leukocyte recruitment. Rosiglitazone reduced the incremental area under the curves (dAUCs) for IL-6 (−63%, p < 0.01) and IL-8 (−16%, p < 0.05). The dAUC for leukocytes decreased with 37% (p < 0.05), due to a specific reduction of neutrophils (−39%, p < 0.05).
Conclusions
Rosiglitazone attenuated the postprandial increases of neutrophils, IL-6 and IL-8 in patients with type 2 diabetes. Since inflammation is a major force driving atherosclerosis, and man lives in a postprandial period most part of the day, a reduced inflammatory response after a meal may delay progression of atherosclerosis.
Condensed abstract
We postulated that in type 2 diabetes, the postprandial phase is a pro-inflammatory state that can be modulated by PPAR-γ agonists. Rosiglitazone attenuated the postprandial increases of neutrophils, IL-6 and IL-8 in patients with type 2 diabetes. These effects may contribute to cardiovascular risk reduction.

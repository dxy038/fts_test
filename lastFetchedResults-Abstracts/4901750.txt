Mathematical optimization methods are modern and powerful means to help enhance the performance of technical systems or processes. This paper shows how optimization methods can be used to find an optimal design of tooth concentrated winding rotating field (CWRF) machines. The machine is considered as optimal if its MMF-harmonic distribution is made in such a way that unwanted effects, like noise, vibration, etc. are minimized. The paper suggests a way how to compute the MMF-harmonics as a function of design parameters, setting up an objective function and applying optimization algorithms on it.

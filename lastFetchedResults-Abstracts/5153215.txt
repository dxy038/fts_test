This paper addresses an attempt to evolve genetic algorithm by a particular modified partially mapped crossover method to make it able to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem. Which is type of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. The main objective is to look a better GA such that solves TSP with shortest tour. First we solve the TSP by using PMX (Goldberg and Lingle, 1985) and then a modified PMX to evolve a GA.

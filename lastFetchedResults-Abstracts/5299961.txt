Wireless sensor networks consist of tiny sensor nodes with sensing, computation and wireless communication capabilities. The design of routing protocols is influenced by various factors like fault tolerance, energy efficiency, scalability, latency, power consumption and network topology. The primary design objective of research is determining the active nodes and enhancing the energy efficiency. In this paper a new protocol is proposed based on the characteristics of Threshold - sensitive Energy Efficient sensor Network protocol and Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol is efficient in transmission of packets, energy and throughput.

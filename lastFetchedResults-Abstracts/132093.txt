Introduction & Objective: Acute urinary retention is an unusual symptom among women. This is a case report of acute urinary retention due to endometriosis in a postmenopausal woman. Case: The patient was a 49 - years old woman who had referred with dull abdominal pain and acute urinary retention for a few weeks. In physical examination, cervix was displaced anteriorly
 and superiorly and a large and tender mass was palpable above symphysis pubis. Ultrasonography and CT-Scan showed a huge thick-walled cystic structure almost 12x14 cm occupying central part of pelvic and lower abdominal cavity most likely arised from left ovary. The patient operated and TAH+BSO was done.The mass was reported endometriosis by pathologist. CA-125 level was normal.
Conclusion: Endometriosis is not a disease of childbearing age and about 2-4% of cases occur in postmenopausal age. it is still unclear how endometric masses grow and become evident in postmenopausal women .

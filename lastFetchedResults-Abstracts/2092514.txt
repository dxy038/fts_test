Bangladesh is a developing country. The country is not only technologically and
managerially inefficient but also underdeveloped in the areas of key infrastructure such
as transport, telecommunication, and energy sectors. Despite a low GNI/capita (PPP,
current) of $1,940 the growth fundamentals of the economy has received widespread
international attention. Guardian has enlisted Bangladesh among the economies that
have the potential of overtaking the west by 2050. Bangladesh’s economic stability fares
well even in comparison with the “Emerging Asia”. Bangladesh’s growth is overly
dependent on two growth drivers— exports and remittances— making growth highly
vulnerable to developments in the global economy. The economy of Bangladesh suffers
from both supply side and demand side problems. The main objective of the study was to
select four macro-economic factors and know how the factors of macroeconomics work in
our country in the reference period (January 2013 to March 2013) and compare with the
same period of 2012.

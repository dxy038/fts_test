The objective of this review is to provide updated information about the most important features of graphitized carbonaceous sorbents used for solid-phase extraction (SPE) of organic compounds from liquid natural matrices or extracts. The surface characteristics of graphitized carbon blacks and porous graphitic carbons are described which are responsible for the various types interactions (hydrophobic, electronic and ion-exchange) with analytes. The method development is given which is based on the prediction from liquid chromatographic retention data obtained using porous graphitic carbon. Emphasis is placed on their capability for trapping very polar and water-soluble analytes from aqueous samples. Comparison is made between carbon-based SPE sorbents and other reversed-phase materials such as octadecyl silicas and highly cross-linked copolymers. Especially, the difficulty encountered for the desorption of some strongly retained analytes is explained by LC data and solutions are given for optimizing the composition and volume of the desorption solution. Many examples illustrate the various common features of graphitized carbons which are the extraction of very polar analytes and multiresidue extractions. Some applications are specific to graphitized carbon black due to the presence of surface functional groups. They include the extraction of anionic compounds such as benzene and naphthalene sulfonates or acidic pesticides. Other applications are specific to porous graphitic carbon due to its flat and homogeneous surface. One example is the trace extraction of coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans from other PCB congeners

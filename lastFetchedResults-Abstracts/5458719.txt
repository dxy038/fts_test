Hydrogen network is the key part in crude oil refinery process, which has such features as large scale, complex process. It is very difficult to formalize and optimize the network. This paper presents bi-objective model for the scheduling problem of the hydrogen network. NSGA-II algorithm, which is adopted to solve our model, gives out the Pareto set. Then C<sup>2</sup>R method can be used to evaluate the Pareto solution in the set. Computational experiments based on the data from certain refinery factory demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the scheduling mothodelogy.

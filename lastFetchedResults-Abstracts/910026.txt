Monitoring of surface ozone over southern Africa has shown that ambient concentrations often exceed a threshold of 40 ppb at
which damage to vegetation by ozone could be expected. The Cross Border Air Pollution Assessment Project (CAPIA) was therefore
established to assess the potential impacts of ozone on maize, a staple food crop, in five southern African countries. Measured
surface ozone data are scare in the region so it was necessary to complement the monitoring with regional-scale photochemical
modelling to achieve the objective. The Pennsylvania State and NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) is used to produce gridded
meteorological data for 5 days in each month of the maize growing season, October to April, as input to the photochemical model,
CAMx. Gridded anthropogenic emissions from industry, transport and domestic burning and gridded biogenic emissions from soils
and vegetation are input to CAMx. The model estimations indicate large areas on the sub-continent where surface ozone
concentrations exceed 40 ppb for up to 10 h per day. Maximum concentrations may exceed 80 ppb, particularly in the winter when
mean ozone concentrations are higher. The areas where the 40 ppb threshold is exceeded coincide with maize growing areas in South
Africa and Zimbabwe. It appears that neither anthropogenic emissions nor biogenic emissions are dominant in the production of
surface ozone over southern Africa. Rather the formation of surface ozone over the region is attributed to the combined
contribution of precursors from anthropogenic and biogenic origin.

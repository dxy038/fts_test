Compact microstrip patch antenna with L-shaped spur lines using Hilbert shaped fractal defective ground structure (DGS) is proposed and investigated for multiband applications. The objective of the paper is to obtain average size reduction of about 72% using resonant frequency shift method with the help of DGS. The impedance bandwidth, gain and efficiency are observed and compared for the proposed antenna with and without DGS. Excellent agreement is found between simulated and measured results.

Carrying out Food and Agricultural product Quality Inspection manually is a laborious task. Maintaining consistent product quality is not possible due to human errors. Customer expectations are increasing day by day and seek products of high quality. However, in India the Inspection of Food and Agricultural produce is done manually in most of the cases. Work in the Computer Vision area is being extensively carried out these days to provide automated, non-destructive and cost-effective techniques to achieve this. Computer Vision uses Image processing as one of the intermediary tools to achieve the ultimate objective. Cashew is one of the important commercial crops of India. The objective of this research is to provide an image processing method for measuring cashew kernel Size (i.e. length and width/height) with an accurate and smallest relative error.

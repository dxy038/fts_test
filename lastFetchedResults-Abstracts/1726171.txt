Objective of this study is to realize appropriate enzyme immobilization onto a suitable support material and to develop a model which enables reactions catalyzed with different enzymes arranged in order. Thence, this model was potential for developing a multi-enzyme system. The reactions need more than one enzyme can be realized using immobilized form of them and the enzymes will be in one support at wanted activities. In this study, sodium alginate was used as immobilization material and glycidyl methacrylate was grafted onto sodium alginate. Thus reactive epoxy groups were added to sodium alginate which also has carboxyl groups. Average molecular weight of sodium alginate was determined using Ubbelohde viscosimetri. The molecular mass of sodium alginate was calculated as 15,900 Da. Graft polymerization was made in two steps. Firstly, sodium alginate was activated with benzophenone using UV-light at 254 nm. Secondly, glycidyl methacrylate was grafted under UV-light at 365 nm onto activated sodium alginate. Grafted glycidyl methacrylate was determined gravimetric and titrimetric. Additional groups after grafting were showed with FT-IR spectrum. 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimetylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide was used for immobilization urease from carboxyl groups at pH 5.0. Suitable 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimetylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide/–COOH ratio was found 1/10 and immobilized product activity was 197 U/g support. Reaction medium pH was 8.0 for immobilization from epoxy group. Optimum immobilization reaction time was found as 2 h and immobilized product activity was 285 U/g support. Sequential immobilization of urease to glycidyl methacrylate grafted sodium alginate was made from –COOH and epoxy groups, respectively.

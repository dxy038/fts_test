This paper aims at devising an optimized pseudo-random test methodology for NoCs and its architectural support. The guiding principle consists of using a test pattern compaction engine for generating minimal test lengths. We show the application of this principle driven by the objective to minimize test application time, at the cost of test wrapper complexity. The achieved design point results in a reduction of test application time by two orders of magnitude with respect to state-of-the-art test architectures for NoCs exploiting pseudo-random patterns.

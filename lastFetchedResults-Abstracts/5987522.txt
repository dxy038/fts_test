ICSES´08 is the fifth issue of two years´ series started in 2000 and preceded by 22 annual National Conferences on Circuit Theory and Electronic Networks (in Polish: KKTOiUE). These conferences have traditionally been the main forum for presenting research developments in analog and digital signal processing and electronic circuits and systems, taking place in the most interesting venues in Poland. This year we invited you to Krakow ?? the old capital of Poland, well known as Polish university and cultural center and very popular touring European city ?? the capital of Malopolska (Little Poland) region. The Conference is being held at the Novotel Bronowice, Armii Krajowej Street 11. The Conference is organized by the Department of Electronics at the AGH University of Science and Technology, in co-operation with: IEEE Circuits and Systems Society, Section of Signals, Circuits and Electronic Systems, of the Committee of Electronics and Telecommunications, Polish Academy of Science, under Honorary Patronage of Minister of Science and Higher Education, Poland Rector of AGH University of Science and Technology. The objective of the ICSES Conference is to provide an international forum from the signal processing community and the circuit and electronic systems community as well as industrial developers for discussion and exchange of information on the latest scientific and theoretical advances, to discuss and debate major issues and to demonstrate state-of-the-art applications. This year, 13 main topics will be featured.

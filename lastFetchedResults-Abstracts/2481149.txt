This paper proposes and investigates a Combined Ejector-Cooling and
Power (CECP) system, using R123 as a working 
uid to utilize the solar energy over
a low temperature range. Evacuated tube solar collectors are used to collect the solar
radiation for their low costs. A thermal storage system and an auxiliary boiler are used
to provide continuous cooling and power output when solar radiation is not sucient.
Mathematical models are employed to simulate the system under steady-state conditions.
The results obtained reveal that solar collector and auxiliary boiler are the main exergy
destruction sources. Parametric analysis is conducted to examine the eects of some key
thermodynamic parameters on the system performance. The results indicate that under
the actual constraints, increasing turbine inlet pressure elevates system eciency while
increasing turbine inlet temperature and turbine back pressure decreases that. The system
is also optimized with the energy and exergy eciencies as objective functions by means of
genetic algorithm under the given conditions.

Ground source heat pump, due to high coefficient of performance (COP) and use of low-temperature thermal energy source, is one of the best technologies to use renewable energy resources. In this work, at first, a geothermal heat pump for heating with economizer is simulated, and then the effects of the variations in different parameters such as pressure in different parts of cycle, super-heating at evaporator outlet, sub-cooling at condenser outlet, and soil temperature on heat pump and total COP and exergy efficiency are analyzed. At the end, the ground source heat pump system is optimized in two manners: total COP relative to objective function and total exergy efficiency relative to objective function. The total COP and exergy efficiency values for the basic input mode were 3.674 and 0.488, respectively, and these values  increased to 5.323 and 0.72, respectively, after optimization.

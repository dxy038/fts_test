Objective: The purpose of this study was to measure patient health-related quality of life/satisfaction with the results of hysterectomy in 2 distinct groups of women. Study Design: A health-related outcomes questionnaire was completed 3 months after hysterectomy by 50 low-income women who underwent operation at a state-supported teaching hospital and by 50 women who underwent operation at a private hospital. Results: The women at the teaching hospital had a significantly worse outcome satisfaction score than the women at a private hospital. However, 98% of the patients at the teaching hospital and 100% of patients at the private hospital noted their symptoms to be improved. Factors such as race, age, preoperative indications, route of hysterectomy, oophorectomy, and hormone replacement therapy did not affect outcome scores. Conclusion: Low-income women who undergo operation at a university teaching hospital experience lower satisfaction after hysterectomy than do other women. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;187:1528-32.)

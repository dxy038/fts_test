Load curve shape modification in electric power system is a major demand side management objective, achieved by extensive use of &#8220;time of the use&#8221; and such other tariffs. This paper describes a different approach to achieve the same objective by adapting concept of &#8220;frequency for the use&#8221;, aided by appropriate tariff strategy. Administration of this new demand side management toot by automatic frequency dependent &#8220;load chipping in&#8221; is proposed

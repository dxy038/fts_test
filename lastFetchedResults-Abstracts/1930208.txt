The objective of this study was to characterize facial whorl characteristics in Holstein stud bulls (n = 485) and to investigate their association with measures of semen quantity and quality. Bulls had 1 (n = 454), 2 (n = 21) or no facial hair whorls (n = 5). Some 39% of bulls had whorls in the middle of their forehead, whereas 43% had whorls very low down on their forehead. Spiral whorls were present on 77% of bulls while 22% had elongated whorls. Abnormally shaped whorls were found more often on bulls with low whorls (27% versus 17%, P = 0.01) than on bulls with high or middle whorls. Semen production data were obtained from the AI center database to provide a representative sample of each sires most recent semen production characteristics. The number of semen collections per bull averaged 38 with a range of 1 (n = 9) to 272 (n = 1). The average number of days between collections was 5 but varied from 1 to 425 days. Average age of bulls at first recorded collection was 679 days and ranged from 307 to 4555 days. There were no significant differences between black and white bulls in semen quality or quantity. Semen quality over the summer months was reduced in comparison to the winter months. Age of the bull at time of collection had no effect on any of the semen quality traits. Older bulls had larger scrotal circumference and produced more semen (P &gt; 0.01). Bulls with whorls located in the center of the forehead were not significantly different in semen quality or quantity for the 10 traits considered when compared to bulls with whorls located outside the center. In contrast to previous research findings with Angus cattle, semen attributes were not significantly different between bulls characterized with round (or spiral) epicenters and those with abnormally shaped whorls. The difference between the two studies may be due to the fact that Angus bulls have a higher percentage of abnormal elongated whorls compared to Holsteins.

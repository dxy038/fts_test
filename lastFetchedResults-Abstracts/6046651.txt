The influence of dead times on the behavior of a pulsewidth modulation (PWM) inverter feeding a bidirectional current load is investigated. An analytical study based on the Z transformation shows that the dynamic of the inverter load set is modified when the load current goes through zero during dead times. Thus, a correction of the effects of dead times on the current is proposed

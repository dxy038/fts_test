Objective: Epinephrine and norepinephrine are associated with the hyperstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Neuropeptide Y is a potent vasoconstrictive substance that is released in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation. Study Design: The concentrations of plasma neuropeptide Y in pregnant patients with eclampsia (n = 8), preeclampsia (n = 8), and normotension (n = 8) were measured by radioimmunoassay on admission and 6 days after delivery. Correlations between plasma concentration of neuropeptide Y and mean arterial blood pressure were also evaluated in these patients on admission and 6 days after delivery. Results: The plasma level of neuropeptide Y in women with eclampsia (P< .001) and preeclampsia (P< .003) was found to be significantly elevated with respect to that in normotensive pregnant women. At 6 days after delivery the concentration of plasma neuropeptide Y was significantly decreased in women with eclampsia, women with preeclampsia, and women with normotensive pregnancies compared with the value measured on admission (P< .0001, P< .0001, and P< .002, respectively). At admission the plasma neuropeptide Y level was positively correlated with mean arterial blood pressure in women with eclampsia and preeclampsia. However, no significant correlations were observed between plasma neuropeptide Y concentration and mean arterial blood pressure both at admission and 6 days after delivery in normotensive pregnant women and 6 days after delivery in women with eclampsia and preeclampsia. Conclusion: We have concluded that the level of neuropeptide Y in plasma is increased in women with eclampsia and preeclampsia. Elevated plasma neuropeptide Y levels may play a key role in the development of eclampsia and preeclampsia. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;182:896-900.)

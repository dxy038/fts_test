The objective of the paper is to design a single-pole double-throw (SPDT) radio frequency microelectromechanical system (RF MEMS) switch for ultra-broadband applications. The SPDT RF MEMS switch is driven by rotary comb-drive actuators with lateral resistive contacts. The proposed fabrication process of the switch is a standard nickel electroforming process on a glass substrate. Chosen electrostatic actuators decrease the power consumption of the switch near to zero and provides good contact force which results less contact resistance. As a result, good RF characteristics were achieved. The designed SPDT RF MEMS switch has a drive voltage of 50V, switching times from OFF to state I or II and vice versa shorter than 79&#956;s and 130&#956;s, an insertion loss below -0.73dB up to 90GHz, a return loss below -16.43dB and an isolation below -23.91dB.

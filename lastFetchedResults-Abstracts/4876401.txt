This paper describes the state of the art in the field of computer aided software engineering (CASE) technology. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the current state and direction of CASE. The term CASE emerged in the late 1970s when computer companies began to borrow ideas from the hardware manufacturing process and apply them to software development. There are many CASE tools available that can improve the productivity of programmers. A survey of object-oriented (OO) CASE tools was conducted to provide an overview of OO CASE tools, methods, and vendors.

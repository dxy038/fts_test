Objective — To establish the incidence of odontogenic tumours in Nigeria we present our experience during the 15-year period 1980–1994. Design — Retrospective review of histopathological specimens and case notes. Setting — Teaching hospital, Nigeria. Subjects — 128 Patients with histologically confirmed odontogenic tumours out of a total of 415 with tumours of the mouth and jaw. Main outcome measures — Incidence, treatment, and recurrence rate. Results — Ameloblastoma (n = 21, 16%) and adenomatoid tumour (n = 16.13%). Patients' ages ranged from 8 to 75 years (mean 33 for ameloblastoma, 31 for fibromyxoma, and 22 for adenomatoid tumour). The corresponding male:female ratios were 3:2, 2:3, and 1:1, and maxilla:mandible ratios 1:9, 1.1:1, and 2:1. The more radical the resection of ameloblastomas the less likely were they to recur. Conclusion — Further research is required to explain the high incidence of odontogenic tumours in Nigeria, particularly ameloblastomas.

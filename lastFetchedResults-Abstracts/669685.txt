In this paper, there is an attempt to investigate the concurrence between law â€“ especially criminal law- from one side and economic- industrial advancement with respect to the historical and objective Perspective from the other side. The (crucial) main point of the view of the authors is that the study of the criminal law in the developed countries shows without a legal field and modern criminal system - especially at the beginning of industrialization- accessing the aims of development is impossible. This relationship is not unilateral and the industrialization and development on its ongoing process has caused to change the legal understanding such as the concept of crime, criminalization, punishment and its methods. The change of this notion and its requirements of modern- industrial society cause the change in the basis of criminalization and the modern criminalization (with respect to these industrial changes from one side and the crime prevention of some conducts in the modern world which are not guilt).  The  penal codes of some countries  with old  notions do not tend to  agree these changes  and comply with the rules  and  their  perspectives with  them  in a way  that  some  traditional  offences  and  rough penalties in these countries show  the  lack of their  development .

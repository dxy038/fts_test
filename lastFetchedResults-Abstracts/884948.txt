Introduction: Most of research projects are in the form of theses and an important part of assessing their research values is based on the type of study chosen and conducted. This survey aims to evaluate the medical residents’  theses at Guilan University of Medical Sciences in terms of   methodology and other research components.
Objective: To determine the frequency of study types adopted in medical residents’  theses
Materials and Methods: In this retrospective-descriptive study, 101 medical theses from April 2005 to March 2009 have been assessed  in terms of  type of study, the research design, acceptance  in the domestic  and foreign  journals and congresses.
Results: Of the 101 of theses, descriptive studies account for  52 theses (5/51%), analysis of patients 43 patients (6/42%),  and evaluation of diagnostic tests 6 theses (9/5%). A total of 68.3% of the manuscripts were published in journals (41.6% in national journals, 5% in foreign journals and 11.9% in both). The lowest number of publications was in 2006 (12.8%) and the highest was in 2009 (24.6%). A total of 47.5% of the manuscripts were presented at congresses (30.7% in national congresses, 13/9% in foreign journals and 12.9% in both). The lowest publication rate was in 2006 (12.8%) and the higheat in 2005 and  2009 (22.9%).

Background and Aim: Anemia in pregnant women is a common disease in developing countries, the prevalence ranging between 35% and 100%. Based on a systematic review in 2005 anemia prevalence among Iranian pregnant women was estimated to be 12.4%. The objective of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine anemia prevalence among Iranian pregnant women between 2005 and 2016.

Materials and Methods: This systematic review, using standard key words, included databases Magiran, Iranmedex, IranDoc, SID, Medlib, Scopus, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochran, Embase, Springer, Web of Science, and &nbsp;Online Library Wiley, as well as the Google Scholar search engine of for the period 2005-2016. All the reviewed papers meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the study. Data were analyzed using the random effect model based on meta-analyses, the software being Stata Ver.11.1.

Result: Twenty-five studies with a total sample of 56610 pregnant women met the inclusion criteria.&nbsp; The prevalence of anemia was estimated to be 17% (95% CI: 14-20). The highest (23%) and lowest (12%) prevalence rates were observed in the center and west of the country, respectively. The prevalence was estimated to be 21% in urban areas and 8% in the rural areas.

Conclusion: The prevalence of anemia in Iranian pregnant women has increased over the last 11 years. Therefore, appropriate intervention programs must be implemented in premarital counseling and pregnancy clinics.

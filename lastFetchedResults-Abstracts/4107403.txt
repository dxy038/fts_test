The variations of NDVI for crops, semi-evergreen forest, dry deciduous forest, and sand have been analyzed as a function of date of acquisition at 670 and 865 am using ADEOS-Polarization and Directionality of Earth Resources (POLDER) data acquired over India. After correcting the data for atmospheric effects, a semi-empirical bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model has been fitted to the data to extract angularly normalized target reflectances. It is shown that atmospheric corrections and angular normalization are important in the quantitative analysis of NDVI and its temporal variations

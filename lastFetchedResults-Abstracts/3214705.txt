The presented MISO radar was developed for detection and tracking of threat missiles as one of sensors used in an active defense system. This way of protection of military vehicles is based on detection of approaching missiles and activation of suitable counter-measures. The objective MISO radar is supposed to be the first sensor, which detects the missile in a medium distance from the protected vehicle. Its main purpose is to find the missile, measure its velocity, monitor its trajectory and estimate the most probable point of impact. The realized test sample operates at 11 GHz and transmits 20 dBm of a CW power. It employs one transmitting channel and 4 receiving channels with a direct coherent conversion to a baseband. The applied signal-processing method is focused on calculating the direction-of-arrival (DOA), which is important for the required tracking capabilities. The presented measured results show that the designed radar meets the above stated requirements.

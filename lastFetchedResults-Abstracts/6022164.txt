This paper presents a study that combines LDM (Layer Division Multiplexing) and SHVC (Scalable High Efficiency Video Coding) techniques to offer HD/UHD TV services in indoor scenarios. First, a theoretical study of the optimal configuration parameters for the LDM signal (such as constellation, code-rate and injection level) for indoor reception will be presented. Next, the results of some laboratory measurements for testing the performance in indoor scenarios will be included. For this purpose, TU6, PI, IOA and IOB channel models will be considered, being the main objective to determine the minimum receiving signal to noise ratios (SNR). These results will be useful for broadcasters for planning purposes.

Study objective: To evaluate the potential anticonvulsant effects of Adenocard in theophylline-induced seizures, we developed a rodent model of theophylline neurotoxicity with resultant convulsions. We used this model to investigate the actions of intracerebroventricular (ICV) Adenocard on seizure onset. Participants: Male Sprague-Dawley rats. Interventions:  Surgical cannulation of the jugular veins of the rats was followed by stereotaxic placement of a catheter in the right lateral ventricle. The rats then received 15 μg (5 μL) ICV Adenocard or an equivalent. Ten seconds later, continuous infusion of IV aminophylline was begun at a rate of 75 mg/minute until the appearance of generalized convulsions with maximal hindlimb extension. Results:  Compared with vehicle-injected controls, rats that received ICV Adenocard had a significant delay in mean time to seizure (162.1 seconds versus 107.4 seconds; P<.001). There was a corresponding increase in the weight-adjusted convulsant dose of aminophylline after the ICV administration of Adenocard (311.4 mg/kg versus 470.4 mg/kg; P<.003). Conclusion:  Our data indicate that ICV Adenocard ameliorates theophylline-induced seizures. Potential anticonvulsant benefits of Adenocard and other adenosinergic compounds for victims of severe theophylline poisoning should be investigated further.

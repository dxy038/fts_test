Objective:The major aim of this study was evaluating the factorial structure and 
psychometric properties of the academic Burnout scale by Berso, Salanova&Schaufeli 
(2007) in an Iranian population. Method:358 students of Kerman city (197 girls, 161 boys) 
who were from first to third grade, had selected using Cluster method sampling, completed 
Academic Burnout scale. Construct validity, convergent validity and internal consistency of 
Academic Burnout Scale were calculated using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), 
pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and cronbach alpha. Results:Goodness of 
fit confirmatory Factor analysis confirmed three factors. Also, the multidimensional scales 
of academic Burnout scale were shown to be an acceptable measurement model in this 
sample.So, Academic Burnout scale’s three factor model (exhaustion, cynicism and 
inefficacy) by confirmatory factor analysis was supported. Also, the correlation coefficients 
between academic Burnout subscales were positive and significant, this is indicating the 
convergent validity of questionnaire. For examining the internal consistency, alpha 
coefficients were 0.87 for total academic Burnout scale, 0.70 for emotional exhaustion 
subscale, 0.69 for Cynicism subscale and 0.73 for inefficacy subscale. Conclusion:The 
result of examining psychometric characteristics of “The academic Burnout scale” 
indicated that this questionnaire is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring academic 
Burnout of Iranian students.

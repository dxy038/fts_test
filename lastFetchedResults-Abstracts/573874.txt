For performance optimization of irrigation canals a suitable combination of indicators must be chosen and optimized in an objective function using an optimization method. But the main problem is choosing appropriate indicators and the lack of a standard method to determine their relative values. The main aim of this research is assessing a proposed method to value indicators in their combination in an objective function in optimization process of irrigation canal performance. For demonstration the capability of ICSSDOM and proposed method, the model was applied on E1L4 of Distributaries' canal of Dez irrigation network. In ICSSDOM, SA (Simulated Annealing) technique is used in a combination with a hydrodynamic model (ICSS). In this research, the most appropriate weighting coefficients of indicators were appointed for performance optimization of irrigation canals using a logical approach which is independent of any professional judgment. According to the results while the weighting coefficient of indicator is considered as a direct proportion of difference between ideal and present performance ( ), the improvement percent is better than the other conditions. The other important aim in this research is assessing performance of irrigation canals according to different periods of operation (6hours, 8hours, 12hours and 24hours). The results showed that the eight-hour period of operation leads to the more performance improvement. In addition to, above mentioned results, a suitable composition of SA parameters was determined.

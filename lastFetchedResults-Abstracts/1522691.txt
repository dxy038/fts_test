Purpose: Albinism is a genetic disorder that affects melanin synthesis of the human being.  Although not very common, it has serious effects on the visual system, particularly reduced visual acuity. The pattern visual evoked potential is a reliable objective technique for diagnosing the latent and misrouting of this condition. The aim of this study was to use and evaluate the importance and accuracy of a single channel PVEP instead of common multichannel PVEP for detecting asymmetric responses between the latent and misrouting albinism and control group.
Methods: In this cross sectional study, the pattern visual evoked potentials were measured using 60 min/arc check sizes with temporal frequency of 3 Hz in twenty four suspected albino people ages of 5 to 43 years (mean age of 19 years). Amplitude and latencies time were measured for both the right and left eبله, and then the results were compared with a age- and gender matched, normal group.
Results: The latency waves of N75, P100, N135 and P1N1 (N75-P100) amplitude between two eyes of the albino people showed a statistically significant difference. The asymmetric responses of PVEP between two eyes of the albino people were significantly larger than than control group.
Conclusion: There is a strong relation between asymmetric responses of single channel PVEP and other clinical signs of albinism, which make this method as a useful objective technique for diagnosing the latent albinism.

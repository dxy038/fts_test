Healthcare services are changing. One of the change drivers is the inclusion of individuals (patients) into health service delivery with the objective of proactively addressing health problems as early as possible. Another change driver is information technology, which enables new improved health services and also new ways of organizing and delivering these. The established relations between stakeholders are the major barrier in making the change towards a health continuum environment.

Despite the availability of detailed data for describing cities, there is a shortage of tools that enable standardized analyses of urban areas, and the associated resource consumption. The objective of this research is to contribute to the development of a standardized method for analysis, so that material and energy consumption can be quantified. Analyzing the resource consumption of the built environment is particularly relevant in cities that are rapidly growing, as short-term planning decisions will have long-term consequences for both the quality of life of the inhabitants, and the future energy and material use of the urban area.

A novel target pseudo-color image fusion algorithm for visual and infrared images is proposed in this paper based on image features in wavelet domain. After wavelet decomposed from source images, edge features are extracted from each low frequency component. The fusion rules are defined by the edge information, using local modulus maximum rule for edge pixels and its sub-band neighboring pixels, and weighted mean coefficient rule for non-edge pixels. The interested targets are extracted respectively by threshold segmentation method for infrared image and moving targets detection method for motion image sequences. Fusion result is mapped into local pseudo-color image in HSV color space, in order to highlight infrared hot targets and moving targets. The simulation experiments show that the fusion image has good visual effect, and also has good performance on the objective evaluation and anti-noise ability.

The goal of this paper is to present a novel chaotic particle swarm optimization (CPSO)
algorithm and compares the efficiency of three one-dimensional chaotic maps within symmetrical
region for long-term cascaded hydroelectric system scheduling. The introduced
chaotic maps improve the global optimal capability of CPSO algorithm. Moreover, a piecewise
linear interpolation function is employed to transform all constraints into restrict
upriver water level for implementing the maximum of objective function. Numerical
results and comparisons demonstrate the effect and speed of different algorithms on a
practical hydro-system.

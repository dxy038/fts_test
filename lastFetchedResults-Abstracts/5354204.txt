FlexRay is a popular communication protocol in modern automotive systems with several computation nodes and communication units. The complex temporal behavior of such systems depends highly on the FlexRay configuration and influences the performance of running control applications. In our previous work, we presented a design framework for integrated scheduling and design of embedded control applications, where control quality is the optimization objective. This paper presents our extension to the design framework to handle FlexRay-based embedded control systems. Our contribution is a method for the decision of FlexRay parameters and optimization of control quality.

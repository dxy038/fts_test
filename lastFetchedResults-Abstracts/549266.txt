Objective
Epilepsy occurs in 12 % to 90 % of children with cerebral palsy (CP). However 
its clinical course is not well defined. This investigation was undertaken to study 
and determine the characteristics and prevalence of epilepsy in children with 
cerebral palsy.
Materials & Methods
Of 133 children with cerebral palsy, seen between 1998 and 2001, in the 
pediatric neurology clinic of the Imam Reza hospital, fifty-three had epilepsy. 
During the same period, a group of 70 epileptic children with normal 
neurodevelopmental status was studied as the controls.
Results
Patients with spastic quadriplegia were the most commonly affected with 
epilepsy. When compared with the control group, children with CP had a 
higher incidence of epilepsy with onset within the first year of age (52.8% 
vs. 18.5%), history of neonatal seizures (20.7% vs. 4.2%), and poly therapy 
(73.6% vs. 29.1%) respectively.
Conclusion
Epilepsy is common in children with CP and can be predicted if seizures 
occur in the first year of life ,in the neonatal period and based on the need for 
polytherapy.

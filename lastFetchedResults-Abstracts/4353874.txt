In this paper, an application of fuzzy logic to the well-known Boothroyd-Dewhurst´s Design For Assembly methodology is introduced. The main objective is to compute the assembly efficiency of a product from boundary representation geometric models and a minimal technological database. The use of a fuzzy decision support system involves the representation of this method by fuzzy sets. Each part of a product has to undergo computation of its handling and insertion efficiencies. This evaluation process depends on geometric and technological criteria. The designer may experience difficulties in making a choice when there are several adequate solutions for every part. This paper demonstrates that a decision support system approach significantly improves the Boothroyd-Dewhusrt´s methodology.

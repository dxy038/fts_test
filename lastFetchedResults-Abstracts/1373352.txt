Background&Objective: The ways of prevention of wound infections are too much, and some references mentioned that one of those ways is dressing. Dressing can cause a sort of spiritual transquility for patients, too. In the other side, doing it causes some kinds of limitations such as preventing of taking a bath or spending expenses. So, we decided to consider the influence of continuation of dressing, on the rate of wound infection, after first 48 hours post operation.

Materials&Methods: In this research, we studied on 150 patients who were under the same surgeries, So that in the half of them, after 48 hours dressing were removed, and in the half remaining, dressing were changed daily for one week. In both groups, in the third, seventh and thirtieth day after surgery were inspected and examined by surgeon, in the case for having or absence of symptoms and signs of infection. In subgrouping patients we considered some factors include age, sex, type of operation and predisposing diseases. The 30 th day post operation was the end of our study and information analyzed in the computer with SPSS software.

Results: The average age in the group of without dressing was 35.12±20.19 and in the group with full dressing was 37.61±18.78 years. There were 74 men and 76 women. There was Just one wound infection in our study, who had dressing for one week. The case was woman without serious disease, and a half day before surgery was admitted in the hospital. In the group without dressing, we did not have any wound infection. 5.3% were nervous in the no dressing group and the 17.3% of patients with dressing were anxious of having their bath with delay.

Conclusion: According to the no impression of dressing on the rate of wound infection in the clean surgeries after first two days  and also lack of considerable anxiety in the non dressing group, we recommend picking up the clean wounds dressing after 48 hours and make patients feel guaranteed.

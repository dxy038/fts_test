An asymmetrically truncated non-tracking compound parabolic concentrator type collector design concept has been
developed. The collector type has a bi-facial absorber and is optimised for northern latitudes. The concept is based on a
general reflector form that is truncated to fit different installation conditions. In this paper collectors for stand-alone,
roof and wall mounting are studied. Prototypes of six different collectors have been built and outdoor tested. The evaluation
gave high annual energy outputs for a roof mounted collector, 925MJ/m 2, and a stand-alone collector with Teflon,
781 MJ/m2, at an operating temperature of Top = 75  C. A special design for roofs facing east or west was also
investigated and gave an annual energy output of 349 (east) and 436 (west) MJ/m2 at Top = 75  C. If a high solar fraction
over the year is the objective, a load adapted collector with a high output during spring/fall and a low output during
summer can be used. Such a collector had an output of 490 MJ/m2 at Top = 75  C. Finally a concentrating collector
for wall mounting was evaluated with an estimated annual output of 194 MJ/m2 at Top = 75  C. The concentrator
design concept can also be used for concentrators for PV-modules.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine whether postcesarean section administration of ketorolac tromethamine reduces pain and narcotic usage.
Study design
A double-blinded randomized, placebo-controlled trial of ketorolac tromethamine was performed. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either ketorolac tromethamine or placebo. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) was used for pain control. Visual analog scales (VAS) were administered postoperatively to assess pain levels. Morphine equivalents and attempts were recorded.
Results
There were 22 patients in each arm of the study. There was no significant difference between patient demographics, blood loss, and type of anesthesia. Pain scores were significantly different at 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours by analysis of variance (ANOVA) (P = .033). There was a significant decrease in pain medication usage (P = .008) in the study group.
Conclusion
Ketorolac tromethamine is efficacious in reducing postoperative pain and narcotics usage after cesarean section.

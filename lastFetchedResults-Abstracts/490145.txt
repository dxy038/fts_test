Introduction: Tumor development is identified by an imbalance between proliferation and apoptosis. The mutation of suppressor genes such as P53 and overexpression of C-erb-B2 as an oncogene are important factors in carcinogenesis. The overexpression of ki67 has been demonstrated in different tumors. Our knowledge about C-erb-B2 and its correlation with cellular proliferation in oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) has not been elucidated.
Objective: The aim of study was the comparison of Ki67, P53 and C-erb-B2 immunoreactivity in well - differentiated SCC of tongue.
Materials & Methods: This study was a descriptive. Five sections of well differentiated SCC were prepared and stained by immunohistochemical (IHC) method. IHC slides were examined for Ki67, P53 and C-erb-B2 for positive staining by counting positive cells per 1000 epithelial cells; labeling indexes (LI) were calculated and LI means were achieved. The correlation test was used to compare the results.
Results: The mean numbers of Ki67, P53 and C-erb-B2 positive cells were 399.4±42.97, 221.4±330.32 and 26.8±27.22, respectively. The correlation test was shown the positive correlation between Ki67 and P53 (p<0.02, r=91.5%). There was not any positive correlation between Ki67 and C-erb- B2 (pcO.97, r= -1.7%) and also P53 and C-erb-B2 (p<0.8, r= -13%).
Conclusion: Immunoreactivities of P53, ki67 and C-erb-B2 were positive in tongue well-differentiated SCC. The positive correlation was seen between P53 and ki67 expression.

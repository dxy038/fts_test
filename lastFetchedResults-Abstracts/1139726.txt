Our objective was to optimize the osmotic dehydration of the cantaloupe using the desired function methodology. Cantaloupe cylinders were cut and weighted, initial humidity and °Brix were measured, then four cylinders were osmo-dehydrated in solutions of sucrose of give concentration and temperature by a stipulated time. The conditions of dehydration were established by means of a central rotable composite design for temperatures, concentrations and times between 40–50 °C, 45–55 °Brix and 60–120 min, respectively. Weight, humidity and °Brix were determined in each cylinder after each dehydration in order to calculate the mass loss, water loss and °Brix increase. These response variables were fitted to predictive models applying multiple linear regressions. Applying the method of the desired function, the dehydration was optimized in 37.95 °C, 41.6 °Brix and 132.30 min in order to obtain weight loss equal to 0.11 g/g, water loss equal to 0.33 g/g and °Brix increase equal to 12.3 °Brix/g.

The objective of the presented work was to introduce the principles of direct field control into magnetic measurements. Different grades of nonoriented and grain-oriented steels were tested in dc magnetization regime. A vertical array of three Hall sensors was used to control the sample field. With small gradients of the sample surface field our results showed comparable measurement errors with the single sheet tester. Measurement of the hysteresis loss and the coercive force was mostly independent of the field determination method. However, for accurate estimation of the magnetic induction parameters the sample field should be determined directly. No unique dependence was found between the measured dc and 50 Hz Epstein/single sheet tester parameters except the remanent induction of the nonoriented steels.

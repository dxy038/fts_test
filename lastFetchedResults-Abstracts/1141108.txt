This study has extended a vehicle routing problem, with time-windows (VRPTW), by considering the randomness of the perishable food delivery process, and constructing a SVRPTW model, to obtain optimal delivery routes, loads, fleet dispatching and departure times for delivering perishable food from a distribution center. Our objective was to minimize not only the fixed costs for dispatching vehicles, but also the transportation, inventory, energy and penalty costs for violating time-windows. We also discussed time-dependent travel and time-varying temperatures, during the day, modifying the objective functions as well as the constraints in the above mathematical programming models. Algorithms were developed to solve the proposed models; results indicated that inventory and energy costs can significantly influence total delivery costs. It was found that our proposed models yielded better results than the traditional VRPTW models.

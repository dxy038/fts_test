The dynamics associated with the thrust vector control system of the launch vehicle is investigated. The objective of the thrust vector control system is to position the thrust vector to some commanded position. The thrust vector control system is the major source of nonlinearity in the flight control system. The modeling and simulation analysis of the TVC system of a sample engine are presented. Using this modeling method, the preliminary design of TVC system for the 75tf thrust engine is conducted. From the simulation analysis of TVC model for the 75tf thrust engine, the nonlinear response, the stability analysis and the bandwidth of the TVC system are presented.

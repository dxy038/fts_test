The ultimate objective in the design of radiotelephone apparatus for use on ships is to provide equipment which is as convenient and simple to operate as the telephone at home. To a considerable degree this has been accomplished in the new 15- and 50-watt ship sets that have recently been designed for use on harbor craft and coastwise vessels. The requirements for sets of this type are discussed and the new equipment is described in this paper.

Distributed generations (DGs) as well as they being integrated into distribution network have attracted more and more domestic and overseas scholars\Â´ interesting. The introduction of distributed generation has great impact on power loss and voltage distribution of the grid, because load flow is changed. Aimed at "Two-way" load flow caused by grid-connected DGs and intermittent output produced by renewable energy generation, and considered more constraint conditions, such as DG model, integration mode, allowed capacity, operational reliability, take minimal loss as optimal goal to construct objective function used to optimize integration configuration of DG and its operation. With information technology deeply applying in power grid, use collecting information of distribution grid and power utilization to modify energy loss model of distribution grid contained DG by means of parameter identification, which can improve precision of the model as well as loss calculation. Finally, select typical distribution system, combine concrete cases to verify correctness of previous theoretical research findings. The research work can help to develop technologies of reducing energy loss, and it also provides strong technical support for better completing the national energy saving tasks undertook by power industry.

We study an approach for sharing channels to improve network utilization in packet-switched cellular networks. This scheme exploits unused resources in neighboring cells without the need for global coordination. We formulate a minimax approach to optimizing the allocation of channels in this sharing scheme. We develop a distributed algorithm to achieve this objective and study its convergence. We illustrate, via simulation results, that the distributed channel sharing scheme performs better than the fixed channel scheme over a wide variety of traffic conditions

A novel preventive control approach based on a newly enhanced particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is proposed for improving the dynamic voltage security of a power system. The proposed approach can be applied to handle both continuous and discrete control variables. The aim of the optimal coordinated preventive control is to optimise the terminal voltage, output power of each generator and the tap position of each on-load tap changer so as to keep the voltage secure along the trajectory of a quasi-steady-state time-domain simulation when credible contingency such as tripping of generation facility or transmission line occurs. The voltage performance is assessed via a heuristic integration of the voltage deviations of selected load buses and the optimal coordinated preventive control is formulated as a multi-objective non-linear optimisation problem solved by an enhanced PSO. A case study on the Nordic 32 test system shows that the proposed approach is capable of providing high-quality solutions when dealing with dynamic voltage security control problems.

The objective of this paper is to assess the use of ALOS PALSAR FBD data to map rice growing areas. Image enhancement in backscattering in rice fields as a result of Bragg resonance scattering was found only at HH polarization since double-bounce scattering is a prerequisite to Bragg resonance scattering for radar backscatter from bunches of rice plants. A rice mapping method using HV images was developed and applied to Haian test site. Validation showed that rice mapping using L-band SAR is promising when cross-polarized data are available to cope with the Bragg resonance scattering effects.

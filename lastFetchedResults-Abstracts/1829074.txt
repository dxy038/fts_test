Our previous studies indicated a direct correlation with loss of CIAPIN1 and carcinogenesis of tumor in human gastric cancer. Here we presented that the expression of CIAPIN1 was absent or significantly decreased in 102 cases of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) tissues (P &lt; 0.05). Up-regulating CIAPIN1 by adenoviral vectors exhibited significant inhibition of CCRCC-derived cell growth in vitro and in vivo with G1 cell cycle arrest. Simultaneously, CIAPIN1-induced growth suppression was found partially to regulate various proteins, including inhibition of cyclinD1, cyclinE, cdk2, cdk4, p-Rb and VEGF, but up-regulation of p27Kip1 and Rb.

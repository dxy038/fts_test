The study objective was to generate biocompatible probes and develop a stable macromolecule imaging system that are based on nanolipopolymersomes and can be used in living cells. We synthesized nanolipopolymersomes with a fluorescent polymer wall surrounded by an outer phospholipid shell that exhibits potential for the controlled delivery of diagnostic agents to cells. We describe a new type of probe suitable for dual detection methods (spectrophotometric and fluorescence). This aspect makes it unique among currently available probes because allows it to be detected with greater accuracy. We developed a highly fluorescent coumarinated polymer to overcome the limited brightness of conventional dyes with insufficient for long-term photostablility. Hydrophilic dyes (Lucifer yellow, Procion red, Procion blue) are entrapped in the aqueous core of stable polymeric nanocapsules with coumarin 6 embedded in a nanometre-thick poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) wall. Target compounds can be incorporated into nanocapsules in a single step. The hydrophilic phospholipids outer shell ensures biocompatibility and facilitates cell penetration. In this way, the novel fluorescent hybrid materials can help of nanotechnology.

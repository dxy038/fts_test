Background and Objective: Several investigations have shown positive effects of microcurrent electrical current on fracture healing. In this study, the effects of microcurrent (microampere) on the full thickness incisional would healing of rabbits were evaluated by histological and tensiometerical methods.
Materials and Methods: Thirty male adult rabbits were randomly divided into control and experimental groups. Each group divided into 3 subgroups, based on duration of study (4,7,15 days). Under general anesthesia and sterile conditions, one full thickness incision on skin of each rabbit was made. From the day of surgery, the experimental group received electrotherapy daily for 2 hours (current intensity: 200miuA/cm^2 , current density: 66miuA/cm^2 , frequency 0.5 Hz). Polarity was negative at first 3 days and was positive thereafter. At the end, rabbits were killed by choloroform and 2 samples were obtained from the wound tissue and the adjacent normal skin for histologic and tensiometeric studies. Number of neurtophils and fibroblasts and cross sections of vessels were counted. Data were analysed using student t test.
Results: The number of fibroblasts on seventh day (862.6±70.1) was significantly higher (P<0.05) than control group (468±2+59). Tensile strength of experimental group at fifteenth day (2138.2±212) was significantly higher than relevant control group (1443.1±218.8). Conclusion: Daily application of microcurrent electrical current significantly accelerated wound healing process of incisional wound of skin of rabbits.

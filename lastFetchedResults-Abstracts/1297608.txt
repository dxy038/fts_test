We address a multi-objective version of the car sequencing problem, which consists in sequencing a given set of cars to be produced in a single day, minimizing the number of violations of assembly constraints and the number of paint color changes in the production line. We propose a set of heuristics for approximately solving this problem, based on the paradigms of the VNS and ILS metaheuristics, to which further intensification and diversification strategies have been added. Computational results on real-life test instances are reported. The work presented in this paper obtained the second prize in the ROADEF challenge 2005 sponsored by Renault.

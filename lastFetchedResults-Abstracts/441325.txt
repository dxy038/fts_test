Background. The objective of this study was to evaluate long-term survival, valve-related complications as well as prognostic factors for early and late outcome after open and closed mitral commissurotomy covering a follow-up period of 35 years.
Methods. From 1955 to 1977, 183 patients with mitral stenosis underwent mitral commissurotomy at our institution. Closed valvotomy was performed on 143 patients (group A) and open valvotomy on 40 patients (group B).
Results. Survival rates after 10, 20, and 30 years were 89%, 67.8%, and 49.1% in group A and 91.7%, 66.7%, and 45.9% in group B (p = not significant). The risk of late death increased significantly with an advanced preoperative New York Heart Association functional class, atrial fibrillation, higher age at operation, pre- or postoperative mitral regurgitation, and leaflet calcification. Forty-four patients in group A and 5 patients in group B required reoperation (p< 0.05). Independent predictors for reoperation in a multivariate analysis were a remaining postoperative mitral stenosis or regurgitation. A total of 68 patients showed valve-related complications. The linearized rate of valve-related morbidity and mortality was 2.1% per patient-years in group A versus 1.1% per patient-years in B (p< 0.01).
Conclusions. Long-term survival for open and closed commissurotomy are excellent, showing no difference between the groups. However, both the incidence of reoperation as well as valve-related morbidity and mortality were significantly lower after open commissurotomy. In well-selected patients with pure mitral stenosis and no leaflet calcification, open commissurotomy still remains a valid surgical option.

Tracheal tuberculosis is an uncommon localized form of tuberculosis with fewer than 150 reported cases in the literature. We report a case of tracheal stenosis caused by tuberculosis in which the diagnosis was suggested by the patientâ€™s past medical history. This patient was successfully treated with tracheal resection, adjuvant steroids and anti-tuberculous therapy. This report will review the various types of tuberculosis of the trachea and their clinical features in addition to discussing the different available treatment modalities.

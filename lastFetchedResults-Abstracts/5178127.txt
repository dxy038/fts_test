A genetic algorithm (GA) based redundant ring topology optimization algorithm is developed to improve the real-time and reliability performance of an IEEE 802.11 based industrial wireless network. The topology design is considered as multi-objective optimization problem, which should minimize the aggregate inner-subnet transmission burden, and balance inner-subnet transmission burden evenly.

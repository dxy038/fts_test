The objective of the experimental work is to study the influence of Fly ash mixed with lime having varying percentage of hair fibres on California Bearing Ratio values. The randomly oriented hair fibres were, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00 and 2.50% of cement by weight respectively.
Thermal power plants generated different types of Fly ash. Fly ash is the most abundant of all the residues and its disposal not only needs enormous land, water and power resources but it also causes serious environmental hazards. In India about 82 such Power Plants produce nearly 106 million tons of Fly ash per year [1] and the Figure is likely to soar. This alarming increase in the production of Fly ash and its disposal in ecologically suitable manners has lately become a global concern. Efforts are being made to increase the use of Fly ash in every possible way.
In this struggle scientists and engineers especially civil engineers are playing a remarkable role. A number of studies have been carried out to determine the influence of fibres on the physical properties of soil and Fly ash with and without Lime. However, no study has been
found so far in the literature to investigate the effect of randomly oriented hair fibres on Fly ash mixed with lime. In this paper, results of an experimental study have been presented to determine the effect of randomly oriented Hair fibres in Fly ash and lime on the value of
California Bearing Ratio and found encoraging.

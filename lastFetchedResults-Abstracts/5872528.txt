In this paper, a novel multi-objective bees algorithm (MOBA) is used for the optimal allocation of FACTS devices in restructured power system. To enhance the available transfer capability (ATC) of power transactions between source and sink areas and minimizing the overall system cost function, which comprises of the investments costs of FACTS devices and generation cost the problem is formulated as multi-objective optimization. Three types of FACTS are simulated in this study namely thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC), static var compensator (SVC) and thyristor controlled phase shift transformer (TCPST). An IEEE30 bus system is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm as an optimization tool. A non-dominated sorting GA-II technique configured to the same purpose is used for validation purposes. The results obtained are encouraging.

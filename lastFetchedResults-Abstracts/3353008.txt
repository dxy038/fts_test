In this paper, a new extraction method of information for quantification of the fingertip sense which is never extracted by previous tactile sensors is reported for the first time. The MEMS two-axis tactile sensor used for the purpose can get the correlation between the surface shape and the local frictional force at the same time and at the same point. Obtained correlative relationships using the device were carefully analyzed with statistical analysis and FFT, and various objective facts have been made clear. For example, the rougher the feel texture of a paper surface, the lower the mutual relation between the time-domain waveform of surface micro roughness and the corresponding instantaneous frictional force. This is an example of never known knowledge about surface feel of touch, and a lot of information to quantify the sense of touch has been extracted using the novel MEMS tactile sensor in this study.

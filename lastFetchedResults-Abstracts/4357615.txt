Improvising student´s consistent learning becomes a challenge. In order to improve the learning activities among controlled group of engineering students, a customized instructional intervention was provided using MOODLE educational software. However, many students scored `below average´ in learning performance assessments. This gave the conclusion that mere usage of technology, pedagogy and content knowledge alone doesn´t improve the students´ learning skill. Hence, the psychological aspect of an individual learner was considered. In this research work, an attempt has been made to identify learners thinking and learning styles in order to map an appropriate learning technology. The overall objective of our hypothesis is to explore the relationship between thinking and learning style.

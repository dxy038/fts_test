For establishing the city post-disaster emergency rescue shelter mechanism, the multi-objective programming is namely adopted for stationing and the emergency rescue shelter venues are prepared to arrange for fleeing victims. The present status and the progress of the traditional risk study are summarized, and then the multi-objective programming of distribution is used to in order to analysis the urban shelter optimally. The multi-objective approach is introduced to study the problems of the escape of evacuation stadium disaster, and then a multi-objective programming model is changed into an integer programming model to complete the stationing issues of post-disaster hedge places. The post-disaster hedge places entity optimization model is established by legitimately using multi-objective programming method, and the four targets, minimization shelter points for escaping, the minimization cost of investment, the maximization numbers of escape refugees and the fastest rate of escaping (the shortest time for arriving at escaping asylum points), are selected out to makes the distribution achieve the desired goals. And then an example is investigated to verify the feasibility of this method.

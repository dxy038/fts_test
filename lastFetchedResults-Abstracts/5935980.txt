Trust and reliability of information is a very critical issue of todayÂ´s information age. Keeping provenance of data not only ensures us about its origination but it also keeps track of all the changes that happen to the data through out its life cycle. In this paper we have discussed the importance of data provenance, difference between Where &amp; Why Provenance and different models for keeping such information. The objective of this study is to select a provenance model which can be implemented in scientific environment of our country. For this purpose we have taken the annotation model and have applied it on the pathological laboratories so as to experience the usefulness and practicality of this concept.

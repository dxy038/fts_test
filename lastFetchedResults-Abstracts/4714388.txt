In this paper a new and efficient hybrid optimization algorithm is proposed for optimal placement and sizing of the Distributed Generations (DGs). Bus voltage profile improvement, line flow capacity, active and reactive power loss minimization are considered as multi-objectives to optimize under various distribution load conditions. Renewable energy resources such as wind, solar, fuel cell and micro turbines are considered in power system modeling for finding the optimal placement and sizing. Current injection based distribution load flow is considered in DGs modeling in power systems. To optimize the objective function, a new optimization technique called Shuffled Bat algorithm (ShBAT) is proposed. The proposed methodology is tested on 84-bus Taiwan power company distribution systems with 90%, 100% and 120% of base load conditions to demonstrate its performance and effectiveness. Results show that the planned methodology is superior to existing strategies in terms of multi-objectives considered.

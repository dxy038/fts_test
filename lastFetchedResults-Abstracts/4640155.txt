This paper presents both formal as well as practical well-definedness conditions for kinematic metric functions. To formulate these conditions, we introduce an intrinsic definition of a rigid bodyÂ´s configuration space. Based on this definition, the principle of objectivity is introduced to derive a formal condition for well-definedness of kinematic metric functions, as well as to gain physical insight into left, right and bi-invariances on the Lie group SE(3). We then relate the abstract notion of objectivity to the more intuitive notion of frame-invariance, and show that frame-invariance can be used as a practical condition for determining objective functions. Examples demonstrate the utility of objectivity and frame-invariance

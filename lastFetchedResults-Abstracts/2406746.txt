Objective
Biotin is a coenzyme composed of four carboxylases. It presents in amino acid
catabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and gluconeogenesis. Biotinidase recycles
the vitamin biotin. A biotinidase deficiency is a neurocutaneous disorder with
autosomal recessive inheritance. The symptoms can be successfully treated
or prevented by administering pharmacological doses of biotin. Although,
according to neonatal prenatal medicine (2011), a biotinidase deficiency does
not manifest during the neonatal period. In this study, we report on a case of
biotinidase deficiency in the first week of birth.
Case Report
A 3100 g term boy was born via cesarean section. After 3 days, he was referred to
the 17th Shahrivar Hospital with the chief complaint of tachypnea and grunting.
Laboratory results revealed that liver and renal function tests, serum electrolytes,
and blood indexes except ammonia were all normal. Within few days after the
administration of oral biotin, the patient showed dramatic improvement and was
discharged. However, within 4 months he was admitted two other times with
the complaints of diarrhea and pneumonia. Unfortunately, he expired after 4
months.
According to our results, it seems that clinicians should accurately assess
suspicious patients and even assess infants for biotinidase deficiency.

The use of Electrochemical Machining (ECM) as one of the best machining techniques for machining and electrically conducting tough and difficult to machine materials with appropriate machining parameters. The present study concentrates on optimizing the machining parameters for ECM considering current, voltage, Electrolyte concentration and feed rate as machining parameters and Metal Removal Rate (MRR) and Surface Roughness (SR). Grey relational analysis is applied to find the Grey Grade and it is used to represent the multi-objective model. Multiple regression model and Differential Evolution model are developed to map the relationship between process parameters and objectives in terms of grade. The percentage deviation is calculated for each model. From the analysis it is noticed that the Differential Evolution (DE) model is the best model and the machining parameters are optimized using Differential Evolution Algorithm.

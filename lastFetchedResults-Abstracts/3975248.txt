The author discusses two Bachelor Engineering degree projects in the field of radioastronomy. The first is the design, construction and, hopefully, the operation of a radio telescope to receive signals from the Sun. The other is a similar exercise where the objective is to detect solar flares by an indirect radio method. Both topics are too extensive for any one student to tackle successfully in the time available. The requirement that each of them work on an individual project would be satisfied easily by the multidisciplinary nature of the topics. No two students would work on the same problem. However, all the hardware and software they produced would have to interface with the other elements of the system developed by their colleagues

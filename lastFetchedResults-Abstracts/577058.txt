The objective of this study was to assess fillet yield, proximate composition and mineral contents of the Indian spiny halibut (Psettodes erumei) during different seasons. Fish samples (female = 100 and male = 100) were caught from the coastal waters of Bushehr province and body weight and length were taken to predict fillet weight and yield. Large differences in the fillet yield were observed between seasons. The highest fillet yield (49.4%) was obtained in the samples collected in autumn while samples collected in spring had the lowest yield (42.1%). There was a linear relationship between fish length and fillet weight while no significant correlation was found between fillet yield and body measurements (weight and length). The fat content of Indian spiny halibut was  <  1.2% throughout the sampling period. Based on the results, fish collected in all seasons except spring for fillets may lead to a higher production with no significant difference between two sexes.

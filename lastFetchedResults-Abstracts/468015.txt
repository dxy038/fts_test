OBJECTIVE: The study determined the expression of oxytocin receptor and its gene in human uterine leiomyoma compared with the adjacent myometrium.
STUDY DESIGN: Paired samples of leiomyoma and the adjacent myometrium from 20 women through the menstrual cycle, menopause, and various hormone treatments were studied. Oxytocin receptor was immunohistochemically localized with use of the specific antibody (2F8) to human oxytocin receptor. Oxytocin receptor protein was determined by Western blotting, whereas reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction was used for oxytocin receptor messenger ribonucleic acid expression.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining in all tissues examined, relatively more intense in the myometrium than in the adjacent leiomyoma, and in tissues from the preovulatory than the postovulatory phase. Western blotting showed a single 70-kd band corresponding to the oxytocin receptor. The relative abundance of oxytocin receptor in both leiomyoma and myometrium was significantly higher during the preovulatory (n = 5) than the postovulatory (n = 5) phase (P = .034 and .05). In women receiving gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (n = 1) or oral contraceptives (n = 1), after the menopause (n = 2), and with irregular vaginal bleeding (n = 1), oxytocin receptor levels in leiomyoma and myometrium were unchanged but were reduced in anovulatory cycles (amenorrhea, n = 2). Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction showed messenger ribonucleic acid for oxytocin receptor as a 391-bp band in all leiomyomas and myometrium examined.
CONCLUSIONS: Leiomyoma and myometrium express the gene and protein for oxytocin receptor, which is probably partially regulated by ovarian sex steroids during the menstrual cycle. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:620-7.)

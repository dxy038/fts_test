Investigation of the effect of atmospheric constituents on NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) visible and near-infrared data is presented. The general remote sensing equation, including scattering, absorption, and bidirectional reflectance effects for the AVHRR solar bands, is described. The magnitude of the atmospheric effects for AVHRR solar bands with respect to their impact on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the surface bidirection reflectance is examined. Possible approaches for acquiring atmospheric information are discussed, and examples of atmospheric correction of surface reflectance and NDVI are given. Invariant effects (ozone absorption and molecular scattering) and variant effects (water vapor absorption and aerosol scattering) are shown to dominate the atmospheric effects in the AVHRR solar bands

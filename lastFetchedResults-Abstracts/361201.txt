Study objective: Carbon monoxide (CO) is the leading cause of poisoning fatalities in the United States. We conducted a survey to sample the quality of the information available to the public from Connecticut heating oil distributors regarding these risks. Methods: An observational, cross-sectional telephone survey of oil distributors in Connecticut was conducted, using a scripted set of questions regarding CO poisoning risk from oil-burning furnaces. We first asked whether such a risk existed and then elicited explanations for confirmation or denial of that risk. We then inquired as to the proper response to a home CO detector alarm. Of 282 calls made, responses were obtained from 91 distributors. Reasons for lack of response included incorrect phone listings, duplicate listings, and unwillingness of the person answering to respond to the questions asked. Results:  Nearly one fourth of distributors responding (23%) denied any risk of CO poisoning from oil burners, 43% of these claiming that the odor would provide protective warning before toxic exposure; another 33% stated that CO is a risk only with gas heaters. Of the 77% who confirmed the possibility of CO toxicity, half (49%) minimized the risk, also invoking a “warning odor.” In case of CO alarm, only 14% of responders recommended turning off the furnace until the source is found. Five percent did not recommend having ambient CO levels checked at the time of the alarm. Conclusion: Heating oil companies in Connecticut do not uniformly provide correct information regarding CO risks. In our survey a majority of distributors responding offered misplaced “reassurance.” As such, they are a potential area for public health intervention and an untapped resource for educating the public on these risks.

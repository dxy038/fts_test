Multi-criteria optimization of processes parameters could be used to
simultaneously achieve several con
icting goals such as increasing product quality and
reducing production time. In this paper, Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) and Taguchi
method have been employed to optimize Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) process
parameters for AISI 2312 (40CrMnMoS86) hot worked steel alloy. The experimental data
are gathered based on Taguchi L36 design matrix. The tests are conducted under varying
peak current (I), voltage (V ), pulse on time (Ton), pulse o time (To) and duty factor
(). The process output characteristics include Surface Roughness (SR), Tool Wear Rate
(TWR) and Material Removal Rate (MRR). The objective is to nd a combination of
process parameters to minimize TWR and SR and maximize MRR. The three performance
characteristics are combined into a single objective using grey relational analysis. The GRA
was followed by the signal to noise ratio to specify the optimal levels of process parameters.
The signicance of the process parameters on the overall quality characteristics of the EDM
process was also evaluated quantitatively using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) method.
Optimal results were veried through additional experiments

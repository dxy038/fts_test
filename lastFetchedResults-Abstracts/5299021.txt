Three dimensional (3D) packaging and interconnecting techniques can greatly reduce the weight and volume of conventional planar microwave modules. The objective of this study was to employ a novel 3D structure with simple manufacturing process to develop 3D microwave modules. Many advanced 3D packaging and interconnecting methods, such as LTCC microwave multichip modules, vertical interconnects, and 3D electromagnetic field analyzing and optimizing, were applied to increase the package density and improve the electric performance. Test method and test results of 3D microwave modules were introduced. These techniques are very useful to many types of modern active phased array radar systems and communication systems.

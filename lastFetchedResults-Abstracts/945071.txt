Background & Objective: In compatibility with the progress of universities and expansion of knowledge and science around the world, Iran has also had significant academic progress in recent years. However, the vision of Iran for the following decades is very ambitious. Much has to be achieved to reach the highest position in the region in development, economy, science, and technology. This qualitative study was designed to explore the strengths and weaknesses of universities. 

Methods: This qualitative study had three phases. In the first phase, we explored the topic in brain storming sessions. Then, the themes raised in phase one were discussed deeply in unstructured interviews with selective experts around the country. In the last phase, we asked 30 selective academic staff from different medical sciences universities to categorize the issues based on their importance and their solutions using Delphi method. 

Results: Our findings showed that improvement of international affairs were frequently stressed by our respondents. In this domain, the English skills of academic staff and students, big revision in rules and regulations, and encouraging the establishment of close scientific communication with academic organizations around the world were highlighted. In addition, most respondents believed that problems were understandable, but our main conflicts were in finding applicable solutions and implementing decisions. 

Conclusion: Our results showed that for a better presentation of Iranian universities in the international environment a new approach to long term reform programs is necessary. In this plan, special attention must be paid to the educational and research infrastructures.

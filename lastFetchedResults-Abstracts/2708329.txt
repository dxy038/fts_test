Spinning reserve (SR) is one of the most important resources used by system operators to respond to unforeseen events. In a low-carbon economy mode, carbon capture plant is an important CO<sub>2</sub> abatement option and might constitute a significant proportion of the generation mix. Due to their potential flexibility, such plants might affect the requirement for SR. This paper describes a multi-period optimization model for coordinating the generation, carbon capture and SR provision. In turn, this model is used to optimize the SR requirements, with the objective of minimizing the overall cost. Since this objective function combines the generation production cost, the expected energy not supplied (EENS) cost, SR provision cost and the carbon emission cost, it is better suited to evaluate the SR requirements of power system with carbon capture plants. Numerical results based on a 26-unit test system show that the proposed model is effective and practical.

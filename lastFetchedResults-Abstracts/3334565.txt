The control and the protection system has an essential role in the over-all performance of the High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission system applications. The main objective of the present paper is to give the solutions of some performances problems that can occur in the conventional HVDC link. Indeed some protection and control devices are inserted to allow the system behavior study. Whereas the HVDC control system overall reliability is not only depending on the controllers, but it is depending also on the protection sub-functions as well. Furthermore, in this paper the actions that are taken by some HVDC link protection systems when faults or dysfunctions occur are presented. In the first step, the model validity is demonstrated based on the obtained waveforms analysis from the simulation under various disturbances. On the other side, the control and the protection robustness are tested and demonstrated during severe operating condition.

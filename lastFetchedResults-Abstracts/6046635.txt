Objective To study the effect of chloride channel inhibitor NPPB(5-nitro-2-(3-phenyl-propylamino)-benzoic acid) on proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of human trabecular meshwork cells. Method Using MTT, flow cytometry, Annexin V-PI and mitochondrial membrane potential, we explored the role of NPPB with different centration (10&#956;M, 50&#956;M, 100&#956;M) in cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential of TMC respectively. Rsults NPPB inhibited proliferation of TMC in a concentration-dependent manner. The proliferation of TMC was inhibited 55.6% by 100&#956;M NPPB, and there was significant difference, P&lt;; 0.01. Cell population increased in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase, while decreased in S phase induced by NPPB. NPPB was able to increase the apoptosis induced by 5-FU and reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential in TMC at the time point of 24h and 48h. Conclusion Chloride channel positively correlated with proliferation of TMC and promoted TMC into S phase via G1/S check point. In addition, ClC might be involved in anti-apoptosis mechanism through interfering internal mitochondrial pathway.

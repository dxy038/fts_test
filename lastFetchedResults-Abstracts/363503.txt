Study objective
The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of over-the counter analgesic overuse in a sample of emergency department (ED) patients.
Methods
We conducted a survey of a convenience sample of patients presenting to an urban, academic ED. Research associates questioned patients about the use of pain or cold medications containing ibuprofen, acetaminophen, naproxen, or aspirin. Patients who reported using medications with these ingredients in the 72 hours before their visit were asked about the specific medications, daily dose, and reason for medication use. The daily dose of these 4 analgesics was determined and classified as within or above the manufacturers’ recommended over-the counter dose range.
Results
Three hundred seven of 546 (56%) surveyed patients had reported using a medication containing one of these ingredients. Thirty-seven patients (6.2%; 95% confidence interval 4.5% to 8.6%) reported exceeding the manufacturer’s recommended daily dose at some point in the 3 days preceding their ED visit.
Conclusion
Although our study was limited by the use of a convenience sample, we found a potentially significant rate of patients who reported taking excessive doses of over-the-counter analgesics.

Objective
es frequently train with a short time recovery between sessions. The present aim was to establish how salivary IgA is altered following two soccer-specific intermittent exercise bouts performed on the same day.

les participated in two experimental trials (single session, double session) 1 week apart, in a counterbalanced design. One trial entailed afternoon exercise only (PMEX), in which participants completed soccer-specific intermittent exercise starting at 14:30 h. On the other occasion, participants performed two bouts of exercise [starting at 10:30 h (AMEX1) and at 14:30 h (PMEX2)]. Timed unstimulated saliva samples were collected before and immediately after exercise.
s
alivary IgA levels increased significantly immediately post-exercise in the single afternoon trial (PMEX). Performance of a second soccer-specific exercise bout in 1 day elicited an increase in heart rate and perceived exertion, compared with the single session, but did not appear to suppress salivary IgA outcomes. Performing soccer-specific exercise at these different times of day did not affect the salivary IgA concentration and secretion rate or salivary cortisol in the short term.
sions
findings suggest that, two 90-min exercise sessions performed at a moderate intensity with a 2.25 h rest in between do not necessarily have adverse effects on salivary IgA levels.

The objective of the proposed approach is to extract useful signals from background noise. This paper describes the adaptive detection of an unknown signal in a colored noise background. In the proposed technology, the ability for the self-adaptive neural network fuzzy inference system (ANFIS ) approaching the nonlinear function is used. First, the nonlinear dynamic characteristic of colored noise is modeled by ANFIS and approaches the colored noise by ANFIS. Then, colored noise is cancelled from a measured signal and the useful signal is gotten. Simulation experimental results show that a useful signal can be obtained accurately from the noise background, which is similar to the measured signal.

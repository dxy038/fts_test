The communication requirements for space missions necessitate to address the problems due to deep space communication networks. In this letter, the effects of slow start algorithm, propagation delay and the link errors on the throughput performance of transport layer protocols are investigated in deep space communication networks. The objective of this letter is to demonstrate through experimental results that existing TCP protocols are far from satisfying the deep space communication requirements and point out the urgent need for new TCP solutions.

The paper studies how to introduce CBR technology into the design of the marine oil spill emergency response decision-making system. At the beginning, in terms of the establishment of a maritime oil spill response decision-making system model, This paper analysis the presence index demonstration and modification mechanism of the case, and the overall framework of the oil spill accident cases. This paper determines the overall similarity of oil spill cases through two-stage search strategy and the nearest neighbor algorithm. First, to abstract oil spill case evaluation, and establish of a first-stage index by optimizing the case base index through clustering. Second, to form a second stage using the nearest neighbor algorithm. It proves that the method can improve the efficiency of oil spill emergency response and rescue, and index results are objective and reasonable.

Inroduction & Objective: Chitons are important for medical research because exist of chitosan and chitin in it?s shell. Because of importance of angiogenesis and since Angiogenesis is a complex process involving extensive interplay between cell soluble factors and extra cellular matrix (ECM) components. In this study, we investigated the angiogenic response induced by Synergic effects of chiton?s shell extract and acellular brain scaffolds implanted onto the chick chorioallantoic membrane.
Materials and Methods In this experimental study, the rat brain was decellularized. we used 50 fertilized eggs that were divided into 5 groups: control, sham-exposed1, sham-exposed2, experimental 1,and experimental 2. In the 12nd day of  incubation, the numbers and lengths of vessels around the sponges were measured by Image J software, data were analyzed with SPSS (version 16) and by statistic test such as ANOVA and Tukey results in significant level P <  0.05.
Results: Mean number(10/34 ± 1/85) and length(13/12±2/04mm) of vessels in the control with number(6/06±1/36) and length(9/76±1/21mm) of vessels in the experimental group 1 showed a significant decrease (p  <  0.001). Mean number and length of vessels in the control with number(8/75±1/04) and length(11/43±1/42mm) of vessels in the experimental group 2 showed a significant decrease (p  <  0.05). 
Conclusion: Results indicate that synergic  usage of  shell extract of Chiton Lamyi and acellular brain decrease angiogenesis in chorioallantoic membrane.

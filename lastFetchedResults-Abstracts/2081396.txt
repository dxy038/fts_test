Objective

ources
ensive literature search was conducted using PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Scirus and Cochrane databases up to November 8, 2012.
sions
are very few absolute medical contraindications to dental implant treatment, although a number of conditions may increase the risk of treatment failure or complications. The degree of systemic disease-control may be far more important that the nature of the disorder itself, and individualized medical control should be established prior to implant therapy, since in many of these patients the quality of life and functional benefits from dental implants may outweigh any risks.

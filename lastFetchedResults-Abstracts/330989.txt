Objective
This study investigated the effects of H2O2-treatment of titanium surfaces on cement shear bond strengths, and characterized H2O2-treated titanium surfaces.
Methods

Using 34.5% hydrogen peroxide solution, cp Ti plates (10 mm×10 mm×1 mm) were treated by (1) an immersion method, and (2) halogen irradiation while immersed in H2O2 for varying times. A cylindrical block (6 mm diameter, 4 mm height) of four different cements was bonded onto H2O2-treated surfaces. The cement bond strengths were evaluated under shear mode. Treated surfaces were also characterized for color change, wettability, AC impedance, and transmission electron diffraction of stripped oxide film.
Results

The cement shear bond strength of cp Ti treated with H2O2 and halogen for 160 s was the highest and was approximately 14 times higher than the un-treated control cp Ti plates. Bond strengths are correlated linearly to wettability. The more surface wetted with the cement material, the higher the resultant shear bond strength value.
Significance

These results suggest that a combined treatment of hydrogen peroxide and halogen light irradiation provides an effective surface condition with appropriate oxide film thickness to enhance the cement bond strength.

Some
features of Islamic science are related to the objective of scientist, function of science or the culture of the scientific community. However, the main objective of the present paper is to explain a feature, which is related to the structure of scientific knowledge.
The main claim of the present paper is:
1. Science is divided into two branches of metaphysics and particular science.
2.Â Metaphysics has a determinative and identification role for other sciences.
3. Metaphysics is divided into monotheistic and non-monotheistic branches.
Religions have different levels and degrees. Monotheism is the central truth of religions, which are generally called Islam, and hence whenever science is based on monotheistic metaphysics it gains a religious and Islamic identity.
Attempts have been made in the present paper also to discuss some of the epistemological principles of Islamic science such as revelation and intuition and elaborated their relations with reason and sense. Also virtue and self-purification have been mentioned as two methods for intuitional knowledge.

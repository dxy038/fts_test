Objective: The study was aimed to compare the results of gap arthroplasty and interpositional arthroplasty in the treatment of temporomandibular joint ankylosis surgery with particular reference to the recurrence of ankylosis.Material and Methods: A total of 30 patients with temporomandibular joint ankylosis, 19 unilateral and llbilateral (41joints) were operated and included both male and female, with age range from 3-40 years with at least 2-3 years of follow up.Results: There were no cases of re ankylosis where interpositional arthroplasty was done regardless of the age and duration of ankylosis. Good results were achieved with interpositional arthroplasty with maximum mouth opening of 35mm (mean). In adult cases where interposition was done there was no re ankylosis and the mouth opening was 32.6mm (mean) at the end of follow up period. In growing children and adult cases where only gap arthroplasty was done there was recurrence of ankylosis and the maximum mouth opening achieved in adult patients at the end of follow up period was less than 30mm (mean).Conclusion: The interpositional arthroplasty is the treatment of choice in any type or stage of ankylosis regardless of the age and duration.

We present a comprehensive set of measurements of a 2.4 GHz DSSS wireless LAN and analyze its behavior. We examine issues such as host and interface heterogeneity, bidirectional (TCP) traffic and error modeling, that have not been previously analyzed. We uncover multiple problems with TCP and UDP performance in this system. We investigate the causes of these problems (radio hardware, device drivers, network protocols) and discuss the effectiveness of proposed improvements

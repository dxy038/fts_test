To assess the relation between silent ischemia and objective markers of ischemia we compared ambulatory electrocardiographic (AECG) monitoring, exercise stress testing, and technetium-99m methoxyisobutyl isonitrile single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 68 patients with coronary artery disease. ST-segment depression at AECG monitoring occurred in 40%, exercise testing was positive in 88%, and SPECT was abnormal in 98% of patients. Patients with ST-segment depression had a higher incidence of 3-vessel disease (70% vs 45%, p = 0.04), shorter duration of exercise (267 ± 109 vs 416 ± 167 seconds, p &lt;0.01), lower workload achieved (5.1 ± 1.9 vs 7.6 ± 2.8 METs, p &lt;0.0002), and a greater extent of ischemia at scintigraphy (p = 0.01). Patients with a total ischemic time of &gt;30 minutes in a 24-hour period had a lower ejection fraction (48 ± 21% vs 70 ± 9%, p = 0.001), a higher perfusion index at rest (2.4 ± 0.6 vs 1.6 ± 0.6, p = 0.001), and a greater number of segments with fixed perfusion defects (4.1 ± 3.7 vs 1.3 ± 1.8, p = 0.02) in comparison with those who had a shorter ischemic time. We conclude that AECG monitoring fails to identify a substantial proportion of patients with objective markers of ischemia; however, ST-segment depression reflects more significant disease. Longer total ischemic time correlates with the area of myocardial damage but not with other markers of ischemia.

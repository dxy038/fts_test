A resonant DC link dual converter system is presented for motor drives. Operating characteristics are presented. The proposed control scheme of resonant initial current and clamp circuit can solve the problems of zero crossing miss and the peak voltage of resonant capacitor. Using experimental tests, the authors confirm that the proposed resonant dual converter system can control bidirectional power flow successfully in the steady state and transient state with induction motor drives.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

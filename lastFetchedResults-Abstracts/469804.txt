Objective
This study was undertaken to determine whether the expression of extracellular matrix components (ECM) is altered in the umbilical arteries from preterm fetal growth-restricted (FGR) pregnancies.
Study design
Preterm pregnancies with FGR were compared with appropriately grown preterm pregnancies. Umbilical artery messenger RNA (mRNA) levels for fibrillar collagens I and III, nonfibrillar collagen XIV, and decorin were determined by using relative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The mRNA expression was compared between cases and controls by using the Student t test. P ≤ .05 was considered significant.
Results
Eight FGR cases and 5 control pregnancies were analyzed. Mean counts per minute (cpm) ± SEM for collagen I and collagen III were increased in FGR pregnancies. There were no differences in mRNA expression of collagen XIV or decorin.
Conclusion
Increased mRNA expression of collagen I and III, but not collagen XIV or decorin, is found in the umbilical arteries of preterm FGR pregnancies.

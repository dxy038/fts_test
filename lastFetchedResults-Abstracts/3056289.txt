In this paper, we present the hybrid transcoding, specifically, practical joint control of spatial, temporal and SNR scaling by rate-distortion modeling. The objective of the joint control is to determine the optimal combination of transcoding operations. To allocate bits more efficiently, the multidimensional factors including spatial, SNR, and temporal and their tradeoffs are exploited in terms of the quality of content. Based on the statistical analysis of dependency distortion, we propose an improved distortion model and a rate control algorithm. In experiments, a typical video transcoding problem is analyzed and solved by using the proposed rate-distortion (R-D) model.

The scientific and reasonable measure of energy efficiency is the foundation based on which government departments at all levels reach their energy-saving goals and make corresponding policies. With reference to the research results of other scholars, the paper gives a new definition of the energy-saving potential to evaluate energy efficiency. The definition is expected to cancel the inability of comparing between nations and communities in terms of industrial structure, level of economic development and level of technology ensure different areas can be compared. In the paper DEA model is used to conduct the empirical research for the energy efficiency of the secondary industries which have suffered the highest energy consumption in ChinaÂ´s major provinces. The paper also gives an objective evaluation of the energy efficiency and energy-saving potential in all provinces of China and analyzes the results of the evaluation. For those inefficient energy provinces, the paper determines the size of the energy-saving potential, and provides some countermeasures for improvement of energy efficiency from the perspective of technology advancement, energy-saving potential and industrial-scale upgrade.

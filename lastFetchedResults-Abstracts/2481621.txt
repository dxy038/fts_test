Background: Today, the relationship between asthma and obesity in many studies is reviewed and weight control is used as a way for control of symptoms and severity of asthma along with other treatment protocol. Portulaca oleracea is consumed for weight loss in some countries. 
Objective: The experiment is designed to study the effect of Portulaca oleracea seeds on anthropometric measurements in asthmatic patients. 
Methods: In a randomized clinical trial, 59 patients with asthma disease divided to intervention (n=31) and control (n=28) groups. First group received asthma treatment and consisting 10g/day P. oleracea seeds in two doses in the morning (fasting) and before dinner with a glass of water for 8weeks .Participants in second group received only asthma treatment. At the beginning and end of the study, anthropometric measurements were measured on each subject. 
Results: The anthropometric measurements including weight, body mass index and waist circumference indicated any significant differences between two groups after completion of the study (P?0.05) but hip circumference and waist-to-hip ratio had significant decrease (P= 0.003) and increase in intervention group (P= 0.04), respectively.
Conclusion: Consumption of Portulaca oleracea seeds influence on some anthropometric measurements likes hip circumference and waist-to-hip ratio in asthmatic patients. However, the effects of them on other anthropometric measurements need further investigations.Keywords: Anthropometric Measurements, Asthma, Obesity, Portulaca oleracea seed.

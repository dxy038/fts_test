This paper will provide an overview of equipment being developed, by Eagle-Picher Technologies, for the US NavyÂ´s Automated Battery Charger/Analyzer Program. The objective of the program is to reduce the cost and improve the effectiveness of battery maintenance. This will require a comprehensive battery support solution. This solution will be accomplished through the timely insertion of state-of-the-art battery charger/analyzer units. These units will utilize Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components whenever possible. These new concepts will be demonstrated by means of system prototypes for proof of concept. A Stationary Battery Charger/Analyzer (SBCA) unit was developed for the program, The SBCA possesses charge, discharge and analysis capability for up to five batteries at a given time. The SBCA uses algorithms that are stored in a battery database. This database will contain pertinent battery data, such as capacity, charge cycles, failures and logistical information on each battery within the local system. The SBCA is able to communicate with a Portable Battery Charger for uploading these same algorithms and downloading data for batteries located at remote sites. The program was designed to address three battery chemistries: lead acid, nickel-cadmium and silver-zinc. However, the SBCA will be capable of charging and testing any rechargeable battery that has similar current profiles and termination criteria. Finally, the expected benefits of implementing this solution throughout the fleet will be discussed. Projected cost savings due to use of this new technology will be quantified and presented in this paper

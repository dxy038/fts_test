Based on credibility theory, this paper firstly constructs a new type of fuzzy transportation expected value model with credibility constraint, in which the transportation cost and the man-power coefficients are uncertain and assumed to be characterized by fuzzy variables with known possibility distributions. Then we discuss some basic properties with respect to the objective function and credibility constraint. In the proposed fuzzy transportation problem, we can rarely solve directly it using the conventional optimization algorithms. But in some special cases, we can transform the objective function and the credibility constraint into the equivalent linear forms via some theoretical methods. After that, we can solve this fuzzy optimization problem by some classical algorithms. Finally, we consider a practical transportation example and solve it by Lingo software.

The integration of traditional and heuristic techniques is considered for the reactive power/voltage control program. The steady-state reactive power problem is addressed. Fuzzy sets are used to modify the linear programming (LP) approach to voltage control and to incorporate some heuristic concepts of the expert system approach. Multiple objectives and soft constraints are modeled using fuzzy sets. Piecewise linear convex membership functions for the fuzzy sets are defined. Under this definition, the fuzzy optimization problem is reformulated as a standard linear programming problem. The objective function represents the compromise among the original competing objectives and the soft constraints. In addition, discrete constraints are considered. Numerical examples demonstrate the approach

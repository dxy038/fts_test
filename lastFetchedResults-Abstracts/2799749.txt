This paper presents a method for taking into account reference limits when the Feature Selective method (FSV) is applied. Nowadays, there is a long line of research that underlines the important role played by the FSV to perform an objective validation process. However, until now, there has been no consideration of a reference level in the validation process. This paper presents a methodology to calculate the FSV values when a reference limit is contemplated. We demonstrate the importance of this technique in the validation criteria for the Computational Electromagnetics and, more particularly, in the EMC comparison process. Finally, in order to show the application and the importance of the method, two real cases, considering different reference levels, are analysed.

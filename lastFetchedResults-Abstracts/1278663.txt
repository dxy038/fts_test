Variability of soil properties can have major influence on the results of solute transport models when applied to field conducted experiments. The objective of this study was to determine spatial variability of transport and degradation parameters for a bromide tracer and atrazine herbicide in a 0.1 ha field of alluvial soils under no-till management. The soil investigated was a Sarpy (mixed, mesic Typic Udipsamment) with surface texture varying from sand to loam. The field was classified into three areas (Area I, sand; Area II, sandy loam; and Area III, loam) according to surface texture. Atrazine and bromide were applied at rates of 1.8 kg ha− 1 and 115 kg ha− 1, respectively. Soil cores were extracted at selected dates, segmented into 75 mm increments, and analyzed for each chemical separately. Soil physical and chemical properties were determined as a function of soil depth from additional soil cores removed when the transport study was completed. The value of the average pore water velocity, v, estimated using bromide concentrations was 6.0 mm day− 1 which was about 29% lower than the value computed from meteorological information, 8.5 mm day− 1. The average bromide dispersion coefficient (D), 508 mm2 day− 1, was 80 times higher than that for atrazine, 6.13 mm2 day− 1. The bromide v and D parameters were found to be spatially autocorrelated with ranges between 20 and 23 m and 12 and 24 m, respectively. Atrazine retardation and degradation parameters were found to have spatial structure for only one sampling date each with a range between 18 and 24 m. Soil textural parameters were found to have spatial structure for the first three depths (0–45 cm) of the five depths monitored (0–75 cm). This study found spatial autocorrelation within about 20 m for bromide transport parameters and a few atrazine transport parameters for an alluvial site.

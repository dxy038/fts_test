The architecture, circuit design, and test results for a GaAs 8-b slice processor IC are presented. The device is a high-speed cascadable element intended for use in MIL-STD-1750A computers, reduced-instruction-set computer (RISC) systems, signal processors, and numerous other applications where high speed and radiation hardness are required. The bus-oriented architecture features a 31-word&#215;8-b two-port register file, a fast eight-function ALU, an 8-bit address port an 8-b bidirectional data port, and associated shifting, decoding, and multiplexing functions. Ancillary logic commonly mechanized in external hardware has been included on-chip. The 9400-transistor LSI device demonstrated peak performance above 150 million operations per second (MOPS) at 9.2 W; a lower power version executes 100 MOPS at 4.2 W

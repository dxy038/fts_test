Based on the managerial realities, practices and problems of firms in the bio-industry, the objective of this research project is to develop a knowledge sharing platform for a consortium of partners involved in research activities in the sector. The electronic knowledge sharing platform serves not only in the production of analyses and pre-emptive studies to accompany firms and bodies within the bio-industry but also to support membersÂ´ activities in their respective field of research. The platform was elaborated to carry out four specific knowledge management processes (strategic monitoring and intelligence, academic monitoring and intelligence, creation of an expert knowledge base, and the development of a bio-industry firm directory). The six main applications chosen by the research consortium to support these processes are presented in this paper.

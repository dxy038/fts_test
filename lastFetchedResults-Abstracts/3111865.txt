The author (1990a, 1990b) established a general class of robust control design procedures, termed as "Target Feedback Loop/Loop Transfer Recovery" (TFL/LTR). The existing "Linear Quadratic Gaussian/Loop Transfer Recovery" (LQG/LTR) methodology (Athans, 1986) is one of the procedures under the TFL/LTR class. Some procedures under the TFL/LTR class can be remarkably superior to LQG/LTR. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate a TFL/LTR procedure for the robust control of a current source inverter (CSI) fed induction motor drive system. This particular procedure employs the Lyapunov filter (LF) introduced by Prakash (1990a, 1990b) along with the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). The design performed in this paper employs a model reduction method giving rise to a reduced order compensator. A full-length description of the steps of the single-input single-output (SISO) reduced order TFL/LTR compensator design is given and the simulation results are presented.

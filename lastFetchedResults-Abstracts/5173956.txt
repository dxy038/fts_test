Multicommodity network flows (MCNF) is a useful tool to solve bandwidth allocation and distribution problems on flows over MPLS (multiprotocol label switching) networks. MPLS has emerged as the protocol of the future due to it\Â´s true "multiprotocol architecture" nature, where it use a simple label switching mechanism and provide some level of quality of service (QoS) management features through traffic engineering. The objective of this paper is to propose a model based on multicommodity network flows theory to determine the optimal allocation of flows in a label switched path (LSP) at minimal cost. We discuss implementation issues and present some computational results.

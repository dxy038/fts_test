Background: One of the major and life-threatening side effects of Assisted
Reproductive Technique (ART) is ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The
available data however, have been showed that both Cabergoline (anti VEGF) and
coasting reduce the severity of OHSS.
Objective: We aimed to compare coasting and Cabergoline administration in
prevention of severe OHSS.
Materials and Methods: A total of 60 IVF/ICSI cycles were selected. Patients at risk
of developing OHSS were divided into two groups as patient's convenience. For 30
patients in coasting group, exogenous gonadotropins were withheld to allow E2 to
decrease while GnRH-a was maintained. Then 10,000 unit hCG was administrated and
oocyte retrieval was performed 36 hours later. In Cabergoline group, 30 patients were
administered with 0.5mg Cabergoline tablet on day of hCG injection, continued for 8
days.
Results: The mean number of retrieved, good quality, mature oocytes and the mean
number of embryos were significantly different in two groups (p < 0.05). The clinical
pregnancy rate was 13.3% in coasting and 26.7% in Cabergoline group that was not
significantly different (p > 0.05). The incidence of severe OHSS was similar in two
groups.
Conclusion: The Cabergoline was as effective as coasting in the prevention of early
severe OHSS in high risk patients, but yielded more retrieved oocytes.

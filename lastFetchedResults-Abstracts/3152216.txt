This paper proposes the retuning method of PID controller based on the controller performance assessment. The objective of the proposed scheme is to close the target performance of PID controller when controller performance deteriorates. The retuning mechanism is based on the estimated controller performance which is based on the on-line system identification. Finally, numerical evaluations demonstrate the practically and utility of this idea.

A bubble-domain memory cell and a storage loop configuration are proposed. The basic operations of writing and shifting information, which include retention and ejection of bubble domains, have been tested. Experimental results for quasi-static operation using YFeO<inf>3</inf>have shown the anticipated operating margins. This configuration has advantages of both field and conductor access, i.e., selective operation of the storage loops, bidirectional shifting, etc.

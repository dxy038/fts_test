In this study, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of kernel-based fuzzy clustering and fuzzy clustering. Kernel based clustering has emerged as an interesting and quite visible alternative in fuzzy clustering, however, the effectiveness of this extension vis-à-vis some generic methods of fuzzy clustering has neither been discussed in a complete manner nor the performance of clustering quantified through a convincing comparative analysis. Our focal objective is to understand the performance gains and the importance of parameter selection for kernelized fuzzy clustering. Generic Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and Gustafson–Kessel (GK) FCM are compared with two typical generalizations of kernel-based fuzzy clustering: one with prototypes located in the feature space (KFCM-F) and the other where the prototypes are distributed in the kernel space (KFCM-K). Both generalizations are studied when dealing with the Gaussian kernel while KFCM-K is also studied with the polynomial kernel. Two criteria are used in evaluating the performance of the clustering method and the resulting clusters, namely classification rate and reconstruction error. Through carefully selected experiments involving synthetic and Machine Learning repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/beta/) data sets, we demonstrate that the kernel-based FCM algorithms produce a marginal improvement over standard FCM and GK for most of the analyzed data sets. It has been observed that the kernel-based FCM algorithms are in a number of cases highly sensitive to the selection of specific values of the kernel parameters.

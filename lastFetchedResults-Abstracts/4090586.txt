The transmission performance of a high speed indoor radio communication system at 60 GHz based on (single carrier) QPSK transmission is evaluated. The main objective of the underlying research is to examine how far high data rates can be achieved with a highly directional antenna placed at desktop level and a centralised antenna at ceiling height that radiates downwards in order to illuminate a circular coverage area below. The results can serve as a reference for tradeoff considerations with respect to the complexity and performance of more sophisticated transmission schemes such as OFDM. Simulation results of achievable data rates are presented. These results indicate that a relatively simple transmission scheme can be applied to provide high data rates in the order of 100-200 Mbit/s

Many mechatronic system design problems are formulated into a multi-objective optimization model. In such a model, multiple objectives with their weights and all variables that describe a designed system from different perspectives (such as kinematic motion, shaking force, controller) are put together and equally updated to seek an optimum. In this paper, such a model is called multiple objective concurrent design (MOCD). We argue that the MOCD model has some significant drawbacks with respect to the &#8220;decoupled&#8221; design problem. According to SuhÂ´s axiomatic design theory (ADT), design problems can be classified into three types: coupled design, decoupled design, and uncoupled design. In this paper, we further propose a decoupled design model for the decoupled design problem. A comparison of the two design models, MOCD and decoupled design, for several examples is given to support our finding and proposition.

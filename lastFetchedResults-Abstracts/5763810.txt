Every service outage in an optical telecommunication network causes significant revenue losses to major corporations relying on the network for business activities. Therefore, survivability must be a foremost consideration in the network provisioning to ensure that the network will be able to survive as many failures as possible. The cost of interconnection equipment required to protect the network is also a priority. In response to these concerns, a metaheuristic was developed to solve the joint optimization of the GRWA and segment protection problems on WDM optical networks. The objective of minimizing the cost of interconnection equipment is evaluated through the dominating cost of MSPP cards. The comparison of joint and sequential optimization approaches showed that the joint one gives significantly lower cost solutions than the sequential one

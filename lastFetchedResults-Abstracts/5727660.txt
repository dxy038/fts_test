The increase in volume and sensitivity of data communicated and processed over the Internet has been accompanied by a corresponding need for e-commerce techniques in which entities can participate in a secure and anonymous fashion. Even simple arithmetic operations over a set of integers partitioned over a network require sophisticated algorithms. As apart of our earlier work, we have developed a secure protocol for computing dot products of two vectors. In this paper, we present a secure protocol for Yao´s millionaires´ problem. In this problem, each of the two participating parties have a number and the objective is to determine whose number is larger without disclosing any information about the numbers. This problem has direct applications in on-line bidding and auctions. Furthermore, combined with a secure dot-product, a solution to this secure multiparty computation provides necessary building blocks for such basic operations as frequent item-set generation in association rule mining. Although an asymptotically optimal solution for the secure multiparty computation of the ´less-or-equal´ predicate exists in literature, this protocol is not suited for practical applications. Here, we present a protocol which has a much simpler structure and is more efficient for numbers in ranges practically encountered in typical e-commerce applications. Furthermore, advances in cryptanalysis and the subsequent increase in key lengths for public-key cryptographic systems accentuate the advantage of the proposed protocol. We present experimental evidence demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed protocol both in terms of time and communication overhead.

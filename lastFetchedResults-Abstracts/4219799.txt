Small cell networks have been broadly regarded as an imperative evolution path for the next-generation cellular networks. Dense small cell deployments will be connected to the core network by heterogeneous backhaul technologies such as fiber, microwave, high frequency wireless solutions, etc., which have their inherent limitations and impose big challenges on the operation of radio access network to meet the increasing rate demands in future networks. To address these challenges, this paper presents an efficient design considered in the iJOIN (Interworking and JOINt Design of an Open Access and Backhaul Network Architecture for Small Cells based on Cloud Networks) project with the objective of jointly optimizing backhaul and radio access network operations through the adoption of SDN (Software Defined Networking). Furthermore, based on this framework, the implementation of several intelligent management functions, including mobility management, network-wide energy optimization and data center placement, is demonstrated.

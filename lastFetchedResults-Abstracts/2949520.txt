This paper addresses the problem of designing weighted order statistic (WOS) filters by employing an objective function given as the L<sub>p</sub> norm of the error between the desired signal and the estimated one. The conventional design of WOS filters uses a mean absolute error (MAE) objective function, and as such, it is a special case of the general, L<sub>p</sub> norm based design, developed here. It is shown that in stack filtering, the L<sub>p</sub> norm can be expressed as a linear combination of the decision errors incurred by the Boolean operators at each level of the stack filter architecture. Based on this formulation of the L<sub>p</sub> norm, both nonadaptive and adaptive algorithms for the design of L<sub>p</sub> WOS filters are developed. A design example is considered, to illustrate the performance of the designed L<sub>p</sub> WOS filters with different values of p. The simulation results show that the L<sub>p</sub> WOS filters with p&#10878;2 are capable of removing more impulsive noise compared with the conventional MAE WOS filters

This paper describes the performance of current objective speech quality measures designed to estimate subjective quality. We examined perceptual objective quality measures using a wide range of distortions including speech compression, wireless channel impairments, VoIP channel impairments, and modifications to the signal from features such as AGC. The results of this study indicate the range of conditions to which these objective measures may be applied, the validity of the estimates they provide, and the general maturity of the field

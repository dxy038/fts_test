A novel mitigation strategy for photovoltaic power fluctuation is presented in this paper. The objective is to adopt the new strategy for optimizing use of the energy storage systems (ESSs). The minimization of storage capacity and the complexity of control strategy are accomplished by introducing of the proposed hierarchical simple moving average (H-SMA). Moreover, the enhance ability to mitigate the problem by allocating the power required by the ESSs is considered. The performance of the proposed technique is verified by a daily power profile collected from the PV power plant. The storage capacities derived by the proposed strategy are compared with those of conventional method. In this paper, the computer simulation is used to carry out the validation results, which points out that it can effectively mitigate the power fluctuation with the minimal-capacity ESSs.

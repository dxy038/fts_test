Objective
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of delivery on problems in subsequent births.
Study design
This was a cohort study that used register data for 73,104 mothers who had their first birth from 1987 to 1989 and subsequent births from 1987 to1998. Three analyses were performed: (1) examination of second births by mode of delivery in the first birth, with adjustment for confounders, (2) same parameter, with exclusion of women with persistent problems, and (3) examination of third births for women with a first birth vaginal delivery.
Results
More complications and poorer infant outcome were found at later births when the first or second birth was by cesarean delivery than after a first spontaneous vaginal delivery, even when women with persistent problems were excluded. Women with instrument first births had a similar rate of complications in the second birth to women with spontaneous vaginal births, but some infant outcomes were poorer.
Conclusion
Problems that are subsequent to cesarean delivery are unlikely to be explained entirely by indications for cesarean delivery.

Objective
jective of this study was to compare the superficial morphology of bovine and human sclerotic dentine.

e morphological analysis, bovine (n = 3) and human (n = 3) incisors exhibiting exposed dentine were used. Dentine presented characteristics of sclerosis: brownish, smooth and shiny—the vitreous appearance. The teeth were prepared for assessment on a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Three pre-determined areas of each sample were submitted to SEM. The number of open tubules per area was obtained from the electron micrographs (n = 9 per group) for comparison purposes.
s
mber of open tubules in both species compared were similar (p &gt; 0.05). Human dentine presented 31.89 ± 23.94 open tubules per area, whereas bovine dentine showed 30.33 ± 18.14 open tubules per area.
sion
on the results, we concluded that dentine exposed at the incisal surface of human and bovine teeth presented similar clinical and micro-morphological aspects, represented by surfaces with equivalent numbers of open dentinal tubules.

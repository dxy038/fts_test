Creation of superhydrophobic self-cleaning surfaces is an important objective for a variety of applications. Indeed, numerous routes to generate superhydrophobic surfaces have been proposed. In this paper, a facile way of forming superhydrophobic surfaces is reported that uses Au assisted HF/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> etching of silicon wafers. The Au layer was deposited onto a silicon wafer via e-Beam evaporation. By controlling the evaporation and etching times, the surface roughness can be manipulated and superhydrophobic surfaces with different optical properties can be generated. The effect of etchant concentration on superhydrophobicity was investigated by altering surface structures. Contact angles were measured with a CCD camera equipped goniometer; these values determined the water repellency. Light reflection on the as prepared black surfaces was measured to assess the efficiency for low cost solar cell applications. This approach offers a new way both to theoretically study the surface roughness effect and to investigate engineering applications of self-cleaning surfaces in solar cells, MEMS, anti-bacteria coating, and microfluidic devices.

Background & Objective: Schizophrenia is considered as one of the most extreme mental illnesses in the area of psychiatry which is characterized by social and occupational incompetence. Support and care of these patients has always been on the part of families. The imposed burden includes physical, mental, social and economic problems being experienced by caregiver of the family. The present study aimed at investigating the burden experienced by schizophrenic patients at Imam Reza Hospital in the city of Bojnurd.
Material & Methods: This is a descriptive-analytical study conducted on 75 family caregivers visiting Imam Reza Hospital. Data collection methods included demographic questionnaire, and Zarit Questionnaire which measured degree of experienced burden by caregivers. Reliability and validity of both questionnaires had already been established. Then, data were fed into SPSS 14 for analysis.     
Results:  12.2% of caregivers experienced low burden, 36.4% average burden, and 51.5% high burden. The perceived burden among women was significantly higher (P=0.003) than that of men. There was significant relationship (p=0.03) between the obtained score of caregiving and age of caregivers while the relationship between caregiving score and age of patients was not significant (p > 0.05) but was negative. Younger patients imposed higher burden on the caregivers.  
Conclusion: Taking care of schizophrenic patients put immense pressure on family especially on caregivers. Therefore, it can be said that the mental pressure imposed by such patients threatens caregivers' mental health, hence reduction in quality of care and support. Consequently, family centered programs are recommended for decreasing the burden incurred by schizophrenic patients.

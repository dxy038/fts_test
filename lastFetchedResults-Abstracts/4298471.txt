Objective: To establish three dimensional finite element model of the whole cervical spine and investigate biomechanical characteristic of the human cervical spine for application of clinical diagnosis and therapy. Method: A healthy adult female was subjected, three dimensional finite element model of the whole cervical spine was established using the method of 3D interpolation with CT. Result: The model included seven vertebrae, five discs, postical structure and seven ligaments. The volume of the whole model is 74 878.34mm3, the surface area is 32 616.04mm2, which consisting of 578 007elements, 123 358nodes, comparing the simulation data with the literature, the validity of the model was verified. Conclusion: The three-dimensional finite element model simulates the structure and property of cervical spine, whose structure is whole, its elements is fine, the model is very accurate and credible. The equivalent (Von Mises) stress of centum, facet joints and intervertebral disc in flexion is higher than in extension, the result of the biomechanical study was better correlated with the available experimental data. This indicates that the model can be used to analyze the biomechanics characteristic of the human cervical spine f in different condition.

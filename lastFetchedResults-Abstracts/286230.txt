Background:  Veterinarians are exposed to allergens, dirt, and chemicals, but there are very few epidemiologic data on dermatoses veterinarians. Objective: The aim of this study is to get information about skin diseases in veterinary work. Methods: A sample of California veterinarians were sent a questionnaire, which was returned by 73% (n = 1,416). Results:  History of skin atopy was reported by 11% and respiratory atopy by 63%. Dermatoses during their career were reported by 46%, and hand and/or forearm dermatitis was reported more than once and during the past year by 22% of women and 10% of men. Dermatitis with work-related exacerbating factors was reported by 28%. Almost 1 of 5 veterinarians reported animal-related skin symptoms. Other aggravators were medications (2%), gloves (4%), and other chemicals (7% of respondents). Of those with animal-related dermatitis, 65% reported only 1 animal (dog, 66%; cat, 29%; horse, 9%; and cattle, 8%), and 66% reported the symptoms appeared in minutes after the contact. In logistic analysis, the risk factors for the appearance of hand/forearm dermatitis during the past 12 months and more than once during their career, were: history of skin atopy (odds ratio, 3.5), childhood hand dermatitis (odds ratio, 3.4), history of respiratory atopy (odds ratio, 2.0), and female sex (odds ratio, 1.9). Conclusions: Veterinarians' skin symptoms were common and often caused by immediate allergy to 1 or few animal species.

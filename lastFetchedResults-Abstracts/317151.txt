Volumetric quantitative computed tomography (vQCT), using multiple thin-slice acquisition, measures three-dimensional volumetric bone mineral density (BMD, mg/cm3). vQCT is often used to measure BMD of lumbar vertebrae and may detect early changes in trabecular, cortical, or integral BMD that extend beyond the technical limits of areal dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) BMD measurements. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of 2 years of raloxifene (RLX) treatment on several volumetric BMD measures in a subset of postmenopausal women (n = 58) enrolled in the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) trial. Patients in this study were randomized to one of three treatment groups: placebo (n = 21), RLX 60 mg/day (n = 17), or RLX 120 mg/day (n = 20), and all patients received daily calcium (500 mg) and vitamin D (400â€“600 IU) supplementation. Data from the raloxifene treatment groups were pooled for each analysis. Following 2 years of raloxifene treatment, there was a significant percent change from baseline in the vQCT regions of interest (ROIs) of midintegral BMD, total trabecular BMD, and total integral BMD (P< 0.05) compared to placebo, while there was no significant change in the spinal DXA BMD measurement. These data provide the first longitudinal assessment by vQCT of changes in vertebral bone density after 2 years of treatment with raloxifene. vQCT appears to be a valuable technique for measuring the effects of raloxifene treatment in this population of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

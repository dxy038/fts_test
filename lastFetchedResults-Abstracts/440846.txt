Background. A silicone-coated microporous hollow-fiber membrane oxygenator has been developed to prevent plasma leakage during long-term use. The objective of this study was to evaluate the biocompatibility of the oxygenator.
Methods. A silicone-coated oxygenator was compared with an uncoated oxygenator in an in vitro model of cardiopulmonary bypass. Simulated circulation was maintained for 6 h at 37°C.
Results. Platelet counts decreased significantly (p< 0.05) and leukocyte counts tended to decline; however, the differences between groups were not significant. Concentrations of C3a increased significantly in both groups (p< 0.05), but levels were significantly less in the silicone-coated oxygenator (p = 0.008). In contrast, concentrations of C4a, β-thromboglobulin, and granulocyte elastase increased significantly (p< 0.05), but the differences between groups were not significant.
Conclusions. Silicone coating over a microporous hollow-fiber membrane may improve biocompatibility by reducing C3a activation.

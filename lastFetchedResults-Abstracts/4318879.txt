This paper presents multiple antenna based spectrum sensing employing sequential detector to further improve the agility of a cognitive radio user. The approach has significantly reduced required sample numbers to accomplish the sensing objective compared to its counterpart when employing the fixed sample number detection. The paper mainly studies behaviours of sequential detection employed in multiple antenna for spectrum sensing when model errors occur. Model errors are represented by mismatches on signal to noise ratio and also on angle of arrival interval of the signal impinging on the antenna array. Performances are derived analytically and also evaluated by monte carlo simulations.

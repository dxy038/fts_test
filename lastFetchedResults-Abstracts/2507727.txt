Background and objective: The circle of Willis (COW) supports adequate
blood supply to the brain. The cardiovascular system, in the current study, is modeled
using an equivalent electronic system focusing on the COW.
Method: In our previous study we used 42 compartments to model whole cardiovascular
system. In the current study, nevertheless, we extended our model by
using 63 compartments to model whole CS. Each cardiovascular artery is modeled
using electrical elements, including resistor, capacitor, and inductor. The MATLAB
Simulink software is used to obtain the left and right ventricles pressure as well as
pressure distribution at efferent arteries of the circle of Willis. Firstly, the normal
operation of the system is shown and then the stenosis of cerebral arteries is induced
in the circuit and, consequently, the effects are studied.
Results: In the normal condition, the difference between pressure distribution of
right and left efferent arteries (left and right ACA–A2, left and right MCA, left and
right PCA–P2) is calculated to indicate the effect of anatomical difference between
left and right sides of supplying arteries of the COW. In stenosis cases, the effect
of internal carotid artery occlusion on efferent arteries pressure is investigated. The
modeling results are verified by comparing to the clinical observation reported in the
literature.
Conclusion: We believe the presented model is a useful tool for representing the
normal operation of the cardiovascular system and study of the pathologies.

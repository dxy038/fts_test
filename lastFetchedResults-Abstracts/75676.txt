The laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy of magnesium, manganese, and chromium atoms by use of a commercial Meinhard nebulizer originally designed for inductively coupled plasma measurements is described. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that this nebulizer has been used for laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy measurements. The limit of detection is slightly lower when the nebulizer rather than a liquid jet is used in single-pulse laser excitation. In addition we present the response characteristics of the nebulizer, such as effects of variations in purge gas and liquid flow rate, that are different from normal operating specifications. The effects of gate delay, gate width, and laser power variations were also studied. The objective of the present research has been to consider a new operating mode and conditions in which a better limit of detection of trace elements in water can be obtained.

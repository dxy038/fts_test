We introduce the concept of an 系-properly efficient solution and establish the equivalence between 系-optimality for a convex multiobjective program and 系-optimality for a related parametric (scalar) objective program. Using this equivalence, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for an 系-properly efficient solution of a nondifferentiable multiobjective objective functions subject to nondifferentiable convex inequality constraints, linear equality constraints, and abstract constraints.

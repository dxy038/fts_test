A three-stage process for making a harmonic resonance mitigation decision in an end-user network is developed. Different sizes of power factor correction banks cause various levels of severity of harmonic resonance which may or may not damage capacitors. Based on the level of severity two new indices are developed to guide in making the appropriate decision. The first index is used to assess the severity of resonance and the second to make a mitigation decision. In stage 1, a quantitative model building approach is used to structure the decision problem taking the harmonic resonance severity index as the objective function. In stage 2, utility theory is chosen as the decision criterion to select the most desirable capacitor size. In stage 3, the mitigation index is applied to assess whether mitigation is needed or not for the chosen capacitor. A case study, based on a deterministic model is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of applying this new decision theory to harmonic resonance.

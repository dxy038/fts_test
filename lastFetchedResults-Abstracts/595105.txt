Objective: To study the frequency and aetiology of rupture of pregnant uterus.Material and Methods: This study was conducted at the department of obstetrics and gynaecology, Military Hospital, Rawalpindi from January 1996 to January 1999. Patients were randomly selected. Only those patients were selected who had reported with uterine rupture (UR) or had developed the condition during their management in the hospital. The age, parity, obstetric history, drug history, the presenting features and booking status, were recorded.Results: Thirty-two patients of UR were managed during the three-year period out of 14128 total deliveries. The frequency of UR was 0.23%. The main etiological factors were previous scar rupture (31.25%), obstructed labour (28.12%), injudicious use of oxytocic drugs (12.50%) and major foetal abnormalities (12.50%).Conclusion: UR is an obstetrical tragedy, commonly seen in developing countries like Pakistan. It is most frequent in patients who have poor antenatal and intranatal care.

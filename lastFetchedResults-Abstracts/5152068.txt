Caching in mobile environment is complicated by the fact that the caches need to be kept consistent. Consistency in cache can be achieved by the Cache Invalidation Strategies. In this paper we assume synchronous stateful algorithm with the objective to maximize bandwidth utilization. Invalidation Reports (IRs) are periodically broadcasted and Updated Invalidation Reports (UIRs) are broadcasted as soon as an update occurs after an IR by the Mobile Support Station (MSS). This approach tries to minimize query delay and uses bandwidth efficiently, the query delay and bandwidth utilization are related to cache hit ratio. To improve cache hit ratio, instead of passively waiting, the clients prefetch the data (the data which has the maximum number of requests previously and has been modified is sent as it might have a future use).

Proposes an original approach to musical score recognition, a particular case of high-level document analysis. In order to overcome the limitations of existing systems, we propose an architecture which allows for a continuous and bidirectional interaction between high-level knowledge and low-level data, and which is able to improve itself over time by learning. This architecture is made of three cooperating layers, one made of parameterized feature detectors, another working as an object-oriented knowledge repository and the other as a supervising Bayesian metaprocessor. Although the implementation is still in progress, we show how this architecture is adequate for modeling and processing knowledge

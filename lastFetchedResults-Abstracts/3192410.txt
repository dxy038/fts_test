Wind power, as an alternative to fossil fuels, is plentiful, renewable, widely distributed, clean, produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, and uses little land. In operation, the overall cost per unit of energy produced is similar to the cost for new coal and natural gas installations. However, the stochastic behaviour of wind speeds leads to significant disharmony between wind energy production and electricity demand. Wind generation suffers from an intermittent characteristics due to the own diurnal and seasonal patterns of the wind behaviour. Both reactive power and voltage control are important under varying operating conditions of wind farm. To optimize reactive power flow and to keep voltages in limit, an optimization method is proposed in this paper. The objective proposed is minimization of the voltage deviations of the load buses (V<sub>desired</sub>). The approach considers the reactive power limits of wind generators and co-ordinates the transformer taps. This algorithm has been tested under practically varying conditions simulated on a test system. The results are obtained on a system of 50-bus real life equivalent power network. The result shows the efficiency of the proposed method.

A new type of linear ultrasonic motor is proposed in order to obtain large thrust of the motor. The system operates simultaneously in two modes that produce mutually orthogonal components of motion. Thus, elliptical motion at the contact surface with the guide is obtained. This new form of the construction produces large output power, bidirectional motion and large holding force without power. The results tested from the prototype motor exhibited a maximum thrust of 11 N, a maximum speed of 0.5 m/s, a maximum output power of 1.4 W, and a maximum holding force of 20 N. This motor will be expected to become a low cost and high efficiency linear motor when one improves it further

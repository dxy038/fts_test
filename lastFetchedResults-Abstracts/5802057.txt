In this paper, a fiber optic communication system has been employed using 10G/2.5G asymmetric gigabit passive optical network (XG-PON) architecture. In this system bidirectional optical fiber has been used for downstream data transmission. The system performance has been investigated for non-return-to-zero (NRZ) and return-to-zero (RZ) data formats by varying the length of the fiber and input power for co-existing GPON and XG-PON system. The results have been compared for NRZ and RZ formats for downstream data in terms of Q-factor and eye opening. It has been observed that RZ modulation format is superior compared to conventional NRZ modulation.

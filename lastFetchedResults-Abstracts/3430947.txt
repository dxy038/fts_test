The specific objective of this paper is to develop multiloop controllers that would achieve asymptotic regulation in the presence of parameter variations and disturbance inputs for a tubular reactor used in ammonia synthesis. The dynamic model considered here has nine state variables, two control inputs, and two outputs. A systematic procedure for pairing the two inputs with the corresponding two outputs is presented. The two multiloop proportional controllers so configured are designed via the parameter plane method. This economic configuration of controllers maintains the temperature profile almost at the optimal value whereas the point controllers fail to do so.

In wireless sensor networks, due to huge amount of packets convergent nature of upstream traffic and limited wireless bandwidth, network congestion happens easy, which is an urgent problem to be solved. The congestion control scheme is necessary to be carried out which can detect congestion precisely and regulate it fairly. To achieve this objective, a fuzzy logic based congestion control is proposed which takes advantage of current buffer occupancy and congestion index (CI) reflecting the congestion trend of each node as congestion level indications. In addition, it periodically calculates the congestion degree using fuzzy logic theory. At the same time each upstream traffic rate is adjusted according to the value of congestion degree. The scheme can quickly perceive the status and trends of the network load, and adjust quickly to avoid a lot of packet losses. Simulations are conducted for the proposal which shows that this implementation efficiently sorts out the traffic and minimizes the packet loss.

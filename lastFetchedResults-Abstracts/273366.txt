In this paper, we consider the plane problem of a frictionless receding contact between an elastic functionally graded
layer and a homogeneous half-space, when the two bodies are pressed together. The graded layer is modeled as a nonhomogeneous
medium with an isotropic stressâ€“strain law and over a certain segment of its top surface is subjected to
normal tractions while the rest of this surface is free of tractions. Since the contact between the two bodies is assumed to
be frictionless, then only compressive normal tractions can be transmitted in the contact area. Using integral transforms,
the plane elasticity equations are converted analytically into a singular integral equation in which the unknowns
are the contact pressure and the receding contact half-length. The global equilibrium condition of the layer is supplemented
to solve the problem. The singular integral equation is solved numerically using Chebychev polynomials and an
iterative scheme is employed to obtain the correct receding contact half-length that satisfies the global equilibrium condition.
The main objective of the paper is to study the effect of the material nonhomogeneity parameter and the thickness
of the graded layer on the contact pressure and on the length of the receding contact.

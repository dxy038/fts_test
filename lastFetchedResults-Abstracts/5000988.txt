Objective To investigate the photoelectric facial blood flow volume Characteristic of heart blood stasis syndrome (HBSS)in premature coronary heart disease(PCHD) and the relations between it and TXB<sub>2</sub>, 6-K-PGF1&#945;. Methods 102 PCHD patients was divided to HBSS group(36 cases), phlegm syndrome(PS) groups (35 cases) and healthy control group(31 cases); facial photoplethysmography detected using GD-3 type device, TXB<sub>2</sub>, 6-K-PGF1&#945; detected by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay and (ELISA) method. Results The Hb, He, Hf, Hb/Tab, Hf/Hb were significantly lower (P&lt;;0.01) in HBSS group compared with the control group; The Hb, He, Hf and Hf/Hb was significantly lower (P&lt;;0.01) in PS group compared with the control group; The Hb, Hb/Tab decreased significantly (P&lt;;0.01) in HBSS group compared with PS group; The content of Hb was lowest in HBSS group, and then the PS group and the control group; The content of TXB<sub>2</sub> was higher in HBSS group than other 2 groups, The 6-K-PGF1&#945; was lower than other 2 groups (P&lt;;0.01).With the dominant wave of photoplethysmography increased, TXB<sub>2</sub> values were gradually decreased, 6-K-PGF1&#945; values was gradually increased; There is a significant difference between low volatility group with high volatility group. There is a negative correlation with Hb and TXB<sub>2</sub>, a positive correlation with Hb and 6-K-PGF1&#945;. Conclusion Cardiac dysfunction and reduced of arterial compliance is one of the basic pathological changes of HBSS; there is a negative correlation with Hb and TXB<sub>2</sub>, a positive correlation with Hb and 6-K-PGF1&#945;. The Hb accurate responses to vasomotor vascular status and changes of bioactive substances in vivo. The 3 can be regarded as a diagnosis indicator of HBSS in PCHD.

This paper deals with the detail of identifying human factors in In-vehicle Intelligent Transport Information System (ITIS) and reveals the consequence of the effect of ITIS on driver-vehicle interface. On the basis of driving situation awareness, the ecological driver-vehicle interface analysis and optimization design for digital driving environment is performed, including the design principals, contexts and procedures. The objective is to design an ecological driver-vehicle interface with intelligent characteristics for new generation vehicle.

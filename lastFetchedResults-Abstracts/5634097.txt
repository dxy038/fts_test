A new mixed algorithm of genetic theory and particle swarm optimization (GA-PSO) have been proposed in this paper to tackle the optimal design problem of hybrid active power filter (HAPF) in its parameter design and investment optimization, considering the better convergence of genetic theory and fast convergence of particle swarm optimization. It takes the original investment, the capacity of reactive power compensation and harmonic distortion as three objectives, and penalty function theory have been used to convert multi-objective design problems into single-objective design problems. Finally a HAPF simulation under the background of PSCAD/EMTDC has been analyzed, the results show that the proposed optimal design method of HAPF can save cost, enhance performance-price ratio and filtering performance.

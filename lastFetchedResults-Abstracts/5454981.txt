This paper reports the progress on a previous work in which we described our experience in using the high-level models provided by the DiVA Framework to design the self-adaptive behavior of autonomous robots. The main objective of this work is to discuss how these models can be translated into a run-time self-adaptive architecture for resource-constrained robots. In order to achieve this goal, the models developed for the case study presented as part of the previous work (based on a Victim-Rescuer scenario) serve as the starting point to manually obtain a self-adaptive component-based architecture, which we have implemented using Cecilia (a C distribution of the Fractal component model) and deployed on two e-pucks (low-cost mobile robotics platform). Through this implementation, we try to identify the generic rules that will allow us to obtain (by means of an automated Model-to-Text transformation) self-adaptive robotics software from the DiVA design-time models. The lessons learned from this experience are reported at the end of the paper, leaving the way open for further improvements on self-adaptive robotics.

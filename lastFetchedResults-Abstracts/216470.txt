Objective
This study was performed to evaluate the normative data and psychometric
properties and the internal consistency of the Farsi (Persian) version of the
Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) self-report form, as a screening
tool in a community-based sample of 12 to 17 year-old adolescents of urban
Tehran.
Materials & Methods
In this investigation, 1105 adolescents (12 to 17 years old), selected from 250
clustersfrom all the 22 municipality areas of Tehran, responded to 25 questions
of the Farsi version of SDQ self-report form. The frequency of each symptom
domains according to Goodman's cutoff points and so" percentile and the
mean score in each subscale were determined.
Results
The so" percentile cutoff points were somewhat different from those of the
previous reports. Using Goodman's cutoff points, the prevalence of symptom
domains was relatively high. For example, 13.7 percent of the adolescents
studied had total scores equal to 20 or more. There were significant correlations
between different subscales and their constituting questions.
Conclusion
Self-report form of SDQ is a valuable tool in the screening of adolescent
psychopathologies. Frequency of majority of the symptom domains seems to
be higher in the adolescents in Tehran urban areas

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL) is a key molecule in innate immunity, this acute phase protein, synthesized in the liver, binds to various microorganisms and damaged cells and destroys them by opsonization of aggressive agents and activation of the complement by relevant serine associated proteases.
METHODS: In this review study, we investigated the literature from Scopus, Pubmed and Google Scholar databases using the following keywords: Genetic, Molecular Epidemiology Mannose Binding Lectin, Immunity, and Infectious disease.
FINDINGS: There are significant differences in serum levels of MBL and its genetic stability and this is due to genetic polymorphism of MBL and because of alteration of structural gene and the promoter region. 
CONCLUSION: Homozygous or heterozygous individuals with compound structural MBL gene are susceptible to some malignancies, infectious and autoimmune diseases. Administration of plasma-free or recombinant MBL, may be helpful to treat certain patients have limited amount of it.
KEY WORDS: Mannose Binding Lectin(MBL), gene polymorphism, Immune system, infectious diseases.

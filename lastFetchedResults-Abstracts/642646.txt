Abstract
Objective
A diet rich in natural antioxidants in combination with anticancer therapy is important in reducing morbidity and mortality in addition to diminishing toxicity and side effects of chemotherapeutic agents. Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II, cis-Pt) is a common chemotherapeutic agent, but it causes side effects, including hematologic toxicity with changes in the biological function of blood cells.
Methods

We compared the action of two phenolic compounds isolated from the bark of Yucca schidigera: trans-3,3′,5,5′-tetrahydroxy-4′-methoxystilbene and resveratrol (trans-3,4′,5 – trihydroxystilbene, present also in grapes and wine) on oxidative stress induced by cisplatin (used in chemotherapy) and selenium-cisplatin conjugate ([NH3]2Pt(SeO3 [Se-Pt], with a slight toxic effect on blood cells) in human blood platelets and peripheral blood lymphocytes.
Results

The trans-3,3′,5,5′-tetrahydroxy-4′-methoxystilbene, like resveratrol, significantly inhibited protein carbonylation (measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot analysis) in blood platelets treated with platinum compounds (10 μg/mL) and markedly reduced oxidation of thiol groups of proteins in these cells. The trans-3,3′,5,5′-tetrahydroxy-4′-methoxystilbene, like resveratrol, caused a distinct reduction of platelet lipid peroxidation induced by platinum compounds. The combined action of the tested phenolic compounds with Se-Pt evoked a significant decrease in DNA damage (measured by the comet assay) in lymphocytes compared with cells treated with Se-Pt only.
Conclusion

We conclude that one promising natural product may be trans-3,3′,5,5′-tetrahydroxy-4′-methoxystilbene, because it is a stronger antioxidant in the tested models in vitro compared with resveratrol (P < 0.05). The trans-3,3′,5,5′-tetrahydroxy-4′-methoxystilbene can also be useful as a protective factor against platinum compounds during chemotherapy or cancer prophylaxis.

Background: The Mentha spices can growth and adaptation with different climatology.
Objective: This research was performed to investigate adaptation, suitable growth period, identification of suitable agronomy characters and identification of essential oil compounds of 2 ecotypes of water mint.
Methods: This research was performed in Research Institute of Forest and Rangelands during 6 years in 1999 to 2004. Was conducted as a split plot at time by using of randomized complete block design (RCBD) with 3 replications. Main and sub factors were ecotype and year, respectively.
Results: There was difference significant between ecotypes on plant height, leaf long and total essential oil yield (??0.01) and lateral stem number, essential oil yield of flower and leaf yield (??0.05). There was significant difference between difference years on all traits at 0.01level. Investigation effect of year√ó ecotype showed that there was difference significant between plant heights (? ?0.01), leaf long, essential oil percent of leaf and yield of flowering shoot (??0.05). There was difference significant between ectype2 with lateral stem number (29.44n/p), leaf yield (475579g/ha) and yield of essential oil (3314.5g/ha) than ecotype1 on lateral stem number (25.94n/p), leaf yield (460040g/ha) and yield of leaf essential oil (3224.2 g/ha). Mean comparison of years showed that highest and least flower yield with 48695 g/ha and 27733 g/ha belong to 2th and 6th years, respectively.The highest leaf yield were 506723, 506225 and 549352 g/ha 1n first, second and 3th years. Main components were carvone with 50.58% and 76.03% in Ardabil and ghilan ecotypes, respectively.
Conclusion: There was different essential oil compounds between different ecotypes and suitable using period of water mint were 3-4 years

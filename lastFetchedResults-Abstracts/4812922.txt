In defense against missile attack there are three participants. The Target, the Missile, that intercepts the Target, and the Defender, that protects the Target by interception of the missile. This is a three person game, the Target, the Missile and the Defender (TMD) game. The dynamic game theory is applied to derive guidance laws for the TMD scenario. In such scenario the objective of the Defender is minimizing its distance to the Missile while the objective of the Missile is to maximize its distance from the Defender and at the same time not to jeopardize its effort to intercept the Target, i.e. minimizing its miss while the Target performs avoidance maneuvers. The performance of the games theory based guidance law is compared to case when the target performs evasive constant acceleration maneuver, and the missile and defender implement Proportional Navigation. It is shown that the application of the game theory based guidance law reduces significantly the miss of both the target- missile miss and the missile-defender miss as well as the required acceleration levels.

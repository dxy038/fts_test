Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is a powerful programming technique with the objective of improving modularity by encapsulating crosscutting concerns. The nature of AOP makes it prone to unexpected and harmful interactions between the different components of a system. The claim behind this PhD is that unit tests can be used to detect these interactions. In this paper we explain how these can be accomplished. A brief state of the art, work plan and a support tool (drUID) are also presented.

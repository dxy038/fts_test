This paper describes a research project being undertaken in BNR (Bell Northern Research), to investigate ATM based architectures and technology for the next generation multi-media, multi-service broadband access platforms. It provides an overview of the project and the high level results to date. A more detailed analysis is provided of one aspect of the work considered a critical underpinning for any multimedia network deployment, i.e. flow control. Finally it details a collaborative industry/academia project, the objective of which, is to take the research beyond theory through building an experimental network

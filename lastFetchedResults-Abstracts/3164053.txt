This paper aims to provide comparative performance evaluation of various available TCP algorithms over a hybrid local area network comprising by, both wired and wireless sections. Although TCP originally was designed aiming to control internet traffic, LAN networks increasingly depend on new TCP protocol versions to provide congestion control, fairness and optimum resource utilization. Additionally wireless LANsÂ´ popularity increase exponentially. Based on the aforementioned observations, the objective of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, to present an adequate test-bed enabling, through a significant number of experiments, an accurate performance evaluation of five different TCP versions available by a typical Linux distribution. Secondly based on the conclusions extracted, propose efficient, yet low complexity modifications, able to improve network performance of the considered scenarios.

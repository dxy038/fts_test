In the operation of power systems it has become necessary not only to consider pursuit of economy but also to take various other requirements into consideration. In order to do away with the shortcomings of conventional approaches, a technique determining the optimal operation states has been proposed, whereby operating problems involving plural objectives are formulated as multi-objective programming, and the fuzzy coordination technique is applied. Economy has been selected as the primary objective while security and the ensuring of AFC (automatic frequency control) regulation capacity have been taken up as sub-objectives. While the pursuit of economy is indispensable to supply low-priced electric power to the customers, consideration for security should be conducted in order to provide stable electric power supply. A new evolution index for AFC regulation capacity margin is proposed. The effectiveness of the technique ensuring AFC regulation capacity margin based on the fuzzy coordination technique with consideration given to economy and security is clarified

OBJECTIVE: our purpose was to determine whether interleukin-10 is expressed in human placental tissue, which might imply a role of it in fetal allograft protection.
STUDY DESIGN: Detection of interleukin-10 messenger ribonucleic acid in human placental tissue and in human placental JAR cells by reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction was studied.
RESULTS: Interleukin-10 messenger ribonucleic acid was detected in human placental tissue from term mothers and in human placental JAR cells. Sequence analysis of the expected interleukin-10 complementary deoxyribonucleic acid fragment revealed 100% homology to authentic interleukin-10 complementary deoxyribonucleic acid.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that human placental tissue from term mothers expressed high levels of interleukin-10 messenger ribonucleic acid, suggesting that cells that produce interleukin-10 and that are associated with the placenta may play a role in preventing rejection of the fetal allograft by the mother.

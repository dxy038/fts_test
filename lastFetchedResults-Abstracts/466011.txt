Objective: Adenosine administration to the uterine vasculature of the nonpregnant oophorectomized sheep results in dose-related increases in uterine blood flow. This study was designed to determine whether these adenosine-induced increases in uterine blood flow are mediated in part by nitric oxide release. Study Design: Five nonpregnant oophorectomized ewes had catheters placed in the femoral artery and vein and in the lateral branches of the right and left main uterine arteries. Adenosine dissolved in isotonic sodium chloride solution was infused into the uterine artery at sequentially increasing doses (1, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 μg/min), and a dose-response curve was constructed. After determination of control responses to adenosine a 10-mg/kg dose of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nω-nitro- -arginine methyl ester was administered into the femoral vein; the dose-response curves to adenosine were then determined again. Responses after Nω-nitro- -arginine methyl ester administration were compared with those obtained before nitric oxide blockade. Results: Adenosine increased uterine blood flow in a dose-related fashion, from a baseline of 11 ± 2 mL/min to 140 ± 19 mL/min. No further increase was seen with adenosine doses >300 μg/min. There were no significant alterations in systemic arterial pressure or heart rate in response to uterine infusion of adenosine. Nω-nitro- -arginine methyl ester administration increased baseline blood pressure 24% ± 4% and decreased heart rate 13% ± 4%. Responses to adenosine after Nω-nitro- -arginine methyl ester administration were significantly reduced, from a maximum at the highest dose of 140 ± 19 mL/min to 95 ± 13 mL/min (P< .001). Conclusion: A significant portion of adenosine-induced vasodilation in the uterine vasculature appears to be mediated by the release of nitric oxide. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;183:46-51.)

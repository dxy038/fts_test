Plastic profiles produced by extrusion die are cooled down and calibrated by calibrators, so it is very important to properly design the cooling system in calibrator for the profile quality. Based on the finite element method (FEM) and the finite difference method (FDM), the numerical simulation of the cooling process is realized for plastic profile within calibrator. The simultaneous shape and topology optimization design is developed for the cooling system in calibrator. A mathematical model is constructed in which the cooling uniformity and efficiency of each domain in the cross sections of the calibrator´s exit are taken as the objective function. An evolutionary optimization method is presented to treat such topological problems whereby cooling channel is introduced or eliminated within the calibrator through a sequence of shape optimization processes. A mathematical programming technique enables the optimal location of the cooling channels plus their shape. The correctness and validity of the design method are illustrated through optimization design of SF66 profile´s calibrator.

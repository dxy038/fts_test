The future load growth and change of generation mix brought by increasing penetration of renewable energy resources has raised many challenges in power systems planning today. This paper summarizes the development process of the 2013 Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) Interconnection-wide Transmission Plan (Plan). Key observations and recommendations are also provided based on the study results. The objective of the Plan is to provide information to stakeholders to support their decision-making processes. It is these decisions on where and when to build new transmission or generation, or to take other related actions, that ensure the Western Interconnection is reliable, low-cost, efficient, and environmentally responsible, while appropriately balancing risks and opportunities.

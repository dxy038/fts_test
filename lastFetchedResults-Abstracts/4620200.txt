REMINE project aims to develop an integrated system to manage risk associated with patient safety. The system is a computer based platform that facilitates integration of diverse multimedia data, providing an interface between clinical activity and risk management. The project objective is to develop a framework whereby data is extracted from a heterogeneous source. This framework is designed to make it possible to efficiently handle risk management data and to trial, validate and evaluate new risk management processes to improve on patient safety.

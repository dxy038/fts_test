Template matching is used for many applications in image processing. Cross correlation is the basic statistical approach to image registration. It is used for template matching or pattern recognition. Template can be considered a sub-image from the reference image, and the image can be considered as a sensed image. The objective is to establish the correspondence between the reference image and sensed image. It gives the measure of the degree of similarity between an image and template. This paper describes medical image registration by template matching based on Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) using Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. The algorithm for template matching using NCC is implemented in MATLAB. The algorithm does the template matching and uses the Cauchy-SchwartzÂ´s inequality to simplify the procedure. The developed algorithm is robust for similarity measure. An experimental result with medical images registration with noise and without noise is shown in the results section.

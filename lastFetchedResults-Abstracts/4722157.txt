With the rapid economic development in China, the industrial pollution emission seriously threatens our living environment. Due to the lack of external constraints, enterprises may not consciously control polluting and protect environment. So it is essential for the government to implement regulation on the polluting behavior of enterprises. The reason of environmental pollution is the externality of the polluting behavior. After introducing the principle and the objective of government regulation in the control of pollution, the paper analyzes the influence of government regulation on the polluting behavior of enterprises on the basis of game theory. The conclusion is that the effective punishing measures must be taken to give full play to the role of government regulation.

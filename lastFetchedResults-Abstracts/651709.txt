Mediterranean forests provide a wide array of benefits; however, most of them are poorly recognized. This paper presents the results of a study, that attempts to value comprehensively all forest benefits in Mediterranean countries. Its objective is to arrive at a rough order of magnitude of total forest value in each country and in the Mediterranean region as a whole, and of the composition of this value, using available data. Forest benefits are identified based on a common framework and valued using a range of methods. The results, although constrained by data limitations in some cases, show the absolute and relative importance of the different forest benefits, and how they vary across countries.

In this paper, an on-line optimization approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) for DC motor speed control is proposed. Here, the main idea is to design speed controllers, discovering on-line the gains. In this work both PID controllers and sliding mode controllers (SMC) are considered. The main contributions are the optimization approach based on the minimization of an objective (cost) function based on different indexes including the Harris index, and the on-line serialization of the parallel PSO optimization scheme. In order to show the performance, simulation results with a nonlinear neural model of the Feedback setup with the DC motor 63-110 are presented.

The concentrations of aero-cation and aero-anion are measured on typical urban green space in Jilin City to study the effect of ecological community structure on aero-anion concentration at urban green space. The data are analyzed with analysis of variance. The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of different urban green space on aero-anion concentration. This study will help design green-lands, construct aero-anion areas, and deeply inquire into the effects and influence mechanism of different plants on aero-anion. On the urban green space of the same ecological community structures, the daily average concentration of aero-anion is steady. The results show the concentration is significantly affected by community structures of urban green space.

Interleukin-10−/− (IL-10) knockout (KO) mice develop an intestinal inflammation that closely mimics human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which is accompanied by inflammation-associated bone abnormalities and elevated serum proinflammatory cytokines. The objective of this study was to use the IL-10 KO mouse model to determine whether flaxseed oil (FO) diet, rich in α-linolenic acid (ALA), attenuates intestinal inflammation and inflammation-associated bone abnormalities, compared to a corn oil (CO) control diet. Male wild-type (WT) or IL-10 KO mice were fed a 10% CO or 10% FO diet from weaning (postnatal day 28) for 9 weeks. At necropsy, serum, intestine, femurs and lumbar vertebrae were collected and analyzed. IL-10 KO mice fed CO had lower femur bone mineral content (BMC; P<.001), bone mineral density (BMD; P<.001), peak load (P=.033) and lumbar vertebrae BMD (P=.02) compared to WT mice fed either diet. Flaxseed oil had a modest, favorable effect on IL-10 KO mice as femur BMC, BMD and peak load were similar to WT mice fed CO or FO. In addition, lumbar vertebra BMD was similar among IL-10 KO mice fed FO and WT mice fed CO or FO. The fact that FO attenuated serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) among IL-10 KO mice suggests that the positive effects of FO on femur BMC, BMD, peak load and vertebral BMD in IL-10 KO mice may have been partly mediated by changes in serum TNF-α. In conclusion, these findings suggest that a dietary level of ALA attainable from a 10% flaxseed oil diet results in modest improvements in some bone outcomes but does not attenuate intestinal inflammation that is characteristic of IL-10 KO mice.

The objective of this minitrack is to explore the potential for Knowledge Management (KM) to enhance creativity and drive innovation. Managing knowledge for creativity and innovation is clearly different from exploiting knowledge for routine work when new procedures are known. Although this is recognized a high priority, and is often cited as a primary reason organizations get involved in KM, the majority of research focuses on knowledge reuse and transfer of best practices, rather than how knowledge is created and applied to derive business value, generate new ideas, and develop new products and solutions.

The gas flow rates for hazardous air pollutant emissions are generally large and their concentrations are low (in ppm ~ a few % levels). When we try to treat directly the large flow rate and low concentration exhaust gas, the energy efficiency becomes low and the size of the equipment becomes large, resulting in high operating cost. The objective of the present study is to convert the exhaust gas with large flow rate and low concentration into the one with small flow rate and high concentration by desorbing the absorbed gas from the absorbent packed inside a nonthermal plasma (NTP) reactor by the application of the atmospheric-pressure plasma.

When following a path, there are several possibilities attending to the way in which the actual robot state can be related with the whole path. In this work, we formulate different tracking methods on the base that a memorized path can be described by a single descriptor parameter (the objective point is readily given by this parameter). We classify path tracking according to the way in which we impose or design the progress of descriptor parameter. Benefits and disadvantages of each method are identified. We also summarize how to construct each method. Despite that this classification is generic, application to mobile robots and chained systems is very valuable due to the importance of tracking problem in them and because their desired path is usually memorized

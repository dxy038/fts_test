Inroduction & Objective: Anxiety is a respond of anorganism to a likely treat which can disturb the cellular homstasis. Serotonergic & cannabinoidergic systems contribute in many physiologic behaviors like anxiety. This study was done to investigate the effect of cannabinoidergic system on central amygdala and its interference with serotonergic system on anxiety in "Elevated Plus Maze"
Materials and Methods: After a week resting , several doses of Arachidonile Cyclo Propyle Amide (ACPA) and selected Agonist of serotonergic receptore 1 (5-HT1) with commercial name of " CP94253 Hydrochloride" has been Microinjected into Central Amygdala of rat. The presence in Open Arms Time percent  (OAT%) and the number of entrance  into the open arms percent (OAE%) and locomotor activity (LA) was measured. 
Results: Injection of ACPA has no effect anxiety behaviors. Injection of high doses of agonist of serotonergic receptor has also got no effect of anxiety. microinjection of  non effective dose of CP94253 Hydrochloride into Central Amygdala could suppres the anxyolitic effect of ACPA.
Conclusion: Presynaptic cannabinoid receptore of CB1 could inhibit many neurotransmitters secration like serotonin and it seems that serotonin agonist could replace the inhibited neurotransmitter by ACPA.

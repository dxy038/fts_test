Background and Objective: In order to prevent obesity it is essential to identify its determinants. This study aimed to assess the association between duration of breastfeeding and subsequent obesity among female adolescents in Najafabad, Isfahan, Iran. 
Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, data were collected on 550 female adolescents aged 15-18 years selected by multistage cluster random sampling from Najafabad high schools. Anthropometric measurements were made and the body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Information on duration of breastfeeding and other required variables was collected by interviewing parents using questionnaires. Overweight and obesity were defined on the basis of TOTF cut-points.                                                                              
Results: The mean (± SD) duration of breastfeeding was 19.7±8.1 months, and the prevalence of overweight and obesity 20.5% and 6%, respectively. Breastfeeding as such (that is, without considering its duration), was significantly associated with a reduced risk of overweight or obesity (25.8% for breastfed, vs 50% for non-breastfed, adolescent, P = 0.02). However, no statistically significant association was found between duration of breastfeeding and either overweight or obesity in the subjects (r= -0.007, P=0.87). 
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that breastfeeding may reduce subsequent risk of obesity and overweight in female adolescents, although we found no association between duration of breastfeeding and adolescent overweight or obesity.

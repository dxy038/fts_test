This paper studies the optimization model of a linear objective function subject to a system of fuzzy relation inequalities (FRI) with the max-Einstein composition operator. If its feasible domain is non-empty, then we show that its feasible solution set is completely determined by a maximum solution and a finite number of minimal solutions. Also, an efficient algorithm is proposed to solve the model based on the structure of FRI path, the concept of partial solution, and the branch-and-bound approach. The algorithm finds an optimal solution of the model without explicitly generating all the minimal solutions. Some sufficient conditions are given that under them, some of the optimal components of the model are directly determined. Some procedures are presented to reduce the search domain of an optimal solution of the original problem based on the conditions. Then the reduced domain is decomposed (if possible) into several sub-domains with smaller dimensions that finding the components of the optimal solution in each sub-domain is very easy. In order to obtain an optimal solution of the original problem, we propose another more efficient algorithm which combines the first algorithm, these procedures, and the decomposition method. Furthermore, sufficient conditions are suggested that under them, the problem has a unique optimal solution. Also, a comparison between the recently proposed algorithm and the known ones will be made.

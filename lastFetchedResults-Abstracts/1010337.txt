The effectiveness and cost are two important parameters in heat exchanger design. The total cost includes the capital investment for equipment (heat exchanger surface area) and operating cost (for energy expenditures related to pumping). Tube arrangement, tube diameter, tube pitch ratio, tube length, tube number, baffle spacing ratio as well as baffle cut ratio were considered as seven design parameters. For optimal design of a shell and tube heat exchanger, it was first thermally modeled using ε–NTU method while Bell–Delaware procedure was applied to estimate its shell side heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop. Fast and elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) with continuous and discrete variables were applied to obtain the maximum effectiveness (heat recovery) and the minimum total cost as two objective functions. The results of optimal designs were a set of multiple optimum solutions, called ‘Pareto optimal solutions’. The sensitivity analysis of change in optimum effectiveness and total cost with change in design parameters of the shell and tube heat exchanger was also performed and the results are reported.

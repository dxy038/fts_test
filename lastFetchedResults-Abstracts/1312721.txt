A ratio of crop evapotranspiration (ETC) to reference evapotranspiration (ETO) determines a crop coefficient (KC) value, which is related to specific crop phenological development to improve transferability of the KC values. Development of KC can assist in predicting crop irrigation needs using meteorological data from weather stations. The objective of the research was conducted to determine growth-stage-specific KC and crop water use for maize (Zea Mays) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) at Texas AgriLife Research field in Uvalde, TX, USA from 2002 to 2008. Seven lysimeters, weighing about 14 Mg, consisted of undisturbed 1.5 m × 2.0 m × 2.2 m deep soil monoliths. Six lysimeters were located in the center of a 1-ha field beneath a linear-move sprinkler system equipped with low energy precision application (LEPA). A seventh lysimeter was established to measure reference grass ETO. Crop water requirements, KC determination, and comparison to existing FAO KC values were determined over a 3-year period for both maize and sorghum. Accumulated seasonal crop water use ranged between 441 and 641 mm for maize and between 491 and 533 mm for sorghum. The KC values determined during the growing seasons varied from 0.2 to 1.2 for maize and 0.2 to 1.0 for sorghum. Some of the values corresponded and some did not correspond to those from FAO-56 and from the Texas High Plains and elsewhere in other states. We assume that the development of regionally based and growth-stage-specific KC helps in irrigation management and provides precise water applications for this region.

We study the problem of distributed least-squares estimation over ad hoc adaptive networks, where the nodes have a common objective to estimate and track a parameter vector. We consider the case where there is stationary additive colored noise on both the regressors and the output response, which results in biased local least-squares estimators. Assuming that the noise covariance can be estimated (or is known a priori), we first propose a bias-compensated recursive least-squares algorithm (BC-RLS). However, this bias compensation increases the variance or the mean-square deviation (MSD) of the local estimators, and errors in the noise covariance estimates may still result in residual bias. We demonstrate that the MSD and residual bias can then be significantly reduced by applying diffusion adaptation, i.e., by letting nodes combine their local estimates with those of their neighbors. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for mean-square stability of the algorithm, under some mild assumptions. Furthermore, we derive closed-form expressions for its steady-state mean and mean-square performance. Simulation results are provided, which agree well with the theoretical results. We also consider some special cases where the mean-square stability improvement of diffusion BC-RLS over BC-RLS can be mathematically verified.

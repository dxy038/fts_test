This paper presents the development and application of a housing performance evaluation model for multi-family residential buildings in Korea. This model is intended to encourage initiatives toward achieving better housing performance and to support a homebuyer's decision-making on housing comparison and selection. Forty-one objective and feasible housing performance indicators, which were selected from the review of existing evaluation models and interviews with experts, are classified into a series of categories. The weights of each category and indicator are calculated by using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) analysis, and a weight is converted into credit. Next, the performance grades are divided into four levels, and evaluation criteria are suggested based on statutory performance value or the one frequently met in practice. Finally, the evaluation program and the application procedure are established through the field case study. This model can be used for objective and practical evaluation and comparison of residential housing alternatives.

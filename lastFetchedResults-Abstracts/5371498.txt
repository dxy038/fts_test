Today´s society is undergoing constant changes and this is reflected in the way the working world is structured. There is an increasing need of qualified professionals having to face changes and prove effective competencies dealing with the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). In this sense, the 21st Century university should offer students the suitable learning tools to become successful professionals. With this goal in mind the Tunning Project aims at implementing active methodologies by enhancing content learning and competencies acquisition. In this paper, we include a comparative study of the efficiency of new learning methodologies across subjects, degrees and academic cycles and focus on the role of the ICTs in the learning process. Our objective is to assess the suitability of these new methodologies for technical subjects. Finally, we present a survey on professors´ willingness to implement active methodologies.

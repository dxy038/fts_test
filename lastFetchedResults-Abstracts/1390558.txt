The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of racing on the serum concentrations of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB) in 32 racing greyhounds. Blood samples were collected 24 h prior to a 7 km race (T0), within 2 h of completion of the race (T1), and 24 h post-race (T2). Blood samples were also collected from 20 non-racing greyhounds. The median cTnI concentration in the racing greyhounds was not significantly different from that in the non-racing greyhounds (0.045 ng/mL).

 racing, the median cTnI concentration in the racing greyhounds was 0.050 ng/mL. Following the 7 km race, 31/32 greyhounds showed increases in cTnI concentrations which were significantly higher than the pre-race concentrations (P &lt; 0.0001). cTnI concentrations dropped back 24 h post-race to values not significantly different from the pre-race concentrations. Following the race, 5/32 greyhounds showed mild increases in CK-MB concentrations but these were not significantly different from the pre-race values. These findings could be of importance when evaluating greyhounds with suspected cardiac disease that have recently performed hard exercise.

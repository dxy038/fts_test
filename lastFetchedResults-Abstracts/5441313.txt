In the last years many different technologies and air interfaces have been standardized. B3G systems will allow the integration and coexistence of these diverse technologies in a common environment. It is a priority objective of this scenario of have a flexible terminal that can dynamically select the most appropriate RAT and reconfigure itself from the physical to the application layer. This reconfiguration can be carried out by downloading the various software modules that form the new RAT through the air interface on which it is currently operating. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the performance of the software download procedure when the terminal is operating in an IEEE 802.11 WLAN.

In the past, Malaysian currency notes was not designed to cater for the visually impaired. Recently, Braille markings have been incorporated in the Malaysian ringgit notes. However, blind Malaysians who do not understand Braille, find difficulties in recognizing different Malaysian bank notes. There are devices available in the market but they do not cater for Malaysian currencies and are very expensive. The objective of this project is to develop an affordable low cost compact device to assist blind people to distinguish Malaysian bank notes. Currency Note Recognizer (CNR) detects different colors of the Malaysian bank notes and outputs various beeping sound patterns to indicate the respective Malaysian bank note value.

The paper presents a new method for the measurement of the leakage current of surge arresters. A prototype version of the current transducer is developed and a series of experimental studies on a large number of arresters are carried out. Thus obtained measurements were examined in detail. The main objective of this research is to improve the measurement equipment and diagnostic methods for the field testing of metal-oxide surge arresters as well as conventional arresters.

Ablation of submicron structures on nickel, aluminum, copper, chromium, gold, silicon and germanium is presented by short ultraviolet laser pulses (0.5 ps, 248 nm). Features like periodic line structures with a line-spacing below 400 nm, and holes with characteristic sizes well below 1 μm are produced on the sample surface by single laser shot exposure. The structures are projection printed by a Schwarzschild-objective (N.A.=0.4) in air environment. A comparison of the morphology of ablation sites of various materials with different pulse durations (100 fs–50 ps) is presented. The role of thermal diffusion effects is discussed.

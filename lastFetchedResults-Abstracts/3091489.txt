In recent years evolutionary computation has its growth to extent. Amidst various evolutionary computation approaches, genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimisation are used in optimisation problems. The two approaches find a solution to a given objective function employing different procedures and computational techniques; as a result their performance can be evaluated and compared. The problem area chosen is that of lower order system modelling used in control systems engineering. Integral square error is used as an indicator for selecting the lower order model.

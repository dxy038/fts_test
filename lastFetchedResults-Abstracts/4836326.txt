Ultrasound imaging technique is widely used in the obstetrics and gynecology for the first-line screening modality. However, the poor image quality usually leads to the interpretation of the disease and the abnormal lesions difficulty. The objective of this study is to apply imaging processing techniques for the improvement of the visual perception ability of ultrasound images. In this experiment, we present a novel algorithm based on the combination of fuzzy set processing and radon transform. We firstly fuzzify the original image by S function which can be determined by the maximum entropy principle. Subsequently, we apply the radon transform and add in a filter of triangular function for removing unnecessary signal. Finally, backprojection stage is used to reconstruct the ultrasound image with an enhancement contrast. In the simulation results of ultrasound images, we can easily identify the enhanced tissues and lesions instead of unwanted artifact. In conclusion, the performance of the proposed approach confirms that the enhanced method is effective and practical for the clinical diagnosis.

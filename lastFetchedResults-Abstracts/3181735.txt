Objective: To set up judgment model of traditional Chinese medicine efficacy of Asthma among adults based on longitudinal data analysis and recognize and control effects made by some factors and distinguish influence of interaction of factors to outcomes. Methods: Records of adult asthma treated by Chinese medicine were included from the modern database. This information was extracted, standard and quantitative. Using logistic regression analysis, the symptoms of medical cases was considered as a variable, the probability of patients with the target disease was drawn. Then efficacy could be assessed by comparing the probability of disease before and after diagnosis. Results: The data consisted of 150 cases of medical record including 211 indexes, 99 in experimental group and 51 in case control group. Through the rank and test index selection 38 groups had significant difference and could be used for logistic model. Variables finally into the model and its weight were: rapid pulse (x1,-0.546), asthma (x2, 0.575), chest pain (x3,-0.561), coated tongue (x4,-1.478), white thin coated tongue (x5,0.708), crimson tongue (x6,-1.786), tout pulse (x7,0.937) and throat gurgling with sputum (x8,1.364). Discussion: The efficiency of this model is closely related with data integrity and the selection of symptoms by experienced clinical specialists. Corresponding relationship between medicine and diseases should be taken into consideration in future research. Discussion: The effective of this model is connective with detailed descriptions of medical records, and symptom selected by experienced clinical specialists. Corresponding relationship between medicine and disease should be taken into consideration in future research.

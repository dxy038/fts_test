This paper deals with the modeling, analysis and controlled simulation (motion control) of a two degree of freedom pan tilt platform (PTP) for positioning or aiming a device. The PTP has two revolute joints. The PTP, with two degrees of freedom, is a device that makes it possible for the camera to point in a desired direction when mounted under a carrier such as an aircraft. The objective of this research work is to derive a linear and nonlinear control system of the PTP to point in a desired direction within allowable specifications. This paper covers the feedback control system with PD controllers for position control of pan and tilt mechanism. These PD controllers derived from linear system model are also used in nonlinear control system simulation. The nonlinear control system developed in this paper is nearest to the physical system. To perform the analysis and simulation, all the parameters involved in the system dynamics were identified. The practicality of this research work can be extended to a broad range of applications. The most apparent use is in security, where there is a strong emphasis on reliably neutralizing threats without risking human life. The unmanned aerial systems (i.e. the PTP on unmanned aerial vehicle) can provide significant reductions in manpower and risk to humans for critical security roles. The role of PTP has been increased significantly in the last few years in the security and defense applications.

This paper describes a rate control algorithm for a streaming video system that dynamically transcodes stored JPEG 2000 frames. The proposed algorithm is designed to improve overall quality over a static rate control method by increasing bandwidth utilization, while satisfying buffer constraints and maintaining consistent quality over time. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of both objective measures and subjective evaluation

A four-wire voice-coil actuator is designed and optimized for use in a near-field optical drive. The first objective was to design a lens holder which could accommodate a large-size lens module while possessing a strong mechanical structure. The second objective was to optimize the yoke so that the magnetic field would be uniform within the stroke range of the voice coils. These improvements eventually helped to improve the bandwidth of the frequency response of the actuator

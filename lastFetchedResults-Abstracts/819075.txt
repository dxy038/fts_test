
Abstract
Background and Objective:Gastroenteritisis one of the most common forms of Salmonellosis, which is a worldwide problem.The invasive characteristic of intestinal bacteria is one of their pathogenicitymechanisms, which can be easily investigated by cell culture technique.  In this study, theinvasive characteristic of some Salmonellaserogroupwas investigated by usingHEP-2 cell.
Material and Methods:Therectalsoaps were prepared from 280 diarrhea patients referred to Imam Khomeyni and children medical centres, 140 with bloody diarrhea and 140 with watery diarrhea as a comparison group. The rectal soaps were obtained from the patients before taking any antibiotics, and 140 rectal specimens were taken from healthy people as a control group. All the samples were inoculated in differential and selective media, likeHektoenand Xylose lysine deoxycholate (XLD) agar .After incubation at 37C for 24 hours, the colonies were examined and identified by conventional biochemical and serological tests. Using   HEP-2, cellular invasion characteristic of Salmonella serogroups was assessed. Moreover, the antibiotic resistance patterns were performed according to clinical and laboratory standards institute (CLSI).
Results: Of all tested samples, 35(8.3%) areSalmonella strains.  The frequency of Salmonellaisreported for bloody diarrhea (5.2%),    watery diarrhea (1.7%) and   control group (1.4%).The most abundant serogroups with invasive characteristic, using HEP-2 cell culture, areserogroup B (62.9%) and D (17.2%). 
Conclusion: The results obtained in this study show that the majority of Salmonellaisolatesare without invasive characteristic.

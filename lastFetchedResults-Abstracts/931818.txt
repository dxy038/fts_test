Antimicrobial packaging with lactic acid bacteria incorporated into the film matrix is a novel approach for controlling the growth of food-borne pathogens in ready-to-eat food. The overall objective of this study was to assess the effect of two strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and nisin trapped in an alginate matrix, on Listeria monocytogenes growth on vacuum packed cold-smoked salmon. A film was formulated containing two LAB strains and nisin (100 IU/mL). LAB viability and bacteriocin like substance production (BLS) were assessed using the plate antagonism technique. To check the film antagonistic activity, pieces of salmon (4.0 × 4.0 cm2), inoculated with L. monocytogenes at a final concentration of 104 CFU/cm2, were covered with film containing both LAB strains plus nisin and stored at 4 °C. L. monocytogenes colonies on OXA agar were counted after 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days to evaluate pathogen inhibition. All treatments led to effective diffusion of the BLS that inhibited L. monocytogenes for 20 days after film preparation, with inhibition zones of 5.7 cm2 for film coupons of 8 mm in diameter. After 28 days, salmon pieces covered with the film without inhibitors showed an increase of 2.4 log cycles in L. monocytogenes growth. In contrast, films with either LAB strain or a combination of both strains and nisin had a bacteriostatic effect on the pathogen over a period of 28 days, which exceeds the industrial standard shelf life for smoked salmon. The results demonstrate that these films inhibit L. monocytogenes growth on salmon during refrigerated storage.

Objective: Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have been used to label
mammalian cells and to monitor their fate in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). However, the effectiveness of phenotype of labeled cells by SPIONs is still a matter
of question. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency and biological effects
of labeled mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) using ferumoxide- protamine sulfate
complex.
Materials and Methods: In an experimental study, undifferentiated mESCs, C571 line, a
generous gift of Stem Cell Technology Company, were cultured on gelatin-coated flasks.
The proliferation and viability of SPION-labeled cells were compared with control. ESCs
and embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from differentiated hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)
were analyzed for stage-specific cell surface markers using fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS).
Results: Our observations showed that SPIONs have no effect on the self-renewal ability
of mESCs. Reverse microscopic observations and prussian blue staining revealed 100%
of cells were labeled with iron particles. SPION-labeled mESCs did not significantly alter
cell viability and proliferation activity. Furthermore, labeling did not alter expression of
representative surface phenotypic markers such as stage-specific embryonic antigen 1
(SSEA1) and cluster of differentiation 117 (CD117) on undifferentiated ESC and CD34,
CD38 on HSCs, as measured by flowcytometry.
Conclusion: According to the results of the present study, SPIONs-labeling method
as MRI agents in mESCs has no negative effects on growth, morphology, viability,
proliferation and differentiation that can be monitored in vivo, noninvasively. Noninvasive
cell tracking methods are considered as new perspectives in cell therapy for
clinical use and as an easy method for evaluating the placement of stem cells after
transplantation.

For more rapid and flexible service creation, the Multiservice Switching Forum (MSF) has begun to define an open intra-switch interface. The objective of the MSF is to define an architecture that separates the control and user/data plane aspects of an ATM-capable multiservice network. Another objective is to establish an extensible framework to new adaptation and switching technologies. However MSF´s activities regarding the management areas are rare except for simply mentioning the use of SNMP across all the planes and future use of CORBA. In this paper, we simply describe MSF´s architecture and its the management aspect. Then we propose to partition the managed resources, which is either shared or dedicated by each signalling controller, into a set of logically managed units: MIBlets. We define components of the MIBlet and propose to use the MIBlet as a common resource interface based on SNMP/SMI. Finally we also show the IDL mapping in case of CORBA based communications across all the planes. The one of purpose of this paper is to show modelling of resources in SNMP/SMI with CORBA which will help to develop the system rapidly, and in a standard and more interoperable way

Today there is no single &#8220;Smart grid&#8221; in existence, but rather a conglomeration of different legacy systems paired with new technologies and architectural approaches, based on different standards and regulations that all need to be amalgamated into a communication network to support the challenges of the future electricity network. To support this objective, &#8220;Zoning principles&#8221;, as an element of the Cyber Security architecture for Smart Grids, are being presented on the basis of cyber security and architecture requirements, dependency on legacy installations, and present regulations and industry standards. &#8220;Zoning principles&#8221; provide a method of classifying functions and systems in a future Smart Grid communication network, and structuring them into a multi-layered &#8220;Defense in Depth&#8221; architecture. Furthermore it introduces a structured method for defining security controls and thus enabling the further development of a compliance process with regard to trusted connectivity in a Smart Grid.

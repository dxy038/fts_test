In this paper, two conjugate dual problems based on weak efficiency to a constrained vector optimization problem are introduced.
Some inclusion relations between the dual objective mappings and the properties of the Lagrangian maps and their saddle points
for primal problem are discussed. Gap functions for a vector equilibrium problem are established by using the weak and strong
duality.

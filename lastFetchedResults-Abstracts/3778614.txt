The objective of the work described in this paper is to create application specific program modules to interface with the existing finite-element software packages, so as to establish strongly supportive user environments for design studies of selected generic classes of electromechanical devices. A new concept of the `Design Environment ModuleÂ´ (DEM) has been developed and its implementation for a particular example of a proximity detector is demonstrated

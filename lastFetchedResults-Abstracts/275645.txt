Frequency analysis of long bones has been investigated as a tool to assess bone quality or integrity. The objective of the present paper was to develop a three-dimensional finite element model of a fresh human femur with geometrical and mechanical properties derived from quantitative computer tomography images. This model was then exercised and the results were compared to those obtained from a vibration analysis technique. The percent relative error between the numerically and experimentally derived results was found about 4%. Finally, the influence of mechanical properties on the resonant spectre was studied. The results exhibit the limitations of the vibrational technique to detect slight material changes

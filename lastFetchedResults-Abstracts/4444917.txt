Objective of research is to analyze the influence of the photovoltaic (PV) generator installation to power quality on distribution network. There are two models of load distribution network, namely industrial and residential costumers distribution network. Research show that the value of bus voltage THD on distribution network of industrial and residential customers are still under of voltage THD limit recommended by IEEE 519-1992 equal as 5%. The majority of the value of TDD conductor in two models of the distribution network is under the limit conductor current TDD recommended by IEEE 519-1992. In network industries and residential customers, the more number of PV plants installed, then the value of current harmonic (TDD) at PCC bus will be even greater. The most value of conductor current TDD average generated by conductor that is connected directly to the PV generator bus The using of single tuned passive filter able to improve THD Bus and TDD conductor which still does not meet the standard requirements.

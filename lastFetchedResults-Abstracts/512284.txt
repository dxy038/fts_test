The objective of this study is to analyse influences of traditional Chinese roof construction elements to the roof design of Kampung Laut’s Old Mosque in Malaysia. The result of this study can be used as an evidence that Islam came to South East Asia (the Malay Archipelagos) from East (China) in contrast to the most arguments claimed that Islam came from West (India and Arabian region). This study conducts roof construction analysis on Kampung Laut’s Old Mosque (KLOM), which is the oldest mosque in Malaysia. There are several historical studies already shows evidences to support this argument. This argument however will be supported through architectural study. The study on the roof design elements are made in the literature study.

Objective
In this study, megakaryocytopoiesis was investigated in the recessive mutant mouse, jumonji, obtained by a gene-trap strategy.
Materials and Methods

We investigated the number of megakaryocyte progenitors in the fetal liver, yolk sac, and peripheral blood of jumonji homozygous embryos by in vitro colony forming assay and monitored colony formation from single megakaryocyte progenitors. We also investigated the differentiation of jumonji-deficient megakaryocytes in terms of the expression of megakaryocyte differentiation markers PF4, CD62P, and GATA-1, proplatelet formation, cytoplasmic maturation, and endomitosis.
Results

We found that the population of megakaryocyte progenitors in the fetal liver, yolk sac, and peripheral blood of jumonji homozygotes increased. A fraction of megakaryocyte progenitors derived from the fetal liver of jumonji homozygotes formed larger colonies in vitro when compared with controls. This abnormality is caused by delayed growth arrest in the progeny. Immature megakaryocyte progenitors showed this abnormality. The megakaryocytes of jumonji homozygotes expressed PF4, CD62P, and GATA-1, obtained cytoplasmic maturation, extended proplatelet-like processes, and underwent endomitosis.
Conclusion

The loss of the jumonji gene causes an increase in the number of megakaryocyte lineage cells. Our data suggest that the jumonji gene regulates proliferation but not differentiation of megakaryocyte lineage cells.

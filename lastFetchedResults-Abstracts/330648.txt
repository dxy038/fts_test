Objective: The effect of filler volume fraction, particle size and silanation on shear punch strength, flexural strength and flexural modulus of model composites has been evaluated.

Methods: Hybrid type glass filled (0–65.2 vol%), composites some without filler silanation (30.7–51.0 vol%) and microfilled type (0–13.0 vol%) resin matrix (UDMA and EGDMA) composites (Shofu Inc., Japan) were used in the study. For the shear punch test, 10 disc specimens, 0.5 mm thick and 9 mm diameter, were prepared for each composite and tested with a 3.2 mm dia punch at 1.0 mm/min. Flexural strength (n=10) was measured by the method outlined in ISO 4049. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Fisher's multiple-range test.

Results: Shear punch strength and flexural strength increased with increasing filler content up to 52.2% for hybrid composites and between 0 and 9.1% for microfilled composites. Shear punch strength and flexural strength decreased with increasing filler volume fraction for un-silanated composites. Flexural modulus for all materials increased with increasing filler volume fraction. Hybrid composites with silanated fillers have significantly higher values of flexural strength, flexural modulus and shear punch strength than equivalent materials with un-silanated fillers.

Significance: The results showed that filler silanation is an important factor for determining material strength. Additions of small quantities of microfillers appeared to have a greater effect on shear strength than equivalent amounts of hybrid filler. The shear punch test may prove beneficial for routine testing of composites as specimen preparation was simple, specimen quality was easy to maintain and the results are meaningful.

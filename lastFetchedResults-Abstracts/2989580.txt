Knowing the ´smart´ way to approach academic and personal challenges can make a big difference in the undergraduate experience at a university. University Learning Skills (ULS), an optional First Year Experience (FYE) one-credit orientation course, was established at the University of Connecticut in an effort to help students modify their high school study habits to those needed for success in college. Data on retention shows an alarming figure of 20-30% of engineering students departing after the first year. The high number of students who either have academic difficulty or decide to change careers prompted the creation of the ULS course. The ULS course includes material on study skills such as time management, the Cornell note-taking method, and the SQ3R approach to textbook reading. It also introduces students to engineering facilities and university offices such as counseling services, career services, library, etc. Improved retention of these students who take the ULS course has occurred. Student evaluation of the course has been positive with 3 out of 4 feeling that it met or strongly met the objective of promoting a positive adjustment and assimilation into the university.

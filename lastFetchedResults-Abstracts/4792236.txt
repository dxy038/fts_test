The read-write characteristics of a land and groove disk have been examined using a blue-laser diode, high NA objective lens and the PRML method. The wide tilt and defocus margins have been obtained and no deterioration by CW has been observed at a data bit length of 0.0987 &#956;m and a track pitch of 0.29 &#956;m. These experimental results certify the feasibility of a rewritable optical disk with a capacity of 30 GB/side.

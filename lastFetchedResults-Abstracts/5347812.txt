The objective of this paper is to develop and to validate a competition model which allows to determine when a cryptosystem type is the best-suiteddest to transmit in a communications channel, depending on the kind of technological used device (cellular phone, PDA, notebook, other ones). The results obtained for this dynamic analysis determine the kind of encryption that should be used at the channel in a given time.

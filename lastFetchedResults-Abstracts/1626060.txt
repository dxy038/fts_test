BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Opioids are routinely omitted at the induction of general anesthesia for cesarean delivery because of concerns about neonatal respiratory depression. The subsequent unmodified maternal stress response to tracheal intubation reduces placental perfusion and a short-acting opioid may afford advantages at the induction, without subsequent neonatal depression. The aim of the present study was to assess sufentanil effects administered before the induction of anesthesia for cesarean delivery on the mother's hemodynamic and neonate's Apgar.
METHODS: In this double blind clinical trial study, cesarean delivery cases were divided into 2 groups (50 in each group). The case group received sufentanil 0.15 ?g/kg at the induction of anesthesia with thiopental 4 mg/kg and succinylcholine 2 mg/kg but the control group with the same induction method did not receive sufentanil. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate of mothers and first and fifth minute Apgar scores of neonates were assessed. 
FINDINGS: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate before induction of anesthesia had not significant difference. But after induction of anesthesia blood pressure and heart rate in control group raised more than case group significantly (p=0.001). First and fifth minute Apgar scores of neonates had not significant difference. Heart rate average in laryngoscopy and intubation time was 116.96± 9.48 that had significant difference with case group average 99.96±12.78 (p=0.001). 
CONCLUSION: The results showed the significant effects of sufentanil at the induction of general anesthesia for cesarean delivery on stress controlling without significant effects on neonates Apgar. So sufentanil using is helpful in hypertensive pregnant cases or pre-eclampsia.

Soil moisture measurement and control is a base to employ optimal management methods for reducing water consumption and improvement of the product quality. The main objective of this research was increasing the efficiency of water consumption in a greenhouse condition. This study was carried out in the framework of three treatments of soil potential including irrigation at 40, 60 and 80 c-bar tension with three replications. The cultivated plant was the greenhouse cucumber and the growth indexes included fruit weight, fruit diameter, fruit size, stem diameter and Leaf Area Index (LAI) measured by scale, calliper and planimeter, respectively. Six plants were selected randomly from each replication in each treatment. The LAI was calculated in three small, medium and large sizes. Statistical analysis showed that treatments 40 and 60 c-bar have led to a significant yield increase (p < 0.001), whereas treatment 80 c-bar had the least yield. The results revealed that treatments 40 and 60 c-bar had a significant difference (p < 0.001) in increasing LAI in comparison with the treatment 80 c-bar. There was no significant difference between treatments of 40 and 60 c-bar. It is concluded that tension 60 c-bar has been more effective in efficiency of water consumption.

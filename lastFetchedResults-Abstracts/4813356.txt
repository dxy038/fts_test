Summary form only given. Introduction of an integrated energy service system in an urban area is assumed. An energy supply plant is installed in the area to provide integrated energy service. It supplies electricity, gas, cooling, and heating to consumers. To consider CO/sub 2/ emission constraint in the area, analyses of energy pricing, economic impact on energy consumers, and operation of the system under the constraint of CO/sub 2/ emission were performed. CO/sub 2/ emission and economic impact on the consumers and the supplier of various energy pricing scenarios were calculated using linear programming models. The solution that satisfied the CO/sub 2/ emission restriction, and was economically optimal to the consumers was chosen from the results. The chosen solutions are Pareto optimum solutions of a multi-objective problem that concerns both CO/sub 2/ emission and cost to the consumers.

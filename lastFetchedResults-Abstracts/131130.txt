Objective: To evaluate the effect of topical fish oil versus salisylic acid and betamethasone in treating psoriasis .
Methods: This randomized double blind clinical trial was carried out on 39 patients with psoriasis vulgaris. They were randomly divided into two groups The first group ( 20 patients) were treated with topical salisylic acid and betamethasone . The second group (19 patients ) were treated with topical fish oil . The patients were evaluated in beginning and 2 months after treatment. Finally the obtained data were analyzed using SPSS package, t-test, chi-square and paired t-test.

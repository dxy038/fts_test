Objective
To compare the frequency of gluten sensitivity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy controls.
Patients and Methods
The patients were 161 clinically definite MS patients who referred to neurology outpatient clinic of Nemazee Hospital, Shiraz, south of Iran from March 2004 to October 2005. IgG and IgA antigliadin antibodies were measured by enzyme immuno assay (EIA) method. The test of IgA antitranstissue glutaminase (tTG) and duodenal biopsy were carried out in patients with either IgA or IgG AGA positive sera. Antigliadin antibodies were also measured for 166 age and sex matched control group.
Results
Neither IgG nor IgA antigliadin antibodies showed significant differences between MS patients and controls. Anti-tTG antibody and histopathologic studies were negative in all patients with positive IgG or IgA antigliadin antibodies results. Mean values of IgG and IgA antigliadin antibodies in MS patients with different sex, age, course, and functional systems involvement were not significantly different.
Conclusion
Gluten sensitivity is not associated with MS in Iran.

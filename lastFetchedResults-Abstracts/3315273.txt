Projects over the years failed to be completed within the specified triple constraint, hence lack of development in skills and infrastructure. The objective of the research is to assess the triple constraint and determine sources of failures in order to increase the success rate of construction projects in South Africa and to give priority on the triple constraint. Both the contextual and fieldwork survey attribute failure of construction projects to lack of understanding and poor management of the triple constraint elements and trade-offs.

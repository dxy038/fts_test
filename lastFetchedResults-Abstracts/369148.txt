The objective of this study was to modify the surface of poly( , -lactic acid) (PDLLA) with different molecular weight of silk fibroins, and assess the effects of the modified surfaces on the functions of rat osteoblasts cultured in vitro. The properties of the modified PDLLA surface and the control one were investigated by contact angle and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). The former indicated the variation of hydrophilicity and the latter suggested that the modified PDLLA film using silk fibroin is enriched with nitrogen atoms. The biocompatibility of the PDLLA film may be altered and in turn affects the seeded cell functions Therefore, attachment and proliferation of osteoblasts seeded on the modified PDLLA films and the control one were examined. Cell morphologies on these films were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. In addition, differentiated cell function was assessed by measuring the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. These results suggest that the silk fibroin-modified PDLLA surface can improve the interaction between osteoblasts and the PDLLA films.

This paper proposes a generator maintenance scheduling (GMS) problem with due consideration of minimizing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The conventional objectives such as leveling the reserve rate, maximizing reliability and minimizing production cost have been effectively dealt with in the GMS problem until now. This paper considers minimizing CO<sub>2</sub> emission as an additional objective in the GMS problem, where the CO<sub>2</sub> emission is evaluated by using CO<sub>2</sub> emission unit cost. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated in the simulation for a real-size power system model in Korea in 2010.

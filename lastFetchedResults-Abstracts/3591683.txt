Pilot-aided orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) channel estimation has, so far, been optimized only for open-loop systems for which the uniform spacing of pilots is optimal. In this paper, we examine closed-loop OFDM systems and show how uniform pilots may no longer be optimal. In doing so, we propose a feedback technique in which the pilot allocation mechanism is adapted to the mobile channel. After deriving a general expression for the symbol error rate as a function of pilot allocation, we optimize the pilot locations and propose two practical solutions using bounds on the objective function. We proceed to formulate pilot allocation based on the maximal average OFDM channel capacity. We examine the feedback overhead that is associated with our method and make comparisons with the conventional uniform framework. Finally, we suggest the use of vector quantization in the context of the generalized Lloyd algorithm to reduce feedback and extend our method to a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)-OFDM system based on the Alamouti space-time block code. Monte-Carlo simulations illustrate the error-rate/capacity performance gains via nonuniform pilots and illustrate the effects of Doppler frequency and carrier frequency offset.

The I-Imas (Intelligent Imaging Sensors) is an EU project whose objective is to design and develop intelligent imaging sensors and evaluate their use within an adaptive medical imaging system specifically tailored to Mammography and Dental Radiology. The system will employ an in line scanning technology approach and proposes the use of CMOS active pixels sensors. The I-Imas sensor will have the capability of processing the data on every pixel and be able to dynamically respond in real time to changing conditions during imaging recording. The result will be to minimise the radiation exposure to areas of low diagnostic information content while extracting the highest diagnostic information from region of high interest. The first phase of the I-Imas project deals with the characterisation of the key features in a medical image that carry the highest content of diagnostic information. With this objective in mind an End-Users Survey has been carried out. We have been distributed a questionnaire to experts in the field of mammography and dental radiology (the dental radiology results will be presented elsewhere): medical physicists, radiologists, radiographers and dentists. From this survey we have collected information about the most useful specifications to be implemented in the I-Imas imaging system. This paper discusses the results from the End-Users survey and considers design implications for the I-Imas sensors

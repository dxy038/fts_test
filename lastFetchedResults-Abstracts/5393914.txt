This paper focuses on the geometry optimization of a 3-TPS/TP parallel manipulator with Parameter Design Space (PDS). Firstly, the structure of the parallel manipulator and its kinematic model are presented. Then, we set up the kinematical performance indices for the evaluation of manipulator working properties, including Local Condition Index (LCI), Global Condition Index (GCI) and Good Condition Workspace (GCW). The optimization objective of this research is to get a larger workspace with good condition. The optimization has been carried out in a PDS with normalized geometry parameters. Three dimensional performance charts and two dimensional atlases are then generated for the performance indices. An optimum region with all optimum solutions are then generated from the atlases. The feasibility of this approach is supported by the example given this paper.

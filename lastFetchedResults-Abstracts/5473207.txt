In this paper, we propose a new interpolation algorithm based on edge-weighted method, which improves the bilinear interpolation method. The conventional bilinear interpolation has a serious problem which is the blurring artifact crumbling the edge components. In this paper, the edge-weighted image (EWI) interpolation algorithm, which enhances the edge components, is proposed. In the experimental results, not only did the EWI interpolation exhibit much better subjective qualities of the images than conventional bilinear interpolation, but also improved objective qualities.

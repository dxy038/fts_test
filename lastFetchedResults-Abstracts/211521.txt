Background: All aspects of lumbar disc surgery are being currently commented in pertinent medical literature, but only few studies have dealt with comparative results and the outcome of surgical treatment.
Objective: To find out the possible correlation between preoperative symptomatic period and postoperative complete recovery time, and fitness to resume normal personal and professional life.
Methods: In a retrospective study, we evaluated the outcomes of lumbar disc surgery by reviewing records of 153 consecutive patients who were surgically treated for lumbar disc herniation. The endpoint of this study for each case was defined at the time of complete recovery and/or between 4 to 12 months after surgery.
Results: A highly significant correlation (r = 0.6) existed between the pre- and postoperative duration of sciatalgic symptoms (P < 0.0001). Regression analysis showed that postoperative recovery time in months = 1.29 + 0.58 * preoperative duration in months.
Conclusion: The duration of preoperative disabling leg pain has a significant predictive value for the overall outcome in lumbar disc herniation surgery

There are large subsets of digital circuits that are designed with bidirectional ports, like microprocessors, peripherals and certain communication circuits. During the design phase, the reliability of these circuits can be tested by means of fault injection. Traditional fault injection techniques have to arrange the design in order to perform the testing the bidirectional ports, because these tests have to take into account not only errors in the values, but also possible damages in the direction of the data. The present paper presents a solution adopted in an existing fault injection system FT-UNSHADES and the new incoming platform FT-UNSHADES2, for bidirectional signals and the solutions of some practical problems encountered.

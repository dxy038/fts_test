Regarding decision support system of global design of tank fire control system, the paper designs the decision evaluation subsystem and establishes the global design index architecture of tank fire control system. It applies grey correlative projection method, TOPSIS method, fuzzy consistent matrix method and satisfaction degree of objectives method to solve the problem of multi-objective optimization in the design process of tank fire control system. In addition, it analyzes the applied condition of the four methods.

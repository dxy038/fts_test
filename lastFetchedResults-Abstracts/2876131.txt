Adhoc networks become more important in many applications for its mobility and scalability property. MANET does not possess any fixed network infrastructure. It possess bidirectional communication link. In adhoc network, nodes that are present in same communication range will communicate directly and those beyond the range communicate through their neighbours. The open medium makes MANET more vulnerable to malicious attackers. Many methods like acknowledgement based systems and monitoring methods are proposed to provide secure MANET. In acknowledgment based system, crytographic techniques are used to provide security against false misbehavior report, limited transmission power and receiver collision problems which creates network and routing overhead and fails to address problems like partial dropping. In my project, acknowledgement based intrusion detection system with trust values are used to address malicious activity in certain cicumstances without affecting network performance avoiding requirementment of predistributed keys and use of digital signatures like other intrusion detection systems which cause more network overhead.

The aim of this work is to present an approach for attaining a practical implementation of an on-line trained neuro-controller, presented previously by some of the authors. Some simplifications in the complete control scheme are made in order to accomplish this objective, and simulations test the validity of the simplifications by comparing the results of this scheme with those of the original control scheme.

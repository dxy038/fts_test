
The objective of this study was to manufacture water resistant kenaf stalk particleboard. Twenty seven boards were produced using 170 Â°C steam treated kenaf particles, 30 and 60 minute treatment time and three resin types include urea-formaldehyde, melamine-formaldehyde and a mixture of fifty percent each. Physical and mechanical properties were measured and the results by factorial model based on a completely randomized design. Results showed that boards made of treated particles with 60 minute treatment time and Urea Formaldehyde resin had the highest bending strength. Modulus of elasticity (MOE) improved with an increase in treatment time. The strongest Modulus of elasticity (MOE) was achieved with the boards bonded with urea-melamine-formaldehyde resin. Moreover, with increasing treatment time from 30 to 60 minutes internal bond strength (IB) reduced. Thickness swelling and water absorption of the boards was significantly improved with increasing treatment time.

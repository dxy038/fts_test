Functional data analysis has gained significant attention from a variety of disciplines. In the present study we propose an effective clustering procedure to categorize a number of profiles that are formed with nonlinear functions. The proposed clustering procedure first smoothes the data and then transforms the smoothed data to obtain their functional form. The coefficients of the function obtained from the preceding transformation step are used for clustering. Simulation studies under various scenarios indicated that our proposed clustering procedure correctly identified the true clusters and yielded better clustering results than a latent class cluster analysis, one of the existing clustering methods. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed clustering procedure was demonstrated using real pain data in which the main objective is to characterize the responses of 144 spinal cord dorsal horn neurons with graded thermal stimuli that range from 37 °C to 51 °C in 2 °C increments. The results showed that the proposed clustering strategy can successfully elicit natural grouping of the neurons with similar response patterns to graded thermal stimuli.

This paper considers the problem of detecting local linear substructures of a system in a high-dimensional data space by applying a fuzzy clustering technique. We propose a linear fuzzy clustering method using eigenvalues of the fuzzy scatter matrix in the objective function for optimizing the dimensional coefficients. The optimal solutions for the objective function and some illustrative examples are shown in this paper

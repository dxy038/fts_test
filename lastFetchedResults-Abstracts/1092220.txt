The primary objective of this paper was to demonstrate the suitability of ACF in effectively adsorbing CS2 from water, and to compare its performance vs. that of GAC. Commercial ACF was modified to increase its specific surface and pore volume. CS2 removal was studied by adding ACF to water containing CS2 under varying conditions. The experimental results reveal that ACF is a potential adsorbent for capturing CS2 under both equilibrium and dynamic adsorption/desorption conditions. The adsorption capacity of ACF was observed to considerably increase with the increase of CS2 concentration: It was observed that the modified ACF exhibited greater adsorption for CS2 than the GAC, and the mechanism for this difference was explored; The modified ACF showed a consistent performance within a pH range from 3â€“9; Under the experimental conditions, an modified ACF sample was adsorbed and desorbed by boiling water repeatedly without exhibiting any appreciable degradation in its adsorption performance.

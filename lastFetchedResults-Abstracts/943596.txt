Background and Objective: Conventional coronary angiography is the gold standard technique for evaluation of coronary bypass grafts stenosis. This study was carried out to find diagnostic accuracy of multisclice 64 CT angiography in diagnosis of bypass graft stenosis rather than conventional coronary angiography.
Subjects and Methods: This prospective and retrospective study was performed in university and private hospitals in Ahvaz, Iran from 2007 to 2012. All data were collected from patients with past history of coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) who presented with chest pain or ischemia according to noninvasive test had indication for conventional coronary angiography. Arterial and venous grafts from 143 patients were assessed by CT angiography and conventional angiography was takenfrom 53 patients with history of CABG. All data was collected and analyzed bySPSS version 17.
Results:The mean age of men was 59.4±10 and women 59.9±8 years (34% were females and 66% were males). Sensitivity , specificity, positive and negative predictive value  and diagnostic accuracy in CT angiography were respectively 95, 100, 100, 86 and96% in proximal and 100,100,100,100,and 100% in middle part;  and 71, 96,93,83 and 86% in distal part of arterial and vein graft bypass in comparison with invasive conventional coronary angiography.
Conclusion:Diagnosis of occlusion and stenosis of arterial and venous bypass grafts by CTangiography is accurate and effectiveand may be decrease conventional coronary angiography among patients with CABG

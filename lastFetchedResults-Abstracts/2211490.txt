In intervention group, the informational support including ICU orientation tours, educational sessions and educational pamphlets was given while in control group just routine information. The satisfaction of information in caregivers was measured by a researcher-made questionnaire in the day of discharge from ICU and data was analyzed using independent T-test.
Results: The mean satisfaction in intervention and control groups was 82. 3±8.66 and 53.2±11.13, respectively. The difference was statistically meaningful (P < 0.0001).

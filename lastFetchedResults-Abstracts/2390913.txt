The Mars Micro-Meteorological Station (“μ-Met”) mission is designed to provide the global surface pressure measurements required to help characterize the Martian general circulation and climate system. Measurements of surface pressure distributed both spatially and temporally, coupled with simultaneous measurements from orbit, will enable the determination of the general circulation, structure and driving factors of the Martian atmosphere as well as the seasonal CO2 cycle. The influence of these atmospheric factors will in turn provide insight into the overall Martian climate system. With the science objective defined as the long-term (at least 1 Mars year) globally distributed measurement of surface atmospheric pressure, a readily achievable and low-cost network mission has been designed. The μ-Met mission utilizes microsensors coupled with a robust and lightweight surface station to deliver 16 μ-Met stations to Mars via a Med-Lite launch vehicle. The battery powered μ-Met surface stations are designed to autonomously measure, record and transmit the science data via a UHF relay satellite. Entry, descent and landing is provided by an acroshell with a new lightweight ceramic thermal protection system, a parachute and an impact absorbing structure. The robust lander is capable of surviving the landing loads imposed by the high altitude landing sites required in a global network. By trading the ability to make many measurements at a single site for the ability to make a single measurement at many sites, the μ-Met mission can provide truly global meteorological science.

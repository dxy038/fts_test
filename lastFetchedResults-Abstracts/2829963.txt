The paper proposes a look-ahead control method in which traffic information is considered. Information about the local traffic is an important factor considering the wider transportation system. The purpose of the method is to reduce control energy and fuel consumption, keep speed limits and travelling time while preceding and following vehicles are taken into consideration. Consequently, the energy-efficient cruise control strategy is able to adapt to the motion of the surrounding vehicles. Moreover, vehicle dynamics, road data and traffic flow in the surroundings are incorporated. The method leads to a multi-objective optimization problem. The design method is illustrated through a complex simulation example based on the CarSim software.

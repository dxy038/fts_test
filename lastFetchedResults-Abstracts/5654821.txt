A statistical correlation study between 18 objective quality measures and a data base of subjective quality measures from the Paired Acceptability Rating Method (PARM) was done for nine communication systems, including waveform coders, channel vocoders, linear predictive coders, and adaptive predictive coders. The results of this study show which of the candidate objective measures are most effective in predicting the subjective results. The measure which was found to be most effective over all systems was a gain weighted L<inf>2</inf>spectral distance metric which had a correlation coefficient of -.83. Supported by DCA/DCEC via the RADC Post Doctoral Program.

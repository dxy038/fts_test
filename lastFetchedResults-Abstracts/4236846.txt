The aim of this paper consists on presenting a novel approach of vector control of an induction motor based on the approach of fuzzy modelling proposed by Ben-Glalia. In fact, the authors introduce here and for the first time the fuzzy modelling technique of Ben-Ghalia et al. in order to conceive a simple reverse model which to replace the bloc of FOC and ensure more robustness towards parameter variations and uncertainties which represent the inconvenient of the vector control technique. The objective of such a reverse fuzzy model is to improve the robustness of the vector control scheme towards parameterÂ´s variations and external disturbances. Unfortunately, in practice this is not checked because of uncertainties in the model. The simulation results show that the two control schemes provide in their basic configuration, comparable performances regarding the decoupling, however the choice for the fuzzy vector control appears advantageous of point of view robustness.

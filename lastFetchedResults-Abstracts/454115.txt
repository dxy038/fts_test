Objective: To determine lipoprotein abnormalities in patients diagnosed with sarcoidosis and their relation to disease activity. Methods:  We studied 90 patients with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis who had not been treated with corticosteroids (44 with active disease and 46 with inactive disease) and 147 control subjects. Sarcoidosis activity was evaluated by means of clinical, chest X-ray, gallium-67 scan, serum angiotensin converting enzyme (peptidyl-dipeptidase A) values, and pulmonary function tests. Analysis of lipoprotein metabolism included: serum cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, HDL2-cholesterol, HDL3-cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein B, and triglyceride concentrations. Results:  Patients with active sarcoidosis had significantly low HDL-cholesterol concentrations (1.15±0.27 mmol/l) as compared with inactive sarcoid patients (1.40±0.34 mmol/l) and with the healthy control subjects (1.49±0.34 mmol/l) (p=0.00001). The decrease in the HDL-cholesterol concentrations seen in patients with active disease was due mainly to the cholesterol bound to HDL2 subfraction. Apolipoprotein A-I concentrations were significantly reduced in the patients with active disease (1.18±0.32 g/l) compared to the healthy controls (1.38±0.27 g/l) (p=0.003). There were no significant differences in cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol or apolipoprotein B values among the three groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that HDL-cholesterol was the only variable independently associated with disease activity (Regression Coefficient b=−0.03; S.E.=0.008; p=0.0005). Conclusion: The decrease in HDL-cholesterol that is observed in patients with sarcoidosis is limited to those with active disease.

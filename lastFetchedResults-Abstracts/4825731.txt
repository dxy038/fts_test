The objective of this paper is to offer a differentiated approach towards post implementation change behaviors towards information technology. The majority of research to date has defined such behaviors as forms of ´adaptation.´ In this paper we argue that the term adaptation is overloaded which can affect the way we theorize about such behaviors. We focus an important behavior that does not fit the definition of adaptation, a behavior which we term IT reinvention and demonstrate why it differs from adaptation and requires new theorizing.

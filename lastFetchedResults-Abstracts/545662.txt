As functional integration has increased in hand-held consumer devices features such as Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers have been embedded in increasingly more devices in recent years. For example, the train positioning system based on GPS provides an integrated positioning solution which can be used in many rail applications without a cost intensive infrastructure. The network built in the GPS receiver has the advantage of determining the exact location and time of the train. The objective of this research was to develop a system which accepts the location from the GPS receiver mounted on the train and extracts its local time. This is implemented using Altera SOPC builder in the NIOS â€“ II environment. Nios II is a 32 bit soft-core embedded-processor architecture designed specifically for the Altera family of FPGAs. The signal received using the GPS receiver is given to the DE2 board through the UART port and converted it in to local time and displayed on the NIOS II console. A working system was developed, which accepts the location from the GPS receiver and extracted its local time.

review of his poetic airs, such as poetic representation, discription, theme, event

different poets, narcissism of the poet for his own poetry and art, his choice of
composing poetry in Farsi rather than Arabic, rhetorical Figures and criticism.

theory that sights Amir khosrow's poetry as the main origin or the mother of Indian
style.
Secondly, proving that the matter of "Indian parrot" Poetry is consequenced by

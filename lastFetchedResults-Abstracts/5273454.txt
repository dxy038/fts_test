We propose the feasibility of bidirectional selection device characteristics in ultrathin (&lt;;3nm) TiO<sub>2</sub> layer. We utilized the localized conducting path as virtual electrode to investigate device property at extremely scaled area. By using electrical method such as &#8220;forming&#8221; and &#8220;reset&#8221; processes in oxide, virtual electrode/sub-3nm-thick TiO<sub>2</sub>/virtual electrode structure was achieved. The measured current-voltage characteristics of fabricated device exhibited uniform bidirectional selection behavior with a high selectivity (~10<sup>5</sup>) and showed the feasibility of high current density (&gt;;10<sup>6</sup>A/cm<sup>2</sup>).

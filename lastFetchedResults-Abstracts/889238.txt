The main objective of this study was to Construct and Validation of norms for an attention skill test in Iranian male and female athletes. This study was a descriptive-normative research. Statistical population of research includes all girl and boy athletes from 5 selected province of Iran (Razavi Khorasan, Isfahan, Tehran, Khuzestan and Markazi).The samples were 1200 athletes (600 girls and 600 boys) who were selected by the multi-stage random cluster sampling method. The measurement tool of this study was Black and Red attention test in which Iranian athletes were used for construction of norms. In this study to analysis of the data, we used descriptive statistics and to determine norms for attention test, Z formula and computation of percent points in each test and percent ranks have been used. The research findings showed that, the mean of attention skill scores in male athletes without auditory distracters was 34.84±4.82, and 30.79±5.39 with auditory distracters, respectively. In female athletes, the mean of attention without auditory distracters was 32.06 ± 0.24 and with auditory distracters was 27.95 ± 0.26. Findings also revealed that there were significant differences between the mean attention of male and female athletes in both attention skill tests with and without auditory distracters (p < 0.01). Reliability of Black and Red attention test determined by test–re-test method, and statistical analysis revealed that there was significant correlation in both tests with and without auditory distracters (r=0.951 & r=0.911 in female and r=0.983 & r=0.932 for male athletes respectively). Generally, based on findings and sufficient reliability and construction validity of Black & Red attention skills test in athletes, sport coaches can use this test to determine attention skills of athletes in different sports, and it may helpful to development of such important psychological capabilities of elite athletes.

The objective of this study was to monitor changes in the pyridinoline concentration of collagen of the fast-twitch gastrocnemius
and slow-twitch soleus muscles of Japanese Saanen male goat kids during the period from 2 weeks before birth to 24 weeks of
age. The moisture concentrations of both muscles decreased and the crude protein concentration increased steadily throughout
the experimental period. The percentage of total collagen in the muscular protein showed a marked decrease (80.6–41.8% in the
gastrocnemius and 77.9–40.5% in the soleus muscle) during the 2 week prenatal period. Similarly, there was a decrease in soluble
collagen concentration (27.8–11.6% in the gastrocnemius and 32.6–18.1% in the soleus muscle) during the prenatal period, but the
decrease in total and soluble collagen concentration was slight thereafter. There was no clear tendency for change in collagen heat
solubility of both muscles, and no strong relationship was identified between collagen heat solubility and pyridinoline concentration.
Pyridinoline concentration in total collagen increased during the prepubertal period in both muscles, but the soleus muscle increased
faster and had a higher concentration of pyridinoline (0.22 mol/mol collagen at 20 weeks of age) than the gastrocnemius muscle
(0.11 mol/mol collagen at 20 weeks of age). It was found that the increase in pyridinoline concentration began during the prenatal
period, and the development of a cross-linking with age was faster in the soleus than in the gastrocnemius muscle, without collagen
concentration between the muscles. It is suggests that meat toughness would be improved when the proportion of fast-twitch
muscular fibrils could be increased.

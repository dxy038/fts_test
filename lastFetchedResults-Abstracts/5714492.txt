Compressed video streams are sensitive to errors and losses when transmitted over wireless error-prone channels. In this paper, we propose an Error Resilient (ER) scheme based on Reversible Data Hiding (RDH) and Redundant Slice (RDH-RS). Reversible data hiding is quite effective in unequal protection and can provide satisfactory protection to vital information, while redundant slice works well in protecting mass important data. Our scheme exploits both advantages. At the encoder side, we apply RS protection to odd frames, and embed vital data, the motion vectors (MV) of even frames, into the redundant slice of odd frames by bidirectional-RDH method, thus providing protection to even frames. If an MV of an odd frame cannot be correctly decoded at the decoder side, the redundant slice of odd frame will be utilized for error concealment. If the lost MV belong to an even frameÂ´s macro block (MB), then the MV will be retrieved from the redundant slice of prior odd frame and help restoration. As our data hiding method is reversible, no extra visual quality degradation will happen, and the computational burden is quite low. Experimental results demonstrate that RDH-RS method can provide much better protection to fragile compressed video when compared with the previous arts.

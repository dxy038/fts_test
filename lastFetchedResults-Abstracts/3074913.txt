Current methods of evaluation of multi-pinhole SPECT imaging systems are limited to analyses of small numbers of experiments or simulations. The authors propose an objective evaluation method based on the singular-value decomposition of the projection-backprojection operation. The decomposition is performed using the power method in order to alleviate the need to store the projection-backprojection matrix in computer memory.

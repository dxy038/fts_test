The paper will present the design of an experimental Virtual Centre for Enterprise VCE in the framework of the ELLEIEC Thematic Network. The objective is to focus on the current state of the activities related to the study and design of the VCE and to present preliminary experimental results. The Virtual Centre will provide learners with the opportunity to develop their competence in small, bite-sized pieces as and when they need them or as part of a planned overall learning strategy. Learners will also be able to elect to be mentored in a foreign language to assist their linguistic development.

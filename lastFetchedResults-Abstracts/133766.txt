BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Different methods as sonography have been used for determining uterus size. The objective of this study was to determine the normal size of uterus in reproductive age women by using sonography method.
METHODS: This cross -sectional and descriptive study was done in Yahyanejad hospital during 1999-2000. This study was performed on 231 women (14-45 years old) who didn't have any abnormal finding in their uterus anatomy and pelvic pathology and also they didn't have abnormal uterus bleeding. Uterine sizes were determined by using Real -- time abdominal ultrasonography.
FINDING: The average of uterus size in all women was 86.6x 49.6x 40.6 mm and in nuliparity was 72.8x 42.8x 32.4 mm and in multiparity was 90.8x 51.7x 43 mm. The mean age of women and BMI was 31.7±4.6 and 24.7±4 kg/m2, respectively. There was a significant correlation between uterine size and parity and also the age of women (p<0.05). But, there was not a significant relationship between uterus size and BMI.
CONCLUSION: According to the results, the normal uterus size in reproductive age women in comparison to other studies was more. By knowing normal uterus sizes, it will be possible to diagnose different uterine diseases by sonography.

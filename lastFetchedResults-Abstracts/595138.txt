Objective: To find out the frequency of risk factors of coronary artery disease (CAD) in a tertiary care hospital in Peshawar.Material amI Methods: In this prospective observational study, patients admitted to cardiology department of Lady reading hospital Peshawar with established diagnosis of coronary artery disease were included from July 2004 to June 2005. Patients were interviewed according to a pre-designed questionnaire. The laboratory reports regarding random and fasting blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol and triglyceride levels were recorded from the chart of the patients. Patients with risk factors but with no preceding coronary artery disease were excluded from the study.Results: A total of 813 patients of CAD were included and a total of 1101 risk factors were recorded on the whole. Out of 813 patients, 454(55.84%) were females and 359(44.16%) were males. Age range MY7.9 from 20 to 95 years with mean age of 57.5 years. Out of total, 35.42%(n=288) had more than one risk factors. Risk factors distribution was: hypertension 59.16%, diabetes 32.59%, hyperlipidemia 16.48% chronic smokers 14.02%, obesity 6.51%, coagulative disorders 1.10% and history of oral contraceptive use 0.86%. Hypertension (59.25%) and hyperlipidemia (53.58%) were more common in females. Hypertension (37.47%>) and smoking (51.75%) were common in lower social class people while diabetes (44.9%) and hyperlipidemia (38.05%) in upper class people.Conclusions: Hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and smoking are major modifiable risk factors of coronary artery disease in patients presenting with CAD to a tertiary care hospital in Peshawar

The objective was to study factors related to the changes induced by antihypertensive treatment on oxidative status, antioxidant activities, and reactive oxygen species by-products in whole blood and mononuclear peripheral cells. Eighty-nine hypertensive patients (mean age 46 years, 46 men, average 24-h blood pressure 139/88 mm Hg, body mass index 29) were included. After 3 months of nonrandomized allocation to antihypertensive treatment (20 nonpharmacologic, 36 β-blockers, 33 angiotensin receptor blocker), oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio and malondialdehyde were significantly reduced, and the activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase was significantly increased in both whole blood and peripheral mononuclear cells. The content of damaged base 8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in hypertensive subjects was also significantly reduced during the antihypertensive treatment. In a group of 42 subjects, the oxidative stress was further reduced and the antioxidant enzyme activities further increased after 12 months of antihypertensive treatment. The changes were independent of the kind of antihypertensive treatment. In conclusion, antihypertensive treatment improved the increased oxidative stress and the decreased antioxidant mechanisms. It is independent of the type of treatment and the beneficial effect of treatment increases over time.

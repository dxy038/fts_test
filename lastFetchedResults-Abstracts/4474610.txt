Topologies of bidirectional PWM dc-dc converters are introduced. These converters can be used in a power system of an aircraft for normal and emergency operation. The converters are obtained by adding an antiparallel diode to the switch and a controllable switch to a diode. Therefore, the load can be replaced by a dc voltage source, and vice versa. The power can flow in either direction, depending on the location of the dc source and the load. The feasibility study of such converters are experimentally confirmed for a transformer ´Cuk´ PWM converter

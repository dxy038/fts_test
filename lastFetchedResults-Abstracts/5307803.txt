The objective of this paper is to design smart antenna systems, based on their power consumption for wireless sensor networks using Ghavami and Least Mean Square algorithms. An optimal power solution is proposed for smart antenna system. It has been found that, at larger distances Ghavami algorithm becomes more power-efficient as compared to the LMS algorithm. Gain provided by the latter is counteracted by the power required to run the algorithm at shorter distances. The system is designed for Strong Arm SA-1100 processor platform Thus, power-optimal solutions becomes efficient for LMS below the critical distance and for Ghavami beyond it.

We demonstrate a high-gain bidirectional amplifier employing the newly proposed bidirectional dispersion compensation technique. We transmit wavelength interleaved 10 Gb/s/spl times/16-channel bidirectional signal over 200 km of single-mode fiber (SMF) with negligible relative intensity noise (RIN)-induced receiver sensitivity penalty. Furthermore, we show a simple fault detection method in bidirectional transmission link by measuring the aggregate signal power at the monitoring port of the amplifier.

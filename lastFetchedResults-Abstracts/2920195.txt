The origin of the UK T-SAT project dates back to the Communication Engineering Research Satellite (CERS) where a University Consortium coordinated through Rutherford Appleton Laboratory studied advanced communications satellite concepts in the early 1980s. The combination of nongeostationary highly-inclined elliptical orbit and onboard processing for land satellite mobile applications, developed in the CERS study, stimulated considerable interest. Further development of these ideas, to a bread board payload level was the prime objective of the mobile payload study associated with the T-SAT project

Problem statement: A cross-sectional study was conducted among workers at a processed food manufacturer in Malaysia. The main objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of back pain among workers who perform manual material handling. In addition, the study also investigated the effectiveness of the interventions provided by the employer to reduce the risk of back pain. Approach: A total of 60 workers had participated in the study. Socio-demographic information and back pain symptoms were obtained using Standardized Nordic Questionnaire (SNQ) for analysis of musculoskeletal Symptoms. WinOWAS software was used to identify the respondent's working posture. Results: Study results showed that lifting posture contributed the highest percentage of upper extremities back pain (45%) and lower extremities back pain (80%). There was a significant relationship at level p<0.05 for posture working repeatedly and lifting weight above head level. The interventions provided by the employer showed 82% of the respondents gave a positive feedback for training provided. As for personal protective equipment and mechanical aid, both showed positive results at 84.61 and 100% respectively. Chi-square analysis results showed, respondents' age has significant effect on standing posture for 10 min (p<0.01) for pain at the upper back. On the other hand for gender factor, correlation with; standing for 10 min, hold on load, reaching load, putting loads above head level, turning load and static standing, has significant effect on upper back pain at p<0.05. Gender also showed significant correlation with; doing repetitive task, reaching load and putting loads above head height, which contributed significantly to lower back pain at p<0.05. Conclusion: The study suggested that all manual handling activities should be replaced with mechanical aids to reduce prevalence of back pain.

This paper reports the results of an experimental programme designed to study the interfacial shear stress concentration at the plate curtailment of reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened in flexure with externally bonded carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP). Specifically, the study looks at the relationship between the CFRP plate thickness and the interfacial shear stress concentration at the plate curtailment, the failure modes of the CFRP-strengthened beams as well as the efficiency of the CFRP external reinforcing system. Comparing the experimental results with existing models' predictions is another objective of this study. The experimental programme included five RC beams 115 mm√ó150 mm in cross-section and 1500 mm in length. Four of the RC beams were reinforced externally with CFRP plates of different thicknesses. Tests in this study showed that the thickness of CFRP plate affects not only the load-carrying and deflection capacities of the strengthened beam, but also the shear stress concentration at the CFRP/concrete interface and the beam failure mode

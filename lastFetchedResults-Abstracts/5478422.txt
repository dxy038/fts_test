In this paper a new image bi-thresholding method called &#8220;divergence-based thresholding&#8221; (DBT) is introduced. In this method an objective function for minimization is constructed using the divergence function between the two classes. The paper compares the new method with the classical discriminant analysis method of Otsu (1979) and the entropic method of Kapur et al. (1985)

An exponential bidirectional associative memory (eBAM) using an exponential encoding scheme is discussed. It has a higher capacity for pattern pair storage than conventional BAMs. A new energy function is defined. The associative memory takes advantage of the exponential nonlinearity in the evolution equations such that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is significantly increased. The energy of the eBAM decreases as the recall process proceeds, ensuring the stability of the system. The increase of SNR consequently enhances the capacity of the BAM. The capacity of the exponential BAM is estimated

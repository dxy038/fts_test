Time domain equalizers are used in the receiver of a discrete multitone (DMT) receiver to compensate the channel effects on the received signal. There are a lot of DMT equalization algorithms presented in the literature, but recently a novel per tone equalizer structure was proposed which offers some advantages over the previous traditional ones. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the important concepts of this technique and evaluate its initialization complexity. The performance of this technique is also compared with typical time-domain equalization algorithms in different simulation environments.

Objective
Pectins have been known to decrease blood glucose levels. However, the mechanism of this effect is unclear. The direct action of various pectins (high- or low-methoxyl pectins) on the intestinal absorption of glucose was investigated in gut-perfused rats.
Methods

After equilibrium, jejunal and ileal segments were simultaneously perfused with an isotonic electrolyte solution (pH 7.4) containing glucose (10 mM/L) and high- or low-methoxyl pectins (10 g/L). Each test or control solution was perfused in a random sequence, with perfusion times of 30 min. Changes in glucose concentration of perfusate solution reservoir were determined over the experimental period.
Results

High- and low-methoxyl pectins in the perfusate significantly inhibited jejunal uptake of glucose compared with the control (P < 0.05). High-methoxyl pectins had greater inhibitive effect on intestinal absorption of glucose than low-methoxyl pectins. The observed changes in glucose and water absorptions caused by high- or low-methoxyl pectins were reversible by switching to a pectin-free perfusate. In addition, net water absorption changed to secretion after addition of high- or low-methoxyl pectins.
Conclusions

These results suggest that the decrease in intestinal absorption of glucose observed after perfusion of high- or low-methoxyl pectins may be caused by viscosity-related increases in mucosal unstirred layer thickness.

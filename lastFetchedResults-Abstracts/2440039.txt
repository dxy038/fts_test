Introduction: Tuberculosis (TB), with different types of respiratory tract involvements, has a high rate of mortality all around the world. Endobronchial involvement, which is a slightly common tuberculous infection, requires special attention due to its severe complications such as bronchostenosis. Aim of study of this study was describes, one type of pulmonary tuberculosis with less diagnosed and delayed treatment. High suspicious needs to diagnose and may be need bronchoscopy for confirmed the diagnosis. It can be associated with sever complication and early diagnosis and treatment are necessary for prevention of adverse effect.
Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was conducted in a teaching hospital during 2005-2010. Patients diagnosed with endobronchial tuberculosis through bronchoscopic biopsy were included in the study. Diagnosis was confirmed by observation of caseous necrosis, bronchial lavage fluid or positive acid-fast staining in tissue samples obtained through bronchial biopsy. Moreover, demographic information, endobronchial view, lab tests, as well as clinical and radiographic findings were reviewed and evaluated retrospectively.
Results: A total of 20 cases were confirmed with endobronchial tuberculosis, 75% of whom were female with the mean age of 60 years. The results showed that the most common clinical symptom was cough (80%), the most common finding in the chest X-ray was consolidation (75%), and the most common bronchoscopic feature was anthracosis (55%).
Conclusion: TB is still a major concern, particularly in the developing countries. Thus, in order for early diagnosis and prevention of this disease, we need to pay meticulous attention to its clinical manifestations and bronchoscopic features.

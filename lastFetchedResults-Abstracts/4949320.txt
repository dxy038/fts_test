In the problem of optimal sensor deployment for satellite antenna reflector, to avoid the one-sidedness of single-objective criterion, in this paper, we adopt double-objectives criterion, which contains the largest orthogonality and the highest vibration energy of observed signal. The double-objectives criterion is converted to single-one criterion by mathematical transformation and Genetic Algorithm is utilized to solve this problem. Comparing with corresponding single-objective criterion by simulation results, we conclude that: the proposed method is a feasible method of optimal sensor deployment for satellite antenna reflector based on double-objectives criterion. The results, whose fitness function is a function based on double-objectives criterion, is not one-sided optimal solution in single objective, but a satisfying solution in global area. According to the application in real project, this satisfying solution is more significant in the area of astronautics.

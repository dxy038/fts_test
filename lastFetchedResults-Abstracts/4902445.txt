The objective of this paper is to suggest a more rigorous and complete DSP curriculum that will meet corporate needs to produce "industry ready" DSP engineers from the ranks of students with undergraduate degrees. A study of many digital signal processing (DSP) curriculums across the world was conducted to determine the level of DSP theory, application, and lab exercise activity that was currently being offered to engineering students. Curriculum guidelines on DSP from the ACM/IEEE Joint Task Force on Computer Engineering Education were examined to help guide the development of an "ideal" DSP curriculum.

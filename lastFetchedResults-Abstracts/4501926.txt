The hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing mission named HISUI is the Japanese next-generation Earth observation project that will be onboard ALOS-3. HISUI will be composed of hyperspectral imager (185 spectral bands in VNIR-SWIR region with 30 m spatial resolution) and multispectral imager (4 spectral bands in VNIR region with 5 m spatial resolution). To expand use of Earth observation data from HISUI, quality assurance and control of data products is indispensable, therefore, the long-term radiometric calibration has a crucial role. The objective of this research is to establish the techniques and develop the plans for conducting the in-flight radiometric calibration of HISUI with high frequency, reliability, and stability, based on the traditional in-flight radiometric calibration for multispectral sensors.

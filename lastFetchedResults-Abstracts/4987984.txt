Encryption, which is the backbone of security protocols, is computationally intensive and consumes energy and computational resources that are limited in wireless devices. This paper focuses on evaluating the performance of Rijndael-Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption scheme in terms of energy consumed and execution time, and modeling the computational operations involved. The objective is to provide simulation results to help in the design and optimization of efficient cryptographic techniques. The computational model as a function of primitive operations shows a good estimate of encryption complexity, hence the energy consumption for encryption.

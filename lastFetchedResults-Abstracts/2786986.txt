This paper present the new design concept of single wiper blade with single link arm (SBSA) systems that it is controlled by fuzzy proportional plus derivative plus integral controllers (F-PID) and will apply for wiper blade innovation system in the final purpose. A conventional wiper blade system is suitable for some windshield glass conditions because of its influenced not only by the quality of the wiper blade system, but also by the shape of the windshield glass size. The proposed of SBSA has taken an advantage of single link wiper arm to gain the geometrical criteria which a larger wipe area while still maintain wiper period and can be reduce the complexity of multilink arms mechanism as in the previous design concept. The multi-criteria objectives are not only considered for wipe quality but also constraints by windshield glass feasibility and respect of wiper blade standards. When the direct derivation of the objective functions is not available appeared and some mathematical models that are applied to control the speed regulation of a wiper motor are not precise for more complexes and have some vague systems, so the F-PID controllers can be used to solve this kind of problems that the main advantage of fuzzy logic is that no mathematical modeling is required but can be achieved higher performance with effective tuning methods of the initial setting parameters. By applying the proposed system, performance has been improved by mathematical analysis and simulation programs which indicated by a larger wipe area and reach to the optimum interval wipe period time for more precise of wiper bladeÂ´s positions in the steady state response and can be reduced the transient state errors that come from any instantaneous disturbances such as instant winding or raining effect and finally for the vehicle drive safety.

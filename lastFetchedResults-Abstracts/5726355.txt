The vertical partitioning is a process of dividing a relation into several fragments. The objective of vertical partitioning is to minimize the number disk accesses and execute transactions concurrently, furthermore ,the performance of query execution and system throughput are improved. Study and expand the transaction_Based vertical partitioning algorithm in this paper. It has been proved that it can decompose a relation into fragments relationally.

Summary form only given. The objective of the paper is to present/introduce related procedures, focusing on minimizing undesired and harmful ecological effects. This procedure is based on: the concept of sustainable development, as worked out by the &#8220;World Commission on Environment and Development&#8221; (1987); and a holistic approach, applying technology and innovation management. Sustainable development as &#8220;development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&#8221; (World Commission, 1987, p. 43) subsumes the interlacing of economic, ecological, social and intergenerational aspects to be considered as a necessary entity. This concept has a normative character and gives a helpful orientation for developing the vision of the company. Finally, the practicability of related tools is shown, presenting results of a project (Hibner et al., 1997) comparing wheel/rail with electromagnetic levitation technology for high-speed trains with special emphasis on resource efficiency

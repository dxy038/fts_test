It is shown that neural networks with embedded brainwaves can cross the gap between the fast parallel unconscious mode of neuroscience and the slow serial conscious mode of psychology. The electromagnetic (EM) component of extremely low frequency (ELF) brainwaves appears to enable perfect fitting with narrowed limits of conscious capacity in normal awake states and very extended limits in altered states of consciousness &#8212; due to the biophysical relativistic mechanism of dilated subjective time base. It also enables the mixing of the normally conscious and unconscious contents in altered states, due to the relativistic Doppler mapping of EM component of the "objective" ELF brainwave power spectrum on the zero-degenerate frequency "subjective" one. All that provides an excellent biophysical basis for dream-like altered states of consciousness, and reveals the nature and significance of dreams and intentionally prolonged dream-like altered states.

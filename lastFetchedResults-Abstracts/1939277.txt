The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of coupling agent and the content of fiber on tensile strength and physical properties of wood/plastic composite produced from recycled polypropylene using mat forming procedure. Recycled polypropylene and three levels of Cotton Fiber Stem (50, 55 and 60%) and three levels of MAPP (0, 3 and 5%) were used. The results of tensile strength and physical properties were statistically analyzed using factorial experimental design. The results indicated that the tensile strength of composites with increasing MAPP content and decreasing of fiber content was improved However the modulus of tensile reduced significantly when the fibers content reduced. Also, the physical properties of composites were improved with increasing of MAPP consumption. Thickness swelling of composites after 24 hours and water absorption after 2 hours in boiling water showed these properties are lower when 50% fibers is used.

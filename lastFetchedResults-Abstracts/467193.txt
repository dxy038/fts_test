Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the experiences, satisfaction, and comfort of women with medical student participation in outpatient care during obstetric and gynecology clerkships. Study Design: A consecutive sample of 303 women who attended the clinic were interviewed before consultation; a structured questionnaire was used. Results: Two hundred sixty-four women (87.1%) accepted student involvement; 158 women (59.8%) and 173 women (66.5%), respectively, preferred female students or preceptors. Comfort levels were significantly lower with male students or preceptors in all skills that were tested (P< .0001), particularly pelvic examination and the discussion of sexual problems. Acceptance was associated significantly with older age (P< .0001), higher parity (P< .0001), higher education (P = .002), husband's occupation (P = .006), obstetric consultation (P< .0001), previous teaching encounters (P = .0006), recognition of the students' roles (P = .004), and satisfaction with clinical service (P = 0.01). Reasons for nonacceptance (n = 39 women, 12.9%) were concern about privacy during examination (53.8%) or counseling (25.6%) and the extent of the students' involvement (20.5%). Conclusion: Most women agreed to participate in the teaching of obstetric and gynecologic skills to medical students. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;187:1091-100.)

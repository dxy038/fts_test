Background: Coronary artery disease is considered as the most important cause of death. Infection is regarded as risk factor of coronary artery disease as it could accelerate the development of atherosclerosis process through formation of inflammation. However, studies on Helicobacter pylori infection have produced contradictory results.
Objective: To investigate the coexistence of H. pylori infection and coronary artery diseases among patients in the city of Qazvin (Iran) during 2004-2005.
Methods: This was a case-control clinical trial carried out on a total of 80 individuals including 40 patients with coronary artery diseases (case group) and 40 patients without coronary artery diseases (control group) who were randomly selected for the study. All patients were tested for urease breath test and the data were analyzed statistically using SPSS 15 and the Fisherâ€™s exact test. 
Findings:  Positive results for urease breath test were observed in 80% and 45% of case and control groups, respectively (P=0.005). Among married members of the case group, 39.4% of partners were also found to be positive for urease breath test whereas in partners of patients in control group it was 5.2%. The prevalence of H. pylori in partners of case and control groups was 83.3% and 38.46%, respectively. The difference in prevalence of H. pylori infection between the partners of both groups was found to be significant, statistically (P=0.0032).
Conclusion: Considering the significantly higher prevalence of coexistence of coronary artery diseases and H. pylori infection in partners, it could be concluded that H. pylori may play a role as a transmissible risk factor of coronary artery diseases among people.

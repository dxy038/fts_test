Background and Objective: The demand for natural orange juice with a high quality in terms of nutritional value, physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics, and processed with a minimum of heat treatment, is presently increasing. The shelf-life of orange juices now marketed is short due to rapid microbial growth in them, even when refrigerated. The objective of this study was to determine the potential of ZnO- and Ag-filled LDPE (low-density polyethylene) nanoparticle packaging, as a new packaging method, for preserving the maximum nutritional value, freshness and shelf-life of orange juice.  
Materials and Methods: Nanocomposite LDPE films containing Ag and ZnO nanoparticles were prepared by melt-mixing in a twin-screw extruder.  Packages prepared from these films were then filled with fresh orange juice and stored at 4oC. Microbial stability, ascorbic acid (AA) content, browning index, color value, and sensory characteristics of the juices were determined immediately after packaging and after 7, 28, and 56 days of storage.
Results: Microbial growth rate significantly decreased as a result of using the nanocomposite packaging up to 28 days of storage (p < 0.05). Reduced degradation of AA and development of brown pigments were also observed (p < 0.05) in the orange juice packaged in nanocomposite packages containing 0.25% of nano-ZnO. Moreover, odor, taste and overall sensory attributes ranked highest for the orange juice packed after 28 days of storage (p < 0.05). Packages containing nanosilver increased the shelf-life of fresh orange juice to 28 days, although parts of its sensory attributes weres lost.
Conclusion: Nanocomposite packaging containing 0.25% nano-ZnO  can  extend the shelf-life of natural orange juice for up to 28 days at 4oC, without any undesirable effects on its sensory characteristics.

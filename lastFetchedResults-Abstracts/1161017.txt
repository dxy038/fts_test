Kumis is a traditional fermented cow milk produced and consumed in South West Colombia. The main objective of this research was to studied the enterococcal population, present in 13 kumis samples traditionally manufactured, for their role as beneficial organisms or opportunistic pathogens. The molecular identification of 72 isolates evidenced that Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium were the dominant species. The genes gelE, esp, asa1, cyl and hyl, all associated with virulence factors in enterococci, were detected in 30 isolates, while 42 were free of virulence determinants. Skim milk media were fermented by all the different isolates and further tested for proteolysis (free NH3 groups), Angiotensin-I Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity and biogenic amines production. Nine E. faecalis and two E. faecium strains produced fermented milk with ACE-inhibitory activity values ranging from 39.7% to 84.35% .The digestion of fermented milk samples by pepsin and pancreatin evidenced an increase in ACE inhibitory activity, with E. faecalis KE09 as the best producer (IC50 = 14.25 μg ml−1). Moreover, the strains showed a very low tyrosine decarboxylase activity and did not produce histamine during 48 h fermentation in milk. This study underlines the that Colombian kumis is a good source of not virulent enterococci able to produce fermented milks with ACE-inhibitory activity.

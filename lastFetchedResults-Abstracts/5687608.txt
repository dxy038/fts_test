RFID is a technology being adopted in many business fields, especially in the medical field. This work has the objective to present a system for automation of a hospital clinical analysis laboratory. This system initially uses contactless smart cards to store patient´s data and for authentication of hospital employees in the system. The proposed system also uses RFID tags stuck to containers containing patient´s collected samples for the correct identification of the patient who gave away the samples. This work depicts a hospital laboratory workflow, presents the system modeling and deals with security matters related to information stored in the smart cards.

During Supercomputing 2012 (SC12), an international team of high energy physicists, computer scientists, and network engineers led by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), the University of Victoria, and the University of Michigan, together with Brookhaven National Lab, Vanderbilt and other partners, smashed their previous records for data transfers using the latest generation of wide area network circuitsWith three 100 gigabit/sec (100 Gbps) wide area network circuits [1] set up by the SCinet, Internet2, CENIC, CANARIE and BCnet, Starlight and US LHCNet network teams, and servers at each of the sites with 40 gigabit Ethernet (40GE) interfaces, the team reached a record transfer rate of 339 Gbps between Caltech, the University of Victoria Computing Center in British Columbia, the University of Michigan, and the Salt Palace Convention Center in Utah. This nearly doubled last yearÂ´s overall record, and eclipsed the record for a bidirectional transfer on a single link with a data flow of 187 Gbps between Victoria and Salt Lake.

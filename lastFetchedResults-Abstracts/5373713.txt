Traffic Video Detection and Analysis provide a new objective and reliable reference for traffic real-time monitoring, dynamic dispatching, route guidance and traffic controlling strategy development. This filed has become a hot spot of Intelligent Transportation Research in recent years for its low cost and high accuracy. This paper introduces Video Detection and Analysis System of the public transport for Guangzhou Asian Games, 2010. Consisted of vehicular and pedestrian subsystem, this system is highly accurate and does well in real-time detection in some traffic parameters such as vehicular and pedestrian flow, speed, density. We believe that its prospect is bright.

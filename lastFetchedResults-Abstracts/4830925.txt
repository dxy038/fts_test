Series resonant converters are widely used in applications requiring high power density. They offer several advantages over other topologies such as simplicity of design, switching at zero current levels, and high efficiency due to low switching losses. A new converter will be proposed that delivers pulses of equal energy to the load with comparatively small pulse-to-pulse delay and draws sinusoidal input current pulses. Also, the conventional charge and discharge cycle of the commutation capacitor is eliminated. The capacitor voltage is bidirectional and energy is transferred from the capacitor to the load during each switching cycle. This topology does not generate any abruptly discontinuous current waveforms, therefore, the EMI produced is minimal.

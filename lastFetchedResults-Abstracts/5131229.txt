In this paper the design of fault tolerant wireless networked control systems (WNCS) is addressed. The considered architecture of WNCS consists of a local execution layer, a supervision layer and a resource management layer, which are connected with wireless communication channels. Such an architecture is often used in industrial applications. An approach of integrated design of those layers as well as the communication channel, is proposed. The major objective is to improve system robustness against system and network disturbances (packet loss, bit error), and tolerance to equipment and network faults. A communication protocol is also designed to meet those requirements.

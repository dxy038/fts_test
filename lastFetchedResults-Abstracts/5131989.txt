The problem of the optimum matching of PV array characteristics and electrical loads is investigated with a mathematical approach using nonlinear optimization techniques. The loads are categorized and mathematically defined as ohmic loads, general linear loads, and nonlinear loads. The objective is to optimize the ratio of the load input energy to the PV generator maximum allowable energy over a one-day period and determine the optimum load parameters using nonlinear optimization techniques. The optimum battery parameters are also determined. Optimum parameters for a number of case studies are presented. A maximum power point tracker may not be needed if optimum load matching is achieved.

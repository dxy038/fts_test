The aim of the present study was to determine the difference of information resources used by elite and sub–elite athletes when self–evaluating their performance. The statistical population included 170 elite and sub-elite athletes in Sanandaj city and 120 participants were randomly selected as the sample of the study based on Krejcie and Morgan formula. To collect the data, Wayment (2002) self – evaluation questionnaire which investigated 10 information resources was used. The face validity as well as the content validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by some physical education experts. Using Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient, the reliability of the questionnaire was calculated to be 0.88. In addition to descriptive statistics, inferential statistics such ANOVA were used for data analysis. Findings revealed a significant difference between elite and sub – elite athletes in the use of objective information resources (P < 0.00), personal standards (P < 0.03), personal fear (P < 0.00) and hope for future (P < 0.02). The results also indicated no significant difference between male and female elite athletes in the use of information resources (P > 0.05). There were also no significant differences between elite athletes of individual and team sports in the use of information resources in self-evaluation (P > 0.05). It is, then, concluded that the skill level of athletes can be the main factor of using information resources to self-evaluate their performance.

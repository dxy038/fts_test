There is more than one link between two nodes with the same direction in public transportation networks described by past description, which induces that shortest path problem in public transportation networks can not be solved. This paper brings forwards a new description of public transportation networks that can resolve the problem. So classic algorithms for shortest path problems can be adopted to public transportation guidance system. Three single-objective and a multi-objective public transportation guidance models based on this description are also proposed to satisfy different passengers. This paper also extends the A* algorithm to shortest route problems in public transportation guidance systems. The developed algorithm is implemented with Guangzhou City public transportation network containing 471 routes and 1040 stops. The results indicate that the description, multi-objective model and adaptation of A* algorithm proposed in this paper are efficient.

A genetic algorithm based on double population is presented and applied to synthesize the array antenna pattern by controlling only the current amplitudes. The algorithm includes global and local population, and each population has different objective function, fitness evaluation and genetic programming. Numerical results proved that DPGA has advantages of fast convergence rate and reliability in array antenna synthesis. Compared with existing algorithms, DPGA has no limitation to the frequency of the antenna and avoids the premature convergence

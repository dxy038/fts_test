Background: Helicobacter pylori is the etiological agent in peptic ulcers and gastric carcinoma. The growing problem of antibiotic resistance by this organism demands the search for novel compounds from plant based sources.
Objective: Tea is amongst the most popular beverages in Iran. There is no investigation regarding the inhibitory effects of tea extracts on Helicobacter pylori growth or its urease production and function. This study was conducted to evaluate the inhibitory effects of tea ethyl acetate extracts on Helicobacter pylori growth and its urease.
Methods: This was an experimental study (2008, Science and Research campus) in which the extraction of samples was performed by Soxhelet extractor in methanol/water (1:1) mixture as a solution followed by final re-extraction with ethyl acetate. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of black and green tea extracts were assessed by broth dilution method and examination of urease function performed by Mc Laren method. The urease production was detected on 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
Findings: Both extracts showed inhibitory effects on H. pylori growth, urease function and its production. Urease production was completely inhibited by both black and green tea extracts at concentrations of 3.5mg/ml and 2.5mg/ml, respectively. Also, the growth of H. pylori was inhibited by black tea extract at concentration of 4.5mg/ml and at 3.5mg/ml of green tea extract. Conclusion: Based on inhibitory effects of tea extracts on H. pylori shown in the present study, it seems that both tea extracts in particular the green tea have the potential to reduce the H. pylori population and possibly prevent from chronic gastritis and peptic ulceration.

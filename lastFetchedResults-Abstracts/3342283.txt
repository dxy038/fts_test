The vision of Internet of Things (IoT) is to enable devices to collaborate with each other on the Internet. Multiple devices collaborating with each other have opened up various opportunities in multitude of areas. It has presented unique set of challenges in scaling the Internet, techniques for identification of the devices, power efficient algorithms and communication protocols. Always connected devices have access to private sensitive information and any breach in them is a huge security risk. The IoT environment is composed of the hardware, software and middleware components making it a complex system to manage and secure. The objective of this paper is to present the challenges in IoT related to security, its challenges and recent developments through a comprehensive review of the literature.

The IEEE power system stability controls subcommittee developed a panel session for the power engineering society general meeting in July 2008. One of the contributions to this panel session is presented in this paper. The objective of this paper is to describe black-start operations, to discuss the studies that should be part of a black-start planning process, and in particular to describe the system dynamics and control aspects of the black start process.

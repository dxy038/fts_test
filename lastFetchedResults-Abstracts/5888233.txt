This paper describes an overview of the UTDrive project. UTDrive is part of an on-going international collaboration to collect and research rich multi-modal data recorded for modeling driver behavior for in-vehicle environments. The objective of the UTDrive project is to analyze behavior while the driver is interacting with speech-activated systems or performing common secondary tasks, as well as to better understand speech characteristics of the driver undergoing additional cognitive load. The corpus consists of audio, video, gas/brake pedal pressure, forward distance, GPS information, and CAN-Bus information. The resulting corpus, analysis, and modeling will contribute to more effective speech interactive systems with are less distractive and adjustable to the driverÂ´s cognitive capacity and driving situations.

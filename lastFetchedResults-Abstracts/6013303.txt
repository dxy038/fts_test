Aiming at the uncertain information in the multi objective assessment for aviation ammunition maintenance quality, the model adopts the deviation degree of the interval number to determine the attribute weight, and uses WAA operator to obtain the comprehensive attribute value of the scheme. According to the possibility matrix, it gains the sequencing vector, so as to get the assessment scheme. The final calculation cases show the feasibility &amp; reliability of the model. Under the circumstance that the weight is unknown, the model carried out the assessment for many schemes. The multi-objective evaluation model can effectively solve complex problem for evaluation of aviation ammunition maintenance quality in uncertain condition, and can provide the scientific support for the aviation ammunition maintenance decision.

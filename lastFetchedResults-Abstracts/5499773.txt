This paper presents a multivariable predictive control algorithm to resolve the coupling effect in closed loop systems. The desired decoupling is achieved by including an appropriate weighting factor on the objective function of predictive control. This weighting factor is tuned in synchronization to the error observation to eliminate the strong interaction. The proposed algorithm is applied to the control of humidity and temperature of a neonatal incubator. Simulation results are verified and compared with the others algorithm in the literature.

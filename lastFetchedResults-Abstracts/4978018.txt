This-paper characterizes the effectiveness of an error detection technique that addresses transient faults induced by the environment (radiation, EMC) in processor-based architectures. Experimental results obtained from fault injection sessions performed on two platforms built around a 32-bit digital signal processor and an 8-bit microcontroller, provide objective figures about the efficiency of the proposed approach.

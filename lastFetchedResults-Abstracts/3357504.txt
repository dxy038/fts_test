Aim is to develop a wireless three level controlled smart irrigation system to provide irrigation system which is automatic for the plants which help in saving water and money. The main objective is to apply the system for improvement of health of the soil and hence the plant via multiple sensors. In last few years, remotely monitored embedded system for irrigation purposes have become a new necessity for farmer to save his energy, time and money. This paper is proposing a complete agricultural solution for the farmer based on Wireless Sensor Networks and GPRS technology.

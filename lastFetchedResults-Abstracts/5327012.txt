According to the demands of actual rolling schedules designing, power distribution, rolling energy consumption and slip rate are selected as objective functions. Then the multi-objective model of rolling schedules is established. An adaptive weight differential evolution algorithm is proposed for multi-objective optimization. And it is applied to rolling schedules multi-objective optimization of tandem cold rolling. The result shows that the proposed method decreases the values of three objective functions simultaneously compared to actual rolling schedules.

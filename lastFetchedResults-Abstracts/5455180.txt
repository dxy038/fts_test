The extraction of fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) from the composite maternal ECG signal is discussed. This problem can be deduced to blind source extraction. Barros and Cichocki presented an objective function by using blind signal extraction along with prior information about the autocorrelation property of the FECG from the noisy free measurements. However, it is realistic to extract the FECG from noisy measurements. We extend the work for the noisy case and propose a new algorithm for the FECG extraction with additive noise. Simulation results confirm the validity of the proposed method.

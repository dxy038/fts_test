This paper describes new heuristic reactive project scheduling procedures that may be used to repair resource-constrained project baseline schedules that suffer from multiple activity duration disruptions during project execution. The objective is to minimize the deviations between the baseline schedule and the schedule that is actually realized.
We discuss computational results obtained with priority-rule based schedule generation schemes, a sampling approach and a weighted-earliness tardiness heuristic on a set of randomly generated project instances.

Aims
The objective of the study was to report a series of patients with H端rthle cell tumours.
Methods

We reviewed medical records of single institution from January 1982 to December 2002, including follow-up information.
Results

We identified 199 patients with H端rthle cell tumours (HCT), 88 patients with H端rthle cell carcinoma (HCC) and 111 patients with H端rthle cell adenoma (HCA). The HCC group had significantly longer duration of the disease and larger tumours (4.8 vs 3.8 cm) compared with HCA group. Gender appeared to play significant role in patients with HCT (women outnumbered man by 7:1; p<0.01). Surgical management for 80% of patients with HCA consisted of hemithyroidectomy and total thyroidectomy in 87% patients in the HCC group. Temporary laryngeal nerve palsy and temporary hypoparathyroidismus were not seen in HCA group, in HCC group were confirmed in 2.27 and 3.41%, respectively. Four patients with HCC relapsed and two died of HCC.
Conclusions

HCC has outlook for favorable outcome when treated radically with total thyroidectomy.

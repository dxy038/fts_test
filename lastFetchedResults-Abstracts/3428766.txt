This paper presents a new multiobjective Tabu search (NMTS) algorithm to solve a multiobjective fuzzy model for optimal planning of distribution systems. This algorithm obtains multiobjective nondominated solutions to three objective functions: fuzzy economic cost, level of fuzzy reliability, and exposure (maximization of robustness), also including optimal size and location of reserve feeders to be built for maximizing the level of reliability at the lowest economic cost (for a given level of robustness). The main characteristics of the NMTS algorithm are: search of planning solutions using several objective functions simultaneously; partition of the space of solutions to diversify the search; intensification of the search by ranking lists of the best network nodes of the distribution system; and an elaborated Tabu list that stores visited network nodes, avoiding unwanted movements. The NMTS algorithm has been intensively tested in real distribution systems, proving its practical application in large power distribution systems.

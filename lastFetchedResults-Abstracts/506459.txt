Due to the limitation of suitable water resources in arid and semi-arid areas, saline and brackish water is an important source for irrigation. Use of brackish waters is limited to salt tolerant crops or is used alternately with scarce freshwater resources in surface irrigation methods. Therefore, in this study, surface and sub-irrigation methods were investigated for production of tomato that is one of the world's major food crops. To achieve the proposed objective, a randomized complete block design experiment was performed in three replicates. Three levels of saline water (S1=0.7, S2=2 and S3=4 dS/m) were applied by two irrigation methods (M1=surface irrigation and M2= sub-irrigation). Water table level in sub-irrigation method was kept at 80 cm below the soil surface. The soil texture was clay loam. The results of this study showed that the salinity (p < 0.01) and the interaction of irrigation method and salinity (p < 0.05) had significant effect on tomato yield. But, irrigation method did not have any significant effect on tomato yield. The maximum yield (50.6 ton/ha) corresponded to M1S1 treatment and the minimum yield (37.4 ton/ha) was obtained in M1S3 treatment. The tomato yield in sub-irrigation system was higher (17.1 percent) than that in surface irrigation system when 4 dS/m water was applied. Irrigation method had significant effect (p < 0.05) on fruit weight and number of fruit. Also salinity had significant effect (p < 0.01) on fruit diameter, plant height, and wet weight. Salinity had significant effect (p < 0.05) on the number of fruit. Among the irrigation treatments, M2S1 and M1S3 with, respectively, 9.4 and 4.9 kg /m3 had, the highest and the lowest water use efficiency.

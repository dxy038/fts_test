This paper describes a heuristic algorithm in 0(n^2) which assigns a set of real-time task to a set of processing sites, The main objective that we try to achieve is to balance the load over the different processors of tke system to improve the safety of the system us well as checking the scheduling conditions that must be satisfied in a real-time context and taking into account given allocation consraints.

Objective based research method is the functional research method and study method based on method and nature is analytical-descriptive research. For collecting information, the library, documentary, direct observation and interviews were used. Based on the research results, the best strategy for Maraghe urban development would be the strategy for development of higher education and universities in the city and changing Maraghe in to a collegiate town, mean while the strategy for strengthening tourism performance of the city is considered as a substitute strategy.

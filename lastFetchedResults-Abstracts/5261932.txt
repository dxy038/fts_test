This work analyzes the case of an AC-AC matrix converter, as an alternative to back-to-back converter, to interface a high-speed micro-turbine generator to a utility load as a distributed generation unit. It is proposed an evaluation procedure of an input-state feedback linearization control of Two-Stage Matrix Converters, in continuous and discrete time, aiming a unit input power factor. Principals of spatial modulation and IGBT bidirectional switch commutation in matrix converters are reviewed. The assessment considers, using ideal and nonideal IGBT models, an indirect evaluation of the inserted error in the output signal expectations due the lack of synchronization between the integration time used in the simulation and the firing times of the power devices.

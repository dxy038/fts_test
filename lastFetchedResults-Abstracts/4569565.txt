Harmonic measurements are made in industrial power systems in order to: (a) aid in the design of capacitor or filter banks; (b) verify the design and installation of capacitor or filter banks; (c) verify compliance with utility harmonic distortion requirements; and (d) investigate suspected harmonic problems. The results of these measurements are used in design calculations, verification, comparison with standards, and system modeling. Each of these objectives will affect the choice of a measurement approach. The selection of the measured quantities, measurement points in the system, and the types of instruments and transducers should be based upon the measurement objective. Once measurements are taken, additional calculations must be made to put the results into a useful form. The measurement results will then provide a firm basis for further engineering work

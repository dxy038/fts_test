This paper focuses on the nano-scale analysis of the mechanical properties of polymer and carbon nanotubes (CNT) embedded MEMS devices using the probe tip of the atomic force microscope (AFM).The mechanical properties of the surfaces of layered materials were investigated by using nanoindentation produced with the tips of an AFM. Experiment results indicated the bending characteristics of the device and also the YoungÂ´s modulus of the CNT embedded micro structure. Our objective was to determine the nano-scale mechanical properties and piezoresistivity of bulk carbon nanotubes using the local probe manipulation.

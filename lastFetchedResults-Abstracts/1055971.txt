Objective: Psychological factors such as the health locus of control play an important role on health behaviors such as adherence to diet regimen. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of health locus of control in predicting adherence to diet regimen among a group of patients with type 2 diabetes. 
Materials and Methods: Research sample was recruited from several clinics in Shiraz using convenient sampling method. Participants consisted of 140 patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients completed the Multi-dimension Health Locus of Control Scale (MHLC: Internal, External, Chance) and the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Questionnaire (SDSCA). 
Results: Nearly half of the patients with type 2 diabetes adhered to their diet regimen. The results also showed that external locus of control significantly predicted adherence to diet regimen (P < 0.05). Furthermore, chance locus of control predicted non-adherence to diet regimen significantly (P < 0.001). Internal locus of control, age, education and illness duration had no significant role in predicting adherence to diet regimen.
Conclusion: Patients with type 2 diabetes who perceived their illness as a destiny or fate were less likely to adhere to diet regimen, while those believed that powerful others such as doctors determine their health were more likely to adhere to recommended diet regimen. The present study highlighted the role of perceived control on adherence to diet regimen.

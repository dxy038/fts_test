Considers the problem of call admission control for an ATM multiplexer by formulating it as a semi-Markov decision process. The authors´ model consists of a single link with two types of calls. While in the system, a call sends out cells as an on/off fluid source. The objective is to maximize the long run average reward from call acceptance subject to constraints that the fraction of cells of each type that are lost must be below given levels. The authors´ numerical results allow them to contrast two related formulations of the optimization problem: `aggressive´ and `conservative´. In addition, the authors quantify the effect of using cell level control to replace the two cell loss constraints by one

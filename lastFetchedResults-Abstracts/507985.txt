During the past two decades, there have been tremendous efforts on developing efficient
business excellence models to improve the quality of organizations. A typical business
excellence model proposes several alternatives with different budget and the primary objective
is to use the best ones. In this paper, we present a robust LINMAP method for measuring the
relative importance of various alternatives in an EFQM self assessment. The presented robust
model is capable of handling uncertainty as part of the problem formulation. The proposed
model of this paper is implemented for a case-study of energy sector in Iran with various
alternatives. The orderings of the alternatives are measured using data from multiple experts
through applying the proposed model of this paper.

OBJECTIVE: We report a 10-year experience with vaginal birth after cesarean section in women with twins. STUDY DESIGN: Data were gathered from labor and delivery records and maternal and neonatal hospital charts. Women with a vertical uterine scar, a previous uterine rupture, an unrepaired dehiscence, or obstetric contraindications to labor were excluded from a trial of labor. Full-thickness uterine defects requiring intervention were classified as ruptures; all others were classified as dehiscences. RESULTS: Between Jan. 1, 1985, and Dec. 31, 1994, at Los Angeles County/University of Southern California Women's Hospital, 210 women with previous cesarean births were delivered of twins. One hundred eighteen (56%) underwent repeat cesarean delivery without a trial of labor. Ninety-two (44%) undertook a trial of labor with no uterine ruptures and no increase in maternal or perinatal morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In women with twins a trial of labor after a previous cesarean section is a safe and effective alternative to routine repeat cesarean delivery. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1996;175:194-8.)

This paper proposes a novel converter topology that interfaces four power ports: two sources, one bidirectional storage port, and one isolated load port. The proposed four-port dc/dc converter is derived by simply adding two switches and two diodes to the traditional half-bridge topology. Zero-voltage switching is realized for all four main switches. Three of the four ports can be tightly regulated by adjusting their independent duty-cycle values, while the fourth port is left unregulated to maintain the power balance for the system. Circuit analysis and design considerations are presented; the dynamic modeling and close-loop design guidance are given as well. Experimental results verify the proposed topology and confirm its ability to achieve tight independent control over three power-processing paths. This topology promises significant savings in component count and losses for renewable energy power-harvesting systems.

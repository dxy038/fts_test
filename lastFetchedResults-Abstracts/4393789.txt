The measurement and improvement of flow in the WMN wireless mesh networks is still a subject of research, making it an issue of importance for the development of 802.11s standard. The objective is to estimate their capacity to better manage traffic and ensure good quality of service QoS. The capacity of a WMN is one of the most important characteristics; it reflects the load of traffic it can flow to a destination. The development of this metric will be the basis for solving problems such as fairness and media access. We have performed research concerning the nature of the goodput in the face of several parameters and on two types of wireless mesh networks: networks adopting the mechanism of the broadcast control messages and networks without flood control. The objective of this work is to derive the optimal values of inter-departure/size pair of packets that match a maximum goodput.

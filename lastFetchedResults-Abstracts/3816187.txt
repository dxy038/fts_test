This paper addresses the problem of curtailing the number of control actions and minimizing controller movements for real-time voltage/reactive power control. Algorithms are proposed to identify the most effective subset of control actions and to minimize controller movements. An algorithmic objective function appropriate for the treatment of system security and economy is also proposed. It eliminates trial and error adjustments of weightage factors for a combined objective. A single parameter decides the priority between movement of controls and gains in security as well as loss reduction. The algorithms are compared and contrasted with sequential linear programming and sequential quadratic programming techniques by means of two practical systems

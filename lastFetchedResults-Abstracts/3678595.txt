It is well known that a rigid in-plane motion can be decomposed into a translation and a rotation around an origin. Based on our previous work, we first extend the Helgason-Ludwig consistency condition (HLCC) to cover a general rigid motion in fan-beam geometry. Then, we model the general motion by several parameters, and develop an iterative scheme for estimation of the in-plane motion parameters. This scheme determines the motion parameters by numerically minimizing an objective function constructed based on the HLCC. After the motion parameters are estimated, image reconstruction can be performed to compensate for the motion effects. Finally, we implement the algorithm and evaluate its performance in numerical simulations

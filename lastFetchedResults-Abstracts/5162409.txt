A new approach based on particle swarm optimization technique is proposed for the design of load following controller for microturbines in a competitive distributed generation power system. The objective is to avoid any power change from upper system when there is small load change in the local distribution system. A case study for IEEE-37 Node Feeder is presented to illustrate the proposed approach. The designed controllers showed a satisfactory system response. The substation power supply is kept constant and the microturbines followed the load changes equally.

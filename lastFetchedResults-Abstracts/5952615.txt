With water resources network-node graph, calculating element water supply and demand balance data and rainfall-runoff, related amount of pollution has been forecasted in the future year (year 2020, 2030). By comprehensively consideration the watershed landform and pollutants degradation characteristic, the paper puts forward implementation process of water quality control objective based on the allowable permitted assimilative capacity of water bodies, the control amount of pollutants discharged into river. In the year 2030, the total water demand in Hun-Tai River basin is 740 million m3, water shortage ratio is less than 1%, the control amount discharged into river of chemical oxygen demand(COD), ammoniacal nitrogen(NH<sub>3</sub>-N), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen(TN) is 93, 6, 8 and 9 thousand ton respective. Applying the above method, under the condition that COD, NH<sub>3</sub>-N, TP and TN discharged into river is 285, 28, 31 and 46 thousand ton, the realization rate of water quality control objective is 100%. Therefore, water quality control method for the polluted river is valid and feasible.

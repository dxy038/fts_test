The optic concept of holography can been extended to the microwave frequencies offering new potential for antenna applications. The attention to these applications has been renewed by the possibility to realize modulated surface impedances on the basis of artificial magnetic surfaces, as suggested by Sievenpiper (D. Sievenpiper et al.). The holographic surface (M. ElSherbiny et al., 2004) that provides a given direction of the maximum radiated power density, can be obtained by interference of the incident wave from a feeder and a plane wave coming from the direction of maximum radiation. The range of operation of holographic antennas is such as the incident wave is dominated by a surface wave (SW) contribution. The same phenomenon can be also seen as local angular transformation from a SW in a leaky wave (LW) (M. Nannetti et al., 2007). This paper has the objective to give guideline for the design of a particular class of holographic antennas based on an curvilinear strips printed on a grounded slab.

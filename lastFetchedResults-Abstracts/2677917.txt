Objective (s): Regular walking has a positive impact on diabetic patientsâ€™ health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of regular walking for 3 months on some glycemic indexes and blood pressure in women with type 2 diabetes.
Methods: 100 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned in 2 groups )regular walking group and the control group. The first group walked 3 months regularly for 30 minutes. The intensity of walking measured by Borg scale of perceived exertion. The control group had no regular walking regularly. Glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured before and after the intervention. Covariance analysis method and paired t-test were used.
Results: There were no differences between two groups in the characteristics of patients including height, weight, age, and history of diabetes. Glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly in regular walking group and fasting blood glucose and systolic blood pressure increased significantly in the control group )p?0.05(. Comparison between two groups showed that changes in glycosylated hemoglobin )p  <  0.0001), fasting blood glucose ) p= 0.001(, systolic and diastolic blood pressure )p  < 0.0001 between two groups was significant.
Conclusion: The findings suggest that regular walking can improve glycemic indices in type 2 diabetic patients.

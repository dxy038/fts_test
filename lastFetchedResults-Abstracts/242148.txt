The objective of this study is to examine the potential for a full transition to domestically produced biofuels in the Stockholm County
transport system in 2030, without exceeding the proportional share of national bioenergy assets. This target is chosen in order to test the
potential of biofuel assets in Sweden, facilitating the transition to renewable fuel systems, and to display the potential of transport energy
demand at macrolevel under tighter conditions on the energy market after fossil oil production has peaked. The distribution of bioenergy
to the transport sector, including conversion losses and relationships to other energy sectors, is analysed explicitly. State-of-the-art traffic
forecasting models, complemented with a specially designed energy quantification model, are applied to assess energy quantities needed
at different vehicle efficiency levels and mobility patterns. The purpose is not to determine the most energy-efficient transport system
possible, or to forecast the optimal distribution of bioenergy set aside for the transport sector in the future. Rather, we try to visualise, at
a more conceptual level, energy demand as dependent on principle transport strategies, future technological developments and a type of
planning that takes technological interlinkages between evolving components into strategic account. This work highlights the importance
of implementing both demand and supply-side policies in order to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in all energy sectors
before making assessments of reasonable distributions of bioenergy between energy sectors and other biomass usage.

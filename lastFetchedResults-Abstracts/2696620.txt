A new approach for designing a sequence that has very low autocorrelation sidelobe levels at specified intervals is proposed. The synthesised autocorrelation function is defined for denoting the autocorrelation properties, and the design problem is formulated as a power spectral density (PSD) fitting problem. In this way, a simple optimisation objective function is obtained and an iterative optimisation technique is applied. The proposed approach is computationally efficient and can generate a sequence with autocorrelation sidelobes that are practically zero at the required lag intervals.

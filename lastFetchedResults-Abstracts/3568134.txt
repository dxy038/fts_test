The goals and objectives of the High Temperature Superconductivity Space Experimental (HTSSE) program are described, and a description of the first launch package and plans for future experiments (HTSSE-II) are presented. The objective of the program is to prove that HTS technology is sufficiently robust to survive the space environment and that it has the potential to significantly improve space communications systems. The devices for the initial launch (HTSSE-I) have been delivered to US Naval Research Laboratory, their electrical characteristics have been verified, and their packages have been space-qualified. These devices will be integrated with a cryogenic refrigeration system and a data acquisition system, all space-qualified. Once placed in earth orbit, the experimental package will be cooled to cryogenic temperatures and the characteristics of the HTS devices monitored periodically. The HTSSE-I mission, scheduled to start in 1993, will last for at least six months.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

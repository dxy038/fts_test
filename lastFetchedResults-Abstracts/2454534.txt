An international benchmark validation task has been conducted to validate the Fusion Evaluated Nuclear Data Library FENDL—1 through data tests against integral 14 MeV neutron experiments. The main objective of this task was to qualify the FENDL—1 working libraries for fusion applications and to elaborate recommendations for further data improvements. Several laboratories and institutions from the European Union, Japan, the Russian Federation and US have contributed to the benchmark task. A large variety of existing integral 14 MeV benchmark experiments was analysed with the FENDL—1 working libraries for continuous energy Monte Carlo and multigroup discrete ordinates calculations. Results of the benchmark analyses have been collected, discussed and evaluated. The major findings, conclusions and recommendations are presented in this paper. With regard to the data quality, it is summarised that fusion nuclear data have reached a high confidence level with the available FENDL—1 Data Library. With few exceptions this holds for the materials of highest importance for fusion reactor applications. As a result of the performed benchmark analyses, some existing deficiencies and discrepancies have been identified that are recommended for removal in the forthcoming FENDL—2 data file.

A switched-reluctance-motor (SRM) drive designed to achieve wide-speed-range operation with reduced torque ripple is presented. The wide speed range is obtained by phase advancing between two critical rotor positions, which are defined by the machine geometry and material properties. The design factors affecting the angular separation between these rotor positions and the methods of optimising the design for the wide-speed-range control objective have been determined. The experimental results of the SRM drive implemented on a TMS320C30 DSP platform are presented.

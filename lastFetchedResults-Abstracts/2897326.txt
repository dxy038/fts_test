An interactive presentation is intended to support lecturers that need to enhance presentation expressions and gather real-time feedback from audiences while delivering their presentations. Our objective is to improve the efficiency of bi-directional communication between a lecturer and a large audience in presentations using a real-time questionnaire that the result is displayed on a shared screen in real-time while gathering answers. The real-time questionnaire is based on a hybrid interactive presentation system that is collaboration between the traditional presentation supporting system and a web application. To gather feedback from audiences at presentations, our system provides the web application that delivers presentation slides to audiences and provides a feature of creating annotations and answering the questions on delivered presentation slides. The result of an experiment for evaluating performance of our system showed that the features of the real-time questionnaire have high performance scalability.

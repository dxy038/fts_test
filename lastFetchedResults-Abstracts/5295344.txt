The PID control parameters are very important to performance of hydraulic servo control system and how to find rapidly the optimum values of PID control parameters is very difficult problem. According to the search mechanism of differential evolution algorithm, differential evolution algorithm for tuning PID parameters was proposed. The algorithm program DEPID1.0 was developed. Based on Matlab/simulink software and taking the IATE standards of optimization design as objective function, the proposed method was applied for the optimization of the three parameters of PID controller of electric-hydraulic servo system of 6-DOF parallel platform. Simulation results show that the proposed parameter optimum method is an effective tuning strategy and has good performance.

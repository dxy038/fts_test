This paper details current status of modelling for power electronics modules and details the challenges in terms of electrical, thermal, reliability and robustness analysis. Multi-domain, multi-physics and multi-objective optimisation toolsets are urgently required for future integrated power electronics. The paper illustrates future trends in power module designs and provides examples of current modelling toolsets and developments in multi-domain (physics) analysis.

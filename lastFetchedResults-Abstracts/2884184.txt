The three-parameter (3P) elliptical aperture distribution, which as previously published had been limited to sum patterns, is complemented with a variation that applies to difference patterns. The parameter values are determined by particle swarm optimization (PSO) to meet particular system modeling performance requirements. The new distribution is suitable for system modeling of tracking antenna applications and can maximize relative angle sensitivity while minimizing clutter from sidelobes. The equations for relative angle sensitivity for the difference pattern are presented. A multi-objective PSO example is presented, optimizing the tradeoff between peak sidelobe level and relative angle sensitivity.

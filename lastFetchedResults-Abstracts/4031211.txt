The question &#8220;to interlace or not to interlace&#8221; divides the television and the personal computer communities. A proper answer requires a common understanding of what is possible nowadays in deinterlacing video signals. This paper outlines the most relevant proposals, ranging front simple linear methods to advanced motion-compensated algorithms, and provides a relative performance comparison for 12 of these methods. Next to objective performance indicators, screen photographs have been used to illustrate typical artifacts of individual deinterlacers. The overview provides no final answer in the interlace debate, as such requires unavailable capabilities in balancing technical and nontechnical issues

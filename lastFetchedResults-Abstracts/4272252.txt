This paper investigates a wireless IPv6-based network architecture to provide access to various multimedia applications with support of voice services, in terms of end-to-end quality of service (QoS) and mobility support in order to ensure global mobility in a converged wired/wireless, voice/data network. The objective is how to jointly use already proposed by the International Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols for the provision of an end-to-end service with some QoS guarantees. Our work studies transmissions for real-time traffic based on formats for voice over IP (VoIP) and differs from others in that it has been based on the development of a detail simulator instead of a real testbed. QoS is addressed at a packet-level in terms of packet delivery delay and error performance (packet loss). To enforce QoS in the backbone network, data packets entering the backbone network are classified to differentiated service (DiffServ) aggregates. resource reservations protocol (RSVP) is used as the end-to-end signaling protocol. To provide for hierarchical mobility support it has been enhanced by several extensions

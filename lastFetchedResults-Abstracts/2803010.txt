A stable and reliable power distribution system is an inevitable pre-requisite for the technological and smarter power system. Furthermore, the traditional methodology for improving reliability of distribution system under smart grid environment will be unavailing. For this purposed, a novel approach is presented for multi objective placement and number of the Fault Indicator (Fl) in the smart distribution systems. The reliability index and investment cost are considered as multifarious objectives in the multi objective problem. Due to its good handling of non-convex and mixed integer problem, a Fuzzy Clustering-based Genetic Algorithm (FCGA) is utilized for optimization problem. The simulation is conducted on a 50 node real system to trace the capability of proposed algorithm.

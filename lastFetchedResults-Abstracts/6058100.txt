The objective of this study was to investigate how different motivational components of social cognitive theory relate to students´ use of cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies in web - based autonomous English learning (WAEL). University students (n = 140) completed a survey that assessed their task value and self-efficacy, as well as outcome variables that included their use of three self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies. Pearson correlations indicate that task value and self-efficacy were significantly related to students´ use of elaboration, critical thinking, and metacognitive learning strategies. Additionally, results from regression analyses reveal that task value and self-efficacy were significant positive predictors of students´ use of various learning strategies. Educational implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.

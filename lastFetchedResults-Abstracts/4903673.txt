This paper proposed the new method to carry out the optimized allocation of the protection devices to improve SAIFI based on the current placement of devices. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the objective function. Advantages of the method used in this paper are minimal risk to change the protection devices, cost minimization of change the location of the devices and system reliability improvement. In order to illustrate the application of this method, an actual electric power distribution feeder, 20 kV, overhead lines, three-wire with a delta-grounded wye connection substation transformer is used.

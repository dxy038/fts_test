The packet-level traffic characteristics in the Internet are so complex that it is natural to do traffic engineering (TE) and control at the flow level. The emerging multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) has introduced an attractive solution to TE in IP networks. The main objective of this paper is to balance traffic at the flow level among the parallel label switched paths (LSPs) in MPLS networks. We first introduce a multipath load-balancing model at the flow level. In this model, each LSP is modeled as an M/G/1 processor-sharing queue. Based on the analysis of the model, we propose a heuristic but efficient mechanism that is implemented only at the ingress label switched routers (LSRs) and egress LSRs in the network. Extensive simulations using NS2 are performed with MPLS modules. The simulation results show that the load through the network is well balanced so that the network throughput is improved and the delay is decreased significantly.

Possibility of hydrogen production from biogas using hot slag has been studied, in which decomposition rate of CO 2 â€“ CH 4 in a packed bed of granulated slag was measured at constant flow-rate and pressure. The molten slag, discharged at high temperature over 1700 K from smelting industries such as steelmaking or municipal waste incineration. It has enough potential for replacing energy required for hydrogen production due to the catalytic steam reforming or carbon decomposition of hydrocarbon. However, heat recovery of hot slag has never been established. Therefore, the objective of this work is to generate hydrogen from methane using heated slag particles as catalyst, in which the effect of temperature on the hydrogen generation was mainly investigated at range from 973 to 1273 K. In the experiments a mixed gas of CH 4 and CO 2 was continuously introduced into the packed bed of hot slag at constant flow-rate and atmospheric pressure and then the outlet gas was monitored by gas chromatography. The results indicate that slag acted as not only thermal media but also good catalyst, for promoting decomposition. The product gases were mainly hydrogen and carbon monoxide with/without solid carbon deposition on the surface of slag, depending on the reaction temperature. Increasing temperature led to large hydrogen generation with decreasing un-reacted methane in the outlet gas, at when the largest methane conversion was about 96%. The results suggested a new energy-saving process of hydrogen production, in which the waste heat from molten slag can replace the energy required for hydrogen production, reducing carbon dioxide emission.

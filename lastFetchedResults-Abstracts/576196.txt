Use of native cool - season grasses are important due to adaptability, soil conservation, livestock grazing and forage production in rangelands. However, Emergence and seedling establishment are critical phases in rangeland management particularly in arid and semiarid regions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact factors on emergence and seedling establishment characteristics of seven cool - season grasses (Agropyron elongatum ,Agropyron pecteniforme , Bromus inermis , Bromus tomentellus ,Festuca  ovina , Dactylis glomerata , Secale montanum ) in field conditions on sites in northern khorasan in 2005 .Field experiment was using randomized complete block design with four replicates. The emergence percentage, emergence rate and status of seedling establishment by measurement of seedling various components at the end of experiment were studied. Analysis of variance revealed that no meaningful difference between species for final emergence occurred but species had significant effect on emergence rate and different characters of seedling growing (p < 0.05).The most emergence percentage on all studied regions, were related to the large-seeded grasses such as: Secale montaum, (about %23/5). These results suggest that seed size and tiller seedling and speed of species emergence could be effective on grasses establishment.

In this work, the authors examine design and implementation of modular field-programmable analog array (FPAA) hardware for emulation of multi-bus power system dynamic behavior. The objective is to develop this hardware such that it facilitates the study of large power systems via increased operator (aka. component) density and application-specific design adaptation. This paper focuses on modularity and system structure, scalability and actuation / data acquisition, as well as board fabrication; it represents an extension of the authorsÂ´ previous work in the field of FPAA technology and power system emulation.

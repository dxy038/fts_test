
Michel Foucault's Reflection in Socio-Political Thought of Muslim Thinkers

Elham Nasirypour 

Because of its methodological innovation and of taking a converse view towards the social issues, the thought of Michel Foucault, has been received positively in Iran as well as in other countries; so that studies of researchers in the humanities have been influenced by Foucault's principles and ideas. But there exists a major problem in the use the Muslim thinkers make of Foucault's ideas, and it is the insensitivity to the requirements and cultural-intellectual climate of Iran's Islamic community. Such insensitivity leads to deviations from the proper path of predominant intellectual-cultural climate which will be followed by a way of explaining, as far as the political-social issues are concerned. Therefore, in this paper, we use the critical approach of sociology, which constitutes our most important objective. It helps us to provide the correct understanding of human science researchers. To achieve this we, on the one hand, review and critically evaluate the foundation of Foucault thought, and other hand, we conduct a case study on several of his followers. Finally, what we reached in doing this critical research and analytical-descriptive survey is that adoption or incorporation of Foucault's ideas is not compatible with the basic idea of religion. This is because of principles of relativism and rejection of meaning and of the fact. But it is desirable and can be considered by us, as it attracts attention to an external matter. Yet one must be careful not to be trapped in settings set by historicity.

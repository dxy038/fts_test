The main objective of this paper is to determine the different methods that can be used for enhancing the battery life of the Zigbee modules used in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Although the Zigbee modules inherently consume less power, it can be shown that a wise choice of data packet length and suitable networking of Zigbee modules will further help to increase the battery life. This will not only require less frequent replacement of batteries leading to a lower maintenance cost but will also help to improve the transmitted data rate, which is the main disadvantage with Zigbee based Wireless communication systems.

Objective: Biphasic ceramics of hydroxyapatite and three calcium phosphate (HA/
TCP) are increasingly being used as a bone substitute in regenerative surgery. To
increase the bone forming capacities, HA/TCP Scaffolds could be enriched with osteogenic
factor like mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) which is the subject of present
study.
Materials and Methods: Passaged-3 culture-expanded MSCs of canines bone marrow
were suspended in a diluted collagen gel and loaded onto commercially-available
HA/TCP ceramics. The cell-loaded scaffolds were then autologously implanted along
with the control cell-free scaffolds in masseter muscles of the four mongrel dogs. Eight
weeks later, the parts of their muscles including the implants were prepared for a
light microscopy. To quantify the amount of bone formation, the slides of both studied
groups were photographed and the percent area of the newly formed bone was calculated
using Image-Pro Plust software.
Results: According to our observations, the implants were appeared to be encapsulated
by fibrous tissue within the muscle. No cartilage tissues were observed in
implantation site. Histological observation indicated that ectopic bone was formed in
both MSCs-loaded scaffolds as well as the control cell-free implants. The percentage
of newly formed bone for cell loaded HA/TCP scaffolds was %29.12±6.01 compared
to %23.55±4.99 of the cell-free implants (p < 0.05). Furthermore, lamellar mature bone
was only observed in cells/scaffold groups.
Conclusion: Taken together, it seems that MSCs enhance bone formation capacity of
HA/TCP. The formed bone following MSCs/scaffold composite implantation appeared
to be histologically lymature lamellar bone.

Objective:To assess the effects of platelet rich plasma (PRP) with chitosan biodegradable film on full thickness wound healing in rat.
Methods:This was an experimental study being performed in 2015 during a 4-month period. Twenty-four male white Wistar rats were divided into four groups of 12 rats each, randomly: Control group (SHAM) with creation of wounds and no treatment, PRP group with creation of wounds and application of one milliliter PRP, Chitosan group (CHIT) with dressing the wound with chitosan and CHIT/PRP group with application of one mL PRPand dressing the wound with chitosan. The wounds were created by cutting healthy skin.Wound size was measured on 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 post surgery and was compared between groups.
Results:Reduction in wound area, hydroxyproline contents and biomechanical parametersindicated there was significant difference (p=0.001) between group CHIT/PRP and other groups. Biomechanical testing was performed on day 9 post surgery in incisional model. Quantitative histological studies and mean rank of the qualitative studies demonstrated that there was significant difference (p < 0.001) between group CHIT/PRP and other groups.
Conclusion:PRP with chitosan have bene?cial effects on wounds repair and could be suggested for treating various types of wounds in animals and human being.

Background: Spinal cord compression is one of causes for disability. Nowadaysto minimize these complication is a goal.
Objective: The effect of aquae extract of Aloe vera on motoneuron death and chemical neurotransmitter for cell signaling in paralysed rats.
Methods: We used 32 female rats from Razi institute. They were randomized divided to 4 groups: 1- control 2- treated with Aloe vera 3- treated with Aloe vera + spinal cord compression by clips aneurysm 4- control+spinal cord compression by clips aneurysm. Perituneal injection continued for 4 weeks (every day). We used 2.5 mg/kg aquae extract of Aloe vera.
Results: Compression hascaused, motoneuron in ventral horn decreases with cavitation. Insecond group these changes are less (p? 0.05). Aloe vera increasessynaptophysin in complete and partial model (p? 0.05).
Conclusion: For the first time Aloe vera has studied for synaptic reaction. It seems the number and percentage of motoneurons increased, as the same as synaptophysin in complete and partial model.

Objective: The aim of this thesis is to explore antioxidant activity of total flavonoids extracted from indocalamus leaves. Method: Aging mice model was established by D-galactose induction. Three groups of mice were treated with total flavonoids extracted from indocalamus leaves at doses of 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg d bw respectively. The antioxidant status in the aging mice was measured by determining the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT) and total anti-oxidant capability (T-AOC) in the serum and liver and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the serum, liver and brain. Results: Compared with control group, extracts of indocalamus leaves significantly enhanced activities of SOD, GSH-Px, CAT in the serum and liver, and decreased MDA content in the serum, liver and brain at the tested doses. Conclusion: Total flavonoids extracted from indocalamus leaves demonstrated the potent antioxidant activity.

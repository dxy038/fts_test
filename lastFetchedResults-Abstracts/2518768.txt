<p><strong>Objective: </strong>This study aimed to provide a normative study documenting how 114 five-seven year-old non-‎patient Iranian children respond to the Rorschach test. We compared this especial sample to ‎international normative reference values for the Comprehensive System (CS).‎</p><p><strong>Method:</strong> One hundred fourteen 5- 7- year-old non-patient Iranian children were recruited from public ‎schools. Using five child and adolescent samples from five countries, we compared Iranian ‎Normative Reference Data- based on reference means and standard deviations for each sample.‎</p><p><strong>Results:</strong> Findings revealed that how the scores in each sample were distributed and how the samples were ‎compared across variables in eight Rorschach Comprehensive System (CS) clusters. We reported ‎all descriptive statistics such as reference mean and standard deviation for all variables.‎</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Iranian clinicians could rely on country specific or “local norms” when assessing children. We ‎discourage Iranian clinicians to use many CS scores to make nomothetic, score-based inferences ‎about psychopathology in children and adolescents.‎</p>

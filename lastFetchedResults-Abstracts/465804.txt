Objective:
We sought to determine the optimum estradiol valerate-medroxyprogesterone acetate regimens for efficacy and safety.
Study Design:
We performed a 24-month, randomized, double-blind phase II study. Four hundred nineteen women who were postmenopausal for at least 3 years were placed in six parallel treatment groups and received 1 or 2 mg estradiol valerate with either 2.5 or 5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate. In two groups the dose of estradiol valerate was increased from 1 to 2 mg estradiol valerate after 6 months.
Results:
A marked improvement of climacteric symptoms was observed, and most women had no bleeding even during the first 3 months of treatment. The best bleeding pattern was achieved with 1 mg estradiol valerate and 2.5 or 5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate, and in most groups the bleeding pattern improved over time. No cases of hyperplasia were observed.
Conclusions:
All regimens alleviated climacteric symptoms and provided excellent bleeding control, even during the early weeks of treatment. A choice of various dose combinations offers flexibility of dosing, thus enabling therapy to be tailored to the needs of individual women.

This paper proposes a novel Adaptive Charged System Search (ACSS) algorithm for the optimal tuning of Takagi–Sugeno proportional–integral fuzzy controllers (T–S PI-FCs). The five stages of this algorithm, namely the engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration and evaluation, involve the adaptation of the acceleration, velocity, and separation distance parameters to the iteration index, and the substitution of the worst charged particles’ fitness function values and positions with the best performing particle data. The ACSS algorithm solves the optimization problems aiming to minimize the objective functions expressed as the sum of absolute control error plus squared output sensitivity function, resulting in optimal fuzzy control systems with reduced parametric sensitivity. The ACSS-based tuning of T–S PI-FCs is applied to second-order servo systems with an integral component. The ACSS algorithm is validated by an experimental case study dealing with the optimal tuning of a T–S PI-FC for the position control of a nonlinear servo system.

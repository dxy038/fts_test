We study consensus networks in which each node updates its state by taking a weighted average of the states of its neighbors. Our objective is to determine the optimal set of weak links whose addition to the network maximally improves the efficiency of reaching consensus. Allocating a small amount of resources to the entire network with which new links can be created, we employ a perturbation method to cast this problem as a linear program. We demonstrate that the set of optimal weak links is sparse and, based on extensive numerical experiments, conjecture that they are also long-range. Examples are provided to illustrate the utility of our developments.

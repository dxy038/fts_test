Objective: The goal of this study was to investigate relationship of In-Arms holding a baby during breast feeding and growth rate in Kashan health centers.
Methods: This study was a descriptive correlational design. 94 mothers entered in study who reffered to Kashan health center. A questionnaire developed by the researcher was tool that was completed by interview. Data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistical tests (t-test, Pearson, chi-square test). 
Results: Mean maternal age was 27.980 (6.836±). The mean birth weight was 3272.5 (427.133±), mean of height 49.280(3.022±) and mean of head circumference was 34.928(2.371±). Time of infant In-Arms Holding by mother was between zero to five hours a day and average time was 4/55 (845/0 ±). Time of In-Arms Holding for other family members and relations was 1 to 5 hours and mean time of In-Arms Holding was 4/910 (223/1 ±). T-test showed that there aren't significant relationship between In-Arms Holding baby by the mother and friends and indices of growth in 2, 4 and 6 months(p > 0.05).
Conclusion: in this study relationship between skin to skin contacts of neonatal growth rate was irrelevant, but due to conflicting results on similar studies, interventional studies with the higher sample size are recommended.

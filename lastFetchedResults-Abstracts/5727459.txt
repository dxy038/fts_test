The Tehachapi Wind Energy Storage Project (TSP) is a research project with the objective of demonstrating the effectiveness of lithium-ion battery technology to improve grid performance and wind integration. Deployment of the demonstration will be at Southern California EdisonÂ´s Monolith substation located 100 miles north of Los Angeles using the Antelope-Bailey 66kV system, part of the Tehachapi Wind Resource Area. The TSP Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) consists of an 8 MW - 4 hour (32 MWh) lithium-ion battery and smart inverter system that is cutting-edge in scale and application. The BESS will be tested for a period of 24 months pursuant to 13 specific operational uses that include delivering ramp rate, voltage support/grid stabilization, frequency regulation, spin/non-spin replacement reserves, and charging/discharging to better integrate renewable energy. This paper presents a description of the 13 operational uses, the technical details of the BESS components, and the test plan to support the use cases.

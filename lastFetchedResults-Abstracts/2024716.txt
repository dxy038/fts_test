Abstract - In wireless sensor networks, the main objective
function is the energy consumption and the constraints are
the packet reliability and delay. To reach a maximum
efficiency, cross-layer interaction is a major design paradigm
to exploit the complex interaction among the layers of the
protocol stack. In this paper, the combination of novel
protocol Breath and HMAC are proposed for control
applications. The MAC layer emulates a full-duplex logical
communication channel in a multi-point network. This
channel may provide unicast, multicast or broadcast
communication service. Breath is designed for WSNs where
nodes attached to plants must transmit information via
multihop routing to a sink. HMAC ensures a desired packet
delivery and delay probabilities while minimizing the energy
consumption of the network. HMAC exhibits a good
distribution of the working load, thus ensuring a long lifetime
of the network. Therefore, Breath and HMAC are the good
candidate for efficient, reliable, and timely data gathering for
control applications.

In this paper, the chaos synchronization between two chaotic systems with linearly bidirectional coupling is studied. A generic criterion is proposed for choosing the appropriate coupling parameters to ensure global chaos synchronization. The criterion can also be applied to the global synchronization for coupled chaotic systems via unidirectional linear error feedback. The Lorenz and RÃ¶ssler systems are chosen to verify the effectiveness of the criterion.

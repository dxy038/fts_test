In this work, the problem of reconstruction of conductances in resistive grids is studied. It is assumed that access is available to boundary nodes only. The problem is stated as an optimization problem. An objective function is defined and its properties are discussed. The performance of several optimization methods for solving the reconstruction problem is evaluated for square and non-square resistive grid. The algorithms are compared in terms of numerical stability, accuracy of the results and the computation time. Possible applications of the proposed algorithms are discussed.

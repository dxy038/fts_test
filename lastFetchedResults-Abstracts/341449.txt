This study examined the effect of depression on neurocognitive performance in patients who passed symptom validity testing. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to assess depression in 420 patients with heterogeneous referral diagnoses (more than half of these cases were head injury or neurological disease). All patients had demonstrated satisfactory effort by passing two symptom validity tests. No differences were found on objective cognitive and psychomotor measures in groups sorted based on their self-reported depression. In contrast, on the self-report measures [i.e., Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2), Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), and Memory Complaints Inventory (MCI)], differences were found indicating that patients with depression report more emotional, somatic, and cognitive problems. Contrary to expectation, these data suggest that depression has no impact on objective neurocognitive functioning.

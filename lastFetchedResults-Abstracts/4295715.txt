The objective of pervasive computing is to provide anytime and everywhere, computing and communication services in particular, for mobiles that interact through ad hoc connections. This paper presents centralized and distributed service based clustering approaches wherein ad hoc or composite services are represented by clusters of nodes that establish relationships based on affinities. The relationships are adaptive according to the limitation of the mobile nodes battery power and to the dynamic network topology changes.

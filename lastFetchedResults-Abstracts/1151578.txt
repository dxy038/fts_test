This paper proceeds beyond the limits of conventional no-burn thought, presenting an optimum strategy permitting burn to appear in the rough grinding stage, but where the burning layer can be accumulated in the following finishing stage. On the basis of the basic grinding models, the objective function and constraint functions for the multi-parameter optimum grinding process have been built in this paper. The non-linear optimum grinding control parameters have been obtained through computer simulation, and the actual grinding process had been controlled by these parameters. The results of the experiments confirm the exactitude of the optimum models and the feasibility of the optimum strategy. This paper had created the pre-condition for grinding automation, virtual grinding and intelligent grinding systems.

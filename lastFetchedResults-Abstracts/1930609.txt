The objective of the present study was to validate a simple, sensitive and direct enzymeimmunoassay (EIA) procedure for 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2α (PGFM) for use in buffaloes with postpartum reproductive disorders and determine the practicalities of using plasma concentrations of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2α for monitoring their reproductive health. The EIA was used for determination of the circulating levels of PGFM associated with the retention of fetal membranes, postpartum endometritis and variable postpartum intervals. The concentrations of PGFM with retention of fetal membranes in the periparturient period were lower as compared to buffaloes that had uneventful parturitions. Concentrations of PGFM associated with postpartum endometritis were elevated as compared to those in buffaloes free of reproductive tract infections. Buffaloes having higher plasma concentrations of PGFM in early postpartum period had shorter postpartum intervals, indicating the association between PGFM concentrations postpartum and uterine involution as well as the resumption of estrous cycle in this species. The study presents the possibility of using circulating PGFM concentrations for monitoring the postpartum reproductive health of buffaloes.

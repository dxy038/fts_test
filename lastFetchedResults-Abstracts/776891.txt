In order for the solar absorption air conditioners to become a real alternative to the conventional vapour compression systems, their
performance has to be improved and their total cost has to be reduced. A solar powered absorption cycle is modeled using the Transient
System Simulation (TRNSYS) program and Typical Meteorological Year 2 data of Abu Dhabi. It uses evacuated tube collectors to drive
a 10 kWammonia–water absorption chiller. Firstly, the system performance and its total cost are optimized separately using single objective
optimization algorithms. The design variables considered are: the collector slope, the collector mass flow rate, the collector area and
the storage tank volume. The single objective optimization results show that MATLAB global optimization methods agree with the
TRNSYS optimizer. Secondly, MATLAB is used to solve a multi-objective optimization problem to improve the system’s performance
and cost, simultaneously. The optimum designs are presented using Pareto curve and show the potential improvements of the baseline
system.

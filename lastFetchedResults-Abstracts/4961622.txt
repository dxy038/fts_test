User-oriented image quality assessment has become a key factor in multimedia communications. However, existing image quality metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) are inappropriate for in-service quality monitoring, since they require the original image to be available at the receiver. Although PSNR and others are objective metrics, they are not based on human visual perception. In order to overcome these problems, we propose a novel reduced-reference objective hybrid image quality metric (HIQM) that accounts for human visual perception and does not require a reference image at the receiver. This approach is based on a combination of various image artifact measures. The result is a single number, which represents an overall image quality. Experimental results indicate that HIQM outperforms PSNR.

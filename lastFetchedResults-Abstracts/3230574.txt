The interline power flow controller (IPFC &amp; UPFC) is one of the latest generation flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) controller used to control power flows of multiple transmission lines. The main objective of this paper is detailed study about a new real and reactive power coordination controller for a interline power flow controller (IPFC &amp; UPFC). The basic control for the IPFC is such that the series converter of the UPFC controls the transmission line real/reactive power flow and the shunt converter of the (IPFC &amp; UPFC) controls the bus voltage/shunt reactive power and the DC link capacitor voltage. Because of the common link, any inverter within the (IPFC &amp; UPFC) is able to transfer real power to any other and thereby facilitate real power transfer among the lines of the transmission system. Since each inverter is able to provide reactive compensation, the (IPFC &amp; UPFC) is able to carry out an overall real and reactive power compensation of the total transmission system. This capability makes it possible to equalize both real and reactive power flow between the lines, transfer power from overloaded to under loaded lines, compensate against reactive voltage drops and corresponding reactive line power and to increase the effectiveness of the compensating system against dynamic disturbances. A simulation in MATLAB has been done in order to extend conventional algorithm based on this model.

n this paper, a constrained optimal control problem is considered where constraint is
elliptic partial differential equations of second order together with the boundary condition
of Dirichlet type. The main purpose is detecting an appropriate solution for control and
state function by using boundary element method in order to discretized PDEs. In this way,
first a quadratic objective, linear constraints optimization problem rewritten respected to
main problem, next it can be solved numerically with the help of appropriate solution
algorithms, which should exploit the structure of the problem, we solved it by generalized
Newtonâ€™s method. Some numerical experiments obtained by using boundary element
method (BEM) and finite element method (FEM) are given in the final section of this
paper.

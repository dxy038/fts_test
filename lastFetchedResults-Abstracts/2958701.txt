The paper adopts the F-P method and minimax method to research the contour of a multi-beam antenna. A new algorithm is developed by compensating for the drawback of the conventional solution to minimax: the unity of the worst stations and the searching mode of F-P method lowers the loss of computer source, and the modification of the objective function enhances the exactitude of minimax. Finally, the results presented compare it with the conventional solution

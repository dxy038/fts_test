A mathematical model is presented for the determination of human exposure to ambient air pollution in an urban area. The main objective was to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation of average exposure of the urban population to ambient air pollution in different microenvironments with reasonable accuracy, instead of analysing in detail personal exposures for specific individuals. We have utilised a previously developed modelling system for predicting the traffic flows and emissions, emissions originating from stationary sources, and atmospheric dispersion of pollution in an urban area. A model was developed for combining the predicted concentrations, information on people's activities (such as the time spent at home, in the workplace and at other places of activity during the day) and location of the population. Time-microenvironment activity data for the working-age population was obtained from the EXPOLIS study (air pollution distributions within adult urban populations in Europe). Information on the location of homes and workplaces was obtained from local municipalities. The concentrations of NO2 were modelled over the Helsinki Metropolitan Area for 1996 and 1997. The computed results were processed and visualised using the geographical information system (GIS) MapInfo. The utilisation of the modelling system has been illustrated by presenting numerical results for the Helsinki Metropolitan Area. The results show the spatial and temporal (diurnal) variation of the ambient air NO2 concentrations, the population density and the corresponding average exposure. The model developed has been designed to be utilised by municipal authorities in urban planning, e.g., for evaluating the impacts of traffic planning and land use scenarios.

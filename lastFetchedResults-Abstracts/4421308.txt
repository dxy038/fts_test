This study attempted to develop valid, reliable, and good fit model game design scales. The first draft of instrument with fifty items was subjected to statistical analyses. Exploratory factor analysis with factor loadings of at least 0.50 was utilized to determine the dimensions and the validity of constructs. Reliability of items was ensured through Cronbach´s alpha analysis. Items with alpha values of less than 0.70 were discarded. It was found out that Storyline, Aesthetics, Reward System, and Game Objective were the four dimensions of game design scales with Cronbach´s alpha values of 0.912, 0.899, 0.916, and 0.906, respectively. Series of confirmatory factor analyses revealed that four constructs with nineteen (19) items provided a good fit model (CFI = 0.984; AGFI = 0.908; RNISEA = 0.035) and discriminantly valid items (AVE(Storyline) = 0.73, AVE(Aesthetics) = 0.73, AVE(Reward System) = 0.78, AVE(Game Objective) = 0.79). The developed Game Design Factor Scales was able to capture at least 50% (%cumulative = 58<sup>%</sup>) of the design considerations in developing a game. Conclusions, recommendations, and future research were also presented.

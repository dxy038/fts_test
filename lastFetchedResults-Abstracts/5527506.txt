Power conservation is one of the most important issues in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, where nodes are likely to rely on limited battery power. In this paper we evaluate multi-hop based data transmission performance of a static CDMA wireless sensor network (WSN), where the positions of nodes are random. Data generated from the source node is received by the sink via multi hop, where an intermediate node in the route selects the nearest node within a sector angle, considered as search angle, towards the direction of the destination as the next hop. Optimization of transmitted data packet in present WSN is considered using the objective function, resource utilization, which has importance in case of delay sensitive WSN. From this frame work, the optimal packet sizes under various network parameters are estimated.

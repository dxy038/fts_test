The video adaptation has been developed with the objective of enabling the access by devices with limitant characteristics. One way to adapt the video is the transcoding technique, which can be applied in a large range of applications. However, it is known that the transcoding process has a high computational cost, which it is thought to be the main generator of delay. In this paper we present a transcoding evaluation in live video adaptation. As a result, the measures obtained can help researchers and developers to choose the best adaptation mechanism or system architecture for their specific applications

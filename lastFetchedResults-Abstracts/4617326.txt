In our proposed plan, we try to obtain an optimal power allocation scheme of cognitive radio along with singlehop relay node strategy. Regenerative relaying protocol is used in many previous references and same is true for our case also. Our main objective in this paper is to maximize the overall system capacity with respect to the channel interference coefficients in single-hop Cognitive Radio systems and in order to keep the interference under a predetermined threshold limit. Along with this, life-time of the network is also considered as a factor to improve the overall capacity of the network similarly as the concept of battery. On the basis of this, non-energy aware and energy aware schemes are taken into consideration. After evaluating with extensive simulations, the results show that energy aware approach tends to be more effective than the non-energy aware approach.

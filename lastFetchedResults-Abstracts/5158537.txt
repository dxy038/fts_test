Scheduling AND/OR precedence constraints jobs to produce a feasible schedule is a well studied problem in real time jobs scheduling field; many approaches and algorithms are presented to solve this problem. However, few of them use the project scheduling method applied in the real time jobs scheduling. In this paper, a new idea of scheduling the AND/OR precedence constraints by a network analysis method CPM is introduced. The minimum makespan of AND/OR precedence constraints jobs is the important performance objective. The AND/OR and CPM models are introduced and used to schedule the jobs with precedence constraints. Moreover, an ES algorithm is presented to solve the problem of scheduling AND/OR precedence constraints to minimize the makespan. The algorithm can compute the job s ES in polynomial time and its capacity is O (n<sub>a</sub>+n<sub>o</sub>log n<sub>o</sub>+ n<sub>a</sub>).

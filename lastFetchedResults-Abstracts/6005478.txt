This paper proposes a technique to estimate the dynamic equivalent generatorsÂ´ parameters. The application is formulated as a multi-objective problem, which is solved as an evolutionary algorithm. Two objective functions are used with the purpose of preserving those angular velocities (&#969;) and electrical powers (Pe) associated to generators at the internal region. In order to contribute to the solution, information stemming from Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) is assumed. These measurements are allocated in specific positions. Results are exhibited on an equivalent of the Mexican interconnected network.

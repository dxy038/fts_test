Introduction & Objective: The positive and negative effects of
perfectionism on human cognition, affection and behavior have
been emphasized. Perfectionism has been conceptualized as a
multidimensional construct, with both adaptive and maladaptive
aspects, which is one of the common personality traits that cause
lifelong stress in human and results in anxiety, depression and
physical and mental distress.The aim of this study was to assess
the positive and negative perfectionism in migrainus patients in
comparison with control group.
Materials & Methods: This is an analytical (Case-control) study
which was performed on 91 migraine patients and 88 healthy
individuals. The pqtients and controls completed a standard 40
item questionnaire for perfectionism - PANPS (20 for positive and
20 for negative perfectionism ). The patients In both groups were
matched for gender and age. Mean of positive and negative
perfectionism scores for two groups was statistically analysed
using SPSS software.
Results: Mean positive perfectionism score was 83.47±8.5 for
migraine group and 65.47±7.54 for control group (p=0.0001). The
difterence between two groups was significant Mean of negative
perfectionism score was 74.12±10.6 for migraine group and
51.79±7.8 for control group(p=0.0001).
Conclusion: The results show that migraine patients have higher
mean of perfectionism scores than healthy individuals. Based on
this study and other clinical experiences more attention to
psychotherapy is necessary for better management of migraine
and recognition of personality profile in migraine patient helps to
reduce patient's compiaints.

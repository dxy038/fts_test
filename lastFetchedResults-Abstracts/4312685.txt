In the on-line rescheduling on a single machine, a set of original jobs has already been scheduled to minimize some cost objective, when a new set of jobs arrives overtime. The decision maker needs to insert the new jobs into the existing schedule without excessively disrupting it. In this paper, we consider the on-line rescheduling problem to minimize makespan under a limit on the maximum disruption constraints and give an on-line algorithm of competitive ratio 3/2.

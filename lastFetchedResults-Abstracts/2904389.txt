Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are a type of distributed embedded systems that are composed of a large number of low cost, low powers, multifunctional mobile sensor nodes. These sensor nodes are small in size and communicate wirelessly in short distances. They are tiny sensor nodes that can perform sensing, data processing and communicating and are densely deployed in the desired environment. The main objective of target tracking is to utilize sensor nodes within the proximity of the target to localize and track it. Along with that, it is required to provide a complete picture of tracking information to the base station, so that some appropriate measures can be taken. In order to provide both better localization and tracking method for mobile wireless sensor network, the relay node selection method [11] is implemented. This distributed relay node selection process is triggered by the reception of a beacon message from the mobile element (ME). Then the particle-filtering based sequential Monte Carlo technique is applied for localization, a technique that has been successfully used to improve localization accuracy in an obstacle-free deployment area. After localization of all the sensors by using ME, target detection method [13] is implemented. Targets can be detected by measuring the energy of signals emitted by the target. Our proposed technique usually generates more accurate sensor localization and tracking information for mobile wireless sensor network.

The overall objective of the SADLI project was to implement a demonstration imaging system in diagnostic microscopy using functional programming under the discipline of a safety critical methodology in order to determine the benefits and the constraints that arise from so doing. For this implementation, we selected an application in cervical screening since it is clearly safety critical, software based and posed a wide range of technical problems which, if they could be solved, would demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques applied.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

The multiple database integration and update (MDBI&amp;U) effort began in October 1995 and is scheduled for completion in September 1998. The Air Force Research Laboratory (ARFL) Information Fusion and Engineering Branch (IFEA), in Rome, NY is the Government sponsor for this Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) effort. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) in Bethpage, NY is the prime contractor. MDBI&amp;U automatically maintains the timeliness and consistency of a geospatial baseline feature database using all available update source materials within Air Force channels: formatted text from the field and DIA´s Modernized Intelligent Data Base (MIDB); NIMA aeronautical products (i.e., ECHUM, DAFIF, etc.); and information extracted from digital imagery and terrain. Today´s digital geospatial data sources differ with respect to scale/resolution, accuracy, extent of coverage, content, attribution, format, and/or media. Our objective is to automatically reconcile and integrate these multiple disparate geospatial sources to produce a unified vector database (UVDB). This value-added geospatial foundation provides combat ready feature data to support predictive intelligence and proactive engagement activities by establishing and maintaining a common, consistent, and current representation of the battlespace

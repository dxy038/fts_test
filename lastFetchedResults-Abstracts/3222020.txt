DEAP (Dielectric Electro Active Polymer) actuator is essentially a capacitive load and can be applied in various actuation occasions. However, high voltage is needed to actuate it. In this paper, a high voltage bidirectional flyback converter with low input voltage is presented. The fundamental operating principle for both energy transfer process and energy recovery process is analyzed in detail. In order to verify the analysis, critical simulation results are provided. So far, a unidirectional flyback converter, which can realize the energy transfer process, has been implemented in the lab. The design parameters for flyback transformer and snubber circuits are illustrated. Moreover, the experimental waveforms are provided.

Khadjeh Nasir Tusi began a philosophical movement that ended with Mir Damad. They were influenced by the Ishraqi school, while benefited a lot from Peripatetic analyses. Regarding philosophical concepts, Khadjeh Nasir follows Shaykh Ishraq in considering them as merely subjective concepts, but some others, beginning from Qushji, regarded them as directed toward the objective world. Davani defined secondary intelligibles in a way that does not imply the non- objectivity of philosophical concepts. MTr Damad, on the other hand, realized that secondary intelligibles should be divided into logical and philosophical concepts. The first category is distinguished by its subjectivity in both qualification and occurrence, while the latter subjective only with regard to its occurrence.

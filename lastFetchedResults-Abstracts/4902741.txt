In this paper a speed governing system of synchronous/permanent magnet hybrid motor(SynPM) is studied, a vector control system based on the coordinate control of the armature current and the excitation current is proposed and a bidirectional excitation current regulator based on this SynPM is designed. The characteristics of the torque and speed governing between the low speed constant torque phase and the high speed constant power phase is analyzed. The result of the simulation shows that the speed governing system of SynPM has wide speed governing range, smooth speed governing property, and good stability, which also tested and verified the exactness of the speed governing system.

Objective: To observe the feasibility of virtual organ computer-aided analysis (VOCAL) technique in estimating the fetal lung volume, and to assess the diagnostic value of ultrasound fetal lung volume in fetal pulmonary hypoplasia (PH). Methods: A total of 31 fetuses (20-32 weeks) with abnomal diagnosed with prenatal ultrasonography were enrolled in this study. The autopsy and clnical diagnosis were permitted. The fetal lung volume was estimated with four-dimensional ultrasonography using VOCAL technique, the value of fetal lung volume in the diagnosis of fetal PH was evaluated. Results: The sensitivity value of fetal lung volume in diagnosing fetal PH was 81.1% and the accuracy ratio was 76.92%. Conclusion: The fetal lung volume can be estimated precisely with four-dimensional ultrasonography using VOCAL technique. Fetal lung volume may be useful in the prenatal diagnosis of fetal PH.

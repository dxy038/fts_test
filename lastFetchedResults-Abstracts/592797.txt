The rate of mother-to-infant hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission is rela-
tively low, however, this mode of infection is the most important route for childhood 
HCV involvement. The chances of transmission are increased by the level of maternal 
HCV viraemia and maternal human immunodefciency virus (HIV) co infection.
Objectives: The objective of the present study was to determine the presence of HCV in-
fection in orphan newborns of infected mothers.
Patients and Methods: A total of 29, two to seven month old, orphan infants were in-
cluded in the study. The tests performed consisted of the detection of; anti-HCV and anti-
HIV antibodies, HCV RNA in the plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells by real-
time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and fnally the detection of HCV core antigens 
(HCV core Ag).
Results: Anti-HCV antibodies were detectable in all of the infants. However HCV RNA was 
undetectable in both plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and there 
were also no anti-HIV 1/2 antibodies present in the infants.
Conclusions: Few studies have addressed the issue of mother-to-infant transmission of 
HCV among orphan newborns. According to the present study, carried out with orphan 
babies, the use of a HCV core Ag assay and evaluation of HCV RNA in PBMCs together with 
HCV RNA real-time PCR on the plasma, could beneft the prediction or exclusion of HCV 
transmission from mother to child.

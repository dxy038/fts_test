The objective of these studies was to identify a chemical indicator for predicting performance of enhanced pork during storage, then select raw materials with the potential for color and shelf life instability and enhance them with antimicrobial solutions in an attempt to overcome their initial deficits. The purpose of Study 1 was to evaluate the use of pH, glycolytic potential, and glucose levels in the drip to assess shelf life characteristics of modified atmosphere packaged (MAP), enhanced pork loin chops during display. Chops from higher pH carcasses had higher color scores and aerobic plate counts, and less discoloration. Study 2 evaluated shelf life characteristics of chops derived from high pH (&gt;5.75) raw materials enhanced with solutions containing salt and phosphate, and/or lactate and/or acetate. Overall, pH was the best indicator of color and microbiological stability. Raw materials with high ultimate pH were least stable. MAP chops derived from high pH raw materials and enhanced with a sodium acetate-containing solutions had better color and microbiological shelf life than those enhanced with other solutions.

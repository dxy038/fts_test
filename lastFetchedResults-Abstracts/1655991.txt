To have an effective performance in today’s economy, most organizations acknowledge that they need to turn into a KBO, however, many of them fail to find the right way to reach the objective. Using an eclectic (qualitative and quantitative) descriptive-survey approach, the present study aims to design a knowledge-based organization model for the National Media i.e. IRIB. In this developmental- applied research, 22 main KBO concepts were extracted from the related literature and shared with 40 scholars – university lecturers and IRIB’s experts – and finally, 22 concepts were finalized as the main components of a KBO. Based on 9 main concepts, then, a KBO specialized for IRIB was proposed. A questionnaire was also produced to test the hypotheses, and its validity and reliability were evaluated through Cronbach Alpha and confirmatory factor analysis. Finally, 13 research hypotheses were tested by structural equation model based on PLS methodology. The proposed model was validated by a sample of some 75 IRB senior managers and subsequently the conceptual model was ratified.

Emissions are generally believed to represent a part, if not most, of the uncertainty in input data for air quality models. The quality of emission data, however, is largely unknown. There are indicators that the actual and modeled emissions may differ by more than a factor of two. In order to evaluate the uncertainty of calculated emissions of individual ozone precursors, a joint research project evaluation of highly resolved emission inventories (EVA) was designed and executed. The main objective of EVA was to determine the total emissions of ozone precursors of a city (Augsburg) experimentally and to compare the obtained results with calculated emissions using state-of-the-art models. This paper presents an overview of the project design and activities.

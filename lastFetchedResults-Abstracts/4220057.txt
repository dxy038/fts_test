Detecting dangerous locations/sites is becoming an important objective necessary for many human life assisting services. To access human living surroundings, it requires many computation costs since our living space includes many kinds of elements (e.g. factors, subjects, targets and more that locate in our living space). The concept of space-oriented metadata is an effective data modeling approach to reduce the complexity of structural access management. As XML becomes a key format both for data representation and transactions, the data used in our research is taken from the real world, where the content is a mix of location and dangerous event information. We add some features into the space information in order to deal with, and take advantage of, various user properties, such as metadata. This technique enables us, for instance, to offer efficient location aware services. This paper focused on space-oriented metadata, management methods and introduces a new architecture to include these major context processing parts into the Ubickids project prototype application

The main objective of this work is to find an approximate Malliavin weight in order to calculate the delta of European style options where the underlying asset is modelled by a Variance Gamma process. We use a Malliavin integration by parts formula for a compound Poisson process. In order to apply this formula, a compound Poisson approximation of the Variance Gamma process is used. We calculate deltas using Monte Carlo simulations. An acceptanceâ€“rejection algorithm is used to generate random numbers for the approximated VG process.

Introduction: Contraception is a major component of preventive health care for women. Several methods are used for familly planning but tubal ligation (TL) is different from other contraceptives because often it isn't
reversible.Recently,due to decrease in acceptability of TL in women,there are questions on saftey of this method.
Objective: The purpose of this stuy was to investigate attitudes and knowledge about tubal ligation and possibility of Post Tubal Ligation Syndrome in women residing in Rasht.
Materials and Methods: Li this study, 403 women were collected with stratified randomized sampling.
The data collection instrument consisted of a three-part questionnaire which included: (1) the demographics (2) knowledge level and (3) questions concerning the attitude. We applied the SPSS.9 statistical analysis software and Chi-square tests, pearsonian coefficient. P<0.05 was determined as statistical significance. Results: The research showed that 45/9% of women have poor knowledge and 21% have negative attitudes about tubectomy. There were significant correlations between the number of children, education level, and information source with level of knowledge (P<0.05). Also, there were significant correlations between variations like education level, information source and contraception methods with level of attitude (P<0.05). Our results showed that 82/1%,41/5% and 21/8"/, of women believed that Pelvic and Lumbar pain, Menstrual disorders and Ovarian cyst might occur after tubal ligation respectively.
Conclusion: Our research showed that many of women due to fear of tubal ligation complications (Post Tubal Ligation Syndrome) bad a negative attitude. It seems that increasing the knowledge of women and more comprehensive studies are necessary for Post- Tubal Ligation syndrome about which there is no consensus yet.

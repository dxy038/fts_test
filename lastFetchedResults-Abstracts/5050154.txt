Registration is an important problem and a fundamental task in image processing technique. In the medical image processing fields, some registration techniques are proposed to find a geometrical transformation that relates the points of an image to their corresponding points of another image. Especially, CT and MR imaging of the head for diagnosis and surgical planning indicates that physicians and surgeons gain important information from these modalities. In radiotherapy planning manual registration techniques performed on MR image and CT images of the brain. Generally, physicians segment the volumes of interest (VOIs) from each set of slices manually. However, manual segmentation of the object area may require several hours for analysis. Furthermore, MDCT images and MR images contain more than 100 slice images. Therefore, manual segmentation and registration method cannot apply to clinical application in the head CT and MR images. To overcome these problems, many automatic and semiautomatic image registration methods have been introduced. The main techniques of image registration are performed by the manual operation, using landmark and using voxel information. In this paper, we develop a new method for automatic registration of head images by computer which obtained CT and MR images employing wavelet transformation and maximization of mutual information. The primary objective of this study is to increase accuracy of the registration and reduce the computational processing times.

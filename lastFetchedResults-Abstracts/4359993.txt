The Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) is to co-ordinate all the road-network data and then present these data effectively to decision-makers. This is one of the ITMS objectives. In order to achieve the objective, several issues have to be considered seriously during the design phase. Some of these issues are integration capability, graphical user interface (GUI) and software reusability. Poor integration planning will create problems in data sharing and signal co-ordination. At the same time, poor user interface design will result in inefficient operation and maintenance. In the ITMS project, the process of transferring an innovation from the research and development stage to the market place involves a wide variety of factors. But, surveys have found that the main `push´ comes from the market competition, pure `technology pull´ innovation being very rare. The authors consider how to make the product or service competitive? The answer is to make it what people need and usable for them. One way of doing this is to adopt a user-centred design approach in the early stages of research and development

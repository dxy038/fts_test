The objective of this paper was a screening of polyphnol and flavonoid by spectrophotometer. The type of some polyphenols in Stachys inflata was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The methanol extract of plant material was used for HPLC analysis. The HPLC system was coupled with colorimetric detection of antioxidant activity. Additionally, the antioxidant activities were determined by ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. The flavonoid and total phenolic contents of methanolic extract was higher than aqueous extract of Stachys inflata. A strong positive correlation of R2 = 0.90 between total phenolic content and antioxidant activity was observed in this investigation. This study indicated that Stachys inflata exhibite high antioxidant activity, flavonoid and phenolic content and can be used potentially as a readily accessible source of natural antioxidant. Antioxidant activities of polyphenols have been suggested to exert beneficial pharmacological effects on some diseases.

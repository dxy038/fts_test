Tuberculosis is one of the most important heath priorities in the world. One third of the world population is affected by this microbe. However, there is no comprehensive and updated information about the indices of the patients affected by pulmonary tuberculosis in urban centers including Tehran, capital of Iran. The data collected from the records of West Tehran Health Center during 2004 to 2008 about the patients with tuberculosis and positive Smear Test (urban regions 2, 5,6,9,18,21 and 22) were analyzed. The average of 5-year incidence of the disease in the under-study community was 2.6 per 100,000 of the covered population from which 1.5 and 1.1 per 100,000 were associated with males and females respectively. The maximum rate of having pulmonary tuberculosis is seen among the age groups over 60 (42.8%) and 16-30 (27.4%). In general, the findings of the present study accompanied with the results gained from similar studies can be helpful for monitoring the results of treating patients for facilitating levels.

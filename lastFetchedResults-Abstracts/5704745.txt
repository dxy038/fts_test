The Centrifugal Delayed Resonator (CDR) is a novel active vibration absorption technology for eliminating undesired torsional oscillations in rotating mechanical structures. The key idea is to reconfigure the dynamics of a damped centrifugal pendulum arrangement so that it mimics an ideal real time tunable absorber. This objective is achieved by applying a control torque based on proportional position feedback with variable gain and time delay. Theoretical fundamentals of the technology are explained, its implementation on a multi-degree of freedom primary structure is presented, and stability of the controlled system is discussed.

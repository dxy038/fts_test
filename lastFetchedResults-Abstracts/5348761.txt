This paper deals with a methodology for presizing the induction motor propulsion of an Electric Vehicle (EV). Based on the EV desired performances, the induction motor optimal power can be calculated. The final objective is to find its minimum weight, volume, and cost that meet the design constraints with minimum power under the European urban (ECE-15) and sub-urban (EUDC) driving cycles. The power presizing methodology is validated through extensive simulations for different induction motor-based EVs using a siding mode control technique.

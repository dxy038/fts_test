This paper studies the performance of a Poisson Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET), owned by an Operator, in the presence of a Jammer. The objective of the Jammer is to degrade the spatial performance of the MANET by causing interference, whereas the OperatorÂ´s objective is to set a Medium Access Probability (MAP) to optimize it. The interaction between the Jammer and the Operator is modeled taking into account the transmission energy costs. This interaction is then transformed into a zero sum game by constructing an anti-potential. First, we assume that the receiver of a node is at a fixed distance. The Nash equilibria is characterized by considering two spatial performance metrics: the number of successful transmissions per unit area which the Operator aims to maximize, and the average delay per unit area which the Operator aims to minimize. We then consider the case where distance between a transmitter and its receiver is not fixed. The Nash equilibria of the resulting game is again characterized.

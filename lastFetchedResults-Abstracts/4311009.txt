This paper proposes a novel algorithm for optimal planning of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging facilities. The proposed algorithm takes into consideration the stochastic nature of PEV mobility in terms of arrivals to and departures from the charging facility. The objective of the planning algorithm is to jointly determine the optimal number of deployed electric chargers and waiting space size in the charging facility so as to maximize the operatorÂ´s expected profit. The expected profit accounts for the charging service price and the electricity cost, and penalizes a long waiting queue of PEVs and rejected PEV charging requests. The planning approach exploits the M/M/C/S queue structural properties and follows a simple search algorithm to reach the optimal solution. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the planning algorithm.

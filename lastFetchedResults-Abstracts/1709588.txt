BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Neonatal sepsis is a major cause of death in neonates in developing countries. In empiric treatment, antibiotic therapy is usually started before pathogen identification. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and antibiotic resistance of common bacteria in late onset sepsis at the neonatal ward in Booali-Sina hospital of Sari, Iran.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional and descriptive study, a total of 100 neonates with clinical diagnosis of late onset septicemia were admitted. Two blood samples were taken before antibiotic therapy and transferred to the bacterial medium. After 72 hour incubation, the samples were analyzed to determine bacteria isolates and antibiotic susceptibility test was performed by disk diffusion technique.
FINDINGS: Among 100 neonates with suspected to late onset sepsis, 20 neonates had positive blood culture. Staphylococcus aureus (35%), klebseilla pneumonia (20%) and Escherichia coli (20%) were the major etiological agents. The percentage of the antibiotic resistance of the gram negative bacteria to ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone were 72.7%, 54.5%, 54.5% and 60%, respectively. The gram positive bacteria (100%) were resistant to oxacillin, and 77.7% were resistant to cefalotin and clindamycin. Vancomycin and imipenem were considered as the most potent antibiotic against gram positive and negative bacteria (sensitivity 100%). 
CONCLUSION: Gram negative bacteria developing resistance to cephalosporins was observed in this study. In conclusions, the empiric use of this drug should be associated with more attention.

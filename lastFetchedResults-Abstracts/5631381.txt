Improving system effectiveness through standardization of data transfer operations required to support avionics systems is an objective of the San Antonio Air Logistics Center (SA-ALC). The Digital Computer System (DCS) was developed in response to this objective. This automated support system standardizes the loading, unloading, and verification of operational flight information transferred to and from avionic systems. The SA-ALC has estimated that this should save the US Air Force a minimum of two million dollars in the first year of deployment as the replacement of multiple outdated data transfer systems

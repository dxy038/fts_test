In the frame of EXOMARS 2016 Mission, TEMIS and Centro Interdipartimentale di Studi e Attivita&#768; Spaziali G. Colombo (CISAS) have developed a very modular sub-system, named Central Electronic Unit (CEU), that has the main objective of handle, acquire and transmit medium and low rate data, coming from sensors devoted to investigate the Martian atmosphere. Thanks to the high modularity of the architecture, CEU is very easy to customize in order to be used in different missions as data handling platform to interface with several types of equipments or intrumentations.

An ideal healthcare delivery system would be centered on patients´ specific needs. These needs are diverse and merit a thorough analysis. In our pilot study, we examined these needs using qualitative interviews. We learned that empowering a patient requires a multi-faceted approach. There needs to be a balance of personalized delivery of health information and shared decision making with providers. Further, a learning element needs to be factored in such that knowledge generated from patients´ experiences can be shared across groups. This learned knowledge will be the key to empowering patients in the Learning Health System. Objective: Early findings describing the conceptual design of a Learning Health System that empowers patients. Method: Nine contextual inquiry interviews were conducted with patients. Using an affinity wall exercise, qualitative thematic analysis of the nine interviews was carried out by a group of researchers.

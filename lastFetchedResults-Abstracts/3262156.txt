In this paper, a fuzzy multi-objective mathematical programming problem is considered where functional relationship between the decision variables and the objective functions is not completely known to us. It is assumed that the information source from where some knowledge may be obtained about objective functions consists of a block of fuzzy if-then rules. The focus in this work is to solve the multi-objective optimization problem for the above situations. A numerical example is also presented to illustrate the method.

High-power-density bidirectional dc-dc converters consisting of buck-and-boost converters are widely used in hybrid electric vehicles due to their smaller size and low cost. With a conventional constant-value inductor, the light-load efficiency of these converters is greatly reduced because of the large constant peak-to-peak current swing and relatively constant conduction losses that result in the entire load range. This paper proposes a new type of nonlinear inductor using magnetorheological (MR) fluid to improve the intermediate- and light-load efficiencies of these converters. The use of the proposed inductor does not require any additional circuit or complex control, and yet, it has benefits of decreasing conduction losses and improving efficiency due to its increasing inductance when the load is changed from heavy to light. A 3.7-kW prototype converter is built, and the efficiency from heavy to light load is measured separately using the proposed MR fluid-gap inductor and conventional air-gap inductor, which validates the advantages of the proposed MR fluid-gap inductor.

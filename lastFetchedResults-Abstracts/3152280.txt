Image quality assessment is a challenging task that is traditionally approached by computational models. To maintain, control, and enhance the quality of images, it is important for image acquisition, management, communication, and processing systems to be able to identify and quantify image quality degradations. A great deal of effort has been made in recent years to develop objective image quality metrics that correlate with perceived quality measurement. To find the right solution to this problem we need measures to estimate quality and amounts of degradation compared with original image to determinate optimal quality of the coded picture. This paper provides comparison of subjective and objective picture quality for three different distortions, each made with four different levels of distortion.

Burn wound depth is difficult to determine. Even for experienced investigators the exact differentiation between superficial and deep dermal burns is not always possible. Therefore, methods for objective and reproducible measurements estimating the depth of burn wounds are of great clinical interest. One technique that appears to be able to differentiate between superficial and deep dermal burn wounds is ICG video-angiography. Since burn wounds are often covered with dressings and ointments or soiled with blood, it is necessary to evaluate the influence of these substances on ICG video-angiography and its performance as a measurement method. The most commonly used ointments and dressings were tested. All studied substances had a massive influence on ICG video-angiography and its measurements. They caused decreases by absorption of up to 63Â±36% and thereby falsely reported deeper burn wounds. The results of this study, suggest that in clinical practice, all dressings, ointments and blood should be completely removed at least 10 min prior to measurement by ICG video-angiography to gain exact and reproducible results.

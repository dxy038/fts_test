Objective We hypothesised that, in a non-
Western setting where literacy was not universal, a visual
measure (the FACES test) would be more valid than
a traditional psychiatric questionnaire [the General
Health Questionnaire (GHQ)] as a screening test for
mood disorders.Methods The study was nested within a
randomised controlled trial of 450 patients with a common
mental disorder (CMD). Subjects were evaluated at
2, 6 and 12 months after enrolment with the Clinical Interview
Standardised-Revised (CISR) (the gold standard),
the GHQ5 (the shortened version of the GHQ-12)
and the FACES test. Results Correlation coefficients and
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves show
superiority of the GHQ5 in the detection of CMD based
on the CISR, compared with the visual FACES test. Lesseducated
subjects had particular difficulty completing
the FACES. The kappa coefficient of agreement between
the two instruments, using the cut-off point for the
GHQ5 estimated by the ROC curves, was between 0.70
and 0.75. Conclusions Contrary to our hypothesis, the
questionnaire-based measure was significantly superior
to a visual measure of mood,especially for less-educated
subjects. A short five-item version of the GHQ has a
good discriminatory ability for CMD and may be used
as a brief alternative to standardised interviews in clinical
and survey settings.

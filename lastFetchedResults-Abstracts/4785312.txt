Design and performance measures of a printed multistrip monopole antenna for ultra-wideband application are presented. The proposed antenna consists of six quarter wavelength strips of different resonant frequency combined in a manner to provide wide bandwidth and omnidirectional pattern. It operates in the frequency range 2.22~15.8 GHz with impedance bandwidth (VSWR &lt;; 2) of 6 GHz and maximum gain of 6.02 dBi. The radiation pattern is nearly omnidirectional in the Azimuthal plane and bidirectional in the elevation plane and the consistency of the radiation pattern exists for almost all frequency in the operating band.

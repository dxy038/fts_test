In recent decades, moving towards extensive applications of renewable energy sources instead of traditional fossil ones, distributed generations or DGs have become proper choices to employ in power grids. Although application of these types of supplies have lots of advantages, such as improving the voltage stability, enhancement of the voltage profiles, mitigation of power losses and improvement of grids reliability, however, improper location and size of these units can raise problems in the operation of power systems. Consequently, appropriate selection and location of DG units are of great importance. This paper proposes a novel technique using multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) tool for determining DGs sizes and locations to be used by distribution company (DisCo). In this study, the necessary operational and economic objective functions are developed. Then in order to select the best compromised answer from the Pareto optimal set of solutions obtained from the related simulations, a fuzzy decision making method is employed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated on the IEEE 33-bus distribution test system.

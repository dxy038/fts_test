The synthesis of optimization of combined cooling heating and power systems implies searching for a design and operation methodology that minimizes or maximizes an objective function, such as economic cost, environmental load or thermodynamic efficiency. The search process is bounded by the system´s model, which is expressed by a set of constraints. The design/operation methodology must deliver systems that can provide energy services efficiently and be capable of adapting to different economic markets or demand conditions. The optimum operation totally depends on the systems´ performance and the relative demand of each commodity (heating, cooling, etc.), which are mutually exclusive, and the different demands cannot be produced independent of each other. The aim of this work is to report the main contributions that have been carried out in order to attain optimum energy integration to minimize the environmental impact while increasing the economical benefits and the thermodynamic performance of combined cooling heating and power plants.

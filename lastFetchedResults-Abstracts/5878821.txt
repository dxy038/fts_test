This paper research on the topologies of main circuit of low-voltage high-performance power inverters. Two new topologies of multilevel inverter are proposed. Inverters with the proposal topologies share the advantages of simplicity of circuit and control method, fewer controllable semiconductor devices involved, high quality of output waveforms, high efficiency and so on. Simulations using PSIM 4.0 of the proposed adding-bidirectional-switch multilevel inverter based on multi-carrier SPWM method are carried out which proved the validity and practicability of the proposed topology.

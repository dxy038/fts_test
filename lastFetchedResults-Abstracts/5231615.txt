The objective of this paper is to develop a Mobile Robot Navigation and Localization Based on Floor Plan Map Information and Sensory Fusion approach. We have developed map recognition algorithm for recognizing the floor plan and high level multi-sensor topological navigation system utilizing the information to perform navigation tasks. In our algorithm, robot can recognize the floor plan to get enough information automatically like human. First, it recognizes the floor plan map, generates the path to destination and extracts two kinds of landmarks location from floor plan map. One is room plate landmark and the other is passage corner landmark. Second, these landmarks can be detected by camera and ultrasonic sensor in experimental environment. Robot can then navigate to the destination by following these landmarks and generated path. The main contributions of this paper are: 1).floor plan can be reconstructed quickly. 2). It is easier to describe the destination for user.

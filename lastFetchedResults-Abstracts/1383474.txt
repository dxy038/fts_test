The development of an innovative approach for optimum vibration suppression of flexible structures is presented. Utilizing concurrent use of semi-active and active subsections, an intelligent semi-automated alternative is suggested. By altering the adjustable structural properties (in semi-active unit) and control parameters (in active unit), a search is conducted to minimize an objective function subject to constraints, which may reflect performance characteristics. In practice, a user-in-the-loop interprets the resulting performance. A number of options may then be initiated: altering the parameters of the semi-active unit, or re-tuning the control parameters in the active unit, or concurrently adjusting the two. An essential component of this strategy is handling the parametric variations within the system. In order to increase the absorber efficiency against such variations an identification process is utilized in sequence with an optimization for re-tuning the absorber. The feasibility of the re-tuning procedure and performance improvement is demonstrated via simulations for a single-degree-of-freedom (s.d.o.f.) system. It is shown that concurrent adjustment of structural properties and control re-tuning significantly improves the vibration suppression quality.

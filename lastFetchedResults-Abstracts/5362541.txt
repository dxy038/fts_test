Space-time adaptive processing (STAP) is used in radar to adaptively suppress both ground clutter returns and radio frequency interference (RFI). However, RFI suppression utilizes degrees-of-freedom that would otherwise be applied to clutter suppression. This paper considers designing the transmit pulse so that fast-time correlated (i.e., colored) RFI is suppressed in the pulse-compression stage preceding the STAP processor. The objective function and constraints for the waveform optimization are derived, and a numerical example demonstrating the efficacy of the approach is provided.

The realization of complex microsound circuits would be greatly facilitated if one were able, efficiently to reflect the surface waves. For example, such reflectors are required for making a "short-circuited" stub, or for a low mode-order resonator. It is known that the interdigital transducer can reflect a surface wave, with rather low losses; however, this approach involves the use of an external inductive tuning circuit, which must be attached to the transducer in order to resonate its self-capacitance. It is therefore a method which cannot be used in those situations where the primary objective is the achievement of very large component densities.

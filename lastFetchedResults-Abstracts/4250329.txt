The objective of the paper is to present active and reactive power control schemes for inverter based distributed energy generators connected to low voltage electric power networks. Inverter power flow control strategies for both grid-connected and standalone modes are presented. The inverter uses a Phased Locked Loop (PLL) signal to synchronize with the grid voltage in islanded mode and to control the DG active and reactive power outputs after synchronization. The control schemes are developed using MATLABSimulink and Simpowersystem toolbox. The simulated model has been tested for various case scenarios. The results confirm the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods.

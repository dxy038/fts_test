Objective: In light of a recent proposal to legislate group B streptococcal prevention strategies in New Jersey, this study examined obstetrician preferences and practices toward group B streptococcal prevention strategies in neonates. Study Design: This was a mail survey of American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Fellows in New Jersey. Physician characteristics, existing guideline preferences, and reported actual group B streptococcal prevention practices were measured. Results: Of the 695 potential respondents, 306 responses (44.7%) were received for analysis. Respondent stated preferences were for guidelines from the Centers for Disease and Prevention (74.5%), American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (12.7%), American Academy of Pediatrics (9.2%), and others (3.6%). The proportions of obstetricians who actually adhere to their stated preference were 57.5%, 64.1%, and 39.3% in Centers for Disease and Prevention, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and American Academy of Pediatrics group, respectively. Only 40.7% of the obstetricians cultured the anorectal/vaginal area for group B streptococcal carriers. An overwhelming 86.7% of obstetricians do not support legislation that regulates neonatal group B streptococcal preventing practices. Conclusions: Obstetrician preferences for use of existing group B streptococcal guidelines are often not reflected by their actual stated practices. However, obstetricians do not support legislative regulation of group B streptococcal prevention practices. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;187:709-14.)

This paper describes joint work between Probots, Inc., and the Samara Division of the Mechanical Engineering Research Institute, Russian Academy of Science (SD MERI). The objective of this project is to develop techniques for modeling complex, dynamic systems that include the modeling of hybrid systems combining logical models and continuous time models. The techniques we have developed are based on automatically constructing both continuous and discrete models of dynamic systems from their description in the form of mathematical relations (algebraic, differential, logical, matrix, and heuristic) and on automating the process of specifying control functions for intelligent agents by embedding learning functions in dynamic objects

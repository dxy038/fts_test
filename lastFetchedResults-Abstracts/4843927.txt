Non-trivial real world decision-making processes usually involve multiple parties having potentially conflicting interests over a set of issues. State-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) are well known to solve this class of complex real-world problems. In this paper, we compare the performance of state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to solve a non-linear multi-objective multi-issue optimization problem found in Greenhouse climate control [1]. The chosen algorithms in the study includes NSGAII, e-NSGAII, 6-MOEA, PAES, PESAII and SPEAII. The performance of all aforementioned algorithms is assessed and compared using performance indicators to evaluate proximity, diversity and consistency. Our insights to this comparative study enhanced our understanding of MOEAs performance in order to solve a non-linear complex climate control problem. The empirical findings of this comparative study show that based on the performance indicators, three algorithms, e-MOEA, e-NSGAII and NSGAII outperform the other algorithms and provide high quality solution sets in an appropriate time.

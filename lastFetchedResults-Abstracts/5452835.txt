The ion sources are the first step in particle accelerators, which are important instruments in todayÂ´s scientific advance, with multiple applications. The design and construction of those machines involves complex technical challenges. One of the keys in the correct operation of an Ion Source is the control system. In this work, an event-based control of the temperature in the transport line and cesium boilers is presented, necessary elements in a Penning-type ion source. The main objective of the controller is to maintain a constant temperature in the transport line and the boiler, providing an adequate concentration of cesium in the plasma chamber. The event-based nature of the controller reduces the control rate and, hence, the activity of the actuators. Therefore, the lifetime of the devices is increased, improving system reliability.

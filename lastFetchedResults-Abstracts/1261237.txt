Introduction Despite the relatively high prevalence of the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affecting up to 15% of all women of reproductive age, only little is known about vocal changes related to this endocrinologic disorder that is characterized by biochemical or clinical hyperandrogenism, impaired cycles, and/or polycystic ovaries. The aim of our study was to describe objective and subjective vocal changes in women with a diagnosed PCOS compared with a control group. Materials and Methods Our study group comprised 34 womenâ€”24 cases with confirmed PCOS and 10 controls in whom PCOS was excluded. A complete endocrinologic laboratory status was obtained by all participants; study procedures included a videolaryngostroboscopy, voice recording, and completion of the German version of the Voice Handicap Index. Results A trend toward lower mean fundamental frequency was detectable, but this failed statistical significance. No differences were found in the objective and subjective voice parameters. Conclusion Elevated serum levels of androgens, as found in women with PCOS, were shown not to have an impact on the subjective and objective voice parameters.

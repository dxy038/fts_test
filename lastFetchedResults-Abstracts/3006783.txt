The objective of this paper is to determine the potentialities of an optimal detection scheme within the framework of subscriber location. The use of a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) for detecting the first arriving path from the estimated channel observations in a multipath environment in severe NLOS conditions is described, and a high-resolution estimation algorithm for the time of arrival (TOA) is presented. Finally, the scheme performance is evaluated for different configurations.

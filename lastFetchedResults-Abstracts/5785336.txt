This paper discusses the design and performance of an 8-bit asynchronous multiplier. Self-timed adders with carry completion signals were implemented to create the asynchronous function of the multiplier. The technique of using bi-directional adders is incorporated in the design. One objective of this design was to estimate the longest multiplication time for a 2 &#956;m CMOS implementation of this 8-bit multiplier

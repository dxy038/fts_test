Partial response signaling (PRS) codes with maximal minimum Euclidean distance have previously been found by linear programming. These perform very well in the narrowband-high energy region, but they were not optimized for minimal bit error rate (BER), so they are only optimal in the limit of infinite signal to noise ratio. Here we search for codes that perform better for more practical signal to noise ratios. The BER objective function is no longer linear, but it is still convex

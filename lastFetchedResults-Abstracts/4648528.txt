The objective of image fusion is to combine information from multiple images of the same scene in order to deliver only the useful information. The discrete cosine transform (DCT) based methods of image fusion are more suitable and time-saving in real-time systems using DCT based standards of still image or video. In this paper an efficient approach for fusion of multi-focus images based on variance calculated in DCT domain is presented. The experimental results on several images show the efficiency improvement of our method both in quality and complexity reduction in comparison with several recent proposed techniques.

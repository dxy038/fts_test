When determining the technology for mould cavities, people from technology departments very often rely only on their experience, which may not lead to the optimal solutions. This paper presents the determination model, which can be used for deciding between two main manufacturing technologies in mould manufacturing, i.e. EDM and HSC. The model is based on the determination of a logical function, as the result of objective input of geometricâ€“technological data on the final product.

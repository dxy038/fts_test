A module generator for CMOS buffers have been written in C. The generator optimizes buffer design with respect to a user specified objective function both in terms of performance and layout. Speed, area, power consumption, power-delay, AT and AT<sup>2</sup> are selectively optimized before the layout is produced. Such layout is generated in various configurations depending on load size. Technology file is easily updatable.

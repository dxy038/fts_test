The scheduling problem in downlink of the cooperative multi-cell system is investigated in this paper. Multi-cell cooperative processing (MCP) has the potential to boost spectral efficiency and improve fairness. However, the traditional centralized multi-cell cooperative scheme, where a central processing unit is assumed with the global knowledge of all the required downlink channels and user messages to jointly design the transmitted signals for all BSs, incurs significant overhead and complexity, and will hinder the practical implementation of MCP. We adopt the decentralized cooperative scheme with adaptive linear pre-processing transmission. The objective of the scheduling is to maximize the total system throughput. The performance of proposed scheme in terms of the average throughput per cell and average user date rate. The multiuser diversity gain is also investigate throughput simulation. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve better tradeoff between system throughput and fairness among users that the traditional non-cooperative scheme.

In this paper an overview of the behavior of an induction motor when it is supplied from a voltage controlled current regulated inverter is presented. The objective is to show that in this condition, the motor behaves very closely to when it is supplied from the mains. In addition, it is emphasized that unlike the other types of inverters-voltage source or current source, PWM inverters-voltage and current waveforms at motor terminals are nearly sinusoidal and the harmonic content of voltage and current is very low. In this paper, only one type of current regulator is discussed (free running hysteresis current regulator) but other types of regulator such as fixed frequency hysteresis regulator could be used in the system. The simulation result depicts the start-up and loading characteristic of the motor. These results could be compared to those of an induction motor fed from mains supply.

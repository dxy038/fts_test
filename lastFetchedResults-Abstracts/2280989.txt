The objective was to compare the effectiveness of combining Lactobacillus buchneri 40788 with three lactic acid bacteria on the fermentation, aerobic stability and nutritive value of corn silage. Freshly chopped whole plant corn was untreated or treated with L. buchneri 40788 paired with Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus acidilactici, or Pediococcus pentosaceus. L. buchneri was added to achieve 4 × 105 CFU/g of fresh forage and the homolactic acid bacteria were added to achieve 1 × 105 CFU/g. Forages were ensiled in laboratory silos for 215 days before opening. Overall, inoculation increased the concentrations of acetic acid and 1,2-propanediol, but it reduced the concentrations of lactic acid, water soluble carbohydrates and ethanol. Effects on acetic acid and 1,2-propanediol were biggest for L. buchneri 40788 paired with P. pentosaceus &gt; P. acidilactici &gt; L. plantarum. Combining L. buchneri 40788 with L. plantarum or P. acidilactici increased and tended to increase in vitro aNDF digestibility in silage when compared to untreated silage, respectively. Untreated silage had a relatively large proportion of visibly spoiled silage at the surface of the silos, which resulted in poorer recovery of feedable dry matter when compared to silage treated with the combinations of L. buchneri 40788 with L. plantarum or with P. acidilactici. All inoculated silages had fewer numbers of yeasts after ensiling which improved their aerobic stability relative to untreated silage. Addition of L. buchneri 40788 to corn silage improves its aerobic stability and combining it with the P. acidilactici and L. plantarum strains used in this study results in other beneficial effects on silage quality.

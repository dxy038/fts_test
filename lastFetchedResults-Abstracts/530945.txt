Background: Successful pregnancy in allopregnant women depends upon the control of graft rejection mechanisms. It has been suggested that some immunosuppressive cytokines contribute to successful pregnancy and transplantation. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) exhibits potent immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory properties which might prolong graft survival. Recent studies suggest a role for TGF- β in the generation of T-regulatory lymphocytes which preserves the tolerance to peripheral self antigens and may control the response to allogenic tissues and thereby promote the transplantation tolerance. Also, the function of TGF-β in trophoblast differentiation and hypertension is reported. Objective: To evaluate the maternal serum TGF-β1 level in normal allopregnant women and in pregnancies complicated by preeclampcia (PE). Methods: Sixty one pregnant preeclamptic women (32 cases with severe and 29 with mild PE), 22 normotensive healthy pregnant, and 20 non-pregnant controls constituted the studied groups. The active form of TGF-β1 in serum from all cases was investigated by indirect ELISA technique. Results: The results showed that TGF-β1 level was higher in all three pregnant groups as compared with the nonpregnant controls. No significant changes in serum levels of TGF-β1 were found in PE as compared with the normal pregnancy. Conclusion: TGF-β1 may function as a regulatory factor in fetal allograft survival during pregnancy, and TGF-β1 does not have a pathophysiological role in PE

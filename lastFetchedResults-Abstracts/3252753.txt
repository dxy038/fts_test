DVB-S/S2 is used to provide multimedia broadcasting and unidirectional IP based services over satellite networks, while DVB-RCS enhances transmission in a bidirectional way, enabling transmission over the satellite return channel. Streaming Encapsulation (GSE) protocols are defined to transport ´P datagrams over DVB. They provide several benefits over Multiprotocol Encapsulation (MPE), typically used in DVB for transporting ´P data. While the security mechanism defined within DVB-RCS standard supports MPE encapsulation, there is no identified security mechanism for both ULE and GSE protocols. This paper proposes an enhanced security framework for DVBRCS security specifications adopting ULE encapsulation to provide secure lightweight encapsulation.

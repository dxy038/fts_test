High risk and high profit are the remarkable characters of enterprise technological innovation. The higher innovation degree is, the higher uncertainty will be. It is very important to analyze entirely all kinds of risk factors which can influence technological innovation and evaluate the process of technological innovation. In this paper, based on the index system of enterprise technological innovation, an evaluation model is constructed by combining the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) theory and the fuzzy-mathematical. Furthermore, the formulas of the new algorithm is derived and the calculate method is indicated in detail. The objective is to set up identifying and evaluating model to help enterprises control risks.

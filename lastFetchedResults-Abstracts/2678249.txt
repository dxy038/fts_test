Background & Objective: The heavy metals are considered as the pollutants which create too much problems in aquatic ecosystems for aquatics, and consequently, humans. This study aims to demystify risk assessment of some heavy metals concentrations such as Nickle, Cadmium, Lead and Zinc in the muscles of Otolithes ruber, Parastromateus niger, Scomberomorus commerson and Sphyraena jello fishes in 2013.

Material & Methods: 96 samples from the aforementioned fishes were taken from both coastal and marine areas of Chabahar port (Oman sea). Wet Digestion method is applied to extract the considered metals from the tissues, and the concentrations of the heavy metals were measured by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer Younglin AAS8020. All statistical analyses were performed by SPSS (V. 17) using ANOVA along with Duncan test.

Results: The results showed the highest and lowest concentrations of Cd were in Sphyraena jello and Otolithes ruber, respectively. The lowest Concentration of Pb was in Sphyraena jello. The highest and lowest concentrations of Ni and Zn were observed in Sphyraena jello and Scomberomorus commerson, correspondingly. The highest concentration of adsorbed Cd, Ni and Zn metals were measured in Sphyraena jello in the coastal area samples in children. 
Conclusion: Concentrations of Cd, Pb and Zn were lower than the determined proportions of  FAO, WHO, UKMAFF, NHMRC and FDA. Ni concentration was higher than the Global Standards in Sphyraena jello.

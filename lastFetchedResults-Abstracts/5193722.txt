In this paper, the response of wind turbine grounding systems is calculated under fault conditions or when they are hit by lightning. The objective is their effective design in terms of dispersion of imposed currents and minimization of raised potentials. Locally raised potentials are calculated in terms of steady state GPR. Transferred potentials to neighboring wind turbines are also computed. Measures taken to reduce potentials are presented and commented upon. For the purposes of this paper the well-known software packages EMTP (Electromagnetic Transients Program) and CYMGRD (CYMeÂ´s grounding) have been used.

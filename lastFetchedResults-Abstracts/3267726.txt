The paper presents the concept and the outline of the implementation of a hybrid approach to supply chain optimization. In this approach, integration of two environments of integer programming (IP) and constrain logic programming (CLP) is proposed. The idea behind the new solution is to use the strengths of both environments, in which optimization constraints are differently treated and different methods are used to solve them. This is particularly important for models in which there is the objective function and various constraints that sum many discrete decision variables. To verify the proposed approach, the optimization models and their implementation in traditional (IP) and hybrid approaches are presented.

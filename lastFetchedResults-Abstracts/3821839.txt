We propose a bidirectional wavelength-division-multiplexed passive optical network by employing gain-saturated reflective semiconductor optical amplifiers (RSOAs) for wavelength-independent optical network terminals. The fabricated RSOA module has the input saturation power less than -13 dBm and its saturated gain higher than 13 dB within the C-band for arbitrary polarization states. The upstream signals are generated by remodulating the downstream signals whose modulation amplitude is squeezed through gain-saturated RSOAs. We present experimental results on bidirectional transmission with 1.25 Gb/s for upstream and 2.5 Gb/s for downstream data rates over 20-km transmission distance.

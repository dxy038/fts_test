The main objective of this study is to obtain the reasonable range of offset in tube roll-cutting process by analyzing the effect of the process kinematics. For this aim, the roll-cutting processes are simulated. Due to the existence of the offset, the relative feed speed of blade is not constant. In this paper, the relationship between the radial feed speed shock of a blade relative to the tube and the offset is introduced. The effects of offset on the roll-cutting force and the blade stress have been analyzed. Regarding the stress of the blade, the offset should be less than 0.15mm for &#934;76 &#215; 3.5mm tube with the blade radial displacement per cycle as 1.0 mm.

The paper addresses an important but difficult class of concave cost supply management problems which consist in minimizing a separable increasing concave objective function subject to linear and disjunctive constraints. We first recast these problems into mixed zero-one nondifferentiable concave minimization over linear constraints problems and then apply exact penalty techniques to state equivalent nondifferentiable polyhedral DC (Difference of Convex functions) programs. A new deterministic approach based on DC programming and DCA (DC Algorithms) is investigated to solve the latter ones. Finally numerical simulations are reported which show the efficiency, the robustness and the globality of our approach.

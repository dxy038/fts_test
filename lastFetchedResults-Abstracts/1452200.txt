We deal with a Home Health Care Problem (HHCP) which objective consists in constructing the optimal routes and rosters for the health care staffs. The challenge lies in combining aspects of vehicle routing and staff rostering which are two well known hard combinatorial optimization problems. To solve this problem, we initially propose an integer linear programming formulation (ILP) and we tested this model on small instances. To deal with larger instances we develop a matheuristic based on the decomposition of the ILP formulation into two problems. The first one is a set partitioning like problem and it represents the rostering part. The second problem consists in the routing part. This latter is equivalent to a Multi-depot Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows (MTSPTW).

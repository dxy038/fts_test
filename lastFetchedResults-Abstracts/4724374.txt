A novel method to estimate the 3D location of a circular feature from a 2D image is presented and applied to the problem of objective dietary assessment from images taken by a wearable device. Instead of using a common reference (e.g., a checkerboard card), we use a food container (e.g., a circular plate) as a necessary reference before the volumetric measurement. In this paper, we establish a mathematical model formulating the system involving a camera and a circular object in a 3D space and, based on this model, the food volume is calculated. Our experiments showed that, for 240 pictures of a variety of regular objects and food replicas, the relative error of the image-based volume estimation was less than 10% in 224 pictures.

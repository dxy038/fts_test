Considering enterprise marketing complex network with local and world-wide competition, incomplete information and asymmetric characteristics, enterprise marketing complex network withl the bidirectional fitness evolution model is constructed on the basis of the BA model. Using continuum theory and the mean field theory node degree distribution, and calculated its rigorous solution, and derived the degree distribution we the model and the power-law index expression. The research results show that the model has universal application.

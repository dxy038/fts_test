This paper presents an optimal design of three dimensional multi-story reinforced concrete
structures using recently developed meta-heuristic algorithms, namely; the charged system search and
the enhanced charged system search. The design is based on the ACI 318-05 code and loadings are based
on ASCE7-05. Analysis of the structures is performed by the standard stiffness method. All members
are subjected to biaxial moments and axial loads. Pre-determined sections are assumed for beams and
columns, and the corresponding interaction curves are utilized to check whether the selected section for
each member is acceptable. The objective function is taken as the weight of the structure, and constraints
consist of the slenderness of compression members, the maximum allowable drift of the structure and the
natural frequency of the structure. It should be mentioned that second order effects are also considered
and that the end moments of the columns are magnified when needed.
First, a 7-story frame with 3 spans is considered and optimized. Then, a sensitivity analysis is performed
by optimal design of nine frames having 3 stories and 2 spans. In each story, different span lengths and
loading conditions are assumed, and the results are compared.

A radiofrequency (RF) fingerprinting strategy for the proper identification of wireless devices in mobile and wireless networks is proposed. The main objective is the extraction of the main parameters of the RF signal of the device by means of the preamble in the communication in the wireless network. A complete procedure for RF fingerprint data extraction is provided, and some experimentation is conducted for its validation.

Flavour and texture in cream cheese depend on the microstructure. The objective of this work was to study the influence of fat content, salt content and homogenisation pressure on the microstructure and sensory properties of cream cheese. Twelve types of cream cheese were produced according to a full-factorial design, whereby the fat content was set at three levels, the salt content at two levels and the homogenisation pressure at two levels. The cheeses were analysed by a sensory panel, using both quantitative descriptive profiling and time intensity (TI) evaluation, and by using a confocal laser scanning microscope, CLSM, whereby the microstructure of the cheeses was analysed. All the design parameters had a significant influence on the flavour and texture, although fat had the largest effect. Interaction effects between the design parameters were also found to influence the character of cream cheese. The results showed that it is possible to create a cream cheese with lower fat content and with sensory attributes similar to the attributes in cream cheese with high fat content, by modification of production parameters.

The ionospheric channel simulator described has been developed with the objective of evaluating HF modem performance either in fixed frequency or in frequency hopping mode. The simulator processes sampled data from complex signals generated by two kinds of sources: modem simulators; and hardware modems (an interface exists that performs the analog to digital conversion and generates the Q component of the complex signal). The following perturbations affecting HF transmissions have been taken into account: ionospheric propagation (Watterson Model); atmospheric noise; and interferences and jammers. In addition some effects of the transmitter-receiver (band-pass filtering, AGC) are included in the simulation. The software has been integrated on an array processor AP120B from FPS and a Vax 785 computer from DEC.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

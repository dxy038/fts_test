This paper studies the feasibility of deploying a ZigBee-based sensor network aboard ships. The objective is to verify if this network can be a suitable alternative of the actual shipboard wired monitoring system. Therefore, measurements campaigns have been conducted to evaluate the quality of ZigBee point-to-point communications aboard a ferry operating in the sea. Different configurations and environments were studied on each deck of the ferry. Experiments during the ship operation have been conducted to take into account the influence of crew´s and passengers´ movements, engines and machines on the quality of wireless transmission. In a second time, a full scale wireless sensor network was deployed aboard another ferry. Real time data such as temperature, humidity and pressure were sent from different ferry decks to a central base station located in the control room. This network has shown a very good connectivity, regardless of the metallic shipboard environments.

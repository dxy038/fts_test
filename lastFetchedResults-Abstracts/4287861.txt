This paper presents a method of how to optimize and dispatch the spinning reserve and unit generation for system reliability and economic efficiency under a specified demand and total value of spinning reserve in a composite power system. Spinning reserve is one of important ancillary services to maintain system reliability in case of contingency. This paper employs the DC power flow and determines generation shift factor so that power generation can be redispatched economically and lines transmission congestion can be alleviated effectively. The linear programming method is used to find the optimal unit generations and spinning reserve, with an objective of minimizing the generation cost while satisfying some operation constraints. Various constraints consisting of power balance and spinning reserve demand, ramp rate limits and transmission capacities limits are considered. The proposed method can be further applied to the operation of deregulated power systems in which spinning reserve is served as an important auxiliary service to help system operate stably and reliably.

OBJECTIVE: For decades, exercise has been considered as a cornerstone for managing diabetes. The current study aimed to determine the effects of short-term exercise on blood glucose, lipids and HbA1C in type-2 diabetes mellitus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 61 diabetic patients were randomly selected. Later, subjects with capability of doing exercise took part in a special four-week exercise program. The blood glucose, lipid levels (before and after 4 weeks) and HbA1C (before and three months after exercise program) of 32 subjects were measured and compared in the time scales. 
RESULTS: Our results showed a significant reduction in blood glucose and lipid concentrations. However, the reduction observed in HbA1C was not significant (P=0.12). Comparison of pre- and post-exercise results demonstrated a significant improved glycemic control.
CONCLUSION: The findings confirm the benefits of exercise training in type 2 diabetic patients. There are many studies which support the importance of physical activities program in controlling and preventing the common metabolic disorder and its complication

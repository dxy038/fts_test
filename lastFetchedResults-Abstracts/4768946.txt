A wide range of InAlAs/InGaAs/InAlAs/InP and InGaAs/InP lattice mismatched heterostructures with different thicknesses and compositions of the InGaAs layer were grown on InP (001) by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) and investigated with high spatial resolution spectrally resolved scanning photoluminescence. The objective of this contribution is to demonstrate that different types of extended defects (misfit dislocations, threading dislocations, oval-shaped defects) and structural micro-heterogeneity in the InGaAs layers induce significant short range changes of the spectral parameters of the photoluminescence bands

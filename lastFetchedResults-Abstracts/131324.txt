METHODS: This systematic study was conducted using library resources in the libraries of Iran University of medical sciences, the internet search engines (Google, Mamma), databases (Pubrned, Science @ Direct) from 1990 to 2003 and the website of national center for the dissemination of disability research (NCDDR).
FINDINGS: Activities about understanding of knowledge concept and focus on dissemination have been considered as third wave since 1980. Researches conducted about dissemination had two main directions: who were seeking the most appropriate approach for disseminating and who were seeing dissemination issue from the view of users. There are five key components for effective dissemination: source, content, context, media and the user. Effective dissemination needs to appropriate interaction among these factors. Dissemination is not a liner phenomenon; rather there is a close relationship and collaboration among generation, dissemination and utilization. There are four kinds of knowledge and each one needs to different way of dissemination.
CONCLUSION: As information utilization is the aim of dissemination, therefore five key components in dissemination, i.e. source, content, context, media and user must have some necessary characteristics in addition to coordination. Any organization, in particular research organizations, who thinks of competitive advantages in today's world, must develop a proper plan for its knowledge dissemination considering the features of effective dissemination and user participation.

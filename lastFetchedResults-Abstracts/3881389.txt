ADAS have the potential to optimize safety and efficiency in road traffic. In order to reach this objective, human-centered design principles have to be considered. Therefore, the effects of such devices on driver behavior and emotion are often analyzed quantitatively by using driving simulator studies that measure effects on individual level. But traditional driving simulation reaches its limits, if the effects of cooperative ADAS on the interactions of several road users (group level) should be analyzed. The paper describes the approach of a multi-driver simulation for the analysis of two cooperative ADAS that assist the driver: merging assistant and hazard warning. Results of experimental studies are presented and show positive as well as negative effects of both systems on driving behavior and interactions as well as drivers emotional response.

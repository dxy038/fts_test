This paper proposes comprehensive methods to improve the energy storage efficiency of the vanadium redox flow battery energy storage system (VRB-ESS) as well as the overall energy efficiency of the DC micro-grid for green building electricity supply. It includes a novel design concept of the bidirectional (charge/discharge) DC/DC converter circuits which link VRB with DC micro-grid, the principle of how to set the nominal voltage of the VRB and how to control these circuitsÂ´ parallel operation, as well as several energy efficiency improvement measures for the establishment and operation of VRB-ESS.

Objective: Ginger has always been known as one of the most famous medicinal herbs in eastern Asia (China and India). In this study we examined the effects of antidepressants-like activity of Ginger on the protection of central nervous system against oxidative damages.
Material and methods: Male Wistar rats (n=30) were allocated into three groups, control (n=10) and test groups (n=20) that subdivided into groups of 2 that had been exposed to 50 Hz electromagnetic fields (EMFs) for 8 weeks, one of the test groups received Ginger rhizome powder (1.5 g.kg-1.day-1.body weight) for 8 weeks as well. In the second and eighth weeks, we used forced swimming test in order to evaluate the antidepressant effect of Ginger powder on the rats exposed to EMF.
Results: In the second week results revealed EMF exposure increase immobility but decrease loco-motor function of swimming and climbing in comparison to control group (P  <  0.05) whereas at the end of 8th week, rats that had been fed with Ginger powder (1.5 g/kg/day.body weight) showed decrease in immobility score and increase in swimming (P  <  0.001), but not in climbing scores significantly. (P =0.18).
Conclusion: Ginger powder could act as serotoninergic antidepressant medicine in order to decrease depression presentation in exposed subjects to EMF

Is this paper, we propose a W-CDMA reception scheme using code combing RAKE with error-and-erasure correction Viterbi decoding. All techniques require only binary operations. The objective is to achieve relatively high transmission performance with very low receiver complexity and power consumption. The performance study of the proposed scheme is carried out taking into account the interference from other users, AWGN and random FM noise. Good performance is confirmed

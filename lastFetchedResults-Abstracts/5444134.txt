Optimum utilization of energy is the need of the hour to alleviate present energy crisis. Micro-Trigeneration system is an effective way of efficient utilization of fuel as an energy source. Around 60% of power in India is generated by conventional methods where 35% of fuel energy is converted into electricity. The rest of the energy is wasted thus affecting economy and environment adversely. Electricity is available for consumer with significant distribution and transmission losses. In such a scenario, generation of electricity at the point of use with maximum utilization of fuel energy is an effective way of avoiding generation and distribution losses. This is the objective of a Micro-Trigeneration system. Trigeneration is a step ahead of cogeneration plants which are used for Combined Heating, Cooling and Production of electricity (CHCP) using single fuel. For experimental proof of the concept, a LPG driven Bajaj 4-stroke IC engine was used as the prime mover. The energy available from engine is utilized for running the compressor of air conditioner and a generator. The former produces cooling of a cabin and the latter generates electricity to illuminate the cabin, run a fan inside the cabin and charge a battery. The heat of exhaust gas from the engine is recovered for water heating by using a heat exchanger. Thus combined heating, cooling and production of electricity is achieved at source to fulfill local requirements. The micro-Trigeneration unit gives an overall efficiency of 96% in terms of fuel energy conversion into other useful forms curtailing energy loss to only 4% thus resulting in economical and environmental benefits. The successful operation of this project proves to be a precursor for the development of a commercial trigeneration system.

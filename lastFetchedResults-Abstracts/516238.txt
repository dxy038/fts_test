1. University branches located in 11 zones in terms of proportion with ICT resources, professor’s, student’s and employee’s needs, (F=2.356 and p<0.05), the amount of using internet for connecting with different parts of organization (F=2.356 and p<0.013), the efficiency of using ICT in assessment of employees (F=2.296 and p<0.05). About the other cases, there is no any significant difference among university branches located in 11 zones.

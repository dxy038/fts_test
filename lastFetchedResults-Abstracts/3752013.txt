We propose a broad-band DWDM/SCM fiber-wireless access network based on a two-level bidirectional path-protected ring (BPR) architecture. This architecture can perform self-healing function under link failure. The proposed network can provide high reliability, excellent flexibility and large bandwidth for future broad-band wireless networks. Finally, we set up an experimental fiber-wireless network to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed architecture.

An approach to the design of multihop lightwave networks with connectivity patterns that can be dynamically reconfigured is presented. A practical algorithm that efficiently reconfigures the connectivity diagram by reassigning wavelengths to best fit the current traffic pattern is introduced. A stochastic optimization algorithm is used to obtain the mapping of a regular structure into a wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) star, while optimizing the system performance measures. The optimization tool is general and can be used with any objective function which is a function of the traffic patterns, the system control, and the system configuration. The results show that this is a practical tool and that the resulting structures have a superior system performance

In the project management environment, it is critical to know how the project is performing from the viewpoint of scope, schedule, cost, and other constraints. One source reports that 70% of IT-related projects do not meet their objective. This paper builds on prior efforts to develop a collaborative agent decision system that aids in recommending the status of a project using color indicators (red, yellow, green) that are based on the progress and standing of the project-related constraints. Progressions in the research, such as knowledge acquisition activities conducted with subject matter experts (SME) to acquire project management domain knowledge, and efforts to incorporate fuzzy logic into the decision system, are discussed.

Multi-cell cooperative processing (MCP) has recently attracted a lot of attention because of its potential for co-channel interference (CCI) mitigation and spectral efficiency increase. MCP inevitably requires increased signaling overhead and inter-base communication. Therefore in practice, only a limited number of base stations (BSs) can cooperate in order for the overhead to be affordable. The intrinsic problem of which BSs shall cooperate in a realistic scenario has been only partially investigated. In this contribution linear beamforming has been considered for the sum-rate maximisation of the uplink. A novel dynamic greedy algorithm for the formation of the clusters of cooperating BSs is presented for a cellular network incorporating MCP. This approach is chosen to be evaluated under a fair MS scheduling scenario (round-robin). The objective of the clustering algorithm is sum-rate maximisation of the already selected MSs. The proposed cooperation scheme is compared with some fixed cooperation clustering schemes. It is shown that a dynamic clustering approach with a cluster consisting of 2 cells outperforms static coordination schemes with much larger cluster sizes.

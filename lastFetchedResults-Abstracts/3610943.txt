The presence of strong acoustic feedback degrades the convergence speed of the active noise control (ANC) filter, and in the worst case the ANC system may become unstable. A fixed feedback neutralization filter, obtained offline, can be used to neutralize the acoustic feedback. The feedback path, however, may be time varying, and we may need continual adjustments during online operation of the ANC system. This paper proposes a new method for online modeling of the acoustic feedback path in ANC systems. The proposed method uses three adaptive filters; a noise control filter, a feedback path modeling (FBPM) filter, and an adaptive noise cancelation (ADNC) filter. The objective of ADNC filter is to remove the disturbance from the desired response of FBPM filter. In comparison with the existing method, which works only for predictable noise sources, the proposed method can work, as well, with the broadband noise sources. The computer simulations are carried out for narrowband (predictable) (case I) and broadband (random) noise sources (case II). It is demonstrated that the proposed method performs better than the existing method in both cases

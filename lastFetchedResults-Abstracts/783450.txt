Objective In the last two decades, a
multitude of investigations into the frequency of
mental disorders in the population have emerged,
making it difficult to keep track of recent findings and
tasks. Building on a historical review, the present
study provides a comprehensive overview of knowledge
about the prevalence of mental disorders.
Method The review is based on current national
surveys with comparable methodology. Study selection,
based on a consecutive literature search through
August 2005, led to the inclusion of Australian, German,
Dutch and US-American (NCS; NCS-R) surveys
of mental disorders in the general population. Results
A considerable proportion of the population is
found to have a mental disorder. The most frequent
disorders within the preceding 12 months are mood
disorders (6.6–11.9%) and anxiety disorders (5.6–
18.1%). Substance disorders (3.8–11.3%) and somatoform
disorders (11.0%) are also very frequent.
The prevalence rates presented in each survey are
dependent on the specific disorders included and the
classification system underlying them. Important risk
factors are being female, being unmarried, being
unemployed and having a low social status. Conclusions
Knowledge about mental disorders in the general
population can contribute to bringing about
considerable improvement in the treatment of mental
disorders. In addition to available knowledge, however,
there is a continued need to address existing
challenges from both a methodological and contentrelated
perspective, e.g. the lack of or inadequate
inclusion of specific disorders, the lack of prevalence
rates of mental disorders in childhood and adolescence,
and the as yet only rare inclusion of personality
disorders.

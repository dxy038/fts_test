With the acceleration of smart grid construction, Distributed Generation (DG) integration technology needs to be developed urgently. Reactive power optimization including windfarm is studied, and the variability and intermittency of wind speed is considered in this paper. The multi-objective reactive power optimization model including network loss, average deviation of voltage and stability margin of static voltage is established. The traditional genetic arithmetic is improved, and logarithmic barrier function in interior point method is introduced into the fitness function. So premature and partial convergence is avoided and the problem that some voltage values easily approach the upper limit in the traditional reactive power optimization is solved. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on IEEE-57 bus system with wind farm.

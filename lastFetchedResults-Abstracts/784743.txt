Objective: To develop a foodservice satisfaction instrument for residential aged care and
geriatric/rehabilitation units. The quality of care and food provided for clients in long-term care facilities is
critical for the prevention of malnutrition. Design: Cross-sectional survey and in-depth interviews. Setting:
Nine residential aged care facilities and two geriatric/rehabilitation units in Southeast Queensland, Australia.
Participants: A total of 103 geriatric/rehabilitation patients and 210 aged care residents. The median age was 84
years, with 72.1 % females. Measurements: Candidate satisfaction items were obtained from: (i) secondary
analysis of acute care foodservice satisfaction data; (ii) focus groups with expert geriatrics/rehabilitation and
aged care dietitians; (iii) pre-testing of instrument content, presentation format and response-scale (n=40) and
(iv) pilot testing of the instrument (n=313). Sixty-one items on foodservice attributes, an overall satisfaction
question, and demographic/contextual information were tested. Results: Principal components factor analysis
and Velicer's MAP test revealed foodservice satisfaction was represented by 18 items within four factors: meal
quality and enjoyment (α=0.91), autonomy (α=0.64), staff consideration (α=0.79), hunger and food quantity
(α=0.67) and six independent items, totalling 24 foodservice characteristics. This represented around 40% of the
variance in foodservice satisfaction. When a further 13 foodservice items were retained due to practical
importance, the analysis explained around 64% of the variance in foodservice satisfaction. Conclusion: The
Resident Foodservice Satisfaction Questionnaire is a novel measure of resident foodservice satisfaction and can
be used to provide evidence for changes to food services that may improve or enhance resident satisfaction and
assist in the prevention of a significant and modifiable cause of malnutrition

In electrical engineering schools, control systems are usually taught through lectures, tutorials, projects and labs. Obviously, it is during projects and labs that students acquire most of their know-how in this field. Nowadays, because real systems are complex and expensive, students learn more and more often from virtual systems. The objective of this paper is to propose the use of Field Programmable Analog Array to assist teachers in their education task. With this programmable analog components, students are able to create classical systems and extract from it real measurements.

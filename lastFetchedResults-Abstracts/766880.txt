The mechanical behaviour of polymeric foams
depends on several parameters such as temperature,
material density and strain rate. This last point implies that
compression tests on conventional testing machines are not
sufficient. Study of the behaviour in practical situations
requires special apparatus like fly wheels, drop towers or
Hopkinson bars, allowing high compression speeds. The
polypropylene foams studied are multi-scale materials;
agglomerated beads (2â€“3 mm in diameter), visible to the
naked eye, are composed of microscopic closed cells (a
few tens of microns). The response of the material to a
shock consists of three regions: an elastic phase, a plastic
phase and densification. The plastic phase is of prime
interest since a great part of the shock energy is dissipated
there. Microtomography was used in order to better
understand damage mechanisms during the stress plateau
of the plastic phase. The final objective of this work is to
determine the strain field of porous materials at several
levels of shock. As tomography is not fast enough to directly
follow the impact deformation, interrupted impact
tests were carried out by controlling the levels of sample
deformation. Between each impact step, a microtomographic
analysis offers insight on the progressive deformation
of the sample. The results of these impact tests
completed by a microtomographic visualisation in 2D are
presented and commented in this paper

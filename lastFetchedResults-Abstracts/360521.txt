Study objective: To evaluate the hemodynamic effects of calcium chloride in a canine model of acute propranolol toxicity. Methods:  Two minutes after the completion of a propranolol infusion (10 mg/kg), a bolus of .125 mL/kg 10% CaCl solution followed by an infusion of .375 mL/kg over the next 30 minutes or a bolus and subsequent infusion of an equivalent volume of normal saline solution was administered to each dog. Results: CaCl yielded significant improvements in propranolol-induced decreases in cardiac index and stroke volume compared with saline solution-treated control animals (overall α=.05). Furthermore, CaCl administration resulted in earlier improvement in propranolol-induced alterations in mean arterial pressure, maximal left ventricular pressure change over time, and peripheral vascular resistance compared with saline solution (overall α=.05). We observed no difference between treatment groups in response to propranolol-induced bradycardia or QRS-interval prolongation. Conclusion:  In this model of acute propranolol toxicity, CaCl therapy improved depressed hemodynamic status, mainly by a positive inotropic action.

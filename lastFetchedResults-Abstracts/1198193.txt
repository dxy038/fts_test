The objective of the present study was to develop and validate a new non-Newtonian shear-thinning standard viscosity fluid (SVF). The SVF exhibiting the non-Newtonian shear-thinning viscosity behavior of whole blood was necessary to evaluate the analytical performance of a blood viscometer according to Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The study utilized three different concentrations of maltose solution in water to cover high-, medium-, and low-viscosity ranges of whole blood. The SVFs could simulate whole blood viscosity over a wide range of shear rates and showed a long-term stability for at least 56 days with the coefficients of variations less than 5% in the viscosity measurements.

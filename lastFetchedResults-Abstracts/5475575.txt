Optical imaging systems used in industrial vision applications suffer from the limited depth of field problem. Image fusion is a practical way to obtain an everywhere-in-focus image of a scene. In this paper, a spatial domain image fusion method using multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed to obtain an optimal fused image. Experimental results conducted with industrial images show that the proposed method outperforms Laplacian Pyramid and DWT methods.

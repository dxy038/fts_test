This paper presents robust decentralized power system stabilizer (PSS) design approaches for power system that can be expressed as minimizing a linear objective function under linear matrix inequality (LMI) in tandem with bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) constraints. In particular, the paper addresses two approaches with their practical implications for large power systems. These approaches are: i) based on the concept of interconnection method for designing robust decentralized dynamic output feedback controllers that guarantee robust connective stability of the overall system, and ii) based on parameter continuation method involving matrix inequalities for designing reduced-order decentralized H<sub>infin</sub> dynamic output feedback controllers. Furthermore, the paper proposes algorithms to solve such optimization problems using sequential linear matrix inequality programming and general parameterized two-stage matrix inequalities optimization methods. It is also shown that the approaches presented in this paper can be used for designing realistic robust PSSs, notably so-called reduced-order robust PSSs design for power systems

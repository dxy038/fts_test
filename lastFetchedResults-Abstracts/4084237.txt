A matched field technique is used for remote sensing of refractivity profile. The method relies on electromagnetic propagation simulation to estimate the height profile of radio refractivity in the lower atmosphere by comparing theoretical predictions with measurements on a terrestrial radio link. The objective is to discover whether small variations of the airÂ´s refractive index can be detected in the lowest part of atmosphere, up to 150 m above the ground. The resultant estimations of the height profile of refractivity are compared with the measured refractivity profile obtained from meteorological sensors at different heights. The results show a close agreement between the estimated and measured refractivity profiles during periods of deep fading events.

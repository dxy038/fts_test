This paper presents a bibliography of selected references pertaining to power distribution system reliability. The objective is to encourage and facilitate broader use of reliability considerations in the design and operation of power distribution systems. References have been selected which deal predominantly with the distribution system beyond the distribution substation. Emphasis is placed on references which illustrate practical applications of reliability engineering techniques.

In recent years power system stability problem is playing a vital role in the research technologies. Improvement of power-system stability by simultaneous tuning of power system stabilizer (PSS) and a static var compensator (SVC) based damping controller is properly investigated in this paper. The design problem of the proposed controller is formulated as an optimization problem, and initially a single objective type differential evolution (DE) algorithm is employed and then a multi objective type Non dominated Shorting Genetic Algorithm-II(NSGA-II) is applied to search for the optimal controller parameters. The performances of the proposed controllers are evaluated under different loading conditions for single-machine infinite bus power system. The proposed stabilizers can be tested on a weekly connected power system by using three phase disturbances and various loading conditions. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control schemes over a wide range of loading conditions are visualized through nonlinear simulation results.

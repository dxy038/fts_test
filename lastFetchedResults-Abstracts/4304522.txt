Enhancing power plants efficiency and exploiting renewable energy sources are going to be two major objectives in pursuing an ecologically compatible development. Thus, reconfiguration management strategies not only have to address the objective (among the others) of minimising system losses, but also the optimal exploitation of network connected DGSs (distributed generation systems). This perspective leads to a more complex formulation of the optimal reconfiguration problem in distribution systems. This paper is intended to show the general problem of reconfiguration techniques in future distribution systems.

In this project, we have developed five curricular modules on distributed systems, performability, security, modern networks and distributed applications. Our objective has been to design these modules in a flexible way so that they can be synthesized suitably to develop courses and educational workshops on distributed systems and network security for a variety of audience including computer science undergraduates and the invited participants of our faculty enhancement workshops. The five curricular modules have been used to construct four new courses on "distributed systems and applications", "computer network protocols and analysis", "cryptography", and "computer network security". The five modules have also been used to develop faculty enhancement workshops. The success of the new courses and faculty enhancement workshops has given us good confidence in the soundness of the modular design approach.

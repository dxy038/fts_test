This paper describes the configuration, modeling, and control of a fuel cell (FC)-battery-powered hybrid system for the Metro Centro tramway in Seville, Spain. The proposed hybrid system presents a polymer electrolyte membrane FC as the primary energy source and a nickel-metal hydride cell battery as the secondary energy source, which supplements the output of the FC during tramway acceleration or whenever else needed and cruise and for energy recovery during braking. The tramway presents a traction system which is composed of four traction induction motor drives. The hybrid system also supplies the power for the auxiliary services. The power conditioning system is composed of two converters: 1) a boost-type unidirectional dc/dc converter for the FC and 2) a boost-type bidirectional dc/dc converter for the battery. The energy management system (EMS) of the hybrid tramway determines the reference signals for the electric motor drives, FC, and power converters in order to regulate accurately the power from the two electrical sources. EMS also determines the reference signal for energy dissipation in braking chopper when required during regenerative braking. In this paper, the proposed hybrid system is evaluated for the real driving cycle of the tramway. The results demonstrate the hybrid system capability to meet appropriate driving cycle.

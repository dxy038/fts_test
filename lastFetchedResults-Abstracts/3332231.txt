User experience of the vehiclesÂ´ telematics services depends on quality of bidirectional network connection between the vehicle and stationary high-performance computing system. In this case, there is a task of ensuring continuous data transmission between the vehicle and stationary computing system in the conditions of highly dynamic networks. The answer is to retrieve data about surrounding networks from external sources. The source may be a telematics map - set of low-level methods, which provide management routines for data about available networks. While vehicle moves along the route, these methods handle the data about surrounding networks, generalize them by geographical and temporal principles, execute queries to a database retrieving list of networks available in the area. As a result, we can schedule connections to wireless networks throughout the route. The article covers technical aspects of implementation of the telematics map information system: data collection and generalization technologies, networks list composition rules. The prototype demonstrates ability to solve the task of networks lists management in moving vehicle under real world radio conditions.

All-polymer dielectric elastomer actuators have been microfabricated using a high aspect ratio molding process. The actuators are multilayer beams of 3 conductive and 2 dielectric elastomer layers. By applying an electrical potential between two of the neighboring conductive electrodes, a stress is generated. This leads to an asymetric stress in the beam and, therefore, bending. Bidirectional actuation is possible by changing which electrodes the potential is applied across. A 1000 &#956;m long actuator demonstrated a tip displacement as high as 350 &#956;m at 1 kV with a static electrical power consumption of 10 &#956;W.

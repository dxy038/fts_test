This paper presents a sufficient condition for the existence, uniqueness and global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point for bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with mixed delays. The results impose constraint conditions on the network parameters of neural system independently of the delay parameter; and they are applicable to all bounded continuous non-monotonic neuron activation functions. The results derived in the literature.

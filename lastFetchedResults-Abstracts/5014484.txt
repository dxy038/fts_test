The design of sophisticated control systems have led in the past ten years to the necessity of satisfying more than one design criterion. Thus, it is natural to think that those criteria can be met in an optimal manner. If several criteria have simultaneously to be optimized, one is in presence of a multi-objective optimization problem. In this paper, many efforts to design the most popular control strategies, i.e. PID and MPC, by using multi-objective optimization techniques are reviewed. Both control strategies have dissimilar optimization characteristics and therefore, they can be considered as representative of two different multi-objective optimization problems, which are described including definitions, possible solutions, algorithms and available software implementations.

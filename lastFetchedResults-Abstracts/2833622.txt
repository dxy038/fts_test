The objective of zero-pollution and zero-emission of new green ships can be realized through the utility of renewable energy source (RES). This paper presents a novel multi-functional grid-connected inverter (MFGCI) with auxiliary services on power quality enhancement. The novel control strategy for achieving maximum benefits from these MFGCI when installed in green ship access to green ship electric network at the point of common coupling (PCC) through isolated transformer. This kind of inverter can not only inject power generated from RES to the green ship electric network, but also can perform as active power filter (APF) at PCC as well as can improve the efficiency of inverter and enhance the cost-effective feature of the green ship. Finally, this MFGCI and the control concept are demonstrated with extensive PSCAD simulation studies.

Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a non-parametric optimization technique that is frequently used in problems of combinatory nature with discrete or continuous variables. Depending on the evaluation function used this optimization technique may be applied to solve problems containing more than one objective. In treating with multi-objective evaluation functions it is important to have an adequate methodology to solve the multiple objectives problem so that each partial objective composing the evaluation function is adequately treated in the overall optimal solution. In this paper the multi-objective optimization problem is treated in details and a typical example concerning the allocation of capacitor banks in a real distribution grid is presented. The allocation of capacitor banks corresponds to one of the most important problems related to the planning of electrical distribution networks. This problem consists of determining, with the smallest possible cost, the placement and the dimension of each capacitor bank to be installed in the electrical distribution grid with the additional objectives of minimizing the voltage deviations and power losses. As many other problems of planning electrical distribution networks, the allocation of capacitor banks is characterized by the high complexity in the search of the optimum solution. In this context, the GA comes as a viable tool to obtaining practical solutions to this problem. Simulation results obtained with a real electrical distribution grid are presented and demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology used.

Activity-dependent modification of evoked activity was studied using cultured cortical networks on electrode-array substrates. The novel multi-site stimulation system enabled the authors to observe pathway-specific enhancement and depression of network activity simultaneously induced by a single tetanus. Correlation analysis revealed that this bidirectional modification followed a common rule: how closely the individual pathways were correlated with the tetanized pathway

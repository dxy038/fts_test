Objective: We sought to investigate the association between fetal heart rate and maternal electroencephalogram patterns during overnight sleep. Study Design: Data were collected prospectively between December 1, 1999, and June 30, 2001. Initially, the participating patients were asked to complete a 66-question survey for the assessment of maternal perception of sleep quality that was referred to as the sleep disturbance score: a continuous score from 0 (no evidence of sleep disturbance) to 110 (extreme sleep disturbance). Second, a subgroup of patients was monitored overnight by concomitant fetal heart rate and maternal electroencephalogram tracings. Statistical analysis included the Student t test, χ2 test, logistic regression, and Cramer's V contingency correlation. Results: One hundred two singleton pregnancies formed the study population. The mean sleep disturbance score was 26.7 ± 9.9. Maternal age was the only variable that correlated with sleep disturbance score. A subgroup of 11 patients was studied overnight. A significant correlation between active fetal sleep and maternal wakefulness was demonstrated in 6 patients. The mean sleep disturbance score for these patients was significantly higher than for patients without such correlation (P = .04). Conclusion: This study establishes an association between fetal activity and maternal wakefulness, which explains many of the maternal awakenings during sleep in the third trimester.

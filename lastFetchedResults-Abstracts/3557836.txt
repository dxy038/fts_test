The theoretical information content, defined by C.E. Shannon (1948), is proposed as an objective measure of MR (magnetic resonance) image quality. This measure takes into account the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), scan resolution, and field of view. It is used to derive an optimum in the tradeoff problem between image resolution and CNR, and as a criterion to assess the usefulness of high-resolution (512<sup>2</sup>) MR images. The result tells that for a given total acquisition time, an optimum value of the resolution can be found. This optimum is very broad. To apply ShannonÂ´s theory on information constant to MR images, a model for the spatial spectral power density of these images is required. Such a model has been derived from experimental observations of ordinary MR images, as well as from theoretical considerations

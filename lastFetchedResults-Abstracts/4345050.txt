Base stations (BSs) are the main energy expenditure elements of cellular networks, considering the high coverage requirements and the fact that the total provisioned capacity is intended to match peak hour traffic demand. In this paper, we introduce energy saving algorithms based on coordination between network elements. We introduce the notion of energy partitions - associations of powered-on and powered-off BSs - to deliver energy saving with the objective of matching offered capacity with the traffic demand in a flexible manner. Our energy saving algorithms are based on shared knowledge of load and coverage information and enable an appropriate cell reconfiguration for achieving a network-level energy saving. Through a simulation-based evaluation, we analyze the performance of centralized and distributed algorithms under different network topologies and traffic conditions, highlight the benefits and drawbacks, and provide recommendations for deployment scenarios.

Liang (2008) [Liang, T. -F. (2008). A note on ‘‘fuzzy multi-objective production/distribution planning decisions
with multi-product and multi-time period in a supply chain”. Computers & Industrial Engineering, 55,
676–694] proposed a production/distribution planning model and its solution approach in fuzzy environment.
However, his mathematical model does not use backordering option. The main purpose of this
paper is to demonstrate this handicap and propose a valid constraint.

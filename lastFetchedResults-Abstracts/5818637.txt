Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) is a highly complex, iterative and interactive process involving several types of knowledge and expertise. In this paper we propose to support users of a multi-view analysis (a KDD process held by several experts with different viewpoints). Our objective is to enhance both reusability of the process and coordination between experts. To do so, we propose a formalization of viewpoint in KDD based on CRISP-DM standard and taking into account the domain knowledge involved during a KDD process.

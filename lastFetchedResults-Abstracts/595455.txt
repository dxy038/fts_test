Objective: To evaluate the management of foreign bodies in the upper Gastrointestinal tract in a tertiary care hospital in Peshawar. Methodology: In this descriptive study, conducted at Gastroenterology Department Hayatabad Medical Complex Peshawar from May 2002 to May 2009, a total of 40 consecutive patients presenting with history of foreign body ingestion were included. Radiological survey was made before endoscopy in all the patients. Flexible endoscope, esophageal over tube and other accessories were used for removal of the foreign bodies. Results: Female to male ratio was 1.5:1. The mean age of the sample was 19.92Â±23.5. Dysphagia (n=18, 45%) was the most common symptom in the esophageal foreign bodies followed by retrosternal pain or discomfort (n=11, 27.5%). The most common foreign body was coin ingestion (n=24, 60%). Meat bolus and bone chip impaction was present in 9 (22.7%) patients. The success rate in case of esophageal foreign bodies was 93.75 %. While in the case of gastric foreign bodies, it was 100 %. There was a small perforation which occurred in only one patient with esophageal foreign body which was managed conservatively. In the case of gastric foreign bodies, no procedure related complications occurred. Conclusion: Flexible endoscopy was a safe and effective technique for the management of foreign bodies in the upper gastrointestinal tract in our study.

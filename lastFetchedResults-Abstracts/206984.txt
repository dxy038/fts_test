For many years the patterns of imported Western management have been applied unquestionably in developing countries without having expected effectiveness. In spite of their effectiveness in the motherlands, the question is why these patterns have not been successfully transferred to other countries if they are chaimed to be universally valid? The objective of this paper is therefore, to investigate the various aspects of this question and to seek some proper answers. In pursuit of this objective, those restrictions and obstacles which present themselves as the most important environmental challenges in the way of transferring and adopting these imported patterns of management are analyzed. To support the argument, the influencing process of national culture on organizational culture and consequently on management style and practices is comparatively discussed. In concluding the analysis which is mainly based on the Hofstede's study, the development of indigenous, management theories and pattern is emphasized as an inevitable necessity and some strategies are presented which can provide the main stream for the formulation of indigenous management patterns.

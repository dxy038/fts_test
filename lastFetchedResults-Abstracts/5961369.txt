This paper studies the dc power system to combine with the solar energy to supply household appliance. The building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) and a high concentration photovoltaic (HCPV) to transfer power into dc bus, a LiFePO<sub>4</sub> battery bank, in which the dc power was charged for storing energy to provide the dc loads. It is an critical issue to develop and save alternative energy for global supplies and needs, to combine the related power-saving technology to reduce the power loss so that the stable power providing could be attained and the efficiency could be raised up. In this paper, the real-time estimation proposed uses polynomials to demonstrate the power-voltage relationship of HCPV panels. This article also describes the comparison on the power providing characteristics of HCPV/BIPV. Besides, the architecture of this proposed system will be integrated with city power through the design of a bidirectional inverter.

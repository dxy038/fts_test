Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.Tb) is a bacillus capable of causing a chronic and fatal condition in humans known as tuberculosis (TB). It is estimated that there are 8 million new cases of TB per year and 3.1 million infected people die annually. Thirty-six new amide quinoxaline 1,4-di-N-oxide derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated as potential anti-tubercular agents, obtaining biological values similar to the reference compound, Rifampin (RIF).

Objective. This work was undertaken to measure mechanical properties of a diverse group of materials used for direct core build-ups, including a high copper amalgam, a silver cermet cement, a VLC resin composite and two composites specifically developed for this application.

Methods. Compressive strength, elastic modulus, diametral tensile strength and flexural strength and modulus were measured for each material as a function of time up to 3 months, using standard specification tests designed for the materials.

Results. All the materials were found to meet the minimum specification requirements except in terms of flexural strength for the amalgam after 1 h and the silver cermet at all time intervals.

Significance. There proved to be no obvious superior material in all respects for core build-ups, and the need exists for a specification to be established specifically for this application.

The two-switch buck-boost (TSBB) converter is suitable for wide input voltage applications. In order to achieve high efficiency over the entire input voltage range, the TSBB converter is operated in buck mode at high input voltage and boost mode at low input voltage. Such operation is called the two-mode control scheme. The objective of this paper is to propose an input voltage feed-forward (IVFF) method to reduce the influence of the input voltage disturbance on the output voltage. The small-signal models of the TSBB converter are built, and based on which, the IVFF functions under different operating modes of the TSBB converter are derived. The IVFF function in boost mode is simplified for easy implementation. The two-mode control scheme with IVFF compensation is then proposed for the TSBB converter, which realizes automatic selections of operating modes and the corresponding IVFF functions. Besides, nearly smooth switching between buck and boost modes is also guaranteed. For exhibiting the advantages of the proposed control scheme clearly, comparisons between the two-mode control with and without IVFF compensation have been presented in this paper, including the output signal of the voltage regulator and input-to-output voltage transfer function. Finally, a 250-500-V input, 360-V output, and 6-kW-rated power prototype is fabricated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme in the laboratory, and the experimental results show that the TSBB converter has an improved input transient response and high efficiency over the entire input voltage range with this proposed control scheme.

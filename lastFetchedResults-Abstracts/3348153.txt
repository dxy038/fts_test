Scan design is regarded as the best design-for-testability (DfT) discipline. High test data volume and long test time are always two major concerns that our work here addresses. Here we combine a test data compression technique and broadcast-based decompressor architecture to relieve these problems. We propose a new decompressor architecture with bidirectional shift register as a source chain to broadcast compressed data into parallel scan chains. It enables one more broadcasting mode which leads to a higher broadcast ratio. We also propose a heuristic method to order the scan cells in each sub scan chain to improve the broadcast ratio so as to reduce the test data and test time. We apply our method on several benchmark circuits and the experimental results show that our method can reduce test data volume by 22.8% and shorten test application time by 19.5% on average with low area overhead in comparison to other state-of-the-art approaches.

With the fast development of multi-terminal high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission technology, there is an urgent demand for the HVDC interruption technique. In this paper, an interruption scheme for HVDC based on artificial current zero is proposed with its main circuit breaker consisting of modularized vacuum switch in series. A triggered sphere gap is adopted as the commutation switch to achieve bidirectional DC interruption. The interruption process, particularly, the most important two commutation processes, is simulated based on a circuit model. The residual current and its influence after current commutation, which might exist due to the weak arc extinguishing capacity of the sphere gap, are analyzed. It is proposed to use back-up circuit breakers to interrupt the residual current. Furthermore, the influence of the frequency of the countercurrent on the interruption process, particularly, on the integral of i<sup>2</sup>t in the triggered sphere gap due to the residual current, is discussed.

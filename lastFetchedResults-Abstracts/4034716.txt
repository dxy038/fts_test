In 2008, the Wuhan National High Magnetic Field Center (WHMFC) was set up at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. The objective of the pulsed magnet program is to produce pulsed magnetic fields in the range of 50 to 80 T. The following pulsed magnets were initially conceived: 1) 50-80 T monolithic magnets energized by one or a few modules of the 1 MJ capacitor bank, 2) a 50 T/100 ms flattop long pulse magnet energized by the 100 MJ/100 MVA pulse generator, 3) a 60 T/200 ms long pulse magnet energized by the 12 MJ capacitor bank, and 4) an 80 T dual coil system energized by two capacitor bank modules. In addition, a 16 T PPMS and a 7 T SQUID-VSM systems were acquired. Currently, work on a 40 T long pulse magnet energized by lead acid battery units and the acquisition of a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer are in progress.

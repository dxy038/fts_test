Maintenance has been profound changes in recent years. It is now considered as a source of productivity and a pillar of industrial activities. Although the essential nature of the maintenance work is now more widely recognized, maintenance activities are identified as critical tasks for the safety of operators. This criticality arises not only from the nature of the activities concerned, but also the organizational context in which they operate and interactions between maintenance and operations. Indeed, the maintenance task is no longer a simple task performed by an operator; it is treated now as a system, and has now become a complex task that involves several components that interact. These interactions reflect the complexity of this activity. To solve these complex problems, multi-agent systems is the most appropriate and the most efficient tool for this kind of problem. The objective of this paper is to present an application of a multi-agent approach to overcome risks in maintenance activities. This system is a multi-agent system that is designed to ensure safety, and to avoid likely accidents / incidents when performing a maintenance task. This system is an anticipating system that detects risks, dangerous situations and hazards that may occur during a maintenance operation, and offers a set of preventive measures to put in place to avoid any risk types.

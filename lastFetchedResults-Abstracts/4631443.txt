Monitoring and supervision of power systems are provided by the control center, whose role is the design, coordination and network management. This paper presents a control technique based on the implantation of measurement units at the network buses. This technique should meet two requirements: ensure the complete system observability and find the optimal locations of PMUs with the minimum cost. The problem was formulated as a mono-objective optimization problem and its resolution was made by implementing a genetic algorithm. The proposed method is tested on three test networks and the results are compared with other resolution techniques. The simulation results ensure the complete system observability and validate the technique presented.

This paper presents a multi-cycle and multi-objective optimization method for the refueling simulation of a 713 MWe Canada deuterium uranium (CANDU-6) reactor based on a genetic algorithm, an elitism strategy and a heuristic rule. The proposed algorithm searches for the optimal refueling patterns for a single cycle that maximizes the average discharge burnup, minimizes the maximum channel power and minimizes the change in the zone controller unit water fills while satisfying the most important safety-related neutronic parameters of the reactor core. The heuristic rule generates an initial population of individuals very close to a feasible solution and it reduces the computing time of the optimization process. The multi-cycle optimization is carried out based on a single cycle refueling simulation. The proposed approach was verified by a refueling simulation of a natural uranium CANDU-6 reactor for an operation period of 6 months at an equilibrium state and compared with the experience-based automatic refueling simulation and the generalized perturbation theory. The comparison has shown that the simulation results are consistent from each other and the proposed approach is a reasonable optimization method of the refueling simulation that controls all the safety-related parameters of the reactor core during the simulation

In order to select the thermal power enterprisepsilas coal suppliers properly, certain attributes of the suppliers should be carefully analysis. Supplier selection is a multi criteria problem which multi attributions of the suppliers should be considered. We models supplier evaluation problem as an MCDM problem. The VIKOR method was developed for multi-criteria optimization of complex systems. So the improved VIKOR algorithm used to evaluate the thermal power enterprisepsilas coal supplier was proposed. The weight was used to estimate the effect of the evaluated index on the evaluated subject. In order to avoid objective influencing factors, the weight was determined by using Shannon Entropy combined Analytic Hierarchy Process. A study shows that the evaluation was more objective, scientific and rational.

Background and Objective: Muscle weakness and fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis, decrease daily activity and quality of life. However, exercise routinely for these patients is acceptable, but its impact has not been proven. This study aimed to assess effect of exercise on walking speed, fatigue and Quality Of Life (QOL) of patients with MS.

Subjects and Methods: Fifteen subjects with mild to moderate disability to MS assigned to an exercise group in a clinical trial study. The degree of disability was determined with the usage of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Also walking speed and fatigue measured by 8m walk test and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). MS QOL-54 Scale was used to assess QOL. Subjects underwent the three times weekly stretch and aerobic exercise programs during 6 weeks.

Results: after exercise, the subjects walking speed were significantly increased (p=0.0001). Fatigue were significantly decreased (p=0.001). There was statistically significant increased only in 4 aspects of QOL after intervention.

Conclusion: The results of this research showed the exercise would increase the walking speed and decreased fatigue. Also, results showed that, exercise may have partially affected health - related quality of life. Furthermore, the results confirm that exercise is safe for MS patients and can be recommended for those with mild to moderate disability. Sci Med J 2010; 9(2): 189-198

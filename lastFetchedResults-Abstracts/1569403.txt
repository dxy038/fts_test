In this paper a heuristic method aimed for detecting of QRS complexes was developed.Toward this objective, a new simple 2-D geometrical feature space (feature space dimension was equal to 2) was extracted from the original electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. In this method, a sliding window was moved sample-by-sample on the preprocessed ECG signal. During each forward slid of the analysis window an artificial image was generated from the excerpted segment allocated in the window. Each image estimated by a 300Ã—300 pixels matrix. Then, a pictorial-geometrical feature extraction technique based on curve-lengthwas applied to each image for establishment of an appropriate feature space. Afterwards the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification methodwas designed and implemented to the ECG signal. The proposed methods were applied to DAY general hospital high resolution holter data. For detection of QRS complex the average values of sensitivity Se = 99.93%, positive predictivity P+ = 99.88% were obtained.

The objective of this work is to characterize a YSZ solid electrolyte using the impedance spectroscopy (IS) technique. Using the IS, a comparison between two electrode geometries and two electrolyte thicknesses at different temperatures has been performed in order to analyze the obtained impedance patterns and finally determine the optimal fabrication process and the optimal measurement conditions.

This work has the objective to present the first development results of a WirelessHART module for the ns-3. Our focus is the implementation of the Physical layer in order to provide the basis for the development of the superior layers such as MAC and Application. Thus, we presente an energy consumption model, a Gilbert/Elliot error model and an analysis for the currently avaliable ns-3 propagation loss models. For further development we mainly aim for the implementation of the time slot scheduler (Network Manager) and the development of an inter protocol simulation with mutual interference.

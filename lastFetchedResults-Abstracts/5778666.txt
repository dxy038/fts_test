In this work, a no reference objective color video quality assessment metric is presented. First, a multi-valued 3D subband wavelet decomposition is defined. This wavelet representation is used to decompose the video sequence in order to describe the different channels in the human visual system (HVS). Thereafter, based on the properties of the HVS, a perceptual mask that integrates spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity function (CSF) and luminance sensitivity is applied to each wavelet band. Then, we define a flow tensor between successive frames. This flow tensor is weighted by the perceptual mask and is used to define a NR color video quality metric. Particularly, based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the flow tensor, we study the inter-frame coherence and the sharpness of edges in the successive frames. Experiments performed on video sequences indicate that the objective scores obtained by the proposed metric agree well with the subjective assessment scores.

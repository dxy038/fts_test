Metastatic melanoma is an incurable condition with a median survival of about 6 months. Chemotherapy can result in objective tumour responses but only in a minority of cases and remissions are short-lived, 3–6 months. DTJC is the most active single agent with response rates of 15–20% and although combination chemotherapy can result in higher response rates there is no response duration or survival advantage. Phase II studies have suggested that combining chemotherapy with biological response modifiers may result in higher response rates, in the order of 50% and the results of two large randomized trials investigating this approach are awaited.

nt trials currently focus on interferon and/or vaccine strategies. Further data are required before any adjuvant treatment can be regarded as standard.

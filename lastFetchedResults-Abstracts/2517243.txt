Combined heat and power production technology has energy efficiency and environmental advantages over other forms of energy supply. Solving combined heat and power economic dispatch problem considering all system demand and operational constraints determines optimal utilization of power and heat sources. In micro grids, dual dependency of combined heat and power production makes economic dispatch problem as a complicated non-linear optimization issue. In this paper, a bacterial foraging algorithm oriented by particle swarm optimization method is applied to solve the problem considering valve point effects and prohibited zones for power-only units models. These considerations cause nonconvexity in both the objective function and constraints. To exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, it is implemented on small and large scale systems. Comparison of the results obtained by the proposed approach with some other recently presented in literature shows overall superiority of the method and illustrates that it can be utilized as an efficient method in solving combined heat and power economic dispatch problem.

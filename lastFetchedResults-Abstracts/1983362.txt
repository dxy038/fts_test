In tanneries, the phases of conditioning and preparing the hide for tanning, as well as the transportation and fixation of tanning substances, are all carried out in aqueous media. Most of the steps of these processes are carried out with fresh water, which is used as a vehicle for the diffusion of chemical products and the extraction of undesirable materials from the hide. The objective of this study is to provide the minimization of water consumption at tanneries by applying the reuse of water at some stages of the process. Alternatives for water reuse were evaluated through analysis of the process wastewater to determine the concentration of some contaminant parameters. In tests with half-hides, the possibility of reusing the liquors from the 2nd bating washing in the 1st bating washing, and of reusing the liquors from the pre-deliming washing in the pre-deliming operation, was verified. In industrial scale the water reuse from a mixture of bating washings in the deliming and deliming bating was tested successfully. The quality of wet-blue leather analyzed in the systems with and without water reuse did not show any considerable differences and satisfies the tannery specifications. Finally, a mathematical program for mass integration was applied to solve the problem of water reuse in the beamhouse steps.

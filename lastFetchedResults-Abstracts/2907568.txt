This paper provides minimum C/N values for correct reception of DVB-T2 signals under fixed reception conditions. The C/N values are obtained after analyzing the results of field and laboratory trials. The field measurements were taken in a middle-sized city, along 33 locations, with MFN and SFN configurations. Both the system configuration options (constellation and code rate, FFT size, pilot pattern, and rotated constellations) and the propagation channel are taken into account to quantify their influence on the reception requirements. DVB-T was also measured and both systems are compared. The final objective is to provide the broadcasters with some guides based on measurements to optimize the DVB-T2 networks by choosing the parameters that best fit their needs.

The ability of a human to visually detect whether a packet has been lost during the transport of compressed video depends heavily on the location of the packet loss and the content of the video. In this paper, we explore when humans can visually detect the error caused by individual packet losses. Using the results of a subjective test based on 1080 packet losses in 72 minutes of video, we design a classifier that uses objective factors extracted from the video to predict the visibility of each error. Our classifier achieves over 93% accuracy.

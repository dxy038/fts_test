In this paper the CIRcuit CORrection rule-based expert system (CIRCOR) for the repair oriented diagnosis of NMOS and CMOS digital circuits is presented. Its objective is, in spite of testing, to reduce or eliminate the need for human analysis of tester-generated failure messages. The program can handle all types of physical failures than can occur in integrated circuits, that is: shorts, opens, extra transistors, missing transistors terminals within the range of primitive building blocks specified by the user. CIRCOR offers the possibility of diagnosing circuits only on the basis of an extracted transistor level description

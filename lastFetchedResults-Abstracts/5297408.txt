The loss of fingers and hands severely limits career and lifestyle options for the amputee. Unfortunately, while there have been strides made in advancements of upper arm and leg prosthetics, the state of the art in prosthetic hands is lagging far behind. Options are generally limited to claw like devices that provide limited gripping capacity. The overall objective of this paper is to demonstrate a path towards a low-cost prosthetic hand with multiple articulated fingers and a thumb that rivals the human hand in terms of weight, size, dexterity, range of motion, force carrying capacity and speed. We begin with a description of the functional requirements for a human hand. When comparing requirements with actuation technologies, the fluid power approach has the potential to realize a prosthetic hand that rivals a human hand in size, strength and dexterity. We introduce a new actuation technology, mesofluidics, that focuses on miniaturization of fluid power to the meso-scale (mm to cm). As a novel demonstration of the potential for this technology, we describe a proof-of-principle mesofluidic finger that has intrinsic actuation and control (actuators and control valves within the volume of the finger). This finger weighs 63 grams, is sized to the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile male finger, has a total of 25 mechanical parts and is capable of providing 10 kg (22 lbs) of pinch force.

A unified discussion of least <img src="/images/tex/146.gif" alt="p"/> th approximation as it relates to optimal computer-aided design of networks and systems is presented. General objective functions are proposed and their properties discussed. The main result is that a wider variety of design problems and a wider range of specifications than appear to have been considered previously from the least pth point of view should now be tractable.

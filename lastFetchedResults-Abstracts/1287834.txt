Background & Objective: It is necessary for a correct evaluation to use valid instruments prepared exactly according to the study population and special field. This study aimed to determine valid and reliable criteria for clinical evaluation of nursing teacher in Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Iran.
Methods: In this exploratory-descriptive study, reviewing different sites and literature, primary clinical evaluation form with 60 items based on the Likert scale was designed. Face validity of the instrument was determined based on students', teachers', and nursing and educating professors' opinions and content validity was determined based on Waltz and Bausell index. Construct validity was determined by factor analysis. Also, reliability of instrument was determined by Cronbach's alpha coefficient, split-half coefficient and test-re-test.
Results: Factor analysis to determine construct validity created two factors: educational behaviors factor with 21 phrases, factor coefficient of 0.633-0.788 and eigenvalues of 20.059; and supportive behaviors factor with 6 phrases, factor coefficient of 0.629-0.799 and eigenvalues of 1.915. Cronbach's alpha coefficient of clinical evaluation instrument was 0.95 totally, 0.96 for factor 1 and 0.85 for factor 2. Split-half coefficient was 0.81 and total Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.77 (P  >  0.001). Pearson correlation coefficient of answers to final question "what do you evaluate your teacher finally?" was 0.81 for factor 1 (P  >  0.001), and 0.72 for factor 2 (P  >  0.001).
Conclusion: Our instrument for clinical evaluation of nursing teachers (student form) was designed with two factors: educational behaviors factor with 21 phrases and suportive behaviors factor with 6 phrases and had a high degree of validity and reliability. We suggest this instrument can be used for clinical evaluation of nursing teachers in Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences.

Misunderstanding the emotionality of a word or an emotion-laden word used
inaccurately or inappropriately might lead to pragmatically unwanted and embarrassing
effects. The present study’s objective was to analyze the perception and use of the
phrase ‘I love you’ in Iranian bi/multilingual’s different languages. The aim was to
identify if variables of sociobiographical, learning history, and social and linguistic
context of L2 use affect the perceivedweight and use of this phrase. The research was
conducted using both quantitative (statistical correlation) analysis and qualitative
(open-ended questions) to investigate the research question. Twenty Iranian
bi/multilingual participants answered an emotional language valuation questionnaire
derived from a subsection of the Bilingualism and Emotion Questionnaire (BEQ)
database. Our research found that there was no statistical association with the variables
except language dominance. Furthermore, seventy percent of the participants reported
feeling that ‘I love you’ had the greatest weight in their L1regardless of their age,
gender, education level, whether they learned the L2 in a natural, instructed or mixed
environment, the onset age of learning, even if they had a high degree of socialization
and an extensive network of interlocutors in their L2.

The main objective of this research work is to obtain the minimum number of measurements and their weights (index) in the power system network. The use of singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to find a simpler approximation that speed up the search dramatically. The SVD is used to solve the problem of minimum number of measurements placement while maintaining accuracy as well as network observability. In this paper, the weights (index) of the measurements are obtained by their effect measured by the respective relative error in state estimation. The critical and non critical measurements are identified in the system.

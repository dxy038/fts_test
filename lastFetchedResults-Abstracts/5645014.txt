The objective of this paper is to contribute with the researches on the mapping of the electromagnetic fields of transmission lines using the Charge Simulation Method and MATLAB to develop a software that is capable of measure the electromagnetic fields of transmission lines. The software has several different analyses for the electromagnetic fields, which include the electromagnetic graphs, the 3-D graph for the electric field and the 3-D graph for the magnetic field, which are presented in this paper. The user can analyze the fields together or separated, for more specific analysis. The importance of developing software like that is that it gives to students and researchers a very powerful tool for the simulation of electromagnetic fields. The results show coherent to others measurements.

Materials and Methods: Injecting 0.05ml of sustained releasing agent (4% Papain and poloxamer) into knee joint to injury cartilage for a period of 2h at 50&#176;C. Results: Apparent pathology lesions had been shown in all articular knee cartilage, followed by gradual degenerative changes which were consistent with pathology features of osteoarthritis (OA). Conclusion: Injecting the sustained releasing agent is a feasible, successful and fast method to establish the osteoarthritis (OA) animal model.

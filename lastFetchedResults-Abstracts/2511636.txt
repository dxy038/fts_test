The purpose of this article is to represent an obvious understanding of the challenging concept of the science of “life-world” in The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology and meaning of this project by Husserl. Hereof, first is very important to perpend distinction and yet relationship between the objective science and the life-world then it seems inevitable to reflect on steps to this transcendental science including epochs of the objective science, epochs of the science of life-world and transcendental reduction. Here, the main focus lays on the possibility of the science of life-world project with tow approachs; a reflective and a non-reflective. The result of first approach was realization of the universal structures of the life-world in an ontology format of the life-world, and the achievement of second approach, by a transcendental turn to the life-world and its maner-of-givenness, is discovering the transcendental solidarity between the world and the world consciousness.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Propofol is an intravenous anesthetic for induction and maintenance of anesthesia, which its usage is increasing owing to produce a general state of post operative well being, antiemetic effect, rapid onset and recovery. This study was done to compare the effect of halothane and propofol on blood pressure and heart rate in maintenance of anesthesia.
METHODS: One hundred patients in ASA class I and II (American Society of Anesthesiologists) 16-60 years old were randomly divided into two groups. Halothane and propofol with continuous IV infusion were used for maintenance of anesthesia in group 1 and 2, respectively. Hemodynamic changes were measured after premedication, 1 minute after intubation and then every 5 minutes but it was recorded to 30 minutes after beginning and end of surgery. In the end of surgery, the patients were taken to recovery room and observed for evaluating nausea and vomiting for one hour and duration of recovery was compared on the basis of visual and verbal response.
FINDINGS: Systolic blood pressure during maintenance of anaesthesia was similar in two groups, but systolic blood pressure changes (0.037) and heart rate (p=0.009) were different in both groups. Relative frequency of nausea and vomiting was one in propofol group and four in halothane group. First and second recovery time in propofol group were 9.60, 10.52 min and in halothane group were 20.20, 22.90 min, respectively that there was a significant difference between them (p=0.000).
CONCLUSION: With regard to cardiovascular changes in maintenance of anesthesia with propofol, halothane and recovery time, propofol is a better choice in cases that rapid recovery time is need or inhalational drug usage is contraindicated.

In order to identify the reflection spectrum of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) designed on new features more easily, harmony search (HS) algorithm is proposed to analyze the reflection spectrum characterization of FBG. Embark on the coupled mode theory and the phase matching condition of FBG, theoretical model of fiber grating based on axial homogenous strain is discussed in detail. Through establishment of the HS algorithm model and design of the programs, the application of HS algorithm on optimization of the unary function is verified, and the feasibility, accuracy and stability of the method are determined by three important parameters. The corresponding objective function of the reflection spectrum under uniform axial strain is established and the theoretical simulation experiment has been carried on. The simulation experiment indicates that the optimization result of HS algorithm fits the theoretical result well with an error of 0.1%, which verifies the feasibility of the application of HS algorithm in the FBG reflection spectrum optimization.

Clinical gait analysis aims to quantify and assess the mechanics of walking and identify deviations from ‘normal’ movement patterns. To facilitate the use of clinical equipment, protocols are required to process data and produce a few meaningful summary measurements which can, in turn, be used to flag gait abnormalities. Earlier work produced a one-dimensional index of gait, calculated from sagittal hip, knee and ankle rotation angle patterns. The objective of this study was to extend the original index, incorporating kinematic and kinetic data from multiple planes, while allowing for correlations between component measures. A one-dimensional index of normal gait was developed, based on normative gait data (N = 45 children, aged 3–13 years). The new one-dimensional index was calculated using correlation patterns between seven component indices, each of which has diagnostic interpretation. The effectiveness of the new index was tested using immature normative data (N = 14) and hypotonic data (N = 10). Approximately 85% of immature normative children and 100% of hypotonic children were classified as either unusual or extreme by the one-dimensional index. These data reduction protocols improve objective gait analyses in the clinical setting.

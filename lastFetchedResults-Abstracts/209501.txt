The objective of this papers is to investigate impacts of aquaculture. The rate of growth of aquaculture
exceeds that experienced by other animal food producing sectors. By reducing the number of fishing
through open - ocean capture methods, aquaculture might be considered as a "best practice" for the
protection of marine ecosystems. Development of aquaculture, promotion of new fish varieties
production, productivity enhancement, establishment of hatchery facilities and formation of an
effective support organization are the most important strategies. Nowadays, At least 60% of the
threatened species were decreased as a result of negative effects to habitat. Aquaculture provides
possibility of culturing endangered species. In this paper world statistics on annual growth of
aquaculture and important culture species from the past to date will be compared. Then some
programs are explained for protection of marine ecosystems for protection of marine eco systems

Background: A studentâ€™s lifestyle can change notably in a foreign country. The objective of this study was to
determine factors associated with the body weight status of Iranian postgraduate students in Universiti Putra
Malaysia (UPM) 2009.
Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was administered to 210 Iranian postgraduate students at UPM.
Anthropometric factors also were measured using standard procedures. Body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip
ratio (WHR) also were calculated. The chi-squared test, Spearman's rho, and the Pearson product-moment
correlation coefficient were used to determine the associations between the variables that were studied. Multiple
linear regression analysis was used to measure the amount of influence a predictor variable had on a outcome
variable.
Results: There was no significant correlation between nutritional knowledge (P  >  0.05), weight-management
knowledge (P  >  0.05), and smoking (P  >  0.05) and BMI. There were statistically significant correlations between
gender (P  <  0.01), physical activity (P  <  0.05), protein (P  <  0.01), carbohydrate (P  <  0.01), fat (P  <  0.01), fiber (P  < 
0.01), vitamin C (P  <  0.05), calcium (P  <  0.01), and iron (P  <  0.01) and BMI. There were also relationships between
body fat (P  <  0.01), waist circumference (P  <  0.01), hip circumference (P  <  0.01) and WHR (P  <  0.01) and BMI.
Conclusion: Our findings showed the need for a nutrition promotion program for the Iranian students to help them
change their negative food habits and improve their lifestyles.

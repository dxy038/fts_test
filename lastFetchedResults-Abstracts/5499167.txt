In this paper, a method for calculating the semiconductor losses in a three-phase matrix power converter is presented. Since there is no freewheeling path in the matrix converter power circuit, and in order to provide safe commutation between the complementary devices, an R-C snubber has been used with each bidirectional switch. The effects of this snubber circuit have been considered in the calculation of the switching losses. The results showing semiconductor losses versus various parameters in the matrix power converter have been graphically demonstrated. Hence, the semiconductor losses in the power converter can be estimated by examining these results

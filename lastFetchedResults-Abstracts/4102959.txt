The information content of scientific data coming from remote planets explorations is very high and is still not fully exploited by the scientific and public communities. A large distribution of such data to scientists not directly involved in a space mission project is a relevant objective worthy of interest. This evolution requires an increase in returned data volumes and higher data rates, envisaging the need for complex Interplanetary communications architectures and technologies.

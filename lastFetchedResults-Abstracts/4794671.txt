The problem of partitioning appears in several areas ranging from VLSI, parallel programming to molecular biology. The interest in finding an optimal partitioning especially in VLSI has been a hot issue in recent years. In VLSI circuit partitioning, the problem of obtaining a minimum cut is of prime importance. To enhance, the other criterion like power, delay and area in addition to minimum cut is included. In this paper we engineer memetic algorithm (combination of global search + local search) as in fig 1 for optimization of VLSI partitioning. Here we incorporate genetic algorithm for global search and a simple local search for handling the multi-objective. The result will be compared the previous work result.

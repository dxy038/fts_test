This paper describes an inductive charging system based on bidirectional ac-dc-ac converter for Plug-in Hybrid and Electric Vehicles. Unlike traditional full bridge converters for high frequency generation, the proposed new topology has the advantage of simple circuit with reduced number of switches and diode for inductive charging systems. Thus, number of components, switching stress, losses and control complexity is reduced. Based on the qualitative description of the charging system, a fuzzy controller is developed to regulate the current flow in battery during charging and discharging process. The entire charging system is designed and simulated for a maximum power handling capacity of 200KW.

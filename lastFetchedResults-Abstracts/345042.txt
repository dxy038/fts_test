Recent studies have shown that F2-isoprostane levels—a marker for lipid peroxidation—are increased in human renovascular hypertension but not in essential hypertension. Angiotensin II specifically stimulates F2-isoprostane production through activation of the AT1 receptor. The objective was to determine whether there is a relationship between the level of oxidative stress evaluated by measuring urinary F2-isoprostanes levels and polymorphisms of genes involved in the renine angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) regulation. The population studied included 100 subjects, 65 of whom were healthy normotensives; the other 35 were suffering from untreated, essential hypertension. The polymorphisms studied concern the genes encoding angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE/in16del/ins), angiotensin II receptor type I (AGTR1/A+39C[A+1166C] and AGTR1/A-153G), angiotensinogen (AGT/M235T), and aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2/T344C). Oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring urinary F2-isoprostanes levels. The characteristics of the population were as follows: men/women = 46 / 56; age = 50 ± 10 years; BMI = 24 ± 3 kg/m2; SBP = 131.7 ± 17.2 mm Hg; DBP = 84.6 ± 10.4 mm Hg. In univariate analysis, urinary F2-isoprostane levels were significantly lower in the presence of the G allele of AGTR1/A-153G (56 ± 17 vs 76 ± 39 pmol/mmol creatinine; P < 0.001, and P < 0.01 after Bonferroni correction for 10 tests). In multivariate analysis, taking into account BP, age, gender, BMI, plasma glucose, and total cholesterol, the G allele of AGTR1/A-153G is linked independently to urinary F2-isoprostanes level (P < 0.01). Our data suggest that F2-isoprostane level depends at least in part on the A-153G polymorphism of the angiotensin II AT1 receptor gene. The clinical and prognostic relevance of this polymorphism requires further investigation.

The differential equation of Yang for residual strength degradation in composite materials subject to fatigue loading is considered for obtaining the lognormal distribution as a model for the fatigue life of a composite material. Using this model, an ad-hoc method for estimating the physical parameters of the composite system is suggested. An example illustrates the use of our method in analyzing data. Since YangÂ´s differential equation is for composite materials, our objective was to derive a model for composite materials. However, the methodology can be extended to other metals and materials.

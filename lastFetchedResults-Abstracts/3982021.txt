An allocation model for mapping a real-time application to certain <e1>k</e1>-processor multiprocessor systems is developed and analyzed. Its objective is minimizing the total processing time of the application by exploiting the parallelism of the application-architecture pair. The model is formulated in terms of the performance characteristics of the system and the resource requirements of the computation involved. Experience with the model suggests that it can be used effectively for the performance evaluation of application-distributed system pairs

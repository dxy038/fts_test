The paper presents the usage of global optimization methods for finding the suitable placement of transmitters and receivers of radar systems. The optimization criterion is maximum covered area. The following text describes using a genetic algorithm for placing elements of radar systems which have several transmitters and several receivers. The algorithm is searching for the optimum configuration of transmitters and receivers so that there are no blank areas close to the airport and with a minimum number of element systems to achieve a maximum covered area. The text also describes signal propagation from transmitter to target and from target to receiver. It is important for calculating the area where it is possible to detect a target. The covered area is used as an objective function for the optimization algorithm.

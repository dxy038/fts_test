Modern economy is the economy of information and knowledge, resulting in increasing speed of changes occurring in it; accordingly, it requires new tools and approaches to industrial activity. In conditions of high degree of uncertainty in the environment and in order to enhance their role, the entire staff and not only the top management become the protagonists in the organization. Thanks to the skills, abilities, knowledge of each organization item, one can not only achieve their strategic objectives (this is the role of management care in the classical management), but also form a strategic aim (which featured the activities of management in the classical management). Objective intellectual limitation of the organization leader is due to the fact that speed of changes in the external environment makes it necessary to use the potential of subordinates, who often have greater intellectual potential than leaders do. Thus, by combining efforts, the organization receives a significant synergetic effect. But this approach requires changes in organization management: control system based on coercion needs to be changed to a system based on the cooperation of all organization subjects, on the interaction of leadership qualities, leadership potential of every individual, but on condition that they are all ready to take on leadership functions.

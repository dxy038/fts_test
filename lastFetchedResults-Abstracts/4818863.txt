This paper proposes a quantitative reverse logistics system model and an application example on electronic products. An interactive heuristics algorithm is presented to solve the multi-objective optimization problems of the proposed reverse logistics system model. Reverse logistics systems no longer are confined to one-way product flows from manufacturers to consumers, but also deal with flows in the opposite direction. Environmental issues are considered in reverse logistics. Companies cannot avoid the responsibility of their pollution to the environment. Reverse logistics is the ideal selection and could provide a solution to the management problem of electronic product wastes and help to lower economic cost and improve environmental performance of the business. This research studies optimization decisions and constraints required by analyzing the reverse logistic model. A multi-objective optimization method is used in this research, since the optimization decision problems of the proposed reverse logistics model always have multiple objectives. Product manufacturing, distribution, returning, recycling, and other general activities through the reverse logistics system are discussed and modeled. A life cycle assessment method (Eco-indicator 99) is also developed to integrate environmental impacts into optimization processes

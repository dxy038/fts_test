Vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of a circular cylinder at low values of the Reynolds number (Re) are simulated by means of a fully coupled fluid–structure interaction numerical model based on the finite element method. It is shown that VIV could occur far below the first Hopf bifurcation ( Re &lt; 47 ) . The main objective of this study is to determine the limiting curve that separates the non-vibrational area from the possible vibrations occurrence area in the Reynolds number–reduced velocity (Re, Ur) plane. We assume that by taking a zero mass cylinder and zero structural damping we should get the low limit of vibrations in terms of Re and Ur. It is shown that transverse vibrations could occur for reduced velocities larger than 40 and that for zero mass/no damping cylinders the maximum vibration amplitude for subcritical Reynolds numbers is obtained at Ur = 6.5 .

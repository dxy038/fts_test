The main objective of this work is to develop an analogue computer base on switched capacitor circuits. The system is suitable for solving nonlinear differential equations in real time. This has considerable advantages in solving systems of equations that cannot be solved analytically and of optimising nonlinear systems. The method has been used to solve nonlinear systems for the generation of Solitons and the results have been compared to measurements

Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of Eating Disorder Beliefs Questionnaire (EDBQ) (Cooper et al. 1997). Method: The sample consisted of 18 classes (403 high school girls) which were selected through cluster random sampling from among public high schools in the City of Tehran. All participants responded to Persian version of the EDBQ and the Young Schema Questionnaire-Short Form (YSQ- SF). Results: The validity of the questionnaire was investigated using con¬vergent and discriminative validity and exploratory factor analysis. Results from factor analysis of the EDBQ using Varimax rotation method, yielded 4 factors labeled: 1- Negative Self Beliefs; 2- Other Acceptance; 3- Self Ac¬ceptance; and 4- Overeating Control, which explained more than 46.26% of the total variance. EDBQ inter-factor correlations ranged from 0.31 to 0.84 (p<0.01). Convergent validity was assessed by computing a correlation co¬efficient between EDBQ and YSQ-SF total scores, which was 0.48 (p<0.01). The reliability of EBDQ was calculated using Alpha Cronbach and split-half method which was 0.89 and 0.72 respectively. Conclusion: Considering the findings of this study, it could be stated that EDBQ can be used as a reliable instrument for evaluating eating disorder beliefs in the Iranian population.

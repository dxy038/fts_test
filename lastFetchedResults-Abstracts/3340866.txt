The objective of this paper is to develop an easy, efficient and robust algorithm for the analysis of electrocardiogram signals. The technique used in this algorithm is based on the use of Moving Average Filters and Adaptive Thresholding for QRS complex detection. Several established ECG databases published on PhysioNet with sampling frequency ranging from 128Hz-1KHz, were used for analyzing the technique. The accuracy of the algorithm is determined on the basis of two statistical parameters: sensitivity (SE) and Positive Predictivity (+P).

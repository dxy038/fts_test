Objective
mine the current suctioning practices nationally of experienced pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) nurses.

ten survey method was used for this descriptive study.
tion
CUs in the 92 hospitals listed in the 1991 National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions directory.
ipants
nurses with more than 3 years experience were requested to complete the questionnaire in relation to their endotracheal suctioning practices of PICU patients.
s
estionnaire was returned by 80 (90%), PICUS. A wide range of suctioning techniques were used. Most respondents reported hyperoxygenation, hyperventilation, and/or hyperinflation of the patient's respiratory system before suctioning. Nursing judgment and the patient's clinical condition were used to determine when a suctioning procedure was needed. Most respondents (71%) indicated inserting the suction catheter until resistance was met. Normal saline-solution irrigant was used by all but one respondent. A manual resuscitation bag was used routinely during suctioning. Eighty percent of respondents reported that few patients displayed and adverse response to the suctioning procedure.
endations
udy should be replicated with direct observations of actual PICU sucting practices. Suctioning techniques should be examined in relation to specific groups of PICU patients. Further research is needed to determine the optimal practice for rates of hyperventilation, percentage of oxygen increase during hyperoxygenation, and pressure increase during hyperinflation.

The bottom surface of conventional cavity receiver cannot be fully covered by coiled metal tube during fabrication, which would
induce a dead space of solar energy absorption. The dead space of solar energy absorption can severely decrease the optical efficiency
of cavity receiver. Two new types of cavity receiver with bottom surface convex are put forward with the objective to solve the problem of
dead space of solar energy absorption and improve the optical efficiency of cavity receiver. The optical efficiency and heat flux distribution
of the two new types of cavity receiver are analyzed by Monte Carlo ray tracing method. Besides, the optical efficiency comparisons
between conventional cavity receiver and the two new types of cavity receiver are conducted at different characteristic parameter
conditions.

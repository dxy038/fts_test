The risk evaluation index system of geological catastrophe of tailing reservoir was set up based on the safety system engineering. The safety total catastrophe subjection function values of tailing reservoir in different periods were worked out based on catastrophe theory, and the risk grade of geological catastrophe of tailing reservoir was divided, so the dynamic analysis and evaluation was realized. The weight were not used by the method based on catastrophe theory, so the subjective influence was reduced, thus the evaluated result was more objective and reasonable.

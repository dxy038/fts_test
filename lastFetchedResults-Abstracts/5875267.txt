The objective of this study is to show the applicability of Flow Network Modeling (FNM) in analyzing liquid cooling systems that incorporate microchannel heat sinks. The study is divided in two parts. In the first part, an analytical model of a microchannel heat sink is proposed and its validity is established by comparison with a detailed CFD analysis. In the second part of the study, a liquid cooled system that accommodates three microchannel heat sinks is analyzed using Flow Network Modeling (FNM). In the FNM method, the pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient of the components in the system are calculated using analytical or empirical correlations. The goal of the analysis is to balance the liquid flow passing through each heat sink such that the chips case temperature remains below recommended values. This study illustrates the use of the FNM technique for analyzing liquid cooled systems and microchannel heat sinks.

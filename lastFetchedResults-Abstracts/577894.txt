Separable programming deals with such nonlinear programming problem in which the
objective function as well as constraints are separable. For solving Separable Nonlinear
Programming Problem (SNPP) is reduced first to Linear Programming Problem (LPP)
by approximating each separable function by a piecewise linear function and than usual
graphical, simplex method applied. A new form of Gauss elimination technique for inequalities
has been proposed for solving a Separable Nonlinear Programming Problem.
The technique is useful than the earlier existing methods because it takes least time and
calculations involve in are also simple. The same has been illustrated by a numerical
example of SNPP.

The purpose of this paper is to describe the design and development of the hexapod robot HITCR-II for walking on unstructured terrain. The leg and joint with modularized structure have been designed, and an objective function has been made up to further optimize the parameters of structure, thereby enhancing the motion performance of this robot; The 3-D.O.F force sensor in the foot end and joint torque sensors have been designed into the structure of leg, thus the leg has the omnidirectional perception of force, and the robot is also equipped with pose sensor, joint position sensor and binocular vision, so it can apperceive its own state and external environment; A highly integrated electric system has been developed, and finally the shell of the robot has been designed to make the robot more beautiful as well as better wrap-around.

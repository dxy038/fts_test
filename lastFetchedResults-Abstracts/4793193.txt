Harmony Search algorithm is a heuristic approach for global optimization which mimicking the improvisation process of music player, and has been applied into different engineering applications. This paper first introduces the step and base flow of basic Harmony Search algorithm, aiming at the existent shortage, it analyzes the improved Harmony Search algorithm from two aspects including algorithm itself and combing with other algorithms, and then analyzes the application in multi-objective, and finally puts forward some future research lines.

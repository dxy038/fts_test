The objective of this panel presentation is to briefly assess the present stage of the Brazilian power sector reform, evaluating the 2001 energy crisis, its effects and proposals for power sector model improvement. In this process the Brazilian government faces a considerable number of challenges, of which we will concentrate on the following ones in more detail: price signals and operational reliability, and investment and supply security in the long term. We will evaluate the most recent proposals and alternatives for ensuring security of supply in Brazil, and also assess alternatives and proposals learned from other countriesÂ´ experiences.

Background: In recent years, most of the studies focused on oat bran and the food of oat containing &#946;-glucan that could bring about hypoglycemic effects, while only a few studies paid attention to the functions of oat &#946;-glucan, in addition , there was much controversy about the effective dose of oat &#946;-glucan in humans with type 2 diabetes. Objective: To evaluate the association between the oat &#946;-glucan and type 2 diabetes and decide the optimal dose after taking of different doses of oat &#946;-glucan extraction (from the oat bran of Shanxi, and the content is 82.10%). Design: Male KM mice (n=100) were randomly divided into two groups within a randomized design after adaptive feeding for 3 days, the normal control group (NC, n=15) was kept with chow diets and the model group (n=85) was fed high-fat diets. The model of type 2 diabetic mice was successful, then oral administration of oat &#946;-glucan at 800 mg/kg&#183;bw, 1200 mg/kg&#183;bw and 2000 mg/kg&#183;bw up to 6 weeks. Methods: The type 2 diabetic mice resulted from high fat and Streptozotocin (STZ) .Decide the adequate levels of oat &#946;-glucan by many measures, such as fasting/ postprandial blood glucose(FBG/PBG) fasting blood insulin(Fins) Insulin activity index (IAI) and oral glucose tolerance test(OGTT). Results: Oat &#946;-glucan can remarkably reduce the FBG/PBG and stimulate insulin secretion, as well as improve the ability of glucose tolerance (p&lt;;0.01).And the best dose is 2000mg/kg&#183;bw. Conclusions: The results showed that oat &#946;-glucan might alleviate diabetic symptoms and improve the sensitivity of insulin in diabetic mice.

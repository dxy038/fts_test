We focus on the development of a Lyapunov-based economic model predictive control (LEMPC) method for a class of switched nonlinear systems for which the mode transitions take place according to a prescribed switching schedule. In contrast to steady-state operation of conventional model predictive control (MPC) methods which use a quadratic objective function in their formulations, LEMPC utilizes a general (non-quadratic) cost function which may directly address economic considerations and may lead to time-varying closed-loop operation. Appropriate stabilizability assumptions for the switched nonlinear system are made and suitable constraints are imposed on the proposed LEMPC formulation to guarantee closed-loop stability of the switched nonlinear system and ensure satisfaction of the prescribed switching schedule policy while dictating time-varying operation that optimizes the economic cost function. The proposed control method is demonstrated through a chemical process example described by a switched nonlinear system.

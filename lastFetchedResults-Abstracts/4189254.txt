In this paper we propose a method for video delivery over bit error channels. In particular, we propose a rate distortion optimal method for slicing and unequal error protection (UEP) of packets over bit error channels. The proposed method performs full frame based search using a novel dynamic programming approach to determine the optimal slicing configuration in a practically short time. Also we propose a rate and distortion estimation technique that decreases the time to evaluate the objective function for a slice configuration. The proposed method can perform rate-distortion UEP that can be used over forward error correction (FEC) capable channels. We show that the proposed method successfully exploit the local dynamics of a video frame and perform more than 1 dB better than common methods.

The main objective of the paper is to provide a like-with-like performance comparison between the wavelet domain and the multiwavelet domain watermarking, under a variety of attacks. The investigation is restricted to balanced multiwavelets. Furthermore, for multiwavelet domain watermarking, both wavelet-style and multiwavelet-style embedding are investigated. It was shown that none of the investigated techniques performs best across the board. The wavelet-style multiwavelet technique is best suited for compression attacks, whereas scalar wavelets are superior under cropping and scaling. The multiwavelet-style multiwavelet is far superior under low-pass filtering. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that for attacks which are likely to affect mid-range frequencies, the wavelets are more suitable than multiwavelets, whereas for attacks which are likely to affect low frequencies or high frequencies, the multiwavelets are the best choice. Furthermore, the multiwavelets generally offer better visual quality than scalar wavelets, for the same peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). This suggests that part of the available channel capacity remains unused, and shows once more the potential of multiwavelets for digital watermarking.

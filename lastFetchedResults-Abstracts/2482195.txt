Objective: According to the fact that university students are role models for the whole society, this study
was performed to evaluate reasons of and attitudes toward cigarette smoking among Iranian university students.
Methods: This study was performed as a cross-sectional self-reported questionnaire based study among
university students of Kerman city of Iran. Our questionnaire was attributed to 1750 university students who
were selected randomly. Current smoking was defined as using cigarette within the last 30 days. Participants’
demographic data in addition to their reasons for and attitudes toward smoking were obtained. Frequency,
distribution and factor analysis of attitude items followed by a varimax rotation was used to evaluate the
attitudinal statements.
Results: From 1750 university students, who filled our questionnaire, 31% were ever smokers (51% males
and 15% females) and 11% were current smokers (21.5% males and 2% females). Avoiding depression and
taking pleasure were the reasons mentioned as important reasons the most frequently. Besides, the most
frequently attitudinal statements were as follows:” My parents upset knowing my habit” and “Cigarette causes
disease”. Furthermore, the mean score of encouraging attitudes was significantly higher among males, current
smokers and those with a tendency toward cigarette smoking.
Conclusion: This study confirmed that addressing attitudes toward smoking while developing preventive
strategies against it among university students is an obvious necessity.

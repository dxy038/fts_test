This paper proposes a DC-DC converter that can be used in battery equalization and charging and discharging applications. The proposed topology is a high frequency (&#8805; 5 MHz) resonant bidirectional SEPIC DC-DC converter. The resonant technology and high frequency operation will allow the size and cost of a battery equalizer to be reduced because of the ability to reduce the size of the magnetic components. The topology of the DC-DC converter is proposed, analyzed, and realized, and then verified by simulation and experimental results. It is shown that this converter can obtain an efficiency that is greater than 81%.

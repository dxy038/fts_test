In this study, a computation-aware scheme for motion estimation (ME) in H.264 is proposed. The objective of the proposed scheme is to distribute the available ME computation power of H.264 video encoding to get better coding efficiency. In this study, the temporal motion vector prediction technique is used to get the predicted motion vectors (PMVs) of macroblocks. The sum of absolute components of the PMVs of all the macroblocks of a video frame helps to allocate the available computation power (CP_FM) to the frame and then CP_FM is distributed to all the macroblocks of the frame. As compared with some existing schemes, the proposed scheme usually has the better performance in most simulation cases.

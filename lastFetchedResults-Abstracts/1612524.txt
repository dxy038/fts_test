The quinoid pigments phthiocol, produced byMycobacterium tuberculosis,and pyocyanine, produced byPseudomonas aeruginosa,were examined for their effects on[formula]production in cultured human lung epithelial-like A549 cells. Intracellular[formula]levels were measured using the[formula]-sensitive aconitase(s), and rates of[formula]generation were assessed from rates of antimycin-resistant respiration. Elevated[formula]was detected in cells exposed to &lt;25 μmphthiocol and &lt;2 μmpyocyanine in neutral pH medium, and both agents impaired cell growth. The[formula]scavenging manganoporphyrin, Mn(III)TMPyP, partially protected cells against pyocyanine and phthiocol-mediated growth inhibition.[formula]production by phthiocol and pyocyanine was enhanced by acidification of the growth medium. Surprisingly, the dicumarol-inhibitable quinoid detoxification enzyme DT-diaphorase was a significant source of phthiocol and pyocyanine-mediated[formula]generation in cells.[formula]production in macrophages by the phthiocol analog, menadione, was shown to impair macrophage mitochondrial respiration and bactericidal activity towardEscherichia coli.Phthiocol and pyocyanine, by producing[formula]/H2O2, and inhibiting host cell aconitase activity, energetics, and other host cell functions, may contribute to the pathogenicity ofM. tuberculosisandP. aeruginosa.

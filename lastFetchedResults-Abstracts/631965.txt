Introduction: Multiple sclerosis disease is the result of delimitation of central nervous system which can harm fatigue is among the most common symptom of Multiple Sclerosis. Although exercise is administered to Multiple Sclerosis patients, comparison type of exercise on the fatigue level has not been established.
Objective: This research has been conducted to evaluate the effect of stretching with aerobic on fatigue levels in Multiple Sclerosis patients.
Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, sample included 80 MS patients referring to MS society in Tehran who were chosen by simple sampling according to inclusion criteria and were randomly divided into two groups (stretching with aerobics and control group).  Data gathering tool included a two part questionnaire covering demographic variables, disease related information and fatigue severity scales (FSS).  Exercise was done for six weeks (18 sessions) and immediately after sessions completed, fatigue severity was measured by FSS. The gathered data was analyzed using statistical method: chi-square, paired& independent T, Analysis of covariance by SPSS software.
Results: Findings showed severe fatigue (35%), moderate and slight fatigue (12.5%) before stretching and aerobics. But most samples (92.5%) had slight fatigue after stretching and aerobics and in control group most samples (40%) remained in the state of before study. The Independent T-Test showed a significant difference between two groups' severity of fatigue (P < 0.001). 
Conclusion: Aerobics with stretching is very effective in reducing fatigue. Perhaps aerobics with stretching in addition to increasing energy relieves muscle spasms and decreases harm and also increases flexibility and decreases fatigue.

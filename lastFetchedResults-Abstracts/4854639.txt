Constraint Programming (CP) developed as a computer science technology which employs developments in artificial intelligence and computer programming languages. Recently, research interest in combining constraint programming with mathematical programming arose. This paper discusses integration of CP and mathematical programming for a particular class of multi-objective planning and scheduling problems arising in emergency management. Three classical objectives involved in the problems: the cost, the tardiness, and the makespan. Efficient solutions for the multiple objective function problem are determined using convex combinations of the classical objectives. The integrated algorithm solved the problems with runtimes several orders of magnitude better than other approaches.

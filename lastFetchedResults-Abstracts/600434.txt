Atypical and unusual presentations of tuberculosis have become a major diagnostic problem for health professionals. We describe a 30-year-old male patient with a tuberculosis abscess in the teres minor muscle. The patient was initially misdiagnosed due to this unusual presentation and the definitive diagnosis was only made after the histological examination of the drainage material. The patient responded to the anti-tuberculosis therapy and there was no recurrence after 4 years.

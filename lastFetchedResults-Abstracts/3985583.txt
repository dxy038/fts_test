Thirty years ago, IEEE Potentials was initiated as a new IEEE student magazine. The title was selected to indicate that a major objective of the magazine was to encourage you to achieve your highest personal potential level of success. Though your focus is on your formal academic opportunities, you will achieve greater career success when you look beyond the present and start planning your future now.

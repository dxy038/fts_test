A hybrid multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) scheme combines line commutated converter and voltage source converter technologies for HVDC transmission system. This study presents a comprehensive design of wide-area power oscillation damper (POD) controller for the hybrid MTDC system. The process consists of input/output selection and parameter tuning for the POD of the hybrid MTDC based on the linearised black-box model. The objective is to choose an effective control loop to damp the critical mode, which does not have negative impacts on the other modes in the system. For this purpose, a new index, named relative joint interaction index, is proposed for the input/output selection. Afterward, the parameter of POD is tuned using residue-based phase compensation technique because of its practical application. Finally, non-linear simulations are also carried out to verify the effectiveness of the designed POD in different loading conditions.

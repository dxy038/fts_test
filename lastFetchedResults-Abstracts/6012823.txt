Based on the inchworm driving principle, this paper presents a new precision giant magnetostrictive piezoelectric hybrid actuator using giant magnetostrictive actuator (GMA) as the displacement drive mechanism and piezoelectric stack as the clamping mechanism, introduces the movement mechanism and control mode of the hybrid actuator, designs a drive controller, determines the working parameters and driving timing of the actuator and carries out performance test to the actuator prototype under the control of the controller. The test results show that the hybrid actuator has good output linearity and can achieve precision positioning of bidirectional movement, variable speed and continuously adjustable single-step displacement.

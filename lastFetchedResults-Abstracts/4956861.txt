In the paper a static analysis of key grip is presented. Objective deals with estimating maximal pinch force required to secure objects in the human hand system. A three- dimensional static computational biomechanical model was developed. This model is based on fingers anatomy, kinematics and numerical optimization technique. The optimization module permits to predict the optimal combination of tendon tensions that maximize pinch force for a given pinch posture. The key pinch output force is presented in the case of the healthy, the pathological and the reconstructed index and thumb fingers.

Based on the integration application of decision-making methods a synthetic dynamic multi-criteria decision-making model is presented. Considering the decision characters of the multi-criteria decision-making problems, by normalizing the attribute data, a linear changing operator in [-1, 1] is introduced, which is easy to compute and be applied in practice; for representing both subjective and objective information, the Delphi method and the entropy method are integrated to calculate the attribute weights; a new kind of relative closeness is obtained by combining the Euclidean distance with grey correlation degree; in order to embody the dynamic variability of the attributes, the influence of time is also analysed fully. Finally an example is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed decision-making model

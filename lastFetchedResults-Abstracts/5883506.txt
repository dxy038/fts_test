The implementation of a combined flow control and optimal routing algorithm in packet switched networks is discussed. An analysis is made of the influence of various objective functions on maximum link utilization, average packet delay and fairness. How the parameters in the proposed objective function affect network performance measures like the flow in the entire network, amount of rejected traffic, maximum link utilization, average packet delay, and unfairness among users is studied. These measures are evaluated for various networks and traffic configurations, and, on the basis of these studies and results, suggestions are made for obtaining the best network performance and utilization

This paper describes a bidirectional switch commutation strategy for a three-phase to two-phase matrix converter supplying a series resonant load. Classical modulation techniques are not applicable because of the needed high output frequencies. This fact, together with the different topology compared to classical three-phase to three-phase matrix converters, makes a new investigation of commutation principles necessary. The paper shows that the three-phase to two-phase resonant matrix converter can be compared with the full-bridge series-resonant converter. Thus, the commutation of the full-bridge series-resonant converter gives the conditions for the bidirectional switch commutation at the matrix converter. One of the main benefits of the derived strategy is the minimization of commutation steps independent of the load current sign.

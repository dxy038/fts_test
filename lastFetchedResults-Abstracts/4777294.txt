The impulse response of pulse shaper affects the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of transmitted signals in UWB system. In this paper, we present a new design method of pulse shaper based on chebyshev function approximation and Remez algorithm. An arbitrary real or complex-valued impulse response may be approximated and notch is designed flexibly with proposed method. The novel pulse shaper can support dynamic avoidance of narrow-band interference better. Matlab simulation results showed that the PSD of the pulse based on chebyshev function approximation meets the power constraint of the objective spectral mask. The comparison were presented for the bit error rate performance analyses of the pulse position modulation time hopping ultra wideband impulse radio communication system employing the pulse and the second derivative Gaussian pulse in the additive white Gaussian noise channel. The performance of the pulse is better than the second derivative Gaussian pulse.

This paper addresses the resource management problem in a distributed video-on-demand (VOD) system. The objective of resource management is to manage video objects in a VOD system and balance the load among video servers. In order to achieve this objective, several research approaches such as allocation, video server selection, replication, and cache management are considered. These approaches take the video objectsÂ´ characteristics and system load into consideration to achieve good performance in terms of the ability to balance the load among video servers and to minimize the delay for video requests to be served

The increasing demand of tourists to visit natural attractions, historical sites,
cultural and religion places provides a fertile ground for the development of
tourism. Having unique capabilities such as a plenty of natural and historical
attractions, Iran is able to develop tourism. To attract more tourists, there is a
need to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these capabilities. This study
aimed to positioning of Iran's historical sites by important/performance analysis
and perceptual mapping approach from tourists' point of view. In terms of
objective, this research is an applied research, and in terms of data collection, it
can be classified as a descriptive survey. Statistical population is foreign tourists
who have visited each of the three historical sites, i.e. Persepolis, Aali Qapu, and
Jame Mosque of Isfahan. Based on the literature review, a questionnaire of 23
features related to historical sites was designed to evaluate the importance and
satisfaction related to the sites. Data were analyzed using SPSS16, and the
perceptual map was drawn using MATLAB (R2009a). Using exploratory factor
analysis, the features were classified into seven key factors. Utilizing
importance-satisfaction analysis, the perceptual map of the three sites was
drawn. The results showed that the position of these sites is almost alike. Both
hygienic and information factors are main weaknesses of the three sites, while
attractiveness and accessibility are the strengths of the sites. Also all the three
sites have weaknesses in eating and resting, and music factors.

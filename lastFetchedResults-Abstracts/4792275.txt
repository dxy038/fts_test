Minimally invasive surgery demands the development and maintenance of the specialized surgeonÂ´s psychomotor skills. These skills can be measured objectively through hybrid and virtual training systems. Of which, the most advanced, integrates force feedback systems and augmented reality graphics.

In this article, we propose a computerized system for an objective evaluation, which can be integrated into any physical trainer at a low cost.

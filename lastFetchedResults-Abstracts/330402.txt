Objective: In this study a simple non-contact method was developed to measure the polymerization shrinkage of dental composites.

Methods: A gas pycnometer was used to determine the volumes of specimens prior to and after photopolymerization and from which the total volumetric shrinkage could be determined.

Results: Four commercial composites were studied and were found to have polymerization shrinkages varying from 1.6 to 2.5%. The method was found to be labour efficient and produced reproducible results with a standard deviation of approximately 10%.

Significance: This method is appropriate for shrinkage measurements where only the total amount shrinkage is required and in particular for the measurement of shrinkage of photocured materials which are sensitive to water absorption.

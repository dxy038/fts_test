Legalization is one of the most critical steps in modern placement designs. Since several objectives like wirelength, routability, or temperature are already optimized in global placement stage, the objective of legalization is not only to align the cells overlap-free to the rows, but also to preserve the solution of global placement, i.e., the displacement of cells needs to be minimized. However, minimizing displacement only is not enough for current timing-driven SoC designs. Blind displacement minimization may increase the half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) of nets significantly that degrades the chip performance. In this paper, we propose a fast legalization algorithm for standard cell placement with simultaneous wirelength and displacement minimization. The main contributions of our work are: (1) a fast row selection technique by using k-medoid clustering approach; (2) an exact linear wirelength model to minimize both wirelength and total displacement; (3) a constant time approach to determine the median in trial placement stage. Compared with the state-of-the-art legalization algorithms, experimental results show that our legalizer acquires much better achievement in terms of HPWL, total and maximum displacements, and running time on legalized NTUplace3 global placement results on both ISPD 2005 and 2006 placement contest benchmarks.

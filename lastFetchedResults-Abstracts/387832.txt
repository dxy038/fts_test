Because thiacetazone has been linked with serious adverse cutaneous reactions, we undertook 1 year of systematic surveillance for cutaneous thiacetazone-associated adverse reactions within the national tuberculosis programme of Tanzania.

For individual cases, we collected information on age, sex, interval between commencing thiacetazone-containing treatment and occurrence of adverse reaction, most severe clinical presentation (toxic epidermal necrolysis, rash without necrolysis, itching without rash), and outcome (dead or alive) within 2 weeks of onset. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done of variables relevant to outcome. 1273 patients with adverse reactions were reported. The frequency of fatal outcome from any cutaneous reaction was 3·1 per 1000 among all tuberculosis patients, and 19·1% among patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis. About 60% of all adverse reactions and deaths occurred within 20 days of starting thiacetazone.

Case fatality from adverse cutaneous reactions was considerably less frequent than reported previously, suggesting that improved management might allow retention of thiacetazone in the armamentarium of national tuberculosis programmes even where infection with HIV is prevalent.

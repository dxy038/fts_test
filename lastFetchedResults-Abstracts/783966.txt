Objective To examine whether levels of physical activity
or sedentary activity are risk factors for the development of
depressive symptoms in early adolescence.
Methods A representative sample of 2,464 12- to 15-
year-old adolescents living in the middle of Norway was
assessed twice, during the years 1998 (T1) and 1999/2000
(T2). The attrition rate was 4.3%. We assessed depressive
symptoms (using the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire,
MFQ) and levels of physical and sedentary activities at
baseline and follow-up. Various potentially confounding
factors, including demographic factors, were assessed at
baseline.
Results The MFQ scores at T1 were cross-sectionally
associated with low levels of vigorous exercise. A possible
buffering effect of vigorous exercise on the relationship
between stressful life events and depression was demonstrated.
In longitudinal analysis low levels of vigorous
exercise and high levels of sedentary activities (boys only)
predicted a high score (MFQ C 25) at T2.
Conclusions Low levels of vigorous exercise and high
levels of sedentary activities (boys only) constituted independent
risk factors for the development of a high level of
depressive symptoms in a 1-year study of young adolescents.
This knowledge should be considered by policy makers,
preventative services, and health-care professionals

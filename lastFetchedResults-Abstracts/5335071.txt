The conventional way to implement a bidirectional converter with boost/buck has been to use two general purpose PWM ICs with a single supply voltage In this case, when one direction mode is in operation, the other is disabled and the output of the error amplifier of the disabled IC may be saturated to a maximum value or zero. Therefore, during mode transition, a circuit which can disable the switching operation for a certain time interval is required making it impossible to get a seamless transition. In this paper, the limitations of the conventional 42V/14V bi-directional DC/DC converter implemented with general current mode PWM ICs with a single supply voltage are reviewed and a new current mode PWM controller circuit with an dual voltage system is proposed. The validity of the proposed circuit is investigated through simulation, and experiments

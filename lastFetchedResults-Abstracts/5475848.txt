Mining systems have complex power networks including high-power equipment, variable configuration and distributed harmonic injections. This paper presents the problem of resonance mitigation and dynamical behavior of a power system with harmonic filters (HF) for improving reliability in mining plants. It is known that the main objective of the harmonic filters is to provide power factor correction and limiting the harmonic distortions. Nevertheless, until now it is not well covered in the literature that HF also provides mitigation of impedance resonances. Simulation results obtained of the transient behavior analysis of industrial electrical system when harmonic filters are switched are presented, with good correlation between steady and transient behavior, supporting the results given by tools intended for stationary analysis of harmonics performance. Different operating conditions of an industrial power system given by variable topology, multiple harmonic injections and loading factor should be taken into account for the proper design of HF systems. The presented methodology supports the risk assessment, failure analysis and reliability improvement of industrial systems as well as the decision making process at the design stage of power systems

Today, competitive advantages of businesses with various products are
dependent on a competitive analysis and developing a relevant strategy. One of
the effective frameworks by which one can assess business portfolios is the
General Electric (GE) Matrix, which itself focuses on two aspects namely
market attractiveness and the business strengths. Therefore, this study asks
what is the contribution of each of Chabahar Fishery Cluster’s business units,
as far as the competitive advantages and relevant strategies of each unit are
concerned? The objective of the study is then defined as how to identify the
gap between market attractiveness in fishing industry and potentials of
Chabahar Fishery Cluster and to provide appropriate strategies in line with the
GE Matrix. Chabahar Fishery Cluster’s managers have been chosen as the
target statistical population of the study. Marketing Management software is
used to analyze data and results show those units which produced canned fish
enjoyed better positions among other parts of the Cluster.

The Wireless over Cable (WoC) paradigm is a new technique to enable distributed antennas systems. WoC is based on the relay of radio frequency wireless signals over a cable infrastructure through a bidirectional (analog) amplify and forward device that translates the bandwidth of wireless signals to comply with the specifications of the wired links. Following the WoC concept, here the xDSL connection in femtocell architecture is replaced with a plain connection of the antenna with telephone lines after up/down-frequency conversion to enable Radio over Telephone Lines. Baseband processing and radio resource management is carried out simultaneously for multiple femtocells thus centralizing scheduling and mitigation of the radio frequency interference among neighboring femtocells. We propose the envisioned Radio over Telephone Lines architecture for femtocells and get insights into the hindrances of propagation over twisted pair copper lines via numerical analysis by employing OFDMA signals over the air interface (WiMAX/LTE) that coexist (and interfere) with xDSL services.

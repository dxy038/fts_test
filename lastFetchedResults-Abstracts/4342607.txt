The objective of this article is to model and implement a learner supervision system during a remote session of practical works (PW). This system will serve the users (learners, teachers, tutors) of our virtual laboratory during the assistance and evaluation process. It also makes it possible for the teachers to be aware of the progress status of the work. Another characteristic is added, it is a question of designing a model for the average learner based on his/her actions and reactions. The functionalities supported by this system are: the supervision in real-time (teachers and learners are connected simultaneously), supervision in differed time (using the activitiesÂ´ history) and guiding the learners.

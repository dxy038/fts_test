This paper introduces the concept of Network Supported Collaborative Work (NSCW) and its transport design based on the emerging standard of MPEG Media Transport (MMT). Based on extra-high quality 4K video technologies, NSCW is being developed to realize effective remote-collaboration for business workspaces. MMT specifies technologies for the delivery of coded media data for multimedia services over the concatenation of heterogeneous packet based network segments including bidirectional IP networks and unidirectional digital broadcasting networks. One of the core technologies for delivery is forward error correction (FEC) codes. Simulation results using our proposed MMT FEC codes show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

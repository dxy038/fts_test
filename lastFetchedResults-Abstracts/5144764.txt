Under the title Continuing Electrical Engineering Education-Computer Based Training a project was developed in 1993/94 by nine European partners from Portugal, The Netherlands and Belgium. The project, funded by the European Union through the EUROFORM Programme, has as its main objective the development of ten experimental CBT products in the area of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, aimed at the Continuing Education market, rather than the classical University environment. This paper is divided into two main parts: The first describes the development process and the multi-media and hypermedia characteristics of the products; the second explains the consortium building and project management. Intermediate versions of some products are shown

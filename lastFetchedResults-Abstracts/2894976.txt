This paper assesses the 3D sound IP phone service (3D IP phone) developed by the authors under environment with multiple sound sources by experiment. The assessment consists of evaluation of the sound source localization, subjective evaluation and objective one. The authors utilize two sound sources that are conversations carried on by a man and a woman. From the experimental results, this paper shows that multiple sound sources can promote listenerÂ´s reproduction of sound images. This means that the proposed system can give the higher feeling of being in more real environment.

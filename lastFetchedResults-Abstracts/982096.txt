Background: The People believe that herbal medicines are not toxic, but the toxicity of these drugs are reported to be seen.
Objective: Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate hepatic and renal toxicity is Chelidonium majus hydroalcoholic extract.
Methods: In this study, 35 male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups (n=7), control group with normal diet and sham group with fat diet and experimental groups of animals hypercholesterolemia that received the minimum dose of 100, averaged 200 and maximum dose of 300 mg/kg hydroalcoholic extract Chelidonium majus (that collected from farms in the North of the country) by gavage. After this Period (21 days), blood samples were drawn and levels of liver alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), albumin and total Protein as well as renal creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured. The data obtained were analyzed using SPSS version 17.
Results: The ALT was not seen any significant changes between the groups treated with the extract. AST, albumin, total Protein and creatinine increased, but the amount of ALP decreased significantly in high dose of extract. BUN in groups receiving the at least extract dose was not shown any significant changes compared to the control group but Cholesterol had a decreased significant changes at same dose compared to the control group (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: Since the amount of AST, albumin and creatinine extract the maximum dose is increased, especially at doses appear to extract Chelidonium majus have high toxic effects on the liver and kidneys.

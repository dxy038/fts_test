The concepts of fortification and partial interdiction have not been considered
concurrently in previous studies. In this paper, we added the fortification and partial 
interdiction concepts to interdiction problem for the first time; the reason is that in 
interdiction situations, defenders decide to protect some important facilities according to their 
budgets, and attackers like to destroy most unprotected facilities according to their resources, 
and therefore, to cripple the defenders' systems. Moreover, we use the advantages of 
credibility-based fuzzy mathematical programming and introduce an integrated model based on 
uncertainty contexts. In this bi-objective model, decision-maker gives satisfaction degrees for 
constraints, and then we use the interactive possibility model to solve the bi-objective model with 
varying confidence levels. These confidence levels specify the knowledge of attacker and defender 
about themselves. In addition, we propose Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the suggested model. In 
the experiments, we generate problem instances and solve  them by Multi-Objective  
Mixed-Integer  Non-Linear  Programming (MOMINLP) and the proposed genetic algorithm for various settings.

Mobility Load Balancing (MLB) and Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO) are two important functions in Long Term Evolved (LTE) cellular mobile networks. They are closely related because they both adjust handover parameters to achieve their respective objective. But some conflicts may occur if both of the two functions work inconsistently and adjust the same parameter in opposite directions. This will result in huge resource waste, and both of them will not work efficiently. In this paper, we present a scheme embedded in MLB based on the cell load to solve the conflict problem. Analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme works efficiently and improves the performance of the network.

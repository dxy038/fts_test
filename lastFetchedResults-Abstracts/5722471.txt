The performance of the bidirectional transmission of a bundle of OFDM-based signals providing integrated wireless and wired services in next generation long-reach PONs is evaluated experimentally. Particularly, the main long-reach PONs impairments of the downstream and upstream links employing external and direct modulation, respectively, and the crosstalk induced in the bundle of OFDM signals is experimentally evaluated and discussed. Guidelines for long-reach PONs attaining maximum coverage area are provided as well.

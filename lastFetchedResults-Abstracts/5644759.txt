Human resources are the primary resources of an enterprise. Personnel training can cultivate core competence and achieve the success. In view of the existing fuzziness and randomness in the training effect comprehensive evaluation, an index system, which comprises the first class indices such as training condition, training management and training effect, was put forward; and then a two stage fuzzy assessment model for training effect evaluation was established by applying the theory of fuzzy mathematics. The concept of AHP model was also used so as to obtain the objective weight of each index and avoid subjective effect. This method not only improves the scientificalness and objectivity on training effect evaluation by quantitative computation, which provides theoretical basis for making a clearer training aim and further improvement on training quality.

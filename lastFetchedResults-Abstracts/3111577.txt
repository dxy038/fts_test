Recently, the author was funded through the National Science Foundation to develop a Real-time Control Laboratory. The objective of this new project is to substantially improve the instructional capability of undergraduate instruction in real-time system analysis and control. In addition, the great flexibility of microprocessors in both single and multi-loop control actions offers the students a more versatile means of design and experimentation. In this paper the design, development and implementation of this control educational project is reported.

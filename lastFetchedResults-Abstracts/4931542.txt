An optimal design of state feedback controller as an UPFC using immune genetic algorithm (IGA) is presented. The potential of the UPFC supplementary state feedback controllers to enhance the dynamic stability is evaluated. The selection of the state feedback gains for the UPFC controllers is converted to an optimization problem with the time domain-based objective function which is solved by an IGA. The effectiveness of the new controller is demonstrated through time-domain simulation studies. The results of these studies show that the designed controller has an excellent capability in damping power system oscillations.

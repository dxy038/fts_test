The primary objective of this work is to introduce a gear ratio selection strategy for a CVT equipped vehicle and show
its effectiveness on the fuel consumption reduction. AFuzzy control algorithm is designed for this purpose. Anonlinear
model is developed for simulating the longitudinal vehicle dynamics with accelerator pedal applied by the driver as an
input. In order that pedal input values can be used for evaluation of control strategy, a pedal cycle concept was
introduced. With the help of these cycles different driving conditions were simulated and the fuel consumption results
were obtained using Advisor software. Results showed that the control system was successful in reducing the fuel
consumption, especially in low acceleration driving cycles

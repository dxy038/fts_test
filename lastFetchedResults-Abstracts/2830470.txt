Pulsed electron beam generation requires high power pulses of fast rise, short duration pulse with flat top. With this objective we have designed a low cost compact pulsed power driver based on water dielectric transmission line. The paper describes the design aspects and construction of the pulse power driver and its experimental results. The pulsed power driver consist of a capacitor bank and its charging power supply, high voltage generator, high voltage switch and pulse compression system.

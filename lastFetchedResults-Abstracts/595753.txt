Strabismus is an eye deviation, when both eyes cannot be directed at the same time towards the object that is being viewed. Strabismus is observed in approximately 25% of children under 3 years of age, and in approximately 3% of all children. There were 77 patients involved in this study, with Esotropia alternans, that had surgical operations at the Ophthalmology Clinic, University Clinical Centre of Kosova (UCCK), from 2005-2006. Patients were divided in two groups: 1. Researched group - involving 33 patients that had surgical interventions for weakening the functions of the inner straight muscle in both eyes, and 2. Control Group - involving 44 patients that had surgical interventions in one eye intervening in two muscles with contrary actions - the inner straight muscle, weakening it in retro position, and the outer straight muscle, strengthening its function through myectomy. Medium value of the objective angle after the operation, in distance of 6 meters, in the patients with Esotropia alternans from the Experimental group was 6.5 A dyoptry (standard deviation 1.9 A dyoptry). In the Control Group, the medium value of the objective angle was 9.3 A dyoptry (standard deviation 3.6 A dyoptry), with significant distinction (p< 0.01). There were 16.9% patients with Esotropia alternans who had complications during the operation. In the Experimental group, complication occurred in 4 patients, or 12.1% during the surgery. It the Control Group, complications were observed in 9 patients, or 20.5%, without significant difference between the groups.

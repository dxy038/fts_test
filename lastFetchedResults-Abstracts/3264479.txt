Second language acquisition is important for culture exchange, business, and politics. Arabic language is a Semitic language that used in twenty Middle East countries as an official language of hundreds of millions of people and considered as the religious language for all Muslims of various ethical and cultural backgrounds. Although there is much care of Arabic language traditionally, a lot of dictionaries and linguistics books in paper format and electronic versions are produced. Surprisingly little has been done in the field of computerized language and lexical resources as complete and finalized products. Scholars and researchers in the field of teaching Arabic for non-native speakers are doing great efforts but there is a lack of well defined framework for teaching Arabic as second language electronically and online basis. Most of these works are either incomplete, non well-designed, or there is a drawback of the pedagogy or syllabus completeness and fitness. Therefore, an attractive system for teaching Arabic as second language has been proposed based on the online self-learning and self-assessment concepts. The objective is to cut out the distance, time and financial obstacles among the interested learners to ensure the easiness of learning Arabic language by designing simple and attractive systems.

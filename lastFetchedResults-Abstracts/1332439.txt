The objective of the current study is the optimization of the structure and manufacturing processes of large composite plastic parts. The main attention is paid to strengthening of plastic preformed shell by adding variable thickness glassâ€“fiber composite layers and optimizing the material concentrations of the reinforcement layer. The final properties of the part are determined by minimizing the cost and production time simultaneously. The multistage optimization procedure has been applied. According to this approach, the solution of the posed optimization problem has been decomposed into FEA (including free size optimization), meta-modeling and global optimization. Multiple criteria analysis (MCA) is used for evaluating decision options against multiple criteria. Search for global optimum has been performed using of genetic algorithm. The solution has been implemented in MATLAB code. The product family of the composite plastic bathtub, together with the derivate products and their production technologies, is designed using proposed methodology.

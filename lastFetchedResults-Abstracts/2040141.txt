people. The objective of this research was to examine the effect of an interventional training program
on fall-related psychological factors among the elderly men in Arak. Materials & Methods In this quasi experiment research on male older adults in Arak, 27 participants
randomly assigned to Control group (mean age=70.21±6.65) and Experimental group (mean
age=66.07±4.38). Experimental group members participated in a 12 week interventional training program. Results The findings showed that training intervention program improved fall-related psychological factors
(Fall Self-Efficacy/Fear of Fall and Activities-specific Balance Confidence/Balance Self-Efficacy) in experimental
group. No significant changes appeared in fall-related psychological factors in control group
members who did not perform any regular training program. Conclusion According to the findings, regular interventional training program can decrease fear of fall
and increase balance confidence in performing the activities of everyday life by improving physical and
motor fitness levels . These improvements can lead to physical and psychological health, increase in

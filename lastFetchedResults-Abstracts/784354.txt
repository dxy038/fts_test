Objective. This study examines the sex-specific associations of plasma concentrations of iron, copper,
and zinc with cognitive function in older community-dwelling adults. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting:
1988-92 follow-up clinic visit. Participants: 602 men and 849 women (average age=75 ±8 years) who were
community-dwelling and not clinically demented. Measurements: Blood samples were assayed for trace elements
and 12 cognitive function tests were administered. Sex-specific analyses were adjusted for age, education,
alcohol consumption, smoking, exercise, and estrogen use in women. Results. Men and women differed
significantly in education and alcohol intake (p’s<0.001), concentrations of plasma iron, copper and zinc
(p’s<0.001) and scores on 11 of 12 cognitive function tests (p=0.04 to <0.001). Regression analyses showed
significant inverted U-shaped associations in men; both low and high iron levels were associated with poor
performance on total and long-term recall and Serial 7’s (p’s=0.018, 0.042 and 0.004, respectively) compared to
intermediate concentrations. In women, iron and copper concentrations had inverse linear associations with
Buschke total, long and short-term recall and Blessed scores (p’s<0.05). Zinc was positively associated with
performance on Blessed Items (p=0.008). Analyses comparing cognitive function using categorically defined
mineral concentrations yielded similar sex specific results. Conclusion. Optimal trace element concentrations
may exist for optimal cognitive function in older adults, and these levels may differ by sex and cognitive function
domain.

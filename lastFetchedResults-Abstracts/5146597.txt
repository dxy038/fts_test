This paper works toward the development of visual servo based robotic system. The objective is to control the relative position and orientation between a robotÂ´s gripper and an object using a single camera mounted on the manipulator. The feature-based visual servoing control algorithm is used, which continually updates the pose of the robot relative to the object by using the differential changes in image plane. The total system consists of Yasukawa SK6 manipulator, PC based controller, F/64-PCI frame grabber. The PC based controller includes PMAC2 motion control board, Quad amplifier and Win 95 OS environment

Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of intraparotid botulinum toxin-A (BTX-A) injections into parotid gland using ultrasound-guided versus nonguided techniques for the treatment of sialorrhoea in patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). Methods: 15 patients with PD and sialorrhoea were included and divided into two groups. Group A patients (n=8) were injected with BTX-A using ultrasound guidance. Group B patients (n=7) were injected with BTX-A without ultrasound guidance. Saliva secretion was assessed quantitatively at baseline and at weeks 1, 4, and 12. Patients and/or caregivers also assessed the saliva secretion using visual analog scale (VAS). Results: All patients except one reported subjective improvement in sialorrhoea at the first week. Group A patients showed significantly higher rate of saliva reduction at the first week, whereas in Group B the reduction was not statistically significant from baseline at the first week (P>0.05). Comparisons of quantitative saliva assessments at each follow-up visit also showed that ultrasound-guided injections were superior to blind injections for saliva reduction. VAS scores showed an improvement in the mean rate of saliva secretion in each group at first week (P<0.05). Two patients suffered from dry mouth in mild severity lasting 1 month. Conclusion: Intraparotid BTX-A injections using ultrasound guidance may be an effective, easy, and safe treatment for parkinsonian sialorrhoea.

A battery power system can be assembled by a number of battery power modules (BPMs) to higher voltage and current in addition to provide a higher sustainable energy. In which, the battery sets are equipped with associated power electronic converters to regulate the conversion power as well as the output voltage and current. When a bidirectional power converter is adopted in a BPM the battery set is charged and discharged through the same port. Three bidirectional dc-to-dc converters used for BPMs are analyzed. The charging and discharging operations are illustrated by an exemplar battery power source with four serial boost/buck type BPMs.

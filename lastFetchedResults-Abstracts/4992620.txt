This paper discusses, first, the use of a research project as a didactic material for laboratory practices. The objective of TOLLA project (http://tolla.upc.edu) is to develop ecological models for simulate the behaviour of environmental variables (phytoplankton, zooplankton, nutrients, egestion...) in a set of ponds in the Technical University Campus. This experience will be shifted to the classroom in form of laboratory practices for the subjects related with simulation and modelling in different engineering degrees, because we have the belief that undergraduate students must receive an education for the sustainability independently of their career. The paper also discusses the use of easy Java simulations software to implement the models, their views and the simulations, in an easy-to-use and interactive programming environment that generates standalone Java applications or applets, or in conjunction with Matlab/Simulink

Theoretical gear calculations and coordinate measuring machines have been combined to provide an objective, quantitative method for inspecting bevel gears. Errors between the actual surface and the theoretical surface are measured in this way. Changes in the cutting or grinding machine setup are required to bring the errors within an acceptable tolerance. The deviations of the real tooth surfaces from the theoretical one is determined by measuring date processing. A general surface can be expressed in terms of a polynomial and subdivided by rank into first, second and progressively higher orders. The sensitivity of these first and second order terms for the changes of machine settings is analyzed. The corrective machine setting was developed using this concept. The proposed ideas are proven by grinding the convex flank of gear for a pair of spiral bevel gears; the cutting machine settings are adjusted for twice and bring the errors within an acceptable tolerance. This paper presents a method for adjusting the cutting machine settings and provides an effective method of improving designing level, quality of products.

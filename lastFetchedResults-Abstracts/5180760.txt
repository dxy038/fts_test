Quantitative analysis of morphological parameters in clinical diagnosis is more efficient than qualitative analysis. But since the absorptivity of tumour is similar with the tissues around it, and the X-ray image of osteoma has inhomogeneous illumination, the edge of disease area is not clear, traditional edge detection algorithms are not successfully used. In this paper, we apply a radial search algorithm to detect the edge of osteoma. As shown in experiments the extracted edge by this algorithm is true, and the edge possesses accurate location and good continuity. It is suited for quantitative analysis of X-ray image of osteoma, the results provide scientific and objective evidences for clinic diagnosis and cure

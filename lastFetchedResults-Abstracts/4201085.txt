Next generation wireless networks environment consists of heterogeneous wireless technologies, offering mobility service. The objective is to exploit the popularity and the high data rates offered by wireless networks such as WiFi (wireless fidelity) or WiMAX (worldwide interoperability for microwave access) to enhance cellular services i.e. UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System). In this context, mobile terminal has to make several handoff decisions while moving between these technologies. In this paper we propose using the emerging IEEE802.21 standard defines Media Independent Handover (MIH) functions as transport service in order to offer a vertical handoff decision with a minimum of processing delay.

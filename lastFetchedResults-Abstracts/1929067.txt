The objective of the present study was to analyse the association between repeat breeding (RB) in gilts/sows and their subsequent reproductive performance as well as the impact of interactions between repeat breeding and factors like parity number, boar breed, season and mating type (MT) on subsequent reproductive performance in Swedish Landrace (L) and Swedish Yorkshire (Y) sows. Data analysed included 7040 sows (3654 L and 3386 Y), farrowing during January 1994 until December 1999 in 11 L and 8 Y nucleus herds. The study was assigned as a cohort design and the aim was to study gilts/sows from their first mating as gilts until mating after third parity. Analysis of variance was applied to continuous data and logistic regression was applied to categorical data. Percentages of litters as a result of repeat breeding in sow parities 1â€“3 were 6.1, 12.0 and 6.3% for L sows and 6.7, 13.1 and 7.4% for Y sows. For parity 3, the incidence of litters resulting from repeat breeding was significantly higher (P&lt;0.001) in Y than in L sows. The proportion of irregular return to oestrus (&gt;24 days after first mating) was higher (P&lt;0.01) in primiparous sows than in multiparous sows (69% versus 61%). On average, litters resulting from repeat breeding were larger (P&lt;0.001) than litters resulting from non-repeat breeding (NR) (about 0.5 piglets per litter) in both L and Y sows. For Y sows, if the previous litter was a result of repeat breeding, the subsequent reproductive cycle had 2.7% higher RR (P&lt;0.05) and 2.4% lower FR (N.S.) compared with sows that were not repeat bred. The same trend was found in L sows (1.4% higher RR and 1.3% lower FR) but the differences were not significant. Among the sows removed from the herds, about 24% of L and 28% of Y were culled due to reproductive problems (gilts not included). In addition, a number of sows from these nucleus herds were also culled due to low breeding value and poor conformation.

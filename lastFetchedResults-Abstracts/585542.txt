The bi-objective warehouse problem in a crisp environment is often
not eective in dealing with the imprecision or vagueness in the values of
the problem parameters. To deal with such situations, several researchers have
proposed that the parameters be represented as fuzzy numbers. We describe
a new algorithm for fuzzy bi-objective warehouse problem using a ranking
function followed by an application of tabu search. The method is illustrated
on a numerical example, demonstrating the eectiveness of the tabu search
method. Numerical results are compared for both fuzzy and crisp versions of
the problem.

A new ZVS-ZCS bidirectional DC-DC converter is proposed, which provides high output voltages 80v-180v. With proposed ZVS-ZCS concept, the MATLAB simulation results of the application to a fuel cell and battery application have been obtained and compared with those of ZVS bidirectional and applications in order to show the excellent performance of the proposed concept. In addition to this experimental setup has been developed. The experimental results are compared with the simulation results.

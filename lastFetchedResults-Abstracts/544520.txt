Abstract
The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of aminosilane coupling agent on properties of UF and MF-bonded wheat straw boards. The hydrolyzed silane coupling agent was sprayed on fine particles of wheat straw, and blended with UF and MF resins to produce the straw boards. The results showed that the aminosilane had significant effect on improvement of physical and mechanical properties of straw boards so that the internal bond strength was increased significantly by adding the aminosilane up to 2% and 5%. Also thickness swelling significantly decreased at up to 2% silane content, but significant effect was not observed at above 2%. The high-property boards could be contributed to the improvement of bondability between particles and resins for the surface treatment of wheat straw particles by silane coupling agent. The aminosilane had no significant effect on bending strength whereas the bending strength and thickness swelling of MF-bonded boards were improved significantly, because of higher amine groups in melamine formaldehyde resin compared to urea formaldehyde resin.

The objective of this study was to assess the value of MR imaging in the differentiation between a recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and a radiation-induced hepatic injury. Nine male patients with suspected recurrence after radiotherapy for HCC underwent T2-, T1-weighted imaging and Gd-DTPA enhanced dynamic studies. T2 relaxation times, signal intensity ratios in T1-weighted images (WI) and the relative enhancement of the dynamic study were calculated. Recurrent tumors and the irradiated area showed similar image characteristics: hypointense in T1-WI and hyperintense in T2-WI. T2 values and signal intensity ratios in the T1-WI were not significantly different. In the gadolinium-enhanced dynamic study, a recurrent HCC showed early enhancement, followed by a rapid washout. However, the irradiated liver parenchyma showed hyperintensity from an early phase, and contrast enhancement tended to be more prominent and prolonged at the end of the dynamic studies. The characteristic findings of the dynamic MR study enable us to distinguish between a recurrent HCC and a radiation-induced hepatic injury.

Ultrasonic waves are powerful and popular methods for measuring mechanical properties of solids even at nanoscales.
The extraction of material constants from the measured wave data requires the use of a model that can accurately describe
the wave motion in the solid. The objective of this paper is to develop a continuum theory with microstructures that can
capture the effect of the microstructure or nanostructure in ultra-thin films when waves of short wavelengths are used. This
continuum theory is developed from assumed displacement fields for microstructures. Local kinematic variables are introduced
to express these local displacements and are subjected to internal continuity conditions. The accuracy of the present
theory is verified by comparing the results with those of the lattice model for the thin film. Specifically, dispersion curves
for surface wave propagation and wave propagation in a thin film supported by an elastic homogeneous substrate are studied.
The inadequacy of the conventional continuum theory is discussed.

Advances in machine tool technology have led to high speed milling for the production of moulds and dies to become more prevalent. Critical aspects of the technology include cutting tools, machinability data, cutter path generation and machine tools. Much published information exists on cutting tools and related data (cutting speeds, feed rates, depths of cut, etc.), however, relatively little information has been published on the evaluation of cutter paths when high speed rough milling hardened steel. The aim objective of the paper is to investigate the feasibility of employing high axial depths of cut (10 mm ⩽ axial depth of cut ⩽ 20 mm) when high speed rough milling hardened AISI H13 steel in order to achieve high volume of metal removed at the expense of low machining time. In conclusion, where long tool life, high volume of metal removed, short machining times and high volumetric removal rates were concerned, raster cutter path strategy was the most favourable at all high axial depths of cut employed.

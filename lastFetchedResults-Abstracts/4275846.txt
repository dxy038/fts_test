A multi-objective Bin Packing Problem is dealt in this paper. Apart from the main objective of normal Bin Packing Problem, which is to pack the items in such a way that the number of total amount of bins used is minimized, a new objective is also considered. The new objective is to pack items into a bin in such a way that the center of gravity (C.G.) comes in the central position of the bin. Accidents like crashing of airplanes during take off and toppling of ships while loading heavy goods have occurred a number of times in the past. One of the main reasons of such accidents is the position of the C.G. of the vehicle. This research could help reduce such accidents in the future. By bringing the C.G. of the vehicle to a particular point could result in better fuel efficiency since the overall load on the vehicle is reduced. In this presentation, the solution of the problem using existing algorithm (Bottom Left Fill (BLF) Heuristics) is evaluated in terms of the C.G. of the bin. And it is compared to the solution of a new algorithm particularly designed for placing the C.G. near the optimum position.

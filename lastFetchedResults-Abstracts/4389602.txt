The objective of any cell culturing platform is to decipher the in vivo functionality of native tissue in order to deliver reliable cell models for disease and pharmacological studies and eventually in patient-specific tissue engineering. We present a new perspective in lab-on-chip implementations for cell culturing, emphasizing on a versatile technology for cell micropatterning that can integrate electrical and pH monitoring modalities to record extracellular activity. We employ Parylene C, a highly biocompatible material, as a flexible culture substrate that controls the cellular microtopography and promotes a more in vivo-like morphology of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Moreover, we transfer the patterning technology on commercially available Multi-Electrode arrays to highlight the potential of integration with products customly used for extracellular electrical recordings. Finally, we implement flexible Parylene sensors for spatiotemporal pH monitoring, using the material both as a support medium and as a sensing membrane. Integration of these three attributes may deliver a compact solution with high scientific and commercial impact.

The Telecommunications Management Networks (TMN) have been evolving and becoming more sophisticated. Different technologies from different vendors contribute to complicate the telecommunication management so that the need for integration and interoperability is growing. A general TMN computing platform architecture was proposed by the TMN Computing Platform Special Interest Group, comprising representatives from RACE projects GUIDELINE, ADVANCE, AIM, NEMESYS and ROSA. Its main objective is to provide enough support for the contrasting TMN management applications. This paper is about the computing platform architecture developed in the MASI Laboratory, called IDEA, and its relationship with this general TMN computing platform architecture. In both instances, IDEA architecture and general architecture, the support services are identified and the correspondence between them is made

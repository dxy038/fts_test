Data and models are needed to analyse the dynamic behaviour of any system. One of the main goals of mathematical modelling is optimization of some objective function subject to certain constraints. Nature has an optimality principle in biological systems. For example shapes of different cells or bones in the human body are optimal for the function they perform. Optimization models may provide better understanding in diagnosis of diseases as well as in patient health care systems. The paper deals with application of the optimization technique of dynamic programming to model the human gall bladder

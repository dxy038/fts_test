Wavelet transform has been shown to be an effective technique for high quality coding at low bit rates. Choice of filter bank is critical issue that affects signal quality as well as system design. In this paper we investigate the use of NPR QMF banks for compression of electric signal waveforms. For this purpose, these filter banks are compared with the traditional biorthogonal filter banks. As criteria for comparison we use objective performance of the reconstructed signals. Experiments conducted on several signals indicate that NPR QMF banks have better performances than the commonly used biorthogonal filter banks.

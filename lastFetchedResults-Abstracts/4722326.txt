In this paper, we propose a new region reaching control scheme for robots with uncertain kinematics and dynamics. In this control method, the desired objective can be specified as a region instead of a point. Since the desired region can be specified arbitrarily small, the region control concept is also a generalization of setpoint control problem. Based on this observation, we revisit the setpoint control problem from region control point of view, to gain new insights into the robot control problem. We shall show that the approximate Jacobian setpoint controller is a special case of the proposed region reaching controller

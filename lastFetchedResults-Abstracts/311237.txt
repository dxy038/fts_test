Objective. To assess the fixation rigidities of a custom designed blade plate, a 2.7 mm T-plate and 3.0 mm cannulated screws.

Design. A cadaveric non-comminuted radial neck fracture model was employed to test the three fixation methods, using a multi-directional shear loading protocol.

Background. The management of displaced radial neck fractures in adults remains unsatisfactory due to failure of internal fixation with secondary loss of reduction, and non-unions.

Methods. The stiffness of the various fixation methods was measured in five directions of loading in the transverse plane. Failure testing was performed on the final testing condition for each specimen, in a posteroulnar to anteroradial direction.

Results. The direction of specimen loading did not have a significant effect on the stiffness of the various methods of fixation (P=0.4). There was no significant difference in the fixation stiffness between the 3.0 mm screws or blade plate, however, both were superior to the T-plate (P<0.05).

Conclusions. Although the 2.7 mm T-plate has been reported in the literature as a viable method of fixation for radial neck fractures, it may not be optimal from the viewpoint of fixation stability. In the setting of a non-comminuted radial neck fracture, the use of cross-cannulated screws or blade plate fixation is preferred.

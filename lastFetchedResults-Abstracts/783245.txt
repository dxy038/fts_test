Objective There is a lack of consensus
on the identification of seriously mentally ill patients
(SMI). This study investigates the external and predictive
validity of an operationalized definition for the
severity and persistency of mental illness applied to a
sample of service users attending a community
mental health service. Method The definition is based
on the fulfilment of dysfunction (GAF £ 50) and illness
duration (‡2 yrs) criteria. The study was conducted
with a two-year longitudinal design. External
and predictive validity of the SMI definition were
assessed against the diagnosis of psychosis. Results
Our data show evidence for an overall high
predictive and external validity of the SMI definition
and high sensitivity in predicting those with high
burden of mental illness. Conclusions In order to
identify people with high levels of psychiatric burden,
the SMI working definition seems to be more useful
than that simply based on diagnostic criteria.

This study investigates the stability of time-varying two-dimensional hierarchical discrete-time multi-agent systems. The first objective is to design mathematical models to present the hierarchical and time-varying structure of two-dimensional multi-agent systems. Based on the hierarchical structure, the interval stability of time-invariant multi-agent systems can be obtained to guarantee the stability analysis of time-varying multi-agent systems. Then, a simple condition is given to achieve the stability of time-invariant systems. Finally, simulation results are given to illustrate the usefulness of the developed criteria.

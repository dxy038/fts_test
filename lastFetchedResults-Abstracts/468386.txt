Objective: The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of selective prostaglandin synthase type 2 inhibitors on basal prostaglandin concentrations in the fetal and maternal circulations and on the labor-associated increase in prostaglandin production in sheep. Study Design: The effects of maternal nimesulide (0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg) and 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg) administration were examined (n = 5) at 134 ± 1 days’ gestation. At 138 days’ gestation premature labor was induced by fetal dexamethasone infusion (1 mg/d). Ewes were treated with either vehicle or nimesulide infusion (20 mg • d–1 • kg–1 , n = 5 per group). Results: Nimesulide and 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid decreased basal prostaglandin production in a concentration-dependent manner. Delivery of nimesulide-treated ewes was delayed by ≥17 hours with respect to that of control ewes (53.9 ± 2.6 hours). In 2 nimesulide-treated ewes labor did not progress to delivery despite membrane rupture. The increase in prostaglandin concentrations usually seen during dexamethasone-induced labor was abolished in nimesulide-treated ewes and also in their fetuses. Conclusions: Highly selective inhibitors of prostaglandin endoperoxidase H synthase 2 may be required to spare fetal prostaglandin production and limit potential side effects during the suppression of preterm labor.

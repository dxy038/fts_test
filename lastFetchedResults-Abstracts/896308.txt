Objective (s): To translate and validate the ‘Climate Innovation Questionnaire’ in Iran.
Methods: A team of professionals evaluated the content validity. Internal consistency of questions was assessed by the Cronbach's alpha. Twenty experts and faculty members responded to the questionnaire twice within 2-week intervals and test-retest was performed to calculate interclass correlation (ICC).
Results: Eleven professionals evaluated content validity. The Cronbach's alpha for all areas of the questionnaire (vision and strategic objectives, risk and acceptance of failures, interdisciplinary or inter-professional teams, college relations, measuring innovation, transparency and honesty and appropriate behavior with faculty members and staffs) had acceptable internal consistency. The ICC in all areas was over 0.7 except for interdisciplinary teams, or between professional relations at the university, appropriate behavior with faculty members and staffs, and transparency and honesty.
Conclusion: The present translation of the ‘Innovation Climate Questionnaire’ showed appropriate reliability and validity and can be used in assessing innovation infrastructure in Iranian organizations.

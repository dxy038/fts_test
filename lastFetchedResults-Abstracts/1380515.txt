Nonlinear buckling optimization is introduced as a method for doing laminate optimization on generalized composite shell structures exhibiting nonlinear behaviour where the objective is to maximize the buckling load. The method is based on geometrically nonlinear analyses and uses gradient information of the nonlinear buckling load in combination with mathematical programming to solve the problem. Thin-walled optimal laminated structures may have risk of a relatively high sensitivity to geometric imperfections. This is investigated by the concepts of “worst” imperfections and an optimization method to determine the “worst” shape imperfections is presented where the objective is to minimize the buckling load subject to imperfection amplitude constraints. The ability of the nonlinear buckling optimization formulation to solve the laminate problem and determine the “worst” shape imperfections is illustrated by several numerical examples of composite laminated structures and the application of both formulations gives useful insight into the interaction between laminate design and geometric imperfections.

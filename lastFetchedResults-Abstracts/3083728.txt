Scheduling of material flow of each section in mineral process affects not only the stability and continuity of mineral process but also realization of global production indices of the process. Synthetically considering such factors as grade of concentrate, output of concentrate, concentration-ratio and capacity of buffer storage, we establish multi-objective programming model based on object of minimized fluctuation of mineral process assembly load and minimized punish fees, and apply improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to solve the model. Consequently, the optimum processing quantity of each section in material process can be obtained, which provide the reference in seeking the reasonable scheduling of material flow in mineral enterprise.

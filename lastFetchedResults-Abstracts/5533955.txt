In this paper we propose efficient operators for a well known multi-objective evolutionary optimizer, called NSGA II, applied to design all-optical networks regarding the network topology and the device specifications in order to both minimize the capital expenditure to build the network and to maximize the overall network performance. From the experiments, we perceived that it is better to use an uniform crossover, to include preferences a priori and to initialize the individuals emphasizing the network topology.

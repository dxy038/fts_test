Analog transmission using laser diodes is quite attractive for transmitting multiplexed video signals, owing to the wide modulation bandwidth of laser diodes. Optimizations for transmitting color-TV signals (7 channel frequency division multiplexed) in the VHF band using buried heterostructure laser diodes are investigated. The major transmission objectives are a carrier to noise ratio of larger than 48 dB and intermodulation products of less than -55 dB. Design curves for minimizing distortion at the transmitter are demonstrated. A modulation index of 70 percent is shown to be capable of attaining the objective. Both the avalanche photodiode (APD) and the pinphotodiode (PD) are considered for use in the receiving amplifier. Minimum receiving power of -11 dBm obtained with the PD receiver is in good agreement with theoretical values. Deterioration of signal to noise ratio due to fiber guided transmissions is also reviewed in comparison with aerial transmissions.

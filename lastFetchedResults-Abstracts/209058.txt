the application of Lidocaine together with Propofol.
Materials & Methods: This randomized clinical trial study was done in 5th Azar teaching
during 2007.272 patients were selected randomly between age of 15-55 years with ASA Class
I,ll who were the candidates of elective surgery. We injected Fresenius %I to the first group

50.90 (%55.6), and 22.9 (24.2%) in the third group in which there is a significant difference
(P<O.OOI). Moderate and sever intensityof pain (Score 2.3) was 42.91 (46%) For the first group,
18.90 (20%) for the second group and 2.91 (2.2%) for the third group (P<O.OOI).

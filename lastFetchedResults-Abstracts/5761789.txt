The objective of this paper is to present the implementation of Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System (T2 FLS) with analog modules. Specifically, this implementation focuses on Interval T2 FLSs (IT2 FLS) since they are computationally much simpler than general T2 FLSs and hence the most widely used in almost all the applications. The realization of IT2 FLS has been done by using two Type-1 Fuzzy Logic Systems (T1 FLS) which in turn have been implemented through analog modules built around operational-amplifiers (op-amps) and discrete components. The suggested implementation approach is based on rule-by-rule architecture and hence truly captures the inherent parallel nature of fuzzy systems.

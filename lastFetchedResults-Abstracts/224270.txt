This publication describes a laboratory test program
conducted with the objective to develop a test that would replace
the existing dc withstand test. The article describes the
methodology used to establish the voltage duratlon and magnitude
of VLF (0.1 Hz) high voltage field tests suitable for crosslinked
polyethylene @WE) Insulated power cable. The results show that
the voltage breakdown of laboratory aged XLPE cable at 0.1 Hz Is
approximately equal to that at 60 Hz, that proof tests at 0.1 Hz cause
very little damage to the cable, and that 0.1 Hz testing appears to be
a satisfadory alternate to dc testing. Preliminary values are
SUggeStQd for voltage magnitude and time duration of cable
acceptance, main-tenance and proof tests at 0.1 Hz for XLPE cable
ratad up to 35 kV. A program is underway to similarly evaluate
samples of serviceaged XLPE cable; as well as to demonstrate the
use of the preliminary test values at typical utility installations.

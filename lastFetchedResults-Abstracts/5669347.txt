The main objective of this work has been to add the model for fricative excitation to the LPC synthesis model. From the LPC model one finds the acoustic tube section with the greatest constriction and adds a modulated noise signal. The results from this model demonstrate that one is able to produce noise bursts at the right time instants that are shorter than the frame length. This gives a more natural sound for certain phonemes, but adds a quantization type of background noise.

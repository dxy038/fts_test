Thematic interpretation â€“in comparison with running interpretation- is a newly arising exegetical method seeking to reveal the theory of the holy Quran concerning a certain issue or problem. The present article is an attempt to explain the nature of this exegetical method, the cocept and the foundations of this exegesis, its difference with running interpretation, and the extent of its dependence on the latter. Thus the article first presents a conceptual study of the words"Tafsir" and "Mawdui"i.e. "thematic", followed by various definitions of thematic interpretation. Thematic interpretation is deduction of the theory of the holy Quran concerning an issue or problem via gathering and classification of all relevant verses and their methodological investigation, whether the issue found in the Quran itself or come across from outside. Thematic interpretation is different from running one in respect of objective, start, role of interpreter, and method. However, it owes in matters of seeking issues, revelatory study of verses, and revealing the signification of the whole verses to the running interpretation.

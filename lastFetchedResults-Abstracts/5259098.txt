The main objective of this paper is to discuss a number of advanced sensors, their applications and market opportunities. Future Research and Development activities in this field are also described. The paper should provide a critical review of some of the advanced European research work in sensors. The two broad categories of the solid state sensors technologies and the guided-wave optical sensor technologies will be described. One of the authorÂ´s research projects on investigation of amorphous semiconductors as optical sensors will be also outlined

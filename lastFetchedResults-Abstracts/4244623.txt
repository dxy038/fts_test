This paper describes a multi-objective economic load dispatch (ELD) model to minimize the emission cost due to CO2 and N2O. The power system operation costs are minimized under transmission network constraints in ELD. This model will be transformed from single objective economic problem to multi-objective problem to combine both economic and emission dispatch. The model is implemented by Differential Evolution (DE) and a set of numerical experiments for a standard test system is reported.

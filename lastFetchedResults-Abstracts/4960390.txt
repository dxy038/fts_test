Two kinds of ultrafine polyester nonwoven wadding different in weight were tested, and two kinds of hollow-core polyester wadding available in market were chosen as contrast. Then four clothing ensembles which were filled in four different kinds of thermal materials respectively were made. The contents of tests involved material properties and clothing wearing comfort (through objective thermal manikin experiments and subjective evaluation trials). For the ultrafine and hollow-core polyester wadding with the same weight, the ratio of thickness between them was about 1/2, however the ratio of thermal insulation of materials was 1/0.9, and the ratio of thermal insulation of clothing ensembles was up to 1/0.7 and 1/0.8. So both the material itself and the clothing ensemble made of it, the thermal comfort property of ultrafine polyester wadding was much better than that of hollow-core polyester wadding. But in the properties of air and water permeability, ultrafine polyester wadding was not as good as hollow-core polyester wadding. So the moist comfort properties of ultrafine polyester nonwoven wadding still need to be improving.

A novel bidirectional electrooptic network analyzer has been demonstrated which enables the full S-parameter characterization of both electrooptic (E/O) and optoelectronic (O/E) components using a single connection of the device-under-test to the test ports. A combined two-tier E/O and O/E calibration is proposed. Measurement results which validate both the analyzer architecture and the calibration are presented

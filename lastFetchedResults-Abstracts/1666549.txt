The Sonogel–Carbon electrode is a special class of sol–gel electrode that exhibits favourable mechanic and electric properties to be used as electrochemical sensor. In this study, Sonogel–Carbon modified with l-Cysteine was used to prepare a novel electrochemical sensor. The objective of this novel electrode modification was to seek new electrochemical performances for detection of epinephrine in the presence of uric acid. The response of catalytic current with epinephrine concentration shows a linear relation in the range from 1 × 10−7 to 5 × 10−4 M with a correlation coefficient of 0.998, and a detection limit of 8.7 × 10−8 M. The modified electrode had also been applied to the determination of epinephrine and uric acid in biological samples with satisfactory results. A surface characterisation of this modified electrode was carried out helped by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-Ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS).

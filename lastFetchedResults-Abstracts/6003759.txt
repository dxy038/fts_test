At present, most of the image template matching algorithms involve large computational complexity, and can hardly be used in practical projects. This paper proposes that particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) be used in image template matching problems (ITMP). Template matching in fact is a matter of seeking optimization. The cross-correlation function of template and sub image is set as the objective function, and then a fast template matching algorithm can reached based on particle swarm optimization algorithm. Experiment results prove both the computational accuracy and efficiency of this algorithm.

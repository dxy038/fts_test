The objective of this investigation was to study the microscopical structure of the gallbladder in Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonicum). Tissue samples were obtained from six male and six female adult healthy Japanese quail. Sections were stained with haematoxylin eosin. The results showed that the overall microscopical structure of the gallbladder of Japanese quail was similar to that in chukar partridge except for the goblet cells. The gallbladder was composed of tunica mucosa, tunica muscularis and tunica serosa or tunica adventitia. The tunica mucosa was mainly lined by simple columnar epithelium which was covered by a continuous striated border of microvilli. The goblet cells were observed in epithelium. Tunica mucosa forms some folds which appeared to be regularly distributed over the whole gallbladder luminal surface and were most isometric. Deep invaginations of the surface epithelium were observed to have grown down into the underlying mesenchyme, showing a tubular gland like appearance. The muscularis mucosa was absent. The thin lamina propria-submucosa was contained loose connective tissue which consisted of numerous diffuse lymphatic tissues, but no glands were observed. The tunica muscularis consisted of a thin circular layer of smooth muscle fibers. The loose connective tissue of tunica serosa or adventitia was made up of adipose tissues and blood vessels. No significant sex-based differences were found.

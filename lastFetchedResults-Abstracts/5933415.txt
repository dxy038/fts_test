One of the main problems facing sensor localization in wireless communication systems is accuracy. In this paper, we propose an optimization algorithm for wireless sensor networks localization based on time-of-arrival (TOA) technique. The optimal points are determined by the iteration process of multiplier method, and the unknown positions are gotten. Simulation results show that the optimization method can improve the localization accuracy of traditional time-of-arrival TOA locating method. The optimization localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks using multiplier method can effectively minus the sum of errors and thus achieve the objective of high locating accuracy for wireless sensor networks localization.

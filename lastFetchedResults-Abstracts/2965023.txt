The objective of this paper is to address some of the theoretical and practical issues related to the implementation of two stage model predictive control (MPC) schemes such as linear program-MPC and quadratic program-MPC. Single stage QDMC has the drawbacks of steady state offsets, inconsistent set-points and does not take into account economic objectives. The addition of another stage on the top of QDMC is used to address these problems. Results of the application of two stage MPC to the Shell Challenge problem are presented. A comparison is made with the single stage conventional QDMC and some interesting observations are reported. Stability and dynamic performance issues are also considered in this paper

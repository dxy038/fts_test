A two-switch cycloconverter circuit that converts single-phase alternating current into an effective three-phase alternating current is presented. Since this design features only two bidirectional switches, it has a simple and inexpensive construction. At the center of this design is a control circuit which ensures that the average value of the output voltage on the two switches is sinusoidal with a 60&#176; difference in phase. Results for a demonstration model of the two-switch circuit are also discussed

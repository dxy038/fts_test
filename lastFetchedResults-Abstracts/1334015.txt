The purpose of this paper is to propose an effective solution scheme of simultaneous optimization design of layup configuration and fiber distribution for maximum stiffness design of laminated plates. Firstly, a numerical analysis of the lamination parameters feasible region for a laminated plate consisting of various given number of ply groups (each ply group may have different thickness and all the fibers in one ply group are orientated in an identical direction) is carried out, and it is found that the feasible region based on only a few ply groups is very close to the overall one determined by infinite plies. Therefore, it is suggested that the feasible region of lamination parameters of a laminated plate could be approximately determined by the layup configuration of least ply groups. Secondly, a two-step simultaneous optimization scheme of layup configuration and fiber distribution for maximum stiffness design of laminated plates is proposed. Accordingly, by using ply thickness, fiber orientation angle and fiber volume fraction in a laminated plate of least ply groups as design variables, the optimal lamination parameters for maximum stiffness is obtained. Then, taking the optimal lamination parameters as the design objective, a detailed layup design optimization is implemented by considering some limitations on manufacturing, such as preset ply thickness, and specific fiber orientation angle and a limited maximum number of consecutive plies in the same fiber orientation. Numerical examples are also presented to validate the proposed two-step optimization scheme.

Based on today&#8217;s standard of technology, dual-source CT devices and dual-layer-based single-source CT devices are attractive candidates for dual-energy applications in clinical routine. The general difference of kVp and detector based approaches lies in the shape of the detected X-ray energy spectra and in the presence of cross-scatter radiation in dual-source devices. We present simulations and measurements with real CT systems that allow a direct and objective comparison of the performance of dual-kVp and dual-layer CT system concepts in terms of noise and dual-energy performance at given dose exposure.

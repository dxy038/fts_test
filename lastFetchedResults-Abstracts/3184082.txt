The paper proposes a method of modeling and simulation of Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) arrays, interface between two dissimilar toolboxes in MATLAB and different control schemes for the converter control. This paper also shows the simulation of the SPV in Trnsys. The main objective is to find the non-linear I-V equation by obtaining the curve at three points, open circuit, maximum power and short circuit. The method finds the I-V equation for the single diode photovoltaic model including the effect of the series and parallel resistances. Simulation of the standalone system has been carried out using two different DC-DC converters one with push pull converter topology and the full bridge converter topology. A PWM inverter model has been used for the complete model simulation. Finally, hybrid model have been developed so as to perform the analysis of the renewable based standalone system for smart mini grid applications.

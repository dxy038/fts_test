OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the advantages of laparoscopic myomectomy versus laparotomy. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized trial was performed on 40 women, 22 to 44 years old, undergoing myomectomy. Patients were randomized to have laparoscopy (n = 20) or laparotomy (n = 20). The intensity of pain was assessed by a visual analog scale at 0, 1, 2, and 3 days postoperatively. The proportions of patients who were analgesic free on day 2, discharged from the hospital by day 3, and feeling fully recuperated on day 15 were also compared. RESULTS: The intensity of postoperative pain was lower (p< 0.05) after laparoscopy than after laparotomy. A higher (p< 0.05) proportion of patients was analgesic free on day 2, discharged from hospital by day 3, and feeling fully recuperated on day 15 after laparoscopy compared with laparotomy. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic myomectomy may offer the benefits of lower postoperative pain and shorter recovery time in comparison with laparotomy. (AM J OBSTET GYNECOL 1996;174:654-8.)

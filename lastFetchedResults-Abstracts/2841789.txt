This paper presents the design and experimental performance of a compact, 50W/in<sup>3</sup> (3kW/liter), and 96.2% peak efficiency 3.5kW single phase rectifier for telecommunication application. The rectifier is composed of two stages connected in series. The bridgeless PFC boost rectifier with bidirectional switch has less forward diode voltage drop than conventional technologies. The DC-DC converter is based on a full bridge LLC resonant converter with synchronous rectification. A fully digital controller is used to obtain the high power density of the rectifier. The efficiency, PF and THD experimental results obtained from the prototype are also presented.

Image fusion refers to an image processing technique that produces a single image with more information by combining the images of the same scene. The different focus images involve different details according to changing the lens of camera. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for multifocus image fusion by choosing focus regions based on decision map that reflects the clarity of an image. In order to obtain the high pass details of an image, a difference coefficients map between an isotropic diffusion model and Gaussian filter is presented. Sum-Modified-Laplacian (SML)improves the robustness of process by selecting high pass coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed fusion algorithm exhibits better performance than some compared methods, both in visual effect and objective evaluation criteria.

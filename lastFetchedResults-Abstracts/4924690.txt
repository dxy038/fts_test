In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) education field, the teaching of tongue diagnostics is facing the problem of using abstract or non-quantitative notions. In this paper, a computer aided education tool for TCM, tongue diagnosis system (TDS) is described. By using TDS, the diagnosis features are processed in quantitative manner, and the diagnosis reasoning is objective. The system enables performing virtual experiments by students themselves. Moreover, the proposed TDS helps the TCM students to develop a computing thinking model from the interdisciplinary view point. Focusing on the system design, the paper puts forward systematic architecture and design modules of TDS as well as its applications in tongue diagnosis teaching and learning.

Regional traffic level of service (LOS) evaluation is a sticking point in urban traffic research. The objective of this study is to develop a model for estimating LOS of regional traffic. Firstly, we presented one method applied in the micro-layer traffic. Secondly, one macro-layer method was constructed, it based on the result of micro-layer. We combine these two layers into a single Multi-grade evaluation model for traffic level of service. The multi-grade evaluation model owns two layers including the micro-layer, which is used to distinguish the segment traffic status, the macro-layer, which is to estimate regional traffic status. The proposed model is applied to several city areas, and the results show its validity.

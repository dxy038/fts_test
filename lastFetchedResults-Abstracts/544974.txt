 The Observatorio Nacional at Rio de Janeiro has developed a new heliometer to perform accurate measurements of the solar diameter. The equipment makes use of split parabolic mirrors, rather than split achromatic lenses as objective. In its first campaign this reflector heliometer generated a few thousands of images of the Sun through which we evaluate the precision of the solar diameter measurements as been 5 mas. The mechanical and thermal stability of the instrument is guaranteed by the use of a telescope tube manufactured in carbon fiber. The tube firmly holds the heliometric mirrors and the CCD camera that collects the images. The perfect lodging between the two half-mirrors over its supporting plate defines the angular instrumental separation between the two images of the sun. The heliometric mirrors and supporting plate have been made in ceramic material in order to ensure the stability of the optical configuration and to maintain the two images of the solar disk displaced by a fixed angle in relation to each other. To verify the stability of the instrument we designed the procedures of collimation and comparison. The collimation consists of using the heliometer for measuring the diameter of an artificial solar image specifically created for this purpose. The comparison is performed by measuring the residual unfold of a punctual image after been unfold by two opposed heliometers. The heliometric approach allows the measurement of the solar diameter at any heliolatitude and can be undertaken as often as desired. Computer programs have been developed for automated image acquisition and analysis. The optical and mechanical design has been performed by using 3D computer aided design software.

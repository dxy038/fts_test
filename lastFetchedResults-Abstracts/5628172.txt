Software deployment and updating of deployed code is a critical topic in the area of wireless sensor networks (WSN). Reasons are unreliable network connectivity, resource limitations of devices, and energy restrictions in general. Consequently, software deployment has to be performed with great care otherwise resources might be wasted or nodes become unavailable due to failed updates. The overall objective for software management in sensor networks is to enable a robust and efficient way to build deployable software images that take into account all the needs from application requirements to node-specific resource restrictions. In this article, we outline the current state-of-the-art for software management in WSN and (network-based) sensor network (re-)programming. We provide insights into three different approaches enabling a more comprehensive management of WSN while challenging the robustness and efficiency of software configurations and reprogramming. Additionally, we outline research challenges in the area of software management and sensor network operation.

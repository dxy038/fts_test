The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate that a periodic structure can be used to design filters at millimeter frequency band. Theoretical analyses are performed applying the Finite Element Method (FEM) to design a volumic millimeter-wave filter at 35 GHz and a planar microwave filter at 6 GHz. The devices are built and tested at the IRCOM. Theoretical results are compared with success to experimental ones.

Background: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are among important health problems in
working population. Because of performing difficult physical activities, hand-woven shoe-sole
makers are at risk of developing various types of MSDs.
Objective: To determine the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in different body
areas of hand-woven shoe-sole makers, assess workersâ€² postures and workstations, evaluate
ergonomic and individual factors associated with MSDs, and develop guidelines for designing
hand-woven shoe-sole making workstation.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the prevalence of MSDs symptoms and their risk factors
were studied among 240 hand-woven shoe-sole makers. Working posture and workstations
were ergonomically assessed as well. The data were collected through interviewing and
using Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire and by direct observation of posture using RULA
method. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine risk factors associated with MSDs
symptoms.
Results: The prevalence and severity of MSDs symptoms were high among the study population.
Ergonomic factors including daily working time, working posture, and force exertion,
as well as individual factors, such as age, job tenure, and education were significantly associated
with MSDs symptoms.
Conclusion: It seems that the majority of ergonomics shortcomings originate from poorly
designed workstation. Some general guidelines for designing shoe-sole making workstation
are presented.

In this paper, we mainly research a multifractal formalism in a probability space.The first objective of this paper is to define a multifractal generalisation of the Hausdorff measure and the packing measure. We explore the properties of the multifractal Hausdorff measure and the multifractal packing measure in a probability space, and invesigate the relative results of multifractal spectra functions in a probability space. We also describe a sufficient condion and a necessary one of validity for the multifractal formalism in a probability space.

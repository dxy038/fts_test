The objective of this paper is to investigate if and how transformation factors for the lifetime of modern, geometrically complex microelectronic components can be defined and obtained. Three types of components are investigated: BGAs, CSPs, and flip chips (FCs). The lifetime of each is based on the prediction of lifetime for their solder bumps. The latter follows by combination of stress/strain results stemming from FE calculations in combination with a crack growth law as originally proposed by Darveaux (1995)

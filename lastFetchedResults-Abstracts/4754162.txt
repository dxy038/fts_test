This paper demonstrates the techniques used and experiences gained while implementing a new system development process. The objective of the new process was to structure the system development environment to reflect standard software life cycle management methodologies, so that the reliability of the product can be increased while reducing management costs. Although a need to change the software process was felt for a while, the involvement with the development of IEEE software engineering standards provided the additional momentum to initiate the change. Throughout the change process, these standards were used effectively as selling tools to management as well as planning and training guides. The transition was made from the existing software development environment structured around the software features to one structured around the life cycle process and management of changes

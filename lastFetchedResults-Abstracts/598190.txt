Firms are different from markets, resources and managerial expertise. Many studies strongly advocate that firms adopt a market orientation to achieve competitive advantage and can transform firm assets into superior performance. A paucity of research exists on how to develop market-oriented hotel and performance and is lacking an integrated framework to establish them. For establishing a guideline enabling systematic approaches to understand them, find or choose which combinations of changes in factors that would lead to the most desirable outcomes in order to adapt to the objectives of the hotel and to fill some research gaps. This study adopts concept of Total Quality Management (TQM's) IPO (Input-Processing-Output) and Resource-Based View to construct research model and use the Fuzzy Cognitive map and Structural Equation Model. By these objective methods make the decision maker has a clear picture of building competitive advantages in the hotel industry, identify and assess a lot of hypothetical situations which might occur in reality and to detect a group of the most desirable outcomes in limited hotel resource.

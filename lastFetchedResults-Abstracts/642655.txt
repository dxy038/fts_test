Objective
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is one of the most important emerging health issues. Insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome play a central role in the pathogenesis of NASH. Intake of nutrients strongly affects insulin resistance, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and hepatic steatosis. However, there are few reports about the intake of various nutrients in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In this work, we identified the characteristics of dietary habits and nutrient intake in patients with NASH.
Methods

Twenty-eight patients with NASH and 18 with simple steatosis (FL) were diagnosed from histologic findings, and their dietary habits and intake of nutrients were analyzed by detailed questioning by physicians and dieticians.
Results

There was an excess intake of carbohydrates/energy in patients with NASH 20–59 y of age compared with patients with FL. Among carbohydrates, intake of simple carbohydrates was higher in those with NASH. There also was a low intake of protein/energy in patients with NASH 40–59 y of age and a low intake of zinc in those 20–59 y of age compared with patients with FL. Ratio of intake of polyunsaturated fatty acid to saturated fatty acid was lower in patients with NASH and those with FL compared with the general Japanese subjects.
Conclusion

These results suggest that imbalanced diets play important roles in development and progression of NASH and correction of these diets may be necessary in patients with NASH.

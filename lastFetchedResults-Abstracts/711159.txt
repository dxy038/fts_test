Objective
To describe a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to teen mothers and their children that significantly reduces repeat pregnancies.
Design
Retrospective review of repeat teen pregnancy data.
Setting
Young Parent Program (YPP) at a university-based health center.
Participants
1386 teen mothers between the ages of 11 and 19 who participated in the YPP for at least three years.
Intervention
Comprehensive Care: for both teen mother and her baby, including prenatal and postnatal care, preventive care, reproductive services, mental health, and acute care visits. Family counseling and similar services were also provided to siblings of the teen.
Continuity of Care
Patients are seen by the same staff and attending physicians on each visit. The treatment team includes physicians, nurses, social worker, nutritionist, and psychologist, all of whom are available to provide care at each visit. Flexible hours: Including evening clinic to allow teens to attend school or work during the day. Financial incentive: Patients with no insurance are given free contraceptives and a “no charge” clinic visit. Extensive contraceptive counseling is provided prior to start of contraceptive use and at every clinic visit. Routine telephone and/or mail reminders of appointments
Main Outcome Measure
Rate of repeat teen pregnancy.
Results
Only 11(.79%) had repeat pregnancies. Older youth appeared more likely to repeat a pregnancy.
Conclusion
Comprehensive intervention for teen mothers can be very successful in reducing repeat teen pregnancy in those teens who participate consistently in the program over a period of years.

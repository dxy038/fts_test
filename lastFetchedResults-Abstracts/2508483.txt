Background: The angular dependency of response for TLD cards may cause deviation from its true value on the results of environmental dosimetry, since TLDs may
be exposed to radiation at different angles of incidence from the surrounding area.
Objective: A 3D setting of TLD cards has been calibrated isotropically in a standard radiation feld to evaluate the improvement of the accuracy of measurement for
environmental dosimetry.
Method: Three personal TLD cards were rectangularly placed in a cylindrical
holder, and calibrated using 1D and 3D calibration methods. Then, the dosimeter has
been used simultaneously with a reference instrument in a real radiation feld measuring the accumulated dose within a time interval.
Result: The results show that the accuracy of measurement has been improved by
6.5% using 3D calibration factor in comparison with that of normal 1D calibration
method.
Conclusion: This system can be utilized in large scale environmental monitoring
with a higher accuracy

OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to establish a reference range for the fetal crown-chin length at 10 to 14 weeks' gestation and to determine its usefulness in the prenatal detection of anencephaly in the first trimester.
STUDY DESIGN: Women attending our center for transabdominal ultrasonographic screening at 10 to 14 weeks' gestation were prospectively recruited for this study. The crown-chin length was measured in a sagittal view of the fetal head, which included the fetal profile, from the highest point of the head to the most anterior aspect of the jaw. Nomograms for the crown-chin length and the ratio of the crown-chin length to the crown-rump length according to gestational age were generated. Additionally, the crown-chin length and the ratio of the crown-chin length to crown-rump length were obtained from a subset of 13 anencephalic fetuses and plotted against the reference range.
RESULTS: In normal fetuses the crown-chin length increased (Crown-chin length = 65.2 × Gestational age in days – 28.4; r = 0.74%, p<0.0001) and the ratio of the crown-chin length to the crown-rump length decreased (Ratio of crown-chin length to crown-rump length = –17.2 × Gestational age in days + 60.5; r =0.23, p<0.0001) with advancing gestation. In anencephalic fetuses crown-chin length measurements and the ratio of the crown-chin length to the crown-rump length were below the 5th percentile in 77% and 62% of the cases, respectively. The slope of change in the ratio of the crown-chin length to the crown-rump length with gestational age was significantly different in anencephalic fetuses compared with normal fetuses (t = 2.7, p<0.003).
CONCLUSION: Measurement of the crown-chin length at 10 to 14 weeks' gestation provides a technique that can assist in the early recognition of anencephaly. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;176:852-5.)

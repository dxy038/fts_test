The potential of a pulse compression technique has been evaluated experimentally for speckle reduction processing. Multifrequency and multibandwidth data were obtained from a speckle generating medium using frequency-modulated pulses. Speckle decorrelation factors were quantified. The technique is shown to be successful in its primary objective but some additional advantages need further exploration.

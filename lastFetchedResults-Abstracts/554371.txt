Background and Objective: Dental materials that are used for fixation in deciduous pulpotomy have adverse reactions such as toxicity and carcinogenic and mutaginic effects. Severe efforts are focused on substitution of these materials with safer ones. It has been reported that herbal medicines have useful clinical effects .It has been shown that the SUAB-1 and SUAB2 had a lower cytotoxicity than formocresol. To compare the in vivo histocompatibility of SUAB1 and SUAB2 in subcutaneous tissue of rat.

Materials and Methods: The study design was descriptive- analytical .Twenty-one rats with an average weight of 350 grams were used. SUAB1 and SUAB2 were separately placed in polyethylene tubes and implanted in the dorsal subdermal tissue. After intervals of one, two, and four weeks, animals were sacrificed. The implant materials with surrounding tissue were removed and collected in 10% buffered formalin solution for histopathologic evaluation. Capsule thickness, inflammation intensity, angiogenesis, necrosis and calcification were studied on paraffin-embedded sections. Data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 11.5). The Friedman and kruskall-wallis statistical tests were used.

Results: Statistically significant difference in capsule thickness, intensity and extent of inflammation, angiogenesis, necrosis and calcification was observed between SUAB1 and SUAB2 groups .







Conclusion: Capsule thickness, intensity of inflammation and calcification was higher in SUAB1 group than SUAB2.

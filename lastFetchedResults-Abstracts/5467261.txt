In this paper an hierarchical optimal central problem is considered, which involves an &#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub> cost in the primary problem and an &#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub>-norm type or a quadratic secondary objective. Using an allpass dilation technique and results from superoptimal interpolation theory, it is shown that the problem can be reduced to a multi-disk minimisation in terms of a free parameter of reduced dimensions. At this stage, convex programming techniques may be employed to obtain a numerical solution to the problem

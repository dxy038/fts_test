Objective (s): Mucoadhesive disc is one of the various routes of drug delivery for curing buccal disease.Materials and Methods:Everydiscs containing 70 mg stem bark extract of Ziziphus jujuba were formulated  by using Carbopol 934, PVP k30 and gelatin as polymers. Discs were made by granulation  and direct compression. Discs were standardized based on the total phenol.  Properties such as in vitro and in vivo mucoadhesion, drug release, water uptake, and disintegration were carried out.
Results: Discs showed excellent mucoadhesion and released high amount of the active ingredients (47%) immediately and completed after approximately the first hour. They had a good adhesion in buccal cavity. 
Conclusion:This study showed that the kinetics of release of the active substance from the mucoadhesive disc obeyed the zero order kinetic and didn’t follow the fick’s law. The water uptake and dissolution (DS), increased with the passing of time.

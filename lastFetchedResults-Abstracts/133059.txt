Background and Objective: Gastric cancer is the second cause of cancer mortality after lung cancer. Approximately 12% of all cancer death are due to gastric cancer. Tumorgenesis is thought to be a multistep process involving a series of genetic changes in oncogenes and suppressor genes. The most common cancer-related genetic change known in human tumors is p53 mutation, particularly in gastric cancer. This sutdy was done to determine p53 gene Mutations in gastric cancer.
Materials and methods: This study was perfomed on 44 biopsy from patients with gastric cancer during 2002 in three hospitals in Tehran. For determination of p53 gene Mutations was performed PCR-SSCP methods
Results: The patients group comprised 31 males and 13 females (average age, 60.8 years; ranging from 34 to 84 years). 36 cases (81.8 %) intestinal type, 5 cases (11.4 %) were diffuse type and 3 cases no defined. Forty-four gastric cancers of gastric tissues were screened for the mutations of p53 gene mutations in Exons 5-8 using the PCR-SSCP analysis. After polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, nine patients (20.5%) showed an apparent electrophoretic mobility shift between the cancer and other normal samples. One mutation in Exon 5 (11.1 %), two were detected in Exon 6 (22.2 %), three were found in Exon 7 (33.3 %), and three were detected in Exon 8 (33.3%). The mutation rate was seven of 36 (21.2%) in intestinal type and two of (40%) in diffuse type. No significant correlation between p53 gene mutations and age and genus was found.
Conclusions: This Investigation showed the rate of p53 gene mutation (20.5%) in gastric cancer in our socitey.

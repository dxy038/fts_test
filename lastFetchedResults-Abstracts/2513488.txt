Abstract
Objective: The purpose of this work was to study the voluntary motives of the physical education students participating in “National Congress Sport Sciences Needs of Future Generation”.
Methodology: The statistical population of this research work consisted of the volunteers participating in "National Congress Sport Sciences Needs of Future Generation" (N = 70). Due to the low statistical population, the statistical sample was equal to the statistical population; 62 (88% of the) subjects participated in this research work. The instrument used in this research work was the questionnaire for voluntary motives developed by Andam et al. (2009), which measured the 7 dimensions career, material, purposive, progressive, social, protective, and commitment motives on 5 point of the Likert scale. The questionnaire validity was confirmed by 12 sport management experts. The reliability coefficient of the questionnaire was calculated by the Cronbach's alpha (? = 0.83). The data analyzing methods were the descriptive statistics and the inferential statistics. Since the data distribution was normal, the one-way ANOVA and the Friedman's tests were used.
Results: The results obtained showed that the motivations of the students were career, material, purposive, progressive, social, protective, and commitment, respectively. Moreover, the career motives of the BSc students were more than those for the MSc and PhD students. Moreover, the PhD students had more material and progressive motives than the other students.
Conclusion: The present study suggests that the students’ educational degrees and kinds of their motives should be considered by sport managers in the students’ recruitment. In division of responsibilities, the sport event managers should also take into account the volunteer preferences.

Introduction: The incidence of primary br-ain tumors is 18.1 per 100,000. Evaluating the  health related quality of life (HR-QOL) is considered as important issue amo-ng patients with brain tumors. The objective of this study was to examine the HRQOL and its associated factors among patients with primary brain tumors.

Materials & Methods: For the descriptive-analytical study, 194 patients with brain tumors who had referred to the hospital of Shariati in Tehran were selected according to the convenient sampling method. The eligible patients were asked to complete a questionnaire which consisted of demog-raphic questions, clinical variables, the EORTC QLQ-C30 and The EORTC QLQ-BN20. Performance status and cognitive functioning were examinded using Karnof-sky Performance Scale and the Mini-Mental State Exam, respectively. 

Findings: Mean age of the patients was 42.05Â±16.0 years. Most of the patients were male (53%) and married (66%). The mult-ivariate regression models indicated that the older age, female gender and lower educ-ation  were associated with the poor quality of life and more symptoms (P < 0.001). On the other hand, combinational  supportive treatments (radio-chemotherapy), total rese-ction, better MMSE score, higher functional status were associated with higher quality of life(P < 0.05). These results were similar for both the generic and disease specific quality of life. However, demographic and clinical variables were more suitable for the prediction of the changings of the disease related specific quality of life in compare-ison with the generic measures.
 
Discussion & Conclusion: Acoording to the results of the study, the patients with brain tumor suffer from poor quality of life in all generic and specific dimensions. The need for supportive interventions including new treatment strategies, rehabilitation and social aiding in the  patients is unequivocal.

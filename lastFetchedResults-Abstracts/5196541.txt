This paper introduces a system control concept for rectifier/inverter sets. The objective is to create a &#8220;power buffer&#8221; between a utility source and the inverter load to shield the distribution system against the adverse effects of nonlinear loading, and the load against transients from the distribution source. The power buffer interface temporarily modifies the effective loading seen by the distribution system to one that is linear, such as a constant resistance or current source. This provides stability improvement during utility system transients. During this time, the power mismatch between source and load is supplied by a capacitive or battery storage element. Simulation within in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment and experimental evaluation of a simple single-phase power buffer validate the concept

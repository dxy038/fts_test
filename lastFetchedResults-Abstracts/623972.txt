Background and Objective: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)  results  in a range of unpleasant, unpredictable and physically disabling conditions. Thus, health promotion programmes are needed and Peer support groups have been shown to play a role in health promotion. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of peer groups on promoting physical health status in MS patients.
Material and Methods: This before and after quasi-experimental study was conducted in Tehran MS Association (2010) on 33 patients participated in three peer support groups: 10 in male group, 11 in female group and 12 in mixed group. Eight weekly sessions, each taken 2 hours, were held. The patients were asked to fill out  the Physical aspect of "Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Inventory" with 78 items (?=0.93)  in pre of intervention, two weeks after it, post of intervention and one month later. 
Results: The Results show that peer support groups promote the physical health status (p=0.001). In each three groups, there is a significant difference in physical health status in patients from before of intervention until one month after (p=0.001). This change is increasing from start of intervention until the end of it  and then is reducing up to one month after intervention. 
Conclusion: The results show that peer groups can promote the physical health of patients with MS; therefore, with the benefits of peer group, it is possible to promote the quality of care for MS patients, which in turn enhances the patients? quality of life.

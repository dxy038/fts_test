Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the natural history, treatment and prognosis of Esthesioneuroblastoma (ENB), a rare malignancy of the head and neck, based on the literature review.
Subjects and Methods: A retrospective study conducted on ENB patients who were treated at Qhaem and Omid hospitals, since 1994 to 2004.
Results: Eleven patients (mean age 44 years) with ENB identified and analyzed. The patients generally presented with unilateral nasal obstruction (72.7%) and epistaxis (63.6%). The right side was affected in 36.4% of patients. While the left side was involved in 54.5% and both side of the nasal cavity were involved at presentation in 9.1%. Kadish stage C was seen in 54.5% of patients. No patients had distant metastases and two patients (18.2%) had neck lymphadenopathy at presentation. Surgery was performed in 8 patients (72.7%). Radiation therapy was employed in 11 cases and chemo-therapy in 3. Recurrence occurred in one patient. Five-year survival was 80% and ten-year survival was 48%.
Conclusion: ENB is rare tumour that is potentially curable by surgical resection and radiation therapy.

An architecture for lightwave networks based on establishing controllable, optically transparent paths among network users is presented. The objective is to provide high-bandwidth (gigahertz) clear-channel optical connections on demand to large user populations spread over large geographical areas. The networks in question perform only linear operations on the optical signals, hence the name linear lightwave network (LLN). Because they are controllable and are based on arbitrary topologies, the networks can be reconfigured dynamically in response to changing load conditions or component failures. The LLNs operate in a wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) mode. The focus is on performance issues in LLNs subject to random demand. Static and dynamic routing techniques are considered and their performance is compared. Quantitative results are obtained for blocking probability as a function of offered load and as a function of technological constraints. It is shown that with currently available technology, LLNs with the order of one thousand nodes and ten thousand stations, capable of throughputs in the range of 10s of terabits per second, are feasible

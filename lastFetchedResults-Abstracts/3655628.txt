The author of the above-named work analyzes a new plc method that utilizes insulated bundle subconductors of transmission lines. The duscussor had proposed this technique in 1960 and had carried out several experiments on a model transmission line. The results of this investigation were rather discouraging because of the high cost of construction as compared with that of conventional plc and microwave channels. The discussor poses three questions based on the above to the original author. In replying the original author notes that answers to most of the discussorÂ´s questions can be found in the original closure. The author however, wishes to further comment briefly on the discussion. The author notes that the objective of his paper was to develop simplified modal analyses for lines with insulated bundle subconductors and to justify the simplifications. No experiemental work was done on any of the lines utilized for numerical demonstration.

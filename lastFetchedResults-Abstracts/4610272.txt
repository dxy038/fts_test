[Objective] A pepper cDNA library was screened to look for the WRKY transcriptional factor homologous molecules. Then a novel cDNA was found during the screen and cloned. Bioinformatics analysis was performed in order to study the possible function of this cDNA sequence. [ Method ] Various bioinformatics methods including blastn, ORF Finder, Wolf Psort and DNAMAN were used to analyze and predict the feature and possible functions of the novel cDNA sequence. [Results] The result shows this cDNA sequence was the full length of a novel gene and there was a conserved WRKY domain predicted by NCBI, the homologous analysis shows the putative WRKY sequence was highly identity with other plants and predicted to locate in nuclei. It may function in plant development and play a role during resistance to various environmental. Therefore, the functions of the novel gene are valuable for further investigations.

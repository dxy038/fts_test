Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have received wide spread attention in recent years. Several applications require these vehicles to travel in a partially known or unknown environment. The objective of this paper is to develop control strategies that help in keeping the UAV ´safe´. Safety implies that the UAVs are not damaged or destroyed during the mission. We formulate the problem, provide approximation results and show how this strategy can be coupled with other known path planning algorithms.

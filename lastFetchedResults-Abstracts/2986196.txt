For facilitating information searching from divided heterogeneous sources on a network, a modular approach was proposed, giving rise to a multi-agent system named ISAME. The system aims to offer to the agents representing the users, a simplified access to a dynamic collection of information sources available in electronic format. Thus the services aim to facilitate and optimise the process of information searching. The personalisation of the ISAME system for a user is effected by the intervention of the agents used. These agents realise a series of tasks and functions aimed at providing an information system regarding the different users. This article presents a conceptual model of agent user type from the objective of providing the maximum help and services to a class of users with ISAME. It results in a reduction of the server charge in the ISAME environment, before a certain number of operations and sub-tasks at the request of the users are effected locally.

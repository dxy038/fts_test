The author describes the Scalable Neural Array Processor (SNAP), a single-instruction/multiple data (SIMD) parallel processing architecture for solving artificial neural systems, including Hopfield networks, adaptive resonance theory networks, multi-layer perceptron with back error propagation, and bidirectional associative memories. SNAP offers a low-cost, viable, neural network processing engine for real-time applications and research

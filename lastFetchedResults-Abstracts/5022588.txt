A single-phase power injection system for photovoltaic generation plants based in two collaborative inverters is presented in this paper. The first converter works as a quasi-square waveform inverter with the main objective of injecting the energy produced by the photovoltaic generation system. The second converter acts as an active power filter with the objective that the current that flows from or to the grid is sinusoidal. The presented power injection system will be able to achieve a sinusoidal current even when a non-linear load is connected to the same point of common coupling. The performance of the proposed system, including the maximum power point tracking algorithm, is evaluated through simulation.

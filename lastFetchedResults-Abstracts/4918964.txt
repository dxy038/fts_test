This paper focuses on optimizing product-mix problem using real-world data of a food processing industry. The extensively used LP model has been remodeled using fuzzy sets and applied to the real-world problem. The developed LP model is able to consider the fuzziness in the parameters and to tackle the presence of multiple objective functions. The degree of satisfaction of the product-mix decision-maker in terms of (i) the total profit obtained and (ii) the waste resulted, is at least 70%, which is encouraging

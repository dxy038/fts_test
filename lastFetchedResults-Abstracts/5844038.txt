Nonconventional control techniques (fuzzy logic control, neural control, numerical based fuzzy control etc.) have been fully used to implement automatic control of physical systems. In this paper, a novel nonconventional control technique, namely &#8220;interval based control&#8221;, is presented. The objective is the automatic control of physical systems represented by imprecise mathematical models. For the purpose of investigating the basic performance of the newly developed technique, one laboratory-scale plant was used, viz. a crane with two degrees of freedom. Experimental results, including a comparison with the conventional state variable feedback control technique, are also presented

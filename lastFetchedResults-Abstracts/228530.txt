The objective of the beamforming with the exploitation
of a sensor array is to enhance the signals of the sources
from desired directions, suppress the noises and the interfering
signals from other directions, and/or simultaneously provide the
localization of the associated sources. In this paper, we present a
higher order cumulant-based beamforming algorithm, namely,
the super-exponential blind adaptive beamforming algorithm,
which is extended from the super-exponential algorithm (SEA)
and the inverse filter criteria (IFC). While both SEA and IFC
assume noise-free conditions, this requirement is no longer
needed, and all the noise components are taken into account in
the proposed algorithm. Two special conditions are derived under
which the proposed blind beamforming algorithm achieves the
performance of the corresponding optimal nonblind beamformer
in the sense of minimum mean square error (MMSE). Simulation
results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and robust to
diverse initial weight vectors; its performance with the use of the
fourth-order cumulants is close to that of the nonblind optimal
MMSE beamformer.

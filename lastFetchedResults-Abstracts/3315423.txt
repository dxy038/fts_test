Supply chain networks entail a large amount of investments and that is why they are expected to work for a long time horizon in an economic way. But just considering economic aspects cannot ensure the optimum state of networks design and nowadays, there is a need for considering the other effecting aspects such as environmental and social factors. In this research, we provide a comprehensive mathematical framework of supply chain networks design based on the three above mentioned factors. Our proposed model is made based on certain contributions which are considered especially in social responsible factors. Because of the NP-Hard nature of the problem and since our model is a multi-objective model, a meta-heuristic, namely differential evolution multi objective has been applied to find Pareto-archive solutions. For tuning the parameters of the algorithm, we apply response surface methodology.

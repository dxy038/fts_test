The objective was to evaluate both the effectiveness and safety of urapidil in management of hypertensive emergencies (HE) in the prehospital setting. This was an open, prospective study for 6 months. We evaluated systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean blood pressure (MBP), and heart rate (HR) with continuous noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring in 16 consecutive cases of HE. We used urapidil at different doses (25 to 100 mg) at 5 minute intervals, according to the blood pressure response. The basal DBP was 127 Â± 16 mmHg. Urapidil was effective in 15 patients. ANOVA test showed a significant drop out in DBP (P< .0001) and HR (P< .004). The highest decrease was obtained in the first 10 minutes. The decrease in DBP and HR values were significant at 5 minutes versus basal (P< .05) and at 10 versus 5 minutes (P< .01). All adverse effects had little relevance. Urapidil is effective and safe in management of HE when used by a medical team in the prehospital setting.

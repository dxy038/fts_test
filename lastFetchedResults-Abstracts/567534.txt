The main objective of the present study is investigation of mercury bioaccumulation relation to length, weight, age and sex factors at liver of Zander fish. For this purpose, in Winter 2005 at western Caspian Sea shores (from Jefroud fishery station to Anzali wetland) 21 numbers Zander fish were obtained and then after biometry (measuring length, age and weight) and sex determination, the mercury concentration at liver were detected by Advanced Mercury Analyzer254, LECO. Based on the results, mercury concentration at liver (ppb in dry weight) was 0.338Â±0.097. The results showed significant differences between age and weight factors with mercury accumulation at liver (P < 0.05) while sex and length factors showed any significant differences on mercury concentration at liver (P > 0.05).

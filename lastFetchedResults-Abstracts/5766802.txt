In a society based on knowledge, the knowledge is crucial factor to innovation. It is impossible for a firm to possess all the knowledge for innovation. Tacit knowledge is harder than explicit knowledge in delivering information. In general, we know that explicit knowledge can be spillover through formal channel. On the contrary tacit knowledge can be delivered with ease through the informal channels. The purpose of this paper is to find whether the network activities based on social capital (trust and shared objective) differ in Korea clusters or not. Using data collected from multiple respondents in firms, we found there were no differences formal channel and informal channel regardless of industry sectors.

Objective. The aim of this study is to determine associations between method of payment for dental services and perceived oral health in the UK.

Method. A national UK study involving a random probability sample of 2718 adults. Respondents were interviewed in their homes about their method of payment for dental services (private or NHS), service use (time and reason for last dental visit), self-reported oral health status (number of teeth possessed and denture status) and the impact of their oral health on their quality of life (employing the 16-item OHQoL-UKÂ© measure).

Results. The response rate was 68% (1838/2718). Thirty one percent (575/1838) claimed they paid privately for dental services the last occasion they visited their dentist. This was associated with self-reported number of teeth possessed (P<0.01), denture status (P<0.01), WHO goal of retaining 20 teeth with and without a prosthesis (P<0.05), impact of oral health on life quality (P<0.01), and number of positive oral health influences experienced (P<0.01). However, these associations did not remain apparent having accounted for socio-demographic factors (age, gender, and social class background) and reported dental attendance pattern.

Conclusion. Difference in perceived oral health exists between private and NHS dental service users. However, this is more likely to be attributed to socio-demographic factors and regular use of services rather than method of payment

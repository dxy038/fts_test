A novel approach to construct accurate and interpretable high-dimensional fuzzy classification system is proposed in this paper. First, in order to relieve the problem of dimension disaster, a feature selection is accomplished by the Simba algorithm. Then a fuzzy clustering algorithm is using to identify an initial fuzzy system. Finally the structure and parameters of the fuzzy system are optimized by Multi-objective genetic algorithm. The proposed approach is applied to the Wisconsin Breast Cancer benchmark problem, and the results show its validity.

When designing assembly processes it is particularly difficult to determine the optimum automation level, i.e., the ratio of manual to automatic assembly operation times. This factor considerably affects the productivity since it determines product assembly labour intensity, the number of assemblers and the type and cost of equipment. The system module presented allows considerable flexibility in the analysis and assessment of product suitability for automatic assembly, the selection of assembly equipment and the creation of new configurations of assembly stands, depending on changing needs of manufactured products. By interrelating product design and technological features with productivity and production cost-effectiveness ratios the module allows one to derive a simpler and more objective method of determining the automation level.

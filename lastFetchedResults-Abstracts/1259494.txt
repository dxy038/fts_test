Assessment of the optimal mixture is an important issue to obtain desired quality. This paper integrates grey relational analysis and an objective weighting technique into the Taguchi method to propose the weighted Grey-Taguchi method. This method can be employed to assess the optimal mixture with multiple responses. In the application of this method, water/cement ratio, volume ratio of recycled coarse aggregate, replacement by river sand, content of crushed brick, and cleanliness of aggregate are selected as control factors with responses of slump, slump-flow, resistivity (7-day, 14-day, 28-day), ultrasonic pulse velocity (7-day, 14-day, 28-day), and compressive strength (7-day, 14-day, 28-day) to assess the optimal mixture of recycled aggregate concrete. Results demonstrate and verify that the optimal mixture has a water/cement ratio of 0.5, a volume fraction of recycled coarse aggregate of 42.0%, 100% replacement of river sand, 0% crushed brick, and water-washed aggregates.

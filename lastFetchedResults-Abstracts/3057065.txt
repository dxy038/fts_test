In this paper, we discuss a spectral quadratic-SDP method for the iterative resolution of fixed-order H/sub 2/ and H/sub /spl infin// design problems. These problems can be cast as regular SDP programs with additional nonlinear equality constraints. When the inequalities are absorbed into a Lagrangian function the problem reduces to solving a sequence of SDP with quadratic objective function for which a spectral SDP method has been developed. Along with a description of the spectral SDP method used to solve the tangent subproblems, we report a number of computational results for validation purposes.

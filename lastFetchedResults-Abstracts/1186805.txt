This paper presents a new optimization method for coupled vehicle–bridge systems subjected to uneven road surface excitation. The vehicle system is simplified as a multiple rigid-body model and the single-span bridge is modeled as a simply supported Bernoulli–Euler beam. The pseudo-excitation method transforms the random surface roughness into the superposition of a series of deterministic pseudo-harmonic excitations, which enables convenient and accurate computation of first and second order sensitivity information. The precise integration method is used to compute the vertical random vibrations for both the vehicle and the bridge. The sensitivities are used to find the optimal solution, with vehicle ride comfort taken as the objective function. Optimization efficiency and computational accuracy are demonstrated numerically.

In the near future, besides the first and second generation Digital Video Broadcasting -Terrestrial (DVB-T/T2) standards, the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) system will be the most widespread to provide multimedia services in excellent quality, mainly in Europe. These systems can operate in a shared UHF frequency band and significantly affect the performance of the systems colliding. This paper deals with the study of co-channel coexistence between DVB-T/H and LTE systems in a shared frequency band. To measure the impact of the interfering LTE RF signal (with various bandwidths and RF signal levels) on the DVB-T/H one, an appropriate measurement testbed is realized. Objective parameters (namely bit and modulation error ratio) are used to evaluate the overall influence of the LTE mobile services on the DVB-T/H digital TV services. Finally, to explore the impact of the interference effects on DVB-T/H TV signal a digital video quality analyzer is used.

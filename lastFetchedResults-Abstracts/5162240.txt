This paper presents a new algorithm for the voiced/unvoiced (V/UV) decision of noise-corrupted speech. A speech periodicity-harmonic function (SPHF) is proposed to manifest distinctive characteristics between voiced and unvoiced regions. A composite feature vector is developed by combining a periodicity measure obtained from the SPHF with some energy measures such as zero-crossing rate-weighted RMS energy, Kaiser-Teager frame energy and the normalized low-frequency energy ratio. Unlike the conventional hard threshold, a signal-dependent initial-threshold (SDIT) for each feature is determined based on its statistical properties. The SDIT is exploited to develop a logical expression that returns an objective score regarding V/UV region. Additional voicing criteria are introduced to remove the artifacts that may exist due to the overlapping between decision regions. Simulation results of the proposed multifeature classification scheme, using the Keele reference database, show superior efficacy at a low SNR relative to some of the existing V/UV decision algorithms

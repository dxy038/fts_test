Recently, more and more natural image statistics are found useful for image restoration problems. In this paper, we propose a noise reduction technique by use of color-line assumption for natural color images. Based on the color-line model, we propose an algorithm to analyse local color statistics and recover the original image by promoting color linearity of a local patch. Moreover, the proposed method is employed on superpixels to alleviate the boundary effect of the denoising operation. The experimental results show that the proposed method can collaborate with existing noise reduction methods to successfully further boost the quality in both perceptual and objective evaluations.

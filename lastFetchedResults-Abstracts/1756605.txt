Objective
ument performance and satisfaction of medical students in a short course on liaison psychiatry.
s
phasis in this optional course is placed on the discussion of clinical cases, bed-side clinical teaching, and a research-oriented part. The "Innovative Teaching Plan" (ITP) is intended to train student-leaders to guide small groups (SG) of students. Trainee performance was assessed by the marks in the final examination, and a reliable and valid tool, the Medical Teaching Quality Questionnaire (MTQQ) was used to document trainee satisfaction. The results of four academic courses are presented in this report.
s
al experts consulted assured that the content of the course was adequate. It has been completed by more than 200 medical students, and high marks have been obtained by most. Above average scores (AA, “high” or “very high”) were given by substantial proportions of students in most items, related to the “relevance” of the subject, the “usefulness of the clinical cases” or the "enhancement of student-teacher interaction". Compared to the first academic course, students’ satisfaction has improved. "Enhancement of a researcher's mind" was rated AA by 61.1% of students in the last academic course, and "global satisfaction" by 88.8%.
sions
erformance and high satisfaction of medical students was documented in a course on liaison psychiatry. Lessons may be drawn to inform about efficient and effective ways of teaching and learning this subject.

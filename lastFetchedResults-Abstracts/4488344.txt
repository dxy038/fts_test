Many people with disabilities rely upon items of assistive technology for their independence. However, in many cases, the potential of a specific assistive device is limited by the difficulties in actual user operation. Whilst success in use of a particular interface depends on appropriateness of the user´s skills to the interface physical characteristics, there is a need to develop novel systems that will provide quantitative skills relevant to interface operation. The i-match project, funded by the European Commission, focuses on quantifying upper limb skills and performance as well as characterising different interfaces based on their physical and functional characteristics. The objective is to aid the selection of an optimum interface by matching between user´s abilities to control and features of an existing interface. This paper overviews the project and different steps taken to produce a novel matching system.

The digital camcorder system DV, which features advanced intraframe DCT-based video compression, has been successfully introduced for the consumer and semi-professional users. In DV standard, DCT-mode can be selected from two modes, 1&#215;8&#215;8 DCT-mode and 2&#215;4&#215;8 DCT-mode to improve picture quality after bit rate reduction. It is known that the 2&#215;4&#215;8 DCT-mode is selected in case of the big difference between two fields. It is also proven that the quality of 2&#215;4&#215;8 DCT-mode is better than that of the 1&#215;8&#215;8 DCT-mode when high motion is involved. This paper focuses on the new DCT-mode selection scheme that can improve the picture quality compared to the conventional method using a threshold optimization method. As a result both subjective and objective quality of the picture is improved as compared with the conventional scheme

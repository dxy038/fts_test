Background: This study was performed in children aged <15 years, at the Pediatric Neurology Clinic of Imam Reza Hospital affiliated to Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. The objective of this study was to recognize the main predisposing factors that result in uncontrolled seizures in patients so that we can start the treatment accurately. Methods: There were two groups of patients; group I, consisted of 51 patients, with minimum refractory seizures of one episode per month while taking at least two antieplieptic drugs, and group II, comprised of 80 well-controlled patients chosen at random, who had no fit within 6 months after starting the treatment. Results: Factors affecting the occurrence of refractory seizures included age <1 year, multiple seizures before starting the treatment, male gender, myoclonic seizures, neurologic defects, neonatal and daily seizures, and first abnormal electroencephalogram and brain computerized tomography scan. Conclusion: There are several factors that can predict development of uncontrolled seizures. Knowledge of these factors helps us to discriminate our patients and pay more attention to those at risk of developing uncontrolled seizures.

Traditionally electric power systems are operated in such a way that the total fuel cost is minimized regardless of emissions produced. With increased requirements for environmental protection, alternative strategies are required. This paper presents a summary of algorithms of environmental-economic dispatch in electric power systems since 1970. The algorithms attempt to reduce the production of atmospheric emissions such as NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>x</sub> caused by the operation of fossil-fueled thermal generation. Such reduction is achieved by including emissions either as a constraint or as a weighted function the objective of the overall dispatching problem

A 15-year-old boy presented with several months history of bilateral axillary lymph adenopathies which were ulcerated subsequently. He had received anti-tuberculosis therapy for more than six months based on suspicious diagnosis of scrofuloderma. Histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of specific lesions of Hodgkin's disease. These lesions were probably metastatic due to retrograde lymphatic spread from his axillary lymph nodes, as this way is the most common mode of Hodgkin's disease spreading to the skin. The patient received chemotherapy regimen for Hodgkin's disease and ulcers resolved remarkably.

Optimal placement of protection devices in radial feeders is important to ensure power system reliability. Distributed generation is being adopted in distribution networks with one of the objectives being enhancement of system reliability. In this paper, an ant colony system (ACS) algorithm is used to derive the optimal recloser placement scheme for a distributed generation-enhanced feeder. A composite reliability index is defined as the objective function in the optimization procedure. Simulation work is carried out based on a 69-segment 8-lateral distribution feeder with distributed generation to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method

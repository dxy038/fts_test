The unsustainability of the present production–consumption energy model highlights the finite nature of conventional energy resources, as well as the environmental degradation inherent in such a model. Today's environmental policies are largely devoted to fostering the development and implementation in Europe of renewable energy technologies. This paper analyses the present and future situation of renewable energy resources in Andalusia in the south of Spain, and more specifically, of solar energy with an average potential radiation of 4.6±0.3 kW h/m2 per day. In Andalusia energy policies are generally implemented through regional development plans such as the Plan Energético de Andalucía (PLEAN)11Energy Development Plan for Andalusia.
he Programa Andaluz de Promoción de Energías Renovables (PROSOL).22Andalusian Programme for the Development of Renewable Energies.
rinciple objective of the latter programme is to implement and increase high-temperature solar thermal energy to 100 MW in 2006, even raising it to 230 MW in 2010. Regarding low-temperature solar thermal energy installations, there are plans to increase the quantity of m2/1000 installed per inhabitant from the present figure of 14 to a total of 142. Regarding individual installations of solar photovoltaic energy, the present aim is to cover 20.4% of the national objectives and 15% in installations connected to the electricity network. The geographic location of Andalusia in the south of Spain signifies that it is in a key position to play an important strategic role in the implementation of renewable energy technology in Europe, as well as providing sufficient energy for its own needs and even exporting such projects to other countries.

This work study two groups of synchronizers, namely the deterministic phase synchronizer and the random phase synchronizer. The difference between them is only inside of the phase comparator.In the first group, the VCO (voltage controlled oscillator) synchronizes with the input deterministic phase of an expected periodic transition. In the second group the VCO synchronizes with the input random phase of an unexpected no periodic transition. Each group is studied under four topologies (analog, hybrid, combinational and sequential). The objective is to evaluate the two synchronizers groups with the four topologies and to observe their jitter behaviors with the noise.

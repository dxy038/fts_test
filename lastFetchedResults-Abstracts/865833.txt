Our objective was to study mature grains of crops grown on various areas of power plant ash and bottom slag deposits. It was found that good grain quality with the application of usual agricultural techniques and intensified fertilization on various parts of ash and bottom slag deposits may be achieved with: autumn rye (Secale cereale L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), barley (Hordeum sativum Jessen) and, to a lesser extent, winter raps (Brassica napus L.).

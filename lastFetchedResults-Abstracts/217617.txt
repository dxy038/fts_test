Several studies have been published on the epidemiology of childhood
malignancies worldwide. The primary objective of this study is to determine the relative
frequency of pediatric cancers in Iran.
Methods: Using a retrospective approach, all confirmed cases of malignancies aged 14 years
old or less at the time of first referral to the department of radiation oncology of Jorjani hospital
entered to the study. Registered pediatric cancers from 1972 to 2001 were classified into 12
groups according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer (ICCC).
Results: Among 1881 registered malignancies, leukemia was the most common form (36.8%).
Thereafter, in descending order of frequency were lymphoma (16.6%), CNS (14.2%), kidney
(7.1%), soft tissue (5.8%), bone (5.2%), retinoblastoma (4.9%), sympathetic nervous system
(3.5%), epithelial (2.3%), and germ cell tumors (2.1%). Only five patients (0.3%) had liver
cancer.
Conclusion: Like other similar studies worldwide, leukemia, lymphoma, and CNS tumors were
the most common types of childhood cancers in our study. Since relative frequency of cancers
in referred patients to a radiation oncology department cannot give a precise estimation about
cancer prevalence in the country, establishing a national cancer registry can lead to achieve
more accurate cancer prevalence and incidence rate.

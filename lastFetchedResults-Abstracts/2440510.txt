This paper presents a novel method for facial expression recognition that employs the combination of two different feature sets in an ensemble approach. A pool of base support vector machine classifiers is created using Gabor filters and Local Binary Patterns. Then a multi-objective genetic algorithm is used to search for the best ensemble using as objective functions the minimization of both the error rate and the size of the ensemble. Experimental results on JAFFE and Cohn-Kanade databases have shown the efficiency of the proposed strategy in finding powerful ensembles, which improves the recognition rates between 5% and 10% over conventional approaches that employ single feature sets and single classifiers.

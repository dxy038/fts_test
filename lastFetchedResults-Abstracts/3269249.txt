This paper studies a DC Corrective Security-Constrained OPF (SCOPF) in electricity networks in which the transmission lines are potentially instrumented with Distributed Flexible AC Transmission Systems (DFACTS). Hence, in the considered SCOPF, the transmission lines´ reactance along with the generators´ output are considered as control variables. The objective of this SCOPF model is to obtain minimum generation cost while maintaining the system N-1 secure. Benders decomposition is applied to solve the discussed DC SCOPF problem. Case studies for the IEEE 30-bus test system, the IEEE 39-bus test system and the IEEE 118-bus test system are presented. The performance of Benders decomposition is compared to a brute force approach, in which the DC SCOPF is solved as a single optimization problem, with respect to run-time and accuracy of the results.

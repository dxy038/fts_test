Objective: Our purpose was to evaluate whether tamoxifen has estrogenic endometrial effects as defined by histologic study or alterations in steroid hormone receptor expression.
Study design: Nineteen postmenopausal tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients who also had endometrial sampling were identified from files in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. To examine the subgroup of 15 polyps, age-matched, non-hormonally treated patients with polyps (n=8) or atrophic endometria (n=5) served as comparison groups. Proliferative (n=3) and secretory (n=5) endometria served as procedural controls. Immunohistochemical studies for steroid receptors (estrogen, progesterone) were performed.
Results: Glandular cell progesterone receptor was significantly increased and stromal cell estrogen receptor was significantly decreased in tamoxifen-treated versus atrophic endometria. Progesterone receptor staining was not significantly different in tamoxifen-treated versus control polyps, although staining was high in both groups. Stromal cell estrogen receptor staining was significantly reduced in tamoxifen-treated versus control polyps, although there were no histologic differences. Reduced stromal cell estrogen receptor and increased glandular cell progesterone receptor staining was found in all tamoxifen-treated endometria regardless of the diagnosis.
Conclusion: The tamoxifen-associated changes in endometrial steroid receptors support an estrogenic effect that is independent of histologic diagnosis and duration of use. This may contribute to the pathogenesis of tamoxifen-associated polyps and carcinomas.

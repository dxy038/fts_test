This paper proposes output feedback control for fuzzy descriptor systems with interval time-varying delay. First, singular nonlinear dynamic systems with interval time-varying delay are taken into consideration. Then using a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model, we design a fuzzy representation of the original nonlinear system. This fuzzy representation consists of local linear descriptor systems. To achieve the control objective, a fuzzy controller and observer is designed in a systematic manner. The stability analysis of the overall closed-loop fuzzy system leads to formulation of linear matrix inequalities. Using the observer and controller gains by solving LMIs, we carry out numerical simulations which verify theoretical statements.

The permanent magnet synchronous reluctance machine (PMSynRM) is a combination of the characteristics of two machine types: High efficiency, high power density of the permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) as well as better high-speed performance and lower costs of the synchronous reluctance machine (SynRM). This paper presents a general approach for the electro-magnetic design of a PMSynRM. Essential design rules for constructing a PMSynRM are shown. In particular the rotor configuration is improved by dimensioning of the bridges between flux barriers and air gap. An interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (IPMSM) with two layers which form the flux barriers in the rotor is used as reference. The results are concluded in an objective function.

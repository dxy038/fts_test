This paper introduces a framework to show sacrificed elements of TEFL in Iranian Secondary
Education. In spite of the undeniable progress of language education in Iran, there are a
number of problems which frustrate teachers and learners provoking poor results. Some of the
problems involve decisions about language and methodology taken by teachers who are still
too concerned about form and grammar.
These elements of TEFL are based on four pillars: the task-based approach, the content-based
approach, language awareness and intercultural competence. The task-based approach is the
framework in which academic contents are dealt with. Language awareness represents a new
perspective on form and grammar within a communicative approach. Finally, the intercultural
competence is the educational objective of language education. Each of these four concepts
has theoretical and practical implications which may help redefine the curricular design of
English teaching in Iran.

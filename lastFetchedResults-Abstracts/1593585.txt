SummaryBackground
ulosis infection and disease remain a significant cause of global morbidity and mortality. The burden of tuberculosis disease is greatest in the developing nations of the world, although the effect of imported disease is observed in low-incidence tuberculosis regions, represented predominantly by high-income countries. In these regions, national tuberculosis control and elimination programmes are increasingly challenged to address disease in foreign-born residents. Immigration policies and shifting migration patterns over the past 5 decades have brought larger numbers of permanent and temporary residency migrants from high-prevalence regions of the world into low tuberculosis incidence environments. As a consequence, both national immigration policies and global health strategies for the control of tuberculosis share common interest in mobile populations moving from high-to-low prevalence regions. Existing immigration medical screening practices in major immigrant-receiving nations were often designed to prevent and manage the importation of contagious, active pulmonary tuberculosis disease. Such programmes may be limited in addressing the long-term consequences of latent tuberculosis infection in foreign-born residents. In nations with a low incidence of tuberculosis, a direct link can be found between the globalization of health factors related to international population movements, as observed with tuberculosis and immigration policies and practices. Continued migration from high-endemic tuberculosis regions will increasingly influence the disease burden in low-endemic areas, and challenge local tuberculosis control and elimination programmes. Evidence-based approaches to meeting those challenges will allow for the effective use of resources and support ongoing programme evaluation.

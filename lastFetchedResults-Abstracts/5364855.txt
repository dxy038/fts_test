The paper proposes novel FACTS based stabilization scheme for maximum energy utilization of a tidal energy system using particle swarm optimization PSO search technique. PSO is implemented in the control of a hybrid low cost dynamic filter/capacitor compensation DFC and static VAR compensator SVC (TCR+FC) scheme. The dynamic self regulating control method uses real time error to stabilize the tidal wave energy conversion scheme (TWEC). The control objective is to track and extract maximum available energy from the tidal wave energy scheme and transfer this energy efficiency to the local isolated electric load. A novel coordinated dual action multi loop error driven controller for the hybrid SVC and DFC stabilization scheme was developed by the first author and used to adjust the PWM switching of the hybrid DFC- and static VAR compensator SVC. Power factor correction and power quality enhancement are validated under different operation conditions, including load switching and tidal velocity excursions.

This proceedings contains 109 papers selected from presentations at the 2012 Symposium on Piezoelectricity, Acoustic Waves, and Device Applications (SPAWDA 2012), which was successfully held during November 23&#8211;25, 2012 at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. SPAWDA is an interdisciplinary, multi-field, and industry-focused technical forum with international flavor, which has been rapidly growing in recent years. Focusing on the analyses, design, and applications of piezoelectric devices, the objective of SPAWDA is to promote coordinated integration of theoretical research and product design, to accelerate the development of modern sensor technology, to advance the integrated circuits technology, and more importantly, to conceive novel piezoelectric acoustic wave devices with fully-featured capabilities. Under the strong support of the Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (CSTAM), the Acoustic Society of China (ASC), and the IEEE UFFC Society, SPAWDA has been successfully held six times in Ningbo University (2004), Zhejiang University (2006), Nanjing University of Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics (2008), Huazhong University of Science and Technology (2009), Xiamen University (2010) and Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Science (2011).

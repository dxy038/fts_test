Cropping intensity is one of the major factors in crop production and agricultural intensification. A new double-cropping croplands mapping methodology using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series datasets through continuous wavelet transform was proposed in this study. This methodology involved four steps. First, daily continuous MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series datasets were developed for the study year. Next, the EVI time series datasets were transformed into a two dimensional (timeâ€“frequency) wavelet scalogram based on continuous wavelet transform. Third, a feature extraction process was conducted on the wavelet scalogram, where the characteristic spectra were calculated from the wavelet scalogram and the feature peak within two skeleton lines was obtained. Finally, a threshold was determined for feature peak values to discriminate double-cropping croplands within each pixel. The application of the proposed procedure to China's Henan Province in 2010 produced an objective and accurate spatial distribution map, which correlated well with in situ observation data (over 90% agreement). The proposed new methodology efficiently handled complex variability that might be caused by regional variation in climate, management practices, growth peaks by winter weed or winter wheat, and data noise. Therefore, the methodology shows promise for future studies at regional and global scales.

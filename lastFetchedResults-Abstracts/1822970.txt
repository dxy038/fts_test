Objective
rpose of this study was to clarify the interaction of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs)-C and -D with cell surface foetal liver kinase-1 (Flk-1) and fms-like tyrosine kinase-4 (Flt-4) receptors in the induction and activity of osteoclasts in cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

were cultured on chamber slides or on ivory discs for 2 or 3 weeks in the presence of macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), VEGF-A, -C or -D, or placental growth factor (PlGF) with or without receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL). The number of osteoclasts in each group was counted and the area of ivory resorption was measured. In addition, osteoclast differentiation was further analysed under the same conditions, but with the addition of specific neutralizing antibodies against Flk-1 and Flt-4.
s
was essential for the induction of osteoclasts in PBMCs. However, significant differences were found in the number of osteoclasts induced by VEGF-A, -C, -D or M-CSF with RANKL compared with control groups lacking or containing RANKL. Blocking of either Flk-1 or Flt-4 resulted in a reduction in the enhancement of osteoclast differentiation in PBMCs by VEGF-C or -D with RANKL. The osteoclasts induced by VEGF-A, -C, -D or M-CSF with RANKL formed significantly larger resorption lacunae than those formed by osteoclasts induced by RANKL alone.
sions
tudy showed that VEGF-C and -D play a role in the induction of osteoclast differentiation through both Flk-1 and Flt-4 receptors and influence the area of the ivory resorption in PBMCs.

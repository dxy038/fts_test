Software Performance Engineering (SPE) evaluates the key performance
factors such as response time and utilization in the entire life cycle of software development.
One of the important issues of software performance is bottlenecks that have not been
investigated much till now in the process of SPE. Meanwhile, Bottleneck detection and
mitigation in software modeling stage is quality-centered and cost eective. Layered
bottleneck is a type of bottleneck that occurs in systems with layered services and aects its
utilization more than 
at bottlenecks. The presented approach in this paper has selected
Layered Queening Network (LQN) as an appropriate performance model to present and
analyze the layered bottlenecks. The process of SPE from software model to performance
model has been automatically implemented. Also, an optimization stage is added to nd
the best specication of software model in a way that the strength of the bottleneck, the
response time and the cost will be minimized. To assess the proposed solution, two recently
proposed multi-objective gravitational search algorithms are employed. To evaluate the
eectiveness of the applied algorithms, two well-known multi-objective algorithms: NSGAII
and MOPSO are also applied to a case study, and a comprehensive comparison is
presented.

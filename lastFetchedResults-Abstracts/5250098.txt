According to studies, buildings use around 40% of the total energy consumption in the world. Most of this consumed energy comes from fossil fuel, one of the sources of environmental pollution. The Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB) is an alternative to this alarming pollution. Thus the main objective of this research paper is to integrate the renewable energy sources (RES) and the utility grid with the electrical load of NZEB. To achieve this goal, power electronic converters are required to interface RES with the grid and the NZEB. A control strategy of 3-phase 4-wire inverter and dc-dc boost converter is developed to accomplish the following tasks: 1) to transfer power generated from RES to the NZEB and to inject the surplus to the grid 2) to extract the maximum power produced by the RES, to compensate harmonic currents, current unbalance load, reactive power demand and to cancel zero sequence current in the neutral wire. The proposed NZEB and its control technique are validated using the &#8220;MATLAB/Simulink program&#8221;. The results are promising.

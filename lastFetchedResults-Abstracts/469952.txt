Objective
The purpose of this study was to describe the outcomes of a 10-year cohort of pregnancies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and to evaluate clinical and laboratory markers for adverse outcomes.
Study design
We reviewed all pregnancies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus who were seen at Stanford University from 1991 to 2001. Univariate analyses were performed to identify potential risk factors for adverse outcomes.
Results
Sixty-three pregnancies in 48 women were identified. Approximately 35% of the pregnancies occurred in women with previous renal disease and 10% in women with previous central nervous system disease. Flares occurred in 68% of the pregnancies, the majority of which were mild to moderate. Preeclampsia complicated 12 pregnancies. Factors that were associated with premature delivery included prednisone use at conception (relative risk, 1.8), the use of antihypertensive medications (relative risk, 1.8), and a severe flare during pregnancy (relative risk, 2.0). Thrombocytopenia was associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia (relative risk, 3.2).
Conclusion
Flares, most of which were mild to moderate, occurred most of the pregnancies in our cohort of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and prednisone use may be predictive factors for particular adverse outcomes.

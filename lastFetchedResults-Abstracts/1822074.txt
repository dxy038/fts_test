Objective
ontitis is a group of inflammatory diseases that affect connective tissue attachments and the supporting bone that surround the teeth. Osteoclasts are responsible for skeletal modeling and remodeling but may also destroy bone in several bone diseases, including osteoporosis and periodontitis. This study examined the anti-inflammatory effects of Panax notoginseng (PN) on periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLFs) and RAW264.7 cells under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced inflammatory conditions.

fects of PN on PDLFs were determined by measuring the cell viability and mRNA expression of tissue-destructive proteins. The effects of PN on osteoclasts were examined by measuring the following: (1) the cell viability, (2) the formation of Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)(+) multinucleated cells, (3) MAPK signaling pathways, (4) mRNA expression of inflammatory-related proteins and (5) nitric oxide (NO) production.
s
butanol extracts of PN (bPN) increased the cell proliferation of the PDLFs and decreased the mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 in the PDLFs. bPN inhibited the formation of LPS-stimulated TRAP(+) multinucleated cells. bPN also inhibited the LPS-stimulated activation of JNK and ERK signaling, and inhibited the LPS-stimulated degradation of IKB in the RAW264.7 cells. In addition, bPN decreased the mRNA expression of MMP-9 and iNOS, which are involved in the range of pathophysiological processes, such as inflammation in the RAW264.7 cells. NO production was also decreased via the inhibition of iNOS.
sions
findings suggest that bPN has therapeutic effects on bone-destructive processes, such as those that occur in periodontal diseases.

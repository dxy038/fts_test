The antigen (Ag) CFP-10, found in tissue fluids of tuberculosis (TB) patients, is an excellent candidate for use as a sensitive TB marker for early and simplified diagnosis of TB when combined with an effective sensing method. In this study, chemical and optical optimizations were carried out using novel immuno-materials to establish a self-assembled surface plasmon resonance (SPR) optical immunosensing system for the detection of CFP-10 Ag in clinical urine samples from TB patients, which is the first clinical trial as far as we know to monitor Ag in urine. To create a simple sensing interface, a monoclonal antibody (anti-CFP-10) was immobilized directly on a gold surface, followed by blocking with cystamine. The orientation and accessibility of anti-CFP-10 were assessed by the selective binding of CFP-10. The results reveal a linear relationship between the SPR angle shift and the acid-fast bacilli stain stage (0â€“4) of TB patients. Significant differences were seen between urine samples from TB patients and controls. This method, using urine samples and SPR spectroscopy, is promising and can be rapidly developed into a reliable diagnostic method to monitor TB.

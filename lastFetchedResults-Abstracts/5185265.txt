The COELBA utility´s primary objective was to satisfy the energy needs of its customers. To continue doing this as far as possible while reducing consumption presented a substantial challenge. This goal was achieved through a combination of political, institutional and organizational activities. The purpose of this study is to describe these steps in the hope that COELBA´s experience will be helpful to other utilities. The energy situation in northeastern Brazil and Bahia in December, 1986, and the basic premises that required load curtailment are outlined. The parameters involved, legal aspects and rationing criteria are described. Important operational aspects of quota system application are discussed and the total energy saving and financial loss are presented as well as the main lessons and spin-offs of this experience

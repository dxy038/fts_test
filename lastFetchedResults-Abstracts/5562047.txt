In this paper we outline a novel approach for the design of an electric vehicle (EV) aggregator, a controller whose objective is to optimally manage the charging operations of an EV fleet. The control strategy we derive is based on model predictive control and allows to achieve costs minimization, also enabling the aggregator (hence, the EV fleet) to participate to the provisioning of active demand services to upper level market players. Explicative simulations are presented and discussed in order to show the effectiveness of the approach and also to investigate the role of vehicle to grid power.

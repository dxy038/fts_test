The successful orthognathic surgery is directly influenced by more accurate measurement of distance or size of the surgery area. There exist various methods of measurements during the orthognathic surgery. One of the newest methods is to make measurements by using stereo vision system with stereo cameras. The result of stereo vision is affected by many factors, such as captured image colour, glossiness, ambient light, geometry, etc. One of the most important influence factors is ambient light, especially on measuring distances with the value of microns (10<sup>-6</sup> m). The stereo vision systemÂ´s cameras are also influenced by ambient light and the objective of this paper is to investigate more accurate result of stereo vision according to the ambient light of the orthognathic surgery operation room.

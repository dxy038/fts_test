Aims. Fusarium species are the most important group of fungi that produced a variety of mycotoxins which can contaminate food. The objective of the present study was presentation and identification of one isolate from Fusarium species belong to section of sporotrichiella, that recently isolated from stored wheat of Tehran province.

Methods. This species isolated and purified by freeze blotter and single-spore method, respectively. Isolates cultured onto CLA, SNA, PDA and PSA. All microscopic and macroscopic characters studied. The DNA of this isolate amplified by PCR with F. sporotrichioides and F. langsethiae specific primers. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of isolate amplified, purified and sequenced using universal primers ITS4 & ITS5 and the fraction of TEF-la gene also using external and nested primers.

Results. On the basis of morphology and ribosomal internal, transcribed spacer (ITS) classified as F. langsethiae but on the basis of partial translation TEF-la gene grouped with F. sporotrichioides.

Conclusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report in Iran and Asia. Therefore, a large-scale monitoring of these fungi and T-2 toxin on wheat in Iran is necessary.

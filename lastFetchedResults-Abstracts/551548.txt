Background and Objective: some studies shown that position of fetus in uterus could be some lower limb deformities. Up to now, no research has been done about relationship between type of delivery and tibiofemoral developing. We were investigated to consider of this relationship in people between 3-16 years old in Ahvaz city .
Subjects and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 853 people (455 girls and 398 boys). Tibiofemoral (TF) angle, Intercondylar and intermalleolar distances were measured in standing position with knees and hip in full extension. Information about a kind of delivery (caesarian or vaginal) were taken by questionnaires in which was completed by their parents.
Results: TF angle in cesarean sections was more than in vaginal deliveries and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.02). Intercondylar and intermalleolar distances in cesarean sections were more than in vaginal deliveries but the differences were not statistically signÂ¬ificant.
AAA
Conclusion: There is significant relationship between tibiofemoral and type of delivery, but for the future work need to evaluate the effect of fetal position and adaptathions(mechanism of laber) in the development of tibiofemoral angle after birth. Sci Med J 2011; 9(6):581-585

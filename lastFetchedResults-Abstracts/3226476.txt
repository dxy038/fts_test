During line contingencies, overloads in transmission lines occur, which can destabilize the system. These line overloads can be minimized by placing Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) with appropriate setting. In this paper, possible single contingencies are created in transmission lines and the effects are calculated in terms of Contingency Severity Index (CSI) and Performance Index (PI) methods. The calculated values from both the methods are ranked in ascending order. The top ranked lines are more severely affected, which is also the correct location for placement of TCSC. TCSCÂ´s are placed in top three lines taken from CSI and PI methods, and their effects in minimizing the overloads and objective function is noticed. A comparative study is done on the effects of TCSC placement by two ranking methods. The results are calculated for a sample IEEE 6 and a practical 30 Bus Indian system. The optimal setting of TCSC is done by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Technique.

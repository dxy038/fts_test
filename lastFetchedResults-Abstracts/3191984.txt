This research article analyses the concept of &#8220;Organisational Resilience&#8221; (OR), with a specific focus on how this is understood in the South African services sector. The research constitutes both a literature study and a narrative inquiry. The latter entails interviews conducted with thirty-two South African business leaders, involved in the services sector. The institutions concerned range from financial and technical institutions to commercial enterprises. The objective of the research is to gain an insight on the nature of resilience within these organisations, based on the personal observations and experience of the business leaders interviewed. A consolidated interpretation of organisational resilience emerges from the research, which distinguishes the concept from that of Business Continuity Management (BCM). The influence of leadership in building a resilient organisation is explored, as well as the extent to which diversity management and an innovative capacity relates to building a resilient workplace. Furthermore, the relationship between institutional resilience, people, business processes and technology is analysed. The patterns that emerge from the similarities and differences between the insights gained from the research participants provide an indication of the stance on organisational resilience in the South African services sector

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the timing of initial antenatal visits to better characterize possible use of metronidazole or other antimicrobials for common reproductive tract infections in early pregnancy.
STUDY DESIGN: We determined timing of initial antenatal evaluation in five busy and representative Denver, Colorado, practice settings (most recent 50 patients).
RESULTS: Most women were evaluated after completion of 9 weeks of pregnancy. Women seen in private settings received the initial visit earlier than did women in publicly supported clinics.
CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with a common reproductive tract infection and bacterial vaginosis can be “screened and treated” at the initial antenatal examination. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;176:887-8.)

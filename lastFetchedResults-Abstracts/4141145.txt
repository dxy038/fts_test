Addresses the problem of network survivability by presenting a unified approach where the wide-area circuit-switched teletraffic network and the underlying transmission facility network are considered simultaneously. The author assumes the backbone circuit-switched teletraffic network to be nonhierarchical with dynamic call routing capabilities. The transmission facility network is considered to be sparse (as is observed for emerging fiber optic networks) and is assumed to be two-arc connected. The approach addresses the network survivability objective by considering two grade-of-service parameters: one for the traffic network under normal operating condition and the other for affected part of the network under a network failure. The author presents unified mathematical models and develops heuristic algorithms. The author then presents computational results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the unified approach

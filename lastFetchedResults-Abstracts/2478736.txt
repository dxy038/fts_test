Transporting an object using several mobile robots by formation control is an effective method in handling heavy and complicated objects either in known or unknown places. In this paper, to control the formation of three mobile robots and also to control interactive, a control algorithm has been designed based on semi-active suspension system of remote center compliance (RCC). The main objective of control structure of semi-active suspension system is to control the desired formation and appropriate transportation of the object at the same time and also separate the object and other robots from the effect of the errors occurred during creation of disturbance in a certain robot and prevent it from having effects on other robots. In order to terminate instability in impedance methods, multiple impedance control has been used in moving the object by cooperating robots. To follow the desired path and control of mobile robots formation, Leader follower method has been used. Simulation results indicate that the semi-active suspension control system, in order to minimize the vibrations caused by disturbance transferred to the set of robots, is optimum and more stable compared to passive suspension control system.

Packet loss is inevitable in video multicast. In this paper, we propose and study an effective feedback-free loss recovery scheme for layered video which combines forward error correction (FEC) and stream replication. In our scheme, the server multicasts the video in parallel with FEC packets and a number of replicated delayed (ReD) version of the stream. Receivers autonomously and dynamically join the FEC and ReD streams to repair their losses. On the server side, we analyze and optimize the number of replicated streams and FEC packets to meet a certain residual loss requirement (i.e., error after correction). On the receiver side, we analyze the optimal combination of FEC and ReD packets to minimize its loss. We also present a fast yet accurate approximation algorithm for receiver to make such decision. We show that FEC combined with merely one or two replicated streams can effectively reduce the residual error rate (by as much as 50%) as compared with pure FEC or replication alone. Both subjective and objective video measures confirm that our recovery scheme achieves much better visual quality.

Image fusion performance evaluation indices are studied in this paper, and an objective measure is presented, which is the normalized edge mutual information (NEMI). NEMI is defined in view of information transmission and human vision system, and is used to evaluate the performance of pixel level image fusion algorithms. Several valuable properties of it are shown. The effectiveness of the NEMI is illustrated through experiments.

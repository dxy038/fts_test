Introduction & Objective: Skin tag is a soft, small and pedunculated lesion that is usually located on the skin folds like neck and axilla. The relationship between skin tags and dyslipidemia has been reported in several studies. This study was conducted with the aim of comparing serum lipid levels in skin tag affected subjects with healthy individuals.
Materials & Methods: In this case-control study, lipid profile (serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and  high density lipoprotein (HDL)) of skin tag affected patients presenting to dermatology clinic of Farshchian hospital (Hamadan, Iran) was compared with lipid profile of individuals presenting to the same clinic for the reasons other than skin tags. All the data collected were analyzed with SPSS16 software.
Results:  In this study, lipid profile of 49 skin tag affected individuals was compared with lipid profile of 49 individuals not affected by such lesion. Mean serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL and HDL were significantly higher in the affected group in comparison to control group (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: This study showed that the presence of skin tags could be related to increased lev-els of serum lipids. It is recommended that physicians consider the possibility of dyslipidemia in patients presenting with these skin lesions.

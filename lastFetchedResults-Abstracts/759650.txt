Extensive research has linked youth depression
symptoms to low levels of perceived control, using
measures that reflect primary control (i.e., influencing
objective conditions to make them fit oneâ€™s wishes). We
hypothesized that depressive symptoms are also linked to
low levels of secondary control (i.e., influencing the
psychological impact of objective conditions by adjusting
oneself to fit them). To test the hypothesis, we developed
the Secondary Control Scale for Children (SCSC), examined
its psychometrics, and used it to assess the secondary
control-depression symptomatology association. In a large
adolescent sample, the SCSC showed factorial integrity,
internal consistency, test-retest stability, convergent and
discriminant validity, and accounted for more than 40% of
the variance in depression symptoms. Consistent with
evidence on risk and gender, depression symptoms were
more strongly associated with secondary control in girls
and primary control in boys. Assessing secondary control
may help us understand youth depression vulnerability in
girls and boys.

A novel image reconstruction algorithm has been developed and demonstrated for fluorescence-enhanced frequency-domain photon migration (FDPM) tomography from measurements of area illumination with modulated excitation light and area collection of emitted fluorescence light using a gain modulated image-intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) camera. The image reconstruction problem was formulated as a nonlinear least-squares-type simple bounds constrained optimization problem based upon the penalty/modified barrier function (PMBF) method and the coupled diffusion equations. The simple bounds constraints are included in the objective function of the PMBF method and the gradient-based truncated Newton method with trust region is used to minimize the function for the large-scale problem (39919 unknowns, 2973 measurements). Three-dimensional (3-D) images of fluorescence absorption coefficients were reconstructed using the algorithm from experimental reflectance measurements under conditions of perfect and imperfect distribution of fluorophore within a single target. To our knowledge, this is the first time that targets have been reconstructed in three-dimensions from reflectance measurements with a clinically relevant phantom.

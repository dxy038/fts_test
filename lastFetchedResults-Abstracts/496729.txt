When methionine (Met) is limiting in swine diets, it is commonly supplemented by using anhydrous DL-methionine (DLM, 99%
purity) or liquid DL-methionine-hydroxy analogue free acid (MHA-FA, 88% purity). The objective of this experiment was to test
the null hypothesis that the bioavailability of DLM and MHA-FA were not different for growing pigs, using the indicator amino
acid (AA) (phenylalanine, Phe) oxidation (IAAO) method in a slope-ratio assay. Six barrows (mean BW during study: 21.1 kg)
received seven dietary treatments with all pigs receiving all diets in random order at an intake of 95 g/kg BW 0.75. The basal
diet (BD) contained analyzed content of 15.1% CP, 0.20% Met, 0.73% Phe and all other AA in excess of requirement. The BD
was supplemented with three graded levels of DLM or MHA-FA on an equimolar basis. Dietary treatments only varied in Met
content and included: (i) BD, (ii) BD10.034% DLM, (iii) BD10.054% DLM, (iv) BD10.086% DLM, (v) BD10.029% MHA-FA,
(vi) BD10.078% MHA-FA and (vii) BD10.107% MHA-FA, as analyzed. Indicator AA oxidation was determined during 4 h
studies, where pigs were fed half-hourly meals each equal to 1/32 of their daily feed allowance. Each meal was mixed with
258.7 kBq (s.e. 2.6) of L-[1-14C]Phe with a prime of 3.5 times the half-hourly dose added to the first meal. The slope of the
decrease in IAAO calculated by linear regression analysis was greater ( P50.012) for DLM supplementation (9.8761.450 per g,
1.48860.215% per mmol) than for MHA-FA (6.4860.89 per g, 1.10760.152% per mmol). The ratio of slopes indicated a
bioavailability of MHA-FA on a product basis, relative to DLM, of 65.7%. Bioavailability on an equimolar Met basis, calculated
from the ratio of the slopes was 74.4% for MHA-FA, relative to DLM. In conclusion, these results indicate that the metabolic
bioavailability of MHA-FA for growing pigs is appreciably lower than that of DLM on both an equimolar and a product basis.

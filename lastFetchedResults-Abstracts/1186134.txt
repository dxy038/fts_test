We present a methodology for the multi-objective optimization of laminated composite materials that is based on an integer-coded genetic algorithm. The fiber orientations and fiber volume fractions of the laminae are chosen as the primary optimization variables. Simplified micromechanics equations are used to estimate the stiffnesses and strength of each lamina using the fiber volume fraction and material properties of the matrix and fibers. The lamina stresses for thin composite coupons subjected to force and/or moment resultants are determined using the classical lamination theory and the first-ply failure strength is computed using the Tsaiâ€“Wu failure criterion. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is used to obtain Pareto-optimal designs for two model problems having multiple, conflicting, objectives. The objectives of the first model problem are to maximize the load carrying capacity and minimize the mass of a graphite/epoxy laminate that is subjected to biaxial moments. In the second model problem, the objectives are to maximize the axial and hoop rigidities and minimize the mass of a graphite/epoxy cylindrical pressure vessel subject to the constraint that the failure pressure be greater than a prescribed value.

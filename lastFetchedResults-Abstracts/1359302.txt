Background and Objective: Herpes Simplex Type 2 (HSV-2) causes vaginal and cervical infections in women. The diagnosis of this virus is not a routine test in medical laboratories and therefore in many cases this infection is not diagnosed and reported. Consequently, the majority of women have a little information about this infection. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of HSV-2 infection in women with cervicitis admitted to Kermanshah medical centers.
Materials and Methods: After recording patients' information, cervical samples were obtained from 239 women with cervicitis using swab. Then, following DNA extraction from samples, PCR was done using specific primers to determine UL42 gene of HSV-2.
Results: Of 239 women tested, 13(5.4%) had HSV-2 infection who mostly belonged to the age groups of 26-35 and 36-68 years old. Women with the history of abortion and infertility had 9.1 and zero percent infection, respectively. From clinical symptoms point of view, women with dyspareunia and vaginal discharge had the maximum rate of infection whereas in women with tubectomy HSV-2 infection was not found.
Conclusion: Our result for the rate of HSV-2 infection was lower than the rates in most developed and developing countries which is consistent with the Iranian culture and less unrestrained sexual activities. However, the age groups with more sexual activities showed higher prevalence for HSV-2 infection.

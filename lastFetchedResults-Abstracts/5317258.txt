This paper is concerned with vibration suppression of a walking tractor handlebar structure using multiobjective population-based incremental learning (PBIL). Two bi-objective optimisation problems are assigned aiming at vibration alleviation as well as structural mass reduction. Design variables are structural shape and sizing parameters whereas the objective functions include structural weight, natural frequencies, and frequency response function. The problems are posed to minimise the objectives whilst meeting structural safety requirement. The PBIL multiobjective optimiser is detailed and implemented to solve the optimization problems. The optimum results obtained are compared, illustrated and discussed. It is shown that a simple but effective passive vibration control of a handlebar structure can be achieved through the implementation of the proposed multiobjective PBIL.

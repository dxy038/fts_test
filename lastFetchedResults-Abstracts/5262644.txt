Currently almost all universities have the following problems in the information construction process, such as lack of uniform development programming, lack of share effectively for information, applications lack of effective integration, user lack of unified interface, etc. In order to implement the objective of lean management, use distributed resources stored in different domains, improve the quality and efficiency of management, achieve the information interconnection and integration among different systems in higher education, we adopt some technologies, such as SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) software framework, SOA data transformation technique, mode integration technique, web service discovery technique in campus, web service semantic descriptive technique, integration mapping technique, search engine application technique and so on, so the data management platform, named as URP(University Resource Planning) is established in this paper. It could improve effectively the level of management, the quality of teaching and management effectiveness.

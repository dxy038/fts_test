Zinc (Zn) has been implicated in altered adipose metabolism, insulin resistance and obesity. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects dietary Zn deficiency and supplementation on adiposity, serum leptin and fatty acid composition of adipose triglycerides and phospholipid in C57BL/6J mice fed low-fat (LF) or high-fat (HF) diets for a 16 week period. Weanling C57BL/6J mice were fed LF (16% kcal from soybean oil) or HF (39% kcal from lard and 16% kcal from soybean oil) diets containing 3, 30 or 150 mg Zn/kg diet (ZD = Zn-deficient, ZC = Zn control and ZS = Zn-supplemented, respectively). HF-fed mice had higher fat pad weights and lower adipose Zn concentrations than the LF-fed mice. The ZD and ZS groups had a reduced content of fatty acids in adipose triglycerides compared to the ZC group, suggesting that zinc status may influence fatty acid accumulation in adipose tissue. Serum leptin concentration was positively correlated with body weight and body fat, and negatively correlated with adipose Zn concentration. Dietary fat, but not dietary Zn, altered the fatty acid composition of adipose tissue phospholipid and triglyceride despite differences in Zn status assessed by femur Zn concentrations. The fatty acid profile of adipose triglycerides generally reflected the diets. HF-fed mice had a higher percentage of C20:4 n-6, elevated ratio of n-6/n-3, lower ratio of PUFA/SAT and reduced percentage of total n-3 fatty acids in adipose phospholipid, a fatty acid profile associated with obesity-induced risks for insulin resistance and impaired glucose transport. In summary, the reduced adipose Zn concentrations in HF-fed mice and the negative correlation between serum leptin and adipose Zn concentrations support an interrelationship among obesity, leptin and Zn metabolism.

This paper deals with the modeling and control of a magnetically levitated planar motor. The actuator considered has moving coils and stationary magnets. The principal objective is to develop a model which can be implemented in simulation. Therefore, the data obtained by a finite element method (FEM) are used to derive mathematical expressions of the force and torque produced by this motor. Moreover, a control strategy has also been studied.

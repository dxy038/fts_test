A multi-objective optimization method was developed for the design of trigeneration plants. The optimization is carried out on technical, economical, energetic and environmental performance indicators in a multi-objective optimization framework. Both construction (equipment sizes) and discrete operational (pricing tariff schemes and operational strategy) variables were optimized based on realistic conditions. The problem is solved using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. An example of a trigeneration system in a 300 bed hospital was studied in detail in order to demonstrate the design procedure, the economic and energetic performance of the plant, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed approach even under fluctuating energy prices.

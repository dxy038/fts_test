The objective of this work was to apply dense polymeric membranes for pervaporation of tetrachloroethene from aqueous solution. Three membranes were evaluated: polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS-PV1 and PDMS-PV2) membranes, and a PDMS with ZSM-5 zeolite filled (PERVAP-1070) membrane. The effect of feed composition on flux and selectivity was also investigated.

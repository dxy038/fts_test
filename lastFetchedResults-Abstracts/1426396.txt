Objective
nvestigation was undertaken to explore the prevalence and associated features of problem gambling amongst individuals with bipolar I disorder.
s
ta for this analysis were procured from the Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health and Well-being (CCHS 1.2) conducted by Statistics Canada. Individuals screening positive for a lifetime (World Mental Health- Composite International Diagnostic Interview) WMH-CIDI-defined manic episode (i.e. bipolar I disorder) or depressive episode (i.e. major depressive disorder) and current (i.e. past 12-month) problem gambling were compared to the general population without these disorders. Past year problem gambling was operationalized with the Canadian Problem Gambling Index (CPGI).
s
mple consisted of 36,984 individuals (≥ 15 years old); the weighted prevalence of problem gambling was significantly higher (6.3%) amongst the population with bipolar disorder as compared to the general population (2.0%, p &lt; 0.001) and those with major depressive disorder (2.5%, p &lt; 0.01). Compared to those without bipolar disorder, the odds of problem gambling for bipolar individuals were over twice as high (OR = 2.3; 95% CI 1.4–3.7), even when controlling for potential confounders. Males also had higher odds of problem gambling (OR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.4–2.3), as did individuals without post-secondary education (OR = 1.4; 95% CI 1.1–1.8). Persons who were married/cohabiting had lowered odds of problem gambling, compared with those who were unmarried (OR = 0.6; 95% CI 0.5–0.8). Comorbid alcohol dependence (OR = 3.4; 95% CI 2.3–5.0) and illicit drug dependence (OR = 2.6; 95% CI 1.1–6.2) each conferred an increased risk for problem gambling. Physical activity level (moderate to active) was associated with a decreased risk for problem gambling (OR = 0.8; 95% CI 0.6–0.9).
sions
duals with bipolar I disorder are differentially affected by problem gambling. Opportunistic screening for problem gambling is warranted, particularly in persons with comorbid alcohol or substance dependence.

In some windy, dry areas of Iran tree species such as Tamarix spp are used as windbreak to reduce soil erosion. Tamarix accumulates salt in its leaves, and then excretes it onto the leaf surface. These salts accumulate in the surface layer of soil when plants drop their leaves. Therefore some farmers are not interested to plant Tamarix as windbreak around their fields. The objective of the present paper was to evaluate the effect of Tamarix as tree windbreak on the soil salinity of the agricultural lands of Ardakan city. Soil samples were taken in the depth of 0-20 cm at different locations (beginning, middle and end) of each plot. The experiment for both sites (with and without windbreak) was carried out as randomized complete block design with four replications. Soil samples were then analysed for EC, SAR, K-, Na+, Cl-, Ca+2 , Mg+2 , HCo3-2 in laboratory of Natural Resources Faculty of Yazd University and mean of three locations of sampling was recorded. Results showed that rate of soil salts at region with windbreak were more than the region without windbreak. So that wind breaks increased EC of soil 15 percent compared with lands without windbreaks. Also the concentration of Na+, Ca+2 and Mg+2 of the soil near the windbreak were significantly higher than lands without windbreak, In the other hand, the concentration of Cl-, SAR, HCo3-2, K- of soil did not show any significant difference in both sites investigated in this research.

Abstract
Objective: This study aims to evaluate the protective effects of American ginseng administered
by gastric intubation on
sperm vital quality in adult male rats treated with cyclophosphamide
(CP).
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 28 Adult male Wistar rats were assigned to four groups, seven rats in each. The animals allocated to control, CP treated, Ginseng treated and CP-Ginseng treated groups. Rats were treated with CP (6.1 mg/kg/day, i.p) for 6 weeks. American ginseng was used at a dose of 500 mg/kg/day during treatment. Sperm analysis (motion, count, morphology and viability) were evaluated at the end of the experiments.
Sperm motion was assessed by Computer-Assisted Sperm Analysis
(CASA). The

data
were analyzed using GB stat software. Probability values of
p < 0.05  and p < 0.01  were

considered
significant.
Results: The epididymal sperm counts in the groups that received CP showed significant decreases  compared to the control group. Also dead and abnormal sperms significantly increased following CP treatment compared with control. The motility of caudal sperm was reduced significantly with CP treatment. Therefore, according to the results of this study, co-administration of CP and American ginseng can improve these parameters.
Conclusion: American ginseng can prevent the cytotoxic effects of CP on sperm quality factors.

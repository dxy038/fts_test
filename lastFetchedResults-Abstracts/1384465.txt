Components in rotational machinery such as turbine blades used in military aircraft engines are subjected to low-amplitude, high-frequency loads in the kHz range. Under high cycle fatigue (HCF), the initiation state of a crack consumes most of the life of the component. Vibratory stresses may therefore result in unexpected failures of the material. Hence, there is a need for HCF studies to address HCF-related failures of turbine engines and to develop a life prediction methodology. Ultrasonic fatigue provides accelerated HCF testing enabling the simulation of realistic loading conditions for testing materials used in structural components subjected to vibratory stresses. Specimen design is critical for optimum ultrasonic fatigue testing. The objective of this study is therefore to develop analytical modelling necessary for the design of test coupons to be fatigue tested at ultrasonic frequencies.

Objective: Since the direct measurement of attention via brain signals is significantly effective in eliminating excessive interfaces and has special importance for researchers, this study investigated the relations between visual sustained attention and Event Related Potentials (ERPs) using morphological features. Method: Continuous Performance Test (CPT) was used to measure sustained attention. Signals were recorded using 32-channel Walter device with 19-channel electrode cap. Extracted epochs which were time-locked to stimuli onset in each group were averaged to calculate the ERPs. Four hundred morphological features in ERPs of different electrodes were computed in 51 subjects and Pearson correlation was calculated between these features and the result of the CPT. Results: The P3 peak on target stimuli (X) was clearly observed in comparison with non-target stimuli. Calculated correlations indicated that thirty three of these features had significant relation with the level of sustained attention. Conclusion: Based on the oddball paradigm, the resulted qualitative findings were in line with previous research with regard to P3 production. Most characteristics with significant relation with results of CPT, were related to the voltage of relative event dependent potentials (correctly responded X relative to non-X). In general, CPT results showed appropriate relation with brain signal parameters in many areas, which could be used for the assessment of level of sustained attention.

The green economy is defined as a way to ensure human development, eradicate poverty, a 
source of social equity and preservation of natural capital. It thus appears as one of the
means to implement sustainable development in a context where developing countries
aspire to a higher standard of living. Morocco, one of these countries, faces challenges
capable of being treated with the assistance of the green economy. The latter may provide
Morocco with a new framework to strategically and sustainably rethink the Moroccan
economic development. The green economy calls for the use of the environmental
constraints as a lever for sustainable human development. This movement is realized
through the revival of economic activity and employment creation in addition to the
improvement of individualsâ€™ well-being and the reduction of social inequalities.
This article relies on the Moroccan case to analyze the eco-activities opportunities related
to employment creation, critical factor in human development and the social security. We
also discuss different opportunities of innovation that these activities offer in order to
promote social, ecological, and economic interactions. The objective of this movement
consists of developing a green economy. We focus on the conditions necessary for the
mobilization of these opportunities, as they contribute to the creation of wealth and
employment, for sustainable human development in Morocco.

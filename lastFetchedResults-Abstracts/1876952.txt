Objective
rpose of this study was to identify factors influencing self-management in patients with heart failure. Themes were determined by examining the review of the Goal Attainment Follow-up Guide and anecdotal records made by nurse interventionists during their implementation of mutual goal setting for the study of participants with heart failure.
s
tal records from a study using a mutual goal-setting intervention with participants with heart failure were reviewed and analyzed using qualitative methods to determine emerging themes.
s
ecdotal records of 27 patients were reviewed. Four themes emerged from this analysis: (1) competing priorities, (2) self-efficacy related to heart failure self-management, (3) activity level, and (4) psychosocial adaptation.
sion
set by participants reflected their life experiences and exemplified challenges with heart failure self-management. Some themes reflected the complexity of their lives, whereas other themes demonstrated levels of knowledge and motivation. Mutual goal setting was helpful in understanding the perspective of the participants and their receptivity to the process of adopting health-promoting behaviors.

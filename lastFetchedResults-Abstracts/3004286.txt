In the production scheduling of industrial processes, there are various uncertainties, and the uncertainty of processing time is the most typical one. In this paper, the uncertainty of processing time is described as triangle fuzzy numbers, and the scheduling model for flow-shop processing under uncertainty is established based on the fuzzy programming theory. The fuzzy programming is converted into distinct single-objective programming by employing the two fuzzy operations given by Masatoshi et al. (1999) and the "middle maximal membership" algorithm presented by the authors (2000). The experimental study validates the efficiency of the proposed scheduling model and fuzzy optimization method, and the influence of the decision factor &#915; is discussed.

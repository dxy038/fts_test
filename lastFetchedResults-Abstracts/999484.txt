Abstract

Background and objective: Soil bacteria, particularly Bacillus genus have the potential of producing a range of bioactive substances with antimicrobial and antifungal properties. They have the ability to produce hundreds of active and effective biologic compound against microorganisms. Therefore, it seems to be a proper candidate in the biocontrol of fungal pathogenesis.
Material and Methods: In this study, soil samples were collected from different parts of Gorgan in order to isolate Bacillus and to determine their antifungal activity against T.mentagrophytes.  The Isolates that had the highest antifungal effects were analyzed by PCR and 16s rRNA sequencing.
Results: Of 54 strains, 14 have antifungal activity.  The Isolates, S4 and S12, identified as B.cereus and B.thuringiensis respectively show the highest antidermatofit effect.  These isolates based on 16s rRNA sequence analysis show 97% homology with Bacillus cereusstrain KU4 and Bacillus thuringiensisstrain ucsc27.
Conclusion: According to the results, it seems that the soil Bacilli have biocontrol potential against dermatophytic agents such as T.mentagrophytes.

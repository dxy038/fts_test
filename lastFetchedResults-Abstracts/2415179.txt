This study was conducted with the main objective of determining the indicators and standards for the impact of tourism on the protected Karaj River in Tehran Province, Iran. The survey was carried out during the visitors’ peak season at several recreational areas along the protected Karaj River. Discriminative analysis was used to differentiate between the sites in terms of visitor satisfaction. The indicators were as follows: trash in the water, trash along the river banks, water quality, number of visitors, visitors’ distance to river, and visitors’ awareness of indicators. The following standards are suggested to improve the management of the site, including less than 12 percent of trash (both on the water surface and river banks), a family biotic index of less than five, less than 625 individuals per hectare, settlement points of more than 9 m from the river and a score of more than 32 on the scale of visitors’ awareness of potential impacts.

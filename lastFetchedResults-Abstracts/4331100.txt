In the context of green technology, we propose in this work<sup>1</sup> a new channel access method for wireless systems to reduce energy consumption. This method uses the concept of Cross Layer Design and cognitive radio blind sensing techniques to formulate a unified framework for congestion and fading analysis as well as Backoff exponent computation. It allows to acquire from the physical layer the information on the channel state using a blind spectrum sensing. Then the link layer, based on this information, detects congestion or fading situation and decides whether to transmit data or to wait. The objective of the proposed method is to achieve both high frame success rate and high energy efficiency by avoiding unsuccessful transmissions due to bad channel state. Comparaison with others published techniques shows that the proposed technique provide better results.

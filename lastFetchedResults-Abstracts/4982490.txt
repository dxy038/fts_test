This work presents a new proposal for Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) design for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) applications. The new FSSs consist of an array composed by the association of two patch elements per cell: a square loop and a crossed dipole. These structures are called Crossed Loops and have the objective of increasing the bandwidth of the square loop and the crossed dipole, when analyzed separately. Simulated results of the transmission coefficients are obtained using the Ansoft Designer<sup>&#194;&#191;</sup> commercial software. Some of the FSSs tested were fabricated in order to make an experimental analysis with the measured results and to validate the new proposal. In particular, the presented results for the transmission coefficient of a built FSS prototype indicate a percent bandwidth 52.4%.

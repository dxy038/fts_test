In this paper, a three-port converter with three active full bridges, two series-resonant tanks, and a three-winding transformer is proposed. It uses a single power conversion stage with high-frequency link to control power flow between batteries, load, and a renewable source such as fuel cell. The converter has capabilities of bidirectional power flow in the battery and the load port. Use of series-resonance aids in high switching frequency operation with realizable component values when compared to existing three-port converter with only inductors. The converter has high efficiency due to soft-switching operation in all three bridges. Steady-state analysis of the converter is presented to determine the power flow equations, tank currents, and soft-switching region. Dynamic analysis is performed to design a closed-loop controller that will regulate the load-side port voltage and source-side port current. Design procedure for the three-port converter is explained and experimental results of a laboratory prototype are presented.

Recent research indicates tillage operations result in a rapid physical release of CO2 and water vapor from soil. However, effects of soil disturbance on gas fluxes during planting operations have not been adequately explored. Our objective was to measure short-term gas loss resulting from the use of different planting preparation implements on long-term residue-covered soil (no-till) on a Norfolk loamy sand (Typic Kandiudults; FAO classification Luxic Ferralsols) in east-central Alabama, USA. A crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) cover crop was killed with herbicide two weeks prior to the study. Due to dry soil conditions, 15 mm of water was applied 24 h prior to study. Gas fluxes were measured with a large canopy chamber (centered over two rows) for an integrated assessment of equipment-induced soil disturbance. Increased losses of CO2 and water vapor were directly related to increases in soil disturbance. Although these short-term C losses are minor in terms of predicting long-term C turnover in agro-ecosystems, results suggest that selecting planting equipment that maintains surface residue and minimizes soil disturbance could help to conserve soil water needed for successful seedling establishment in these coarse textured soils.

According to the technology of computer graphics and image processing combined with medical knowledge, and based on the feature analysis of X-ray chest films of pulmonary tuberculosis, the paper puts forward some algorithms. Some of these algorithms can establish a localizing frame of reference by some special methods of the rib image processing that are edge detecting method, boundary tracing method and information extracting method, and others can get the professional result of localization after implemented focal segmentation and focal localization. Successful application of the technology of computer graphics and image processing is finally implemented in the filed of medical image.

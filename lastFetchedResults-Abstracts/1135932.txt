The objective of this paper is to analyse the fatigue reliability of rivet lap joints of aircraft structures based on a fast reliability approach using a newly developed detail fatigue rating method. The existing detail fatigue rating method has been modified for use in analysing aircraft structures with multiple riveted joints subjected to a fatigue environment. The system reliability of aircraft structures is evaluated by the use of a series model. The new detail fatigue rating method, developed here, has been validated through the use of results from fatigue tests and finite element analysis. The modified detail fatigue rating method is confirmed to be more accurate in comparison to the existing traditional one.

The objective of this short paper is twofold: 1) to present experimental and computer-simulated results for a number of single-mode and dual-mode high-temperature superconductor (HTS) filters; and 2) to present the measured performance of an integrated 3-channel circulator-coupled multiplexer employing dual-mode HTS thin film filters. The CAD algorithm used to design the HTS filters is also described. The results presented demonstrate the feasibility of building C-band compact-size superconductive multiplexers

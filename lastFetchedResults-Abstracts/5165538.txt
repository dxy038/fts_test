The DLR Hand Arm System is based upon the variable stiffness concept which has been recently developed to improve impact robustness and energy efficiency of modern robots. This paper continues the work on the bidirectional antagonistic variable stiffness (BAVS) joint concept which is an extension of antagonistic joints. Three mechanical setups utilizing different spring and cam disc combinations to implement a desired torque-stiffness characteristic are analyzed. Two BAVS joint solutions as used for the wrist and forearm rotation of the DLR Hand Arm System are presented. Furthermore in the experimental section torque-deflection calibration and drive redundancy are validated.

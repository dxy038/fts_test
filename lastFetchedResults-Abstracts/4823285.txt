Performance indicators are introduced in manufacturing companies in order to improve the reactivity of production activity control by providing performance evaluations reflecting the analysis of the state of processes with regard to pre-set objectives. After having recalled the formal model of performance indicators, the focus is on the semantics of the performance evaluation, which is an important point in order to take control decisions. This semantics depends in fact on the mathematical comparison operators (between the state of the process and the assigned objective) used to evaluate the performance. In this view, possibility and necessity measures are studied. They are also used to define the uncertainty of the performance evaluation.

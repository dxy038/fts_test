Background
et transfusion in thrombocytopenic patients, especially those with marrow failure, remains one of the most important support measures available. Treatment success depends on rational use of platelet transfusion. Platelet yield, reflected in transfused platelet dose, influences platelet recovery in the patient and allows prolonging intervals between transfusions. In this study, our main objective was to identify donor laboratory and clinical factors that showed some influence on platelet yield obtained by apheresis.
s
y donor laboratory and clinical data were analyzed prior to performing plateletpheresis. Platelet yield was quantified after plateletpheresis procedure was concluded in two different ways: a) prefixed volume of 5,000 mL processed, and b) volume determined according to manufacturer recommendations. Age, gender, hemoglobin concentration, platelet and leukocyte count, height, and weight were included as yield-predicting donor variables.
s
up A, two variables were significant: donor platelet count and hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations with r = 0.554, and in group B, donor platelet count, Hb concentrations, and volume with r = 0.758.
sions
platelet count and hemoglobin concentrations influence platelet yield: higher platelet count corresponds to higher yield, while hemoglobin shows an inverse relationship, i.e., the lower the hemoglobin concentrations, the higher the platelet yield.

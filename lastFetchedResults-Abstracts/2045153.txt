
Purpose: Scoliosis is one of the most common spinal deformities that affect chest wall
mechanics. Scoliosis results in ventilator disorders and respiratory muscle weakness. However,
the mechanism of these disorders is still unknown. The main objective of this study was to
identify the intensity of respiratory muscles activity in patients with idiopathic scoliosis compare
with healthy individuals and determine the relationship between scoliosis degree and respiratory
dysfunctions. In this study, 20 female patients with adult idiopathic scoliosis (mild, moderate) as
well as 10 healthy matched individuals with characteristics of the patients were selected. Methods: Electromyography values were recorded through rest phase. In addition, the
electromyography values of external intercostal muscles and diaphragm were recorded bilaterally. Results: The RMS of concave and convex external intercostal muscles and concave diaphragm
in patients with idiopathic scoliosis were reduced significantly relative to healthy individuals
in rest (P<0.001, P<0.001, P=0.023). .There was a correlation between scoliosis degree and
decrease in concave and convex intercostal muscle performances (P=0.001) but there was no
correlation in diaphragm muscle. Conclusion: Respiratory muscle performance is drastically decreased in patients with adult
idiopathic scoliosis. There was a relationship between scoliosis degree and respiratory
dysfunction. This reduction has more observed in concave side and resulted in reduced
physical capacity.

This paper addresses the performance of objective methods for speech quality assessment in signals with realistic, block-varying degradations. A block algorithm is presented which employs an existing data-driven approach and is shown to outperform current standard algorithms. We present test results performed on a block-varying extension to the C-Qual database. The effects of block size on the accuracy and distribution of errors is also investigated.

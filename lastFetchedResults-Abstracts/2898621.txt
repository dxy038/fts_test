We consider challenges faced by everyday Web users, who interact with inherently heterogeneous and distributed information. We see the Web as a knowledge base consisting of distributed logical facts and rules. Our objective is to enable automated reasoning over this knowledge base, ultimately improving the quality of service and of data. For this, we use Webdamlog, a Datalog-style language with rule delegation. We also mention recent work on the specification of an access control mechanism in such an environment. We discuss a fine-grained access control mechanism for intentional data based on provenance as well as a control mechanism for delegation, i.e., for deploying rules at remote peers.

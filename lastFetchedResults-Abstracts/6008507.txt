A ground terminal design has been demonstrated which satisfies many of the emerging tactical satellite communications needs. The objective of this project was to develop and evaluate low-risk terminal design concepts based on current technologies. The basic approach integrated existing electronic components, a stabilization subsystem, a power subsystem and a new, automatically deployable antenna onto a single pallet. The performance goals were: setup in less than ten minutes, one person crew, remote control capability, eight user ports (four simultaneous channels), and survival of tactical environments. Experience gained during this project reduces the technical risk of developing the ArmyÂ´s next generation Milstar terminal, SMART-T

This paper reviews different methodologies for interfacing time-domain and frequency-domain simulation programs. The main objective for this interface is to obtain the steady-state or transient state of a power network containing linear and nonlinear loads, and the calculation of the corresponding harmonics and the foregoing values for different types of analyses in power systems.

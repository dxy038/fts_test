In practical engineering design problems, there are some design and manufacturing considerations that are difficult
or infeasible to express in terms of an objective function or a constraint. Among them, we pay attention to the topological
complexity of optimized designs which are difficult to quantify. In this situation, a set of optimal candidate
designs having different topological complexities, not just a single optimal design, is preferred. In this work, the mean
spatial frequency is proposed as a means to measure the topological complexity of an optimized design. To maximize
the system performance and to control the mean spatial frequency, the topology design optimization in the M-band
wavelet transformed multiscale design space is proposed. In the proposed scheme, the mean frequency is controlled
effectively by choosing different design space resolution in the multiscale design space, and the performance maximization
is treated as the objective function of the topology optimization. The procedure to transform the original design
space into the multiscale design space by the M-band Daubechies wavelet is also explained in some details.

The objective of this research was to compare the tensile, permeability, solubility
and color properties of plasticized starch-polyvinyl alcohol-Montmorillonite
(PS-PVA-MMT) and plasticized starch-polyvinyl alcohol-cellulose
nanocrystal (PS-PVA-NCC) bionanocomposite films. The results showed that adding
MMT (7%), increased the ultimate tensile strenght from 4.2 MPa to 4.61 MPa, however,
NCC (7%) did not show significant (p  <  0.5) effect on the ultimate tensile strength.
Addition of MMT decreased while NCC increased the strain-to-break of the films.
The solubility in water decreased from 23.56% to 18.77% and 11.75% for the films
containing NCC and MMT, respectively. Similarly, water vapor permeability value
of 7.41 ×10-7 g/m.h.Pa was dropped to 7.05×10-7 g/m.h.Pa and 6.19×10-7 g/m.h.Pa
in films containing NCC and MMT, respectively. The results showed that the effects
of MMT on tensile and permeability were higher than NCC, which can be attributed
to differences in the structure and hydrophilicity of two nanoparticles.

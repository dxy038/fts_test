The important scenery structure is embodied by the image border which carries the most important characteristic information of an image. Therefore, searching for a kind of better edge detection method which will apply to most images and have good anti-noise ability has become an urgent solution to this problem. The images containing different noise are detected by Cubic B-spline wavelet in this paper, and its result about anti-noise ability is superior to canny algorithm in both the subjective vision and the objective data.

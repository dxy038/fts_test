The objective of this study is to validate a finite element analysis (FEA) simulation methodology to predict the global behavior of thin-walled elbows subjected to in-plane bending. Two in-plane closing mode bending tests and one in-plane opening mode bending test were conducted on 2″ schedule 10 elbows, and a nonlinear FEA procedure was used to simulate the tests. A detailed FEA study was carried out to determine the relative importance of weld size and location, measured wall thicknesses, and original cross-section dimensions on the reconciliation results. When the weld bead was included in the analysis, the reconciliation results for load–displacement behavior and some of the strain measurements were excellent. For those cases in which the strain measurements reconciliations were not so good, a possible explanation is provided.

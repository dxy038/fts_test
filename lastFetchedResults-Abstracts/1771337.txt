Introduction & Objective: The highest rate of non-anatomic reduction of fractures is usually seen in oblique mandibular body fractures. Thus, the aim of the present study was the as-sessment of reduction performance of TRS (Tube Reduction Screw) in comparison conven-tional method (Reduction forceps with Lag Screws).
Materials & Methods: This experimental study was conducted on 30 half- mandibles of  slaughtered sheep. After creation of oblique fracture in each side of mandibles, one side was reduced with TRS and the opposite side with conventional method. Then , the distance be-tween the fracture lines was determined on inferior, superior, buccal and lingual surfaces.
Results: According to the results, there were no significant differences in the distance between the fracture lines on the superior, inferior and buccal surfaces in TRS and conventional methods. But, this difference was statistically significant on the lingual surface (P < 0.05)
Conclusion: The results showed that the TRS could be a useful instrument for the reduction of oblique mandibular body fractures. But the clinical usage of this device needs more animal and clinical studies.

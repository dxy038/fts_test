The multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of economic load distribution of power system. Through the analysis on mathematical model of load distribution, the series of constrained single-objective optimization problems can be converted into optimization problems of two objective functions. One objective function is the total coal consumption function. The other objective function is the degree function that violates constraint condition. The real coding technology is used in this algorithm. With the individual evaluating indicator of Pareto strength value, the algorithm realizes population evolution through genetic algorithm and finally finds the optimal solution. Apply the method respectively to a generating system composed of five units and a generating system composed of three units for load optimization calculation, and then compare it to the single-objective optimization algorithm based on penalty function. The analysis shows that the algorithm has better optimum-searching performance on the premise of meeting all constraint conditions, confirming the feasibility and the validity of this algorithm.

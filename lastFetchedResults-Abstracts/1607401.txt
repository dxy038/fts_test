Background and Objective: Allergic rhinitis can be stimulated by several allergens. Molds are among these allergens and it is important to assess their frequency in different geographic area. Hence, we aimed at determining the frequency of mold allergens in allergic rhinitis patients referred to specialized clinics of Tabriz Imam Reza hospital, 2011.

Material and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on the serums of 90 rhinitis patients diagnosed by specialized physician. Using Immunoblotting method, the level of specific IgE against four molds including Penicillium, Aspergillus, Alternaria and Cladosporium were investigated. 

Results: Of 90 Patients, 40 were men (44.4%) and 50 were women (55.6%).  The participants were between 6 to 53 years and the most were 28-31years.  The allergy was related to Penicillium (3.3%), Aspergillus (5.6%), Alternaria (13.3%) and Cladosporium (4.4%). There was a significant statistical relation between age and allergic rhinitis to Alternaria (P=0.011).

Conclusion: Molds can grow and proliferate in very humid environments. Because of low humidity climate in Tabriz (in the northwest of Iran), allergy to molds is relatively low in this region.

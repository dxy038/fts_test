Objective
ess a panel of risk factors associated to oral candidosis (OC) onset and its chronic maintenance by means of fuzzy logic (FL) approach and statistical traditional methodology (STM); to investigate their casual relationship within a multifactorial framework.

ontrol study.
g
spital-based clinic.
ts
-nine patients with OC infection microbiologically diagnosed and 98 healthy subjects were consecutively recruited.
e measurements
stic and clinical evaluations for OC, microbiological assessment (i.e. culture, CFU/mL counting and identification) were performed. The commonest predisposing factors for OC onset and its chronic status were analysed by FL and STM.
s
ns of a twofold analysis (FL and STM) significant associations between OC onset and its chronic maintenance were found with respect to denture wearing and hyposalivation/xerostomia, as local risk factors, and to age and female gender, as socio-demographical variables. Tobacco smoking was found not to be a risk factor.
sions
ofold (FL and STM) statistical approach for the identification of OC risk factors has been found useful and accurate in individuating a more selected target population for OC onset and chronic maintenance. The target patient appears to be an elderly person with multiple disease inducing, directly or by medications, hyposalivation/xerostomia. This data could provide to general and dental practitioners a decision-making model finalised to their preventative strategies for the geriatric population.

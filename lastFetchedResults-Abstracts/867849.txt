Cross docking is a logistic technique employed to reduce the inventory holding, order picking, transportation
costs as well as the delivery time. Products arriving to the cross dock are unloaded from inbound
trailers, possibly reconsolidated with other products arriving from different destinations and loaded into
outbound trailers within less than 24 h. In this study, we consider a multiple receiving and shipping door
cross dock environment. The objective is to find optimal (for reasonably small cross docks) or near optimal
(for larger cross docking facilities) scheduling policies which minimizes the total costs related to the
transshipment operations at the facility.

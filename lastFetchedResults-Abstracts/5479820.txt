This paper presents design of active power filter by novel idea of energy balancing control. The control objective can be achieved by fully closed-loop control. The reference current is firstly identified by using the concept of energy calculation and control. The source current is then forced to follow the reference current by current controller. The proposed approach is constructed in single-phase system and verified by simulation results

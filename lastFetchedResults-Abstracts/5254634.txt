This paper deals with the problem of controller failure analysis for T-S fuzzy systems with time-varying delay. The T-S fuzzy systems can be stabilized by a pre-designed state feedback controller. Our objective is to establish conditions concerning controller failure time and frequency, under which the systems still keep exponentially stable. Based on piecewise Lyapunov functional method, exponential stability of such systems is guaranteed. All the results are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). An example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

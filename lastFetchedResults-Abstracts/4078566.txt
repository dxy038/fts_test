This paper presents a comparative study of two surface-mounted permanent-magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs): the first with integral slot windings and the other with fractional slot windings. These machines have the same winding distribution on the stator and the same magnet volume on the rotor but different rotor pole numbers. The objective is to give the advantages of PMSMs with fractional slot windings. This paper also presents a computation method of average copper losses, including the flux weakening and that of average iron losses during the driving cycle for a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). In this paper, in the electrical motorization of a truck, the specification characteristics give a maximum torque of 500 Nm and a maximum speed of 3000 returns per minute (rpm). Finally, a comparative study in terms of average losses during the driving cycle of the HEV has been presented. The energetic efficiency of the electric motor in the vehicle is shown.

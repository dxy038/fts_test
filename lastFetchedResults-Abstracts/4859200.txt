Due to the nature of touch sensation, the interface between a user and a haptic device must be carefully designed and selected such that the user feels they are directly manipulating a virtual object. This is particularly critical for attachment of fingertips to a multi fingered device. We experimentally tested eight methods of attachment for a multifinger haptic device (MFHD) previously developed in our lab. From the test we gathered objective and subjective data on force and user preference. Based on this data we were able to evaluate the quality of the attachment methods

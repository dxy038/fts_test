Background and Objective: DOMS is commonly experienced following novel physical exercise, especially with eccentric exercises. The main aim of this research was the study of ultrasound influence on DOMS indicators.

Materials and Methods: Twenty male students (age: 21±2 years, height: 167±3 cm, weight: 67±16 kg) who did not take physical exercise and have no record about DOMS for the last six months, voluntarily took part in this investigation. Ten subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups (experimental and control groups). The program of physical activity for creating DOMS including bench step-testing for fifteen minutes was applied. Dependent variables (pain and creatine kinase (CK)) were assessed at baseline, 2, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-exercise. Repeated measures ANOVA, Tukey and independent t-test (p <  0.05) were used for data analysis. 

Results: The significant difference occurred between pain and ck of experimental and control groups (p <  0.05).

Conclusion: According to results, ultrasound has positive effects on DOMS indicators. Finally; this results showed that ultrasound usage may be an effective method for DOMS treatment.

The annular denuder system (ADS) is an instrument for trapping and subsequently analysing for concentrations of inorganic reactive gases and aerosol species in the atmosphere. Todate its application in the livestock industry is limited primarily by its inability to collect gaseous ammonia at the elevated levels commonly observed in livestock operations. The study’s objective was to improve upon the ammonia collection capabilities of the ADS to determine if it was potentially suitable for in-house sampling.

Using a 1% phosphorous acid coating, a single denuder becomes less than 100% efficient at collecting gaseous ammonia after 0.65 mg of ammonia was absorbed on the denuder’s walls. The loading capacity of the denuder was determined to be 2.39 ± 0.23 mg of ammonia. Ammonia saturation problems were alleviated by using seven denuders in series to collect a representative ammonia level (25 ppm) for poultry facilities over an hour sampling period.

The extended ADS was calibrated against three ammonia gas standards and an ammonia monitor. The mean error was determined to be 2.39% using the ammonia standards and it was within 5.1%, on average, of the ammonia measurements using the continuous ammonia monitor inside a layer facility.

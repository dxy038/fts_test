Objective: Our purpose was to review patients with granulosa and theca cell tumors as filed in the Emil Novak Ovarian Tumor Registry. Study Design: Our study was a descriptive, retrospective study of 454 case records. Results: The reviewed diagnoses were for 97 patients with granulosa cell tumors, 116 with theca cell tumors, and 97 with granulosa-theca cell tumors. The remaining cases (n = 144) were reclassified as “nonspecific” gonadal stromal tumors (n = 61), luteomas of pregnancy (n = 7), and 76 “other” cases. These included poorly differentiated cancer, metastatic cancer, mixed mesodermal tumors, and sarcomas. The tumor-related mortality rate for the 310 patients with granulosa, theca, and granulosa-theca cell tumors was 7% (37.3% for granulosa cell tumors only). The surgical stage of disease was the most significant prognostic factor, with a mortality rate of at least 40%, given that the tumor had spread beyond the ovary. Conclusion: Because the differential diagnoses of particularly granulosa cell tumors included several conditions with an extremely poor prognosis, an accurate histologic diagnosis is crucial.

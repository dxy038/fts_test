In this paper we consider the solution of multi-objective H<sup>&#194;&#191;</sup>-optimization problems, also referred to as multi-disk problems. We present an algorithm that enables us to compute an upper bound for linear two-disk problems and also a (suboptimal) controller that achieves this bound. This algorithm readily generalizes to incorporate multi-disk problems. One of the main features of this algorithm is that it enables us to graphically display the design tradeoffs inherent in multi-objective problems.

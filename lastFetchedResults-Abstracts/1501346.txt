The main objective of this contribution is to describe the development of the concepts, techniques and devices associated with solid-phase microextraction, as a response to the evolution of understanding of the fundamental principles behind this technique. The discussion begins with an historical perspective on the very early work conduced almost a decade ago. As new fundamental understanding about the functioning of the technology developed, new ways of constructing and using the SPME devices evolved.

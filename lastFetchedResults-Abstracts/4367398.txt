Summary form only given. Polarisation mode dispersion (PMD) is a major impairment for high-bit-rate optical systems. The objective of this course is threefold: (1) understand the physical phenomena of PMD, (2) review the current status of understanding of the impact of PMD on optical systems, and (3) PMD mitigation approaches. In this course we will introduce the concept of PMD and its various mathematical description briefly with emphasis on visualizing and comparing different ways of describing PMD. Then, very briefly, we will concentrate on some measurement aspects of PMD in systems. Current understanding of PMD impact on systems will be summarized next. System impact of PMD will be reviewed in three stages. (1) Impact of fiber PMD, 1st and higher order, in high-bit-rate systems in presence of chromatic dispersion. (2) Impact of fiber and discrete component PMD on optical systems. (3) Impact of fiber and component PMD on optical systems in presence of polarization dependent loss. Finally, PMD mitigation approaches will be discussed.

Objective
Febrile seizure is the most common seizure disorder in children. Its 
pathophysiology is not fully understood yet; however, some risk factors have 
been cited for it. Iron is one of these influential elements and is involved 
in the metabolism of some neurotransmitters which are reduced in irondeficiency anemia and also increases the sensitivity of neural cells during a 
febrile episode. The present study aimed to determine the rate of febrile seizure 
in thalassemic patients and to compare it with the corresponding rate in the 
normal population.
Materials & Methods
This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 766 patients with 
thalassemia major. They were all older than 6 months and were referred to 
Dastghaib Coolyâ€™s Clinic, affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, 
from Oct 2006 to May 2007, and 766 normal and healthy children as the control 
group. Questionnaires containing demographic data and past history of febrile 
seizure, age of febrile seizure, number of episodes, hospitalization, and related 
family history were prepared and filled through interviewing the parents. 
Results
Febrile seizure was detected in 7 cases of the patient group (0.9%) versus 18
cases (2.3%) of the control group. The frequency of febrile seizure in the controls 
was 2.5 times more than that in the thalassemia group, which was statistically 
significant (P  <  0.05).
Conclusion
This study showed a lower rate of febrile convulsion in thalassemic patients 
compared to the control group. Accordingly, it could be suggested that high 
iron storage is a protective factor against febrile convulsion.

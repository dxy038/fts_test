The objective of our study is to realize passive impedance of the robot joint by mechanical elements (MIA), and to develop an anthropomorphic multiple DOF manipulator using this mechanism. This mechanism has the advantage of a conventional method of force control in realizing high compliance. This paper presents the development of the 4-DOF MIA ARM which is an upper arm of the manipulator. This paper also describes the experimental evaluation of the 4-DOF MIA manipulator by means of step responses and circular trajectory. The experimental results show that the 4-DOF MIA ARM has high performance not only in force control but also in motion control

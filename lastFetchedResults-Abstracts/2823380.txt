The Energy and Mining Planning Unit - UPME has among its tasks to define the energy requirements of the country´s population, using economic, social, technical and environmental criteria. Within this context, UPME annually updates the Plan for Reference Expansion of Generation and Transmission, which highlights the electric system´s priorities in the short, medium and long term. The present article aims to present a methodology for impact assessment of the operational outputs of electrical substations in the power system; such methodology was developed by UPME, the National Dispatch Center - CND and the Advisor Committee for Transmission Planning - CATP, with the objective of identifying which substations may undergo bus reconfiguration in order to increase reliability and security of the power system.

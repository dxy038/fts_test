Friction and lubrication are of great importance in many important metal forming processes such as sheet metal forming, forging and extrusion. With the products being more complex, it may utilize different lubrication medium in different tool/workpiece interface in which the metal flow could be controlled more effectively. While there is a substantial body of published research on friction modeling in metal forming processes, there has been relatively little work on forming process in which different tribological interfaces such as lubricant/grease, lubricant/dry and dry/grease are existed. The objective of this research is to investigate the friction distribution in combined forward and backward extrusion process. A realistic model of friction is developed to determine the friction coefficient of lubricated tool/workpiece interface. The friction coefficient of the other interface in which grease or different lubricant may applied is then determined by a coupled FEM and experiment investigation. Both the simulation and experimental data will be presented.

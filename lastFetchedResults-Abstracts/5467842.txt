Since the Quality of Experience (QoE) metric directly reflects the subjective experiences of users, the resource allocation techniques with the objective to improve QoE instead of conventional metrics are efficient in resource utilization. This kind of techniques can avoid wasting resources in providing perfect objective metric which may have little or even no effect on user experience. This paper presents a QoE-aware power allocation algorithm in multiuser Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The power allocation problem is formulated to maximize the overall QoE subject to the total transmit power constraint. The original model is solved by means of transformation and approximation, since it is difficult to develop a closed-form solution. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can enhance the performance in terms of both the overall QoE and single user QoE in comparison with the classical water-filling algorithm.

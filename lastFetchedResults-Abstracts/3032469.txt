In the Advanced Photon Source linac gun test area at Argonne National Laboratory a new S-band ballistic bunch compression (BBC) gun is being tested. It was determined that a WR 284 waveguide bidirectional coupler with a directivity of greater than 30 dB and a coupling of -57 &#177; 1 dB was desired for evaluation of waveguide rf power conditions. Numerical simulations were performed using the High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) and experimental models were built to determine the optimal dimensions of the bidirectional coupler assembly and the orientation of the loop coupler element. Magnetic and electric fields in the coupler were adjusted by modifying the coupling of the fields as well as the capacitance of the coupling loop.

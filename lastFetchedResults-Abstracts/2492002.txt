In this paper, the deformation of a thick-walled circular cylindrical shell of incompressible isotropic elastic
material is considered. The shell, which is made of Three-Term strain energy function is subjected to the
combined external and axial loading pressure. In order to obtain the relevant eigenvalues, which is the main
objective of the work, the incremental equilibrium equations are solved with two numerical, i.e. Adams-Moulton
and Compound matrix methods. Finally the bifurcation behavior is investigated by plotting the radius changes
with respect to the changes of the length of the cylinder.

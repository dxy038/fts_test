      Risk assessment  approach  is one of the essential bases in establishing and using management systems in different organizations. Establishing a kind of complex managerial system in sanitation, security and environmental organizations would help them to be able to have processes to prohibit errors. ARYASASOL Petrochemistry is the biggest unit producing Olphyn gas in Iran which is placed in Pars economic area. The present study is conducted in ASALLOYEH, the production unit of heavy and moderate petrochemistry complex, ARYASASOL, to indentify its environmental aspects and introducing practical alternatives to decrease or even to omitt the negative environmental effects using the analysis methods in breaking states besides considering their effects on environment. This method is a qualitative one which is used as the best possible method in developing the process. Its objective is to recognize and to classify the environmental aspects beforehand which leads to appropriate results during the life circle. Therefore these aspects were first assessed and assigned the prior risk number and the risk degree also was calculated through excess distribution method. Doing the statistical calculations it was shown that some environmental aspects holding the risk priority number more than 19.5 are riskier than others. The obtained results showed that 24.8% of the environmental aspects were at low risk; 21.46% stand in average and 14.12% were high meanwhile 39.54% were considered beyond high levels that for the last two we should apply reforming and risk managerial processes.

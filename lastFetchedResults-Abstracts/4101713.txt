The objective of this paper is to provide the context, physical insight, and perspective on antennas in wireless communications. Although it does not mean to be comprehensive, the four key technologies related to small antenna designs to be reviewed and discussed, including multiband planar inverted-F antennas, broadband folded patch antennas, compact differentially fed antennas, and miniature circularly polarized patch antennas, would cover a wide range of topical interests and practical applications. A brief overview of computer software for analyzing these antennas is also provided. Hopefully, this paper will be beneficial for the diverse engineering readership of the IEEE.

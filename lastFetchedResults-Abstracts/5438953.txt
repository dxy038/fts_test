The behavior of three-port bidirectional DC-DC converters (TPC) under soft-switching mode for hybrid electric vehicles is analyzed in this paper. The principle of power flow control and the operation under soft-switching mode are studied to establish the converter operation range. All this allows to establish design criteria to operate the TPC under soft-switching within a wide operation region. The parameters considered are the transformer turns ratio and the leakage inductance of the transformer, which allows determine the maximum power that can be transferred. Simulation results that validate the analysis are also presented.

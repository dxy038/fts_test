RF exposure guidelines recognize that an increase in local SAR due to metallic implants is possible, depending upon the size and shape of the implant and the position. This study describes the local SAR calculations for an anatomical human with metallic osteosynthesis plates embedded in the mandibular zone exposed to 2 GHz RF fields; FDTD analysis is applied. The main objective is to assess whether combination of two metallic plates aligned in parallel in the head region could be expected to cause SAR enhancements under near-field exposure condition at 2 GHz.

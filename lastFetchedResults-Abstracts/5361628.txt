In this paper, a new approach employing legitimate route choice behavior to estimate an origin-destination (O-D) trip table in a stochastic congested road network is introduced. Also, models with different objective functions on O-D table estimation and their underlying theories are investigated. Furthermore, a case study, including three data sets in a local urban area, is examined and its associated model performances are discussed

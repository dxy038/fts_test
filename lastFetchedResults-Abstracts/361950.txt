Study Objective: Serum markers of smooth muscle destruction have been shown to be elevated in ectopic pregnancy, but they remain of questionable clinical utility. Our goal was to determine the clinical utility of 3 markers of smooth muscle destruction: creatine phosphokinase (CPK), smooth muscle heavy-chain myosin (SMHC), and myoglobin. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study, with consecutive enrollment of all women in the first trimester of pregnancy who presented to our urban emergency department with complaints of lower abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, or both. Patients were excluded from the study if there was a history of recent surgery or major trauma. Data analysis included receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and a regression model. Results: A total of 378 patients were enrolled, with 61 patients diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy, and 317 patients placed in the non–ectopic pregnancy group with other diagnoses. ROC curve analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.56 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.61) for CPK, 0.63 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.68) for SMHC, and 0.58 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.63) for myoglobin. A regression model analyzing the effects of race, maternal age, estimated gestational age, and serum levels of human chorionic gonadotropin β-subunit found no significant confounders. Conclusion: Although there is a statistically significant elevation in the serum levels of SMHC, the range of values seen is too large to allow SMHC to be a useful screening tool.

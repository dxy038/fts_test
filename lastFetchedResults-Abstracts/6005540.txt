Introduction of natural energy power generators particularly, the introduction of the photovoltaic (PV) which can be almost installed anywhere and the rapid spread of the electric vehicle (EV) attracts wide attention. The main reason behind such a phenomenon could be the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions mitigation requirements and global warming aspects. These distributed resources are useful for zero-emission power generations. However, most of those generations are useless when we have a blackout since they are disconnected by the loss of AC power. As an example distributed generators could not used during the blackout after the Tohoku big earthquake. Thus, if we have installing the independence outlet, we can supply power in emergency. According to this research, we can consider EV as a power storage facility in a form of mobile batteries. In this paper, the objective is to construct the isolated power supply system with inexpensive elements. Even if proposed system is isolated from power system, the system can supply stable power by PV and EV. Thus, this paper evaluates sustainability of the isolated power supply system experimentation.

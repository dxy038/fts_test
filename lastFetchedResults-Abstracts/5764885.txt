The National Cancer Institute has collected a large database of digitized 35 mm slides of the uterine cervix, the idea being to build a system enabling to study the evolution of lesions related to cervical cancer. In taking the first few steps towards this goal, the objective of this work is to develop and evaluate methodologies required for visual-based (i.e. content-based) indexing and retrieval that substantially improve information management of such a database. In this paper we model the properties of three tissue types using color and texture features, and use these models for image segmentation. Statistical modeling and segmentation tools are used for the task.

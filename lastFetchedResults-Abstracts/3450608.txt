The analysis and design of an optoelectronic transceiver for bidirectional communication between a live laboratory animal and a fixed measurement instrument are presented. The transceiver is based on diffuse infrared radiation and operates even without direct sight of transmitter and receiver. The communication channel is first analyzed in terms of parameters such as attenuation, bandwidth, and S/N ratio. Multiplexing and modulation schemes are considered and the design of circuits used in the miniaturized battery-operated mobile unit are discussed. Examples of experimental in vivo measurements of brain metabolites are presented.

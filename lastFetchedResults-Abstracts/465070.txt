OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine predictors of successful external cephalic version and to calculate the associated cost savings achieved with success. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of 203 women with singleton gestations who underwent external cephalic version was performed. Descriptive, univariate, and multivariate analyses were performed on patient-specific risk data to predict successful version. National claims data were used for the cost simulation. RESULTS: Higher parity (p = 0.02), transverse-oblique presentation (p = 0.001), posterior placenta (p = 0.001), and a longer duration of pregnancy (p = 0.001) significantly increased the likelihood of a successful version. Heavier maternal weight was negatively associated with successful version (p = 0.05). The cost simulation revealed an average savings of $2462 for each successful version. CONCLUSION: This study identifies clinical variables associated with an increased external cephalic version success rate. If, in fact, successful external cephalic version reduces both maternal and fetal morbidity associated with cesarean delivery and, as demonstrated in this analysis, the costs associated with the delivery, then greater effort should be made to maximize the success rate of external cephalic version.

The primary objective of this paper is the study of a remote control system over the Internet or the telephone for the next generation air conditioner. In the current cooling system, an outdoor-air-conditioner is operated together with only one indoor-air-conditioner. However, in the next generation cooling system, it is expected that the only one outdoor-air-conditioner can be operated with many indoor-air-conditioners. Furthermore, all air conditioners should be controlled remotely by the Internet or the telephone. The structure of the next generation home cooling system is proposed. The next generation home cooling system consists of an aircon-server, an aircon-gateway per a house, an outdoor-air-conditioner per a house, several indoor-air-conditioner per a house etc. The aircon-server is the main host and can be communicated with all aircon-gateways through the Internet or telephone. An aircon-gateway is installed in a house or in a small office, and can be communicated with all air conditioners which are installed in a house or a small office through an AC 220 V power line. The communication protocol of the next generation cooling system is also proposed

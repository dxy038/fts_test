A SPLEEM (spin polarized low energy electron microscope) has been designed with a numerical simulation of electrostatic and magnetic field distributions and electron ray trajectories. Highly (more than 90%) spin polarized electron source has been used. A Wien type spin manipulator and a magnetic lens type spin rotator are used to align spin direction. A magnetic field free objective lens is designed to observe magnetic domain structure of magnetic materials. High or low magnification mode can be selected by using a combined electrostatic and magnetic objective lens for a high spatial resolution and a wide imaging area observation. An electrostatic mirror aberration corrector is installed after the image forming objective lens. A double deflection 45Â° beam separator is used to bend the direction of electrons from the source to the objective lens and from the objective lens to the mirror aberration corrector.

A region control scheme is proposed for underwater vehicle with onboard manipulator. In the proposed control concept, the desired objective can be specified as a region instead of a point. The region control concept is a generalisation of setpoint control problem because when the desired region is specified arbitrarily small, the control objective reduces to a point. Lyapunov-like functions are proposed for the stability analysis. Simulation studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.

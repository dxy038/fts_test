A large quantity of ERS InSAR data and several scenes of Radarsat InSAR data were used to study historical deformation at Mount Meager in Northern B.C. The Mount Meager Volcanic Complex is a hazardous area showing an anomalously high frequency of catastrophic slope failures. It is also the location of CanadaÂ´s most recent explosive volcanic eruption (2350 YBP). The primary objective of processing and analysis of the SAR data was to detect and measure small deformation events on the slopes of the mountain. A similarly large number of repeated ERS SAR scenes collected over the urban area of Vancouver between 1992 and 2000 was selected for InSAR processing. The objective of the project was to investigate the potential of detecting and measuring very small deformation rates (better than 1 mm/yr) and deformation events while taking advantage of the large volume of SAR datasets. The following types of deformation were of specific interest: 1. Stability of the Fraser River Delta 2. Tidal loading 3. Subsidence patterns in urban areas 4. Deformation of individual buildings, bridges and infrastructure. This paper provides some information on the processing methodologies that were employed as well as results and interpretation of the results.

Background: Correlation between chronological age at different stages of cervical vertebral
maturation (CVM) is important in clinical orthodontic practice. The objective of this study was to
evaluate the correlation between CVM stage and chronological age in a group of Iranian female
patients.
Materials and Methods: This study was conducted on 196 digital lateral cephalometry of
female patients with the age ranged 9-14 years. The CVM stage was determined with two
calibrated examiners, using the method developed by Baccetti and its correlation with mean
chronological age was assessed by the Spearman rank-order. The intra and inter-agreements
were evaluated by weighted Kappa statistics in overall diagnosis of stages, in addition to
determination of presence or absent of concavities at the lower border of second, third and
fourth cervical vertebrae and the shapes of the third and fourth vertebrae. P  <  0.05 was
considered as signifi cant.
Results: The correlation coeffi cient between CVM stages and chronological age was relatively
low (r = 0.62). The least amount of inter-observer agreement was determined to be at the clinical
decision of the shape of the fourth vertebra.
Conclusion: Regarding the low reported correlation, the concomitant usage of other skeletal
indicators seems necessary for precise determination of physiological age of the patients.

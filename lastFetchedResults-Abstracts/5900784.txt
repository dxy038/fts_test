Integrated information, innovation and collaboration are the key factors for the sustainable development of construction organizations nowadays. The advancement of cloud computing technology offers construction organizations great potential for developing a collaborative and integrated environment for construction management. This paper presents an in-depth literature review of cloud computing in construction management. Findings from this review have shown that the benefit of using cloud computing technology for construction collaboration will reduce both energy consumption and CO2 emissions, indeed, it is more towards a green mission as it also provides both a financial return and a tangible environmental benefit. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to investigate the most valuable construction collaboration tools as the cloud computing technology along with the main concepts of sustainable project management. The findings in this research illustrate that with implementing the cloud computing in construction industry, it will facilitate the construction processes, collaborations, communications, relations and networks through the construction industry. Firstly, it is hoped that this study will contribute on improvements in construction industry collaboration which could ultimately improve and enhance the competitive advantages within the construction industry. Secondly, it introduces the new visions of construction industry integration and most significantly collaboration in an efficient way that will eventually maximise the productivity, enhance the efficiency and improve the effectiveness towards a green construction industry.

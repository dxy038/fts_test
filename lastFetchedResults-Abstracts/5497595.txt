The clutch , a key transmission part , secures a crucial role especially to torsional oscillation in an automobile. Based on the influence of the torsion stiffness and the torsion damping to transmission system, optimal model of clutch torsional damper was given combined with DST240 series friction clutch which is used in some domestic automobile, and objective function was optimized. Torsional oscillation work condition of transmission system was improved after that. The practicability of optimal method is testified by the analysis results. The idea of taking physical property parameters of automobile clutch as optimal design variables is proposed for the first time and will be helpful to improve design methods for domestic automobile friction clutch and provide reliable design basis for the configuration design of automobile friction clutch.

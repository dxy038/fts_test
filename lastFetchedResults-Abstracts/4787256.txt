Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are evolving rapidly towards specialized application technologies aimed at enhancing monitoring capabilities in the environmental and safety domains. The recent trend of advancing wireless telecommunications technology and sensor design suggest that WSNs will soon find its way into our homes, industries, and natural surroundings. Current WSN research focuses on lowering power consumptions, and providing rigid network performances in terms of bandwidth availability and data rates. The objective of this paper is to develop an application framework for implementing a number of environmental and safety applications. We discuss the major elements of this framework including: Over-The-Air-Programming (OTAP), communication and network configuration, sensors manageability, power efficiency, alarm generation, and finally remote connectivity.

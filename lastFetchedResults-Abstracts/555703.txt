ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Muscular involvement presenting as myalgia, myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are the most important side effects of statins. Frequently statins and other antiangina and antihypertensive agent are used as combination in order to preventing and management of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular and cerobrovascular disorders. Here we present a case of rhabdomyolysis after lovastatin and diltiazem consumption.
CASE: An 80 year old man with decreased level of consciousness presented to emergency ward of Shahid Yahyanejad hospital of Babol, Iran. Past medical history revealed diltiazem and lovastatin consumption (40mg/daily) from three days before. Diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis was documented according to history, physical exam and laboratory test regarding hyperkalemia and bradyarrhythmia leading to cardiovascular collapse. During successful resuscitation arrhythmia and hemodynamic failure and hyperkalemia was corrected and patient was discharged from hospital without any morbidity after convalescence.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that combination of statins and diltiazem can potentially lead to serious side effects that can be prevented by accenting on pharmacology consideration in prescribing statins and avoiding conjoins these agents with diltazem especially in old age patient.

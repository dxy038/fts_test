The explosive increase in Internet traffic definitely requires operators to turn their eyes to a flat-based mobile architecture, providing scalable and reliable mobility solutions for future evolved mobile networks. Distributed and Dynamic Mobility Management (DMM) is one of the main enablers to implement the flat-based mobile architecture, placing anchor functions at the edges and providing dynamic mobility activation. In this paper, we perform a simulation study to assess the impact of the DMM strategy, focused on the data plane, in mobile networks. The main objective of this paper is to identify how much DMM can be effective in reducing network stresses imposed on the mobile backhaul and core networks, compared to Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) having excellent handover performance among centralized mobility protocols. Simulation results demonstrate that DMM is effective to improve packet delivery efficiency and to mitigate the network stresses due to IP mobility support by distributing anchoring burdens and eliminating the need of packet anchoring.

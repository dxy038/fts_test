OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the antibody levels against platelet-activating factor (PAF), PAF-like lipids lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), cardiolipin (CL), and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in recurrent abortion.
STUDY DESIGN: Eigthy-five women with a history of at least 3 recurrent spontaneous abortions (55 women with primary abortion [31.4±5.1 years old]; 30 women with secondary abortion [33±4.5 years old]) were compared with 48 age-matched control subjects (33±4.4 years old) who had delivered without complications. Antibodies were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: Antibodies against PAF and antibodies against oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (oxPAPC) were raised significantly in the group with primary abortion, as compared to control subjects (P<.05) and not significantly higher than in secondary abortion; antibodies against oxidized LDL, LPC, or CL levels did not differ between groups.
CONCLUSION: Antibodies against platelet-activating factor and antibodies against platelet-activating factor–like lipid oxPAPC are associated with primary recurrent abortion and may function as novel disease markers. Whether these antibodies also are pathogenic (eg, by interacting with endothelial cells in placenta or by interfering with platelet-activating factor during embryonal development) remains to be shown.

The objective of this research is to investigate the potential of transesterification of crude palm oil (CPO) to biodiesel at 30 °C. The mass transfer limitations problem crucial at 30 °C due to the viscosity of CPO has been addressed. The process parameters that are closely related to mass transfer effects like enzyme loading, agitation speed and reaction time were optimized. An optimum methanol to oil substrate molar ratio at 6.5:1 was observed and maintained throughout the experiments. The optimum operating condition for the transesterification process was found at 6.67 wt% of enzyme loading and at 150 rpm of agitation speed. The corresponding initial reaction and FAME yield obtained at 6 h were 89.29% FAME yield/hr and 85.01%, respectively. The 85% FAME yield obtained at 30 °C operation of CPO transesterification shows that the process is potentially feasible for the biodiesel synthesis.

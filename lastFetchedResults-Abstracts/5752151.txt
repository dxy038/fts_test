The first generation CELL processor presented a test challenge in that the chip incorporated multiple processing elements, several multi-gigahertz synchronous and asynchronous clock domains, and many custom design elements. The test objective for the CELL design was to have high test coverage and a small test time. In addition to the objectives mentioned above, the CELL test logic is designed to support a modular design point and support for partial good processing elements. This paper will give an overview of the manufacturing test elements that were designed into the CELL processor

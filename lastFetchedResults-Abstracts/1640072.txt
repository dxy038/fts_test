The objective of this paper is to characterize self-compacting concretes produced with lightweight aggregates (SCLC) available in the Iberian Peninsula. The influence of different compositions on the self-compactability of SCLC is analyzed and some limits are suggested for their formulation. The usual self-compacting tests and additional segregation tests were considered. SCLC of adequate stability and self-compactability could be produced for compressive strengths between 37.4 and 60.8 MPa, density classes D1.8–D2.0 and 490–599 kg/m3 of fines content with 33% fly ash by weight. Promising results were obtained in the SCLC mechanical characterization.

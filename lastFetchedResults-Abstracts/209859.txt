Objective: This study introdu ced a simple method for bovine blastocyst vitrification.
Materials and Methods: Bovine blastocysts were produced in vitro by means of a whole
co-culture system with vera cells . The blastocysts were randoml y divided 1:3 into either vitrification
(100 blastocysts ) or control (43 blastocysts ) groups. For vitrification,expanded - blastocysts
were incubated first in equilibration medium for 8 minutes and then in the vitrification
solution for 1 minute . The blastocysts were then loaded in the tip of a handmad e cryotip for
immediate - deep freezing in liquid nitrogen . Frozen embry os were then warmed by directly
immersing the tips in sequential warming solutions . warmed embryo s were cultured for a
further period of 48 hours when the ratios of re-expan sion, hatching and degeneration were
compared with the control group.
Results : After warming , in the vitrified and control groups the ratios of re-expansi on were
78.5% ± 0.067 and 81.6% ± 0.072, the ratios of hatching were 43.7% ± 0.083 and 49.8%
± 0.089 and the ratios of degeneration were 36% ± 0.082 and 22.3% ± 0.087, respectively,
which were not significantly different between the two groups .
Conclusion: Post - warming survival of the vitrified and non - vitrified embry os were not
significantly different, handm ade cryotips can be used as an efficient and feasible device for
bovine blastocysts vitr ification

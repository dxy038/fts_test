We make objective and informal subjective measurements of the floating-point 16 kb/s LD-CELP performance with different bit-error rates. We also study the sensitivity of this coder to errors in gain and shape codeword index parts and the effect of an error to future outputs of the coder. Based on the transmitted code statistics we attempt to minimize the annoying effects of codeword errors. Finally, we examine audible oscillations and distortions in the synthesized speech signal, again in the context of channel errors

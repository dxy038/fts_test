Objective: Multiscale Entropy(MSE)analysis was applied to investigate the complexity of the traditional Chinese medicine pulse condition of the patient with coronary heart disease (CHD), laying the foundation for the development and promotion of pulse diagnosis as a noninvasive diagnostic technique. Methods: Firstly MSE with window movement (WMSE) are used to analyze the complexity of pulses signal of 225 patients with the CHD , 218 patients with the hypertension and 117 normal subjects, and their WMSE values are converted to rank for ANOVA test. Then boxplots are employed to show the distribution of WMSE parameters. Results: The WMSE values of pulses signal of three groups are significantly difference each other. The five WMSEs values of the CHD group are lowest, those of the normal subjects are highest, and those of the hypertension group fall into between the above two groups.

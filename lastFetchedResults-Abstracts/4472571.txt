Auto-Disturbance Rejection Controller (ADRC) has been proved to be a capable replacement of PID with unmistakable advantage in performance and practicality. But it is difficult to obtain a set of optimal parameters, for ADRC controller has too many parameters and has no deterministic rules to compute the parameters. In this paper, Objective function is constructed based on the control system performance indexes. Combined with experienced parameters of ADRC, an invasive weed optimization algorithm (IWO) is employed to obtain a set of key parameters. The simulation results show the validity of the IWO algorithm.

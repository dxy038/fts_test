A clustering problem with balancing constraints is studied in this paper, which means that the sample number in each cluster has to be at least pre-given value. A modified k-means clustering algorithm is proposed, which adopt the proposed heuristic cluster assignment algorithm to deal with the balancing constraints. Numerical computation shows that the proposed algorithm can deal with the balancing constraints and lead to the improvement of the clustering objective.

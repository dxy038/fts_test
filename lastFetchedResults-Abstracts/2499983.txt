<p><strong>Objective: </strong>Medically unexplained symptoms are physical symptoms, which cannot be explained by organic ‎causes. This study aimed to investigate mental health in patients with medically unexplained ‎physical symptoms. ‎<br /><strong>Method:</strong> One hundred outpatients who were admitted to the Electro Diagnosis Clinic of Imam Khomeini ‎hospital, Ahvaz/Iran, participated in this study. Data were collected using physical examination, ‎paraclinical examinations, and SCL-90-R, and analyzed through multivariate analysis of variance ‎‎ (MANOVA), Chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test. ‎<br /><strong>Results:</strong> The findings revealed significant differences between clients with medically explained and ‎unexplained symptoms in obsessive compulsive and somatization (p&lt;0.05). Differences in ‎depression, anxiety, phobia, psychosis, aggression and paranoia were not significant (p&gt;0.05).‎<strong><br />Conclusion</strong>: The present study suggested an association between some psychological problems and somatic ‎symptoms. Therefore, screening for psychological impairments can improve clinical outcomes.</p>

The Advanced Solid-State Array Spectroradiometer (ASAS) is an airborne remote sensing instrument that acquires digital image data for 62 spectral channels in the visible and near-infared. It has an off-nadir tilting capability that has engendered its use as a tool for studying the bidirectional reflectance characteristics of Earth surfaces. Over the last three years, ASAS has undergone numerous upgrades that have resulted in increased data volumes and new data formats. A Unix-based processing system has been developed to decommutate, calibrate, analyze, and archive the ASAS digital imagery. In 1994, it will be tasked to process over 100 gigabytes of data to be acquired during field campaigns in Canada. This paper describes the ASAS processing system and the techniques involved in producing radiometrically calibrated data products for investigators

This paper sets out the findings of a pre-feasibility study on a renewable energy project, conducted by Promethium Carbon, at the Gold Fields Driefontein Mine. The aim is to identify and quantify possible biomass and waste sources at the Driefontein mine, and propose technologies for renewable energy generation. A first pass financial evaluation of the conceptual project design was also included. The study objective is to achieve a triple bottom-line; energy security, social benefits, and environmental benefits, while ensuring that the project is financially viable. Biomass sources identified include on-site alien vegetation and other mining waste streams. An on-site energy plantation was proposed as an additional feedstock stream, and evaluated in terms of land availability, water availability, and the viability of certain indigenous species. Various thermal conversion technology process routes were assessed for technical and financial viability. Carbon credit eligibility was also considered for this project at a feasibility level.

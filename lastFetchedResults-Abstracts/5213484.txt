This paper presents a technique for designing self-checking logic circuits by using residue codes. There are no restrictions or assumptions made about the implementation of the circuit. For any single stuck-at fault that causes bidirectional error at the output, all pairs of faulty output lines that show bidirectional errors are identified. Based on the bidirectional dependency between the outputs, a minimum set of residue weights are assigned to the output lines so that any error at the outputs can be detected

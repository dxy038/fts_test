Study objective: To evaluate the safety of using ultrasound to image exploding bullets that have not detonated. Methods:  We evaluated various types of exploding bullets using ultrasonography at various depths with various transducers and using standard radiography. Results: None of the unexploded bullets subjected to ultrasonography or standard radiography exploded. Conclusion:  Our results suggest that evaluation of exploding bullets with ultrasonography is safe. [Schlager D, Johnson T, McFall R: Safety of imaging exploding bullets with ultrasound.

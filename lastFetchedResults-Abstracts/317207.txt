Osseointegrated percutaneous implants were placed at different sites of the facial skeleton to improve the retention of facial prostheses. Based on four cases a new implant position in autogenous bone grafts for retention of orbital restorations is described. As a first step an autogenous iliac bone graft was transplanted into the orbit. After a minimum interval of 3 months endosseous implants were placed into the grafted bone in axial direction in the middle of the orbit. A third operation several months later uncovered the implants. Using single free-standing rare earth magnetic attachments the orbital episthesis or the eye prosthesis was reliably stabilized. In all cases the bone grafts were integrated at the host site. Nine implants with a follow-up period of 4â€“66 months have been placed of which one was lost. The patients experienced subjective and objective improvement. Indications and advantages of the method are discussed.

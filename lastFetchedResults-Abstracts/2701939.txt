This paper explores control strategies for active power distribution nodes (APDNs) using a hierarchical approach. The proposed APDN consists of multiple bidirectional interface modules and an embedded energy storage that is commonly connected to these modules. Such configuration properties make the APDN attractive as a major interface unit for active power flow control in microgrids and power distribution networks. A two-level hierarchy is considered so that the primary level performs load sharing using droop control, and the secondary level performs embedded energy storage management. The stability of the proposed control framework is studied and the proposed design is verified by an experimental setup.

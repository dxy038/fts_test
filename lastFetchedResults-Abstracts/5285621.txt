Optimization of antenna array using in SAR system is considered in this study. A robust evolutionary algorithm, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms (improved NSGA-II), is applied on a spaceborne SAR antenna pattern design. The system consists of two objective functions with two constraints. Pareto front are generated as a result of multi-objective optimization. After being validated by a test problem ZDT4, the algorithms were used to synthesis antenna radiation pattern. The good results with low ASR and high directivity are obtained.

Data were then analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent T test, variance analysis, and Pearson correlation coefficient through SPSS software version 19. Results indicated that the mean score of librarians' general health was 22.8Â±10.38 which shows that participants were healthy. Furthermore, marital status was associated with health and its components so that married individuals were less healthy.

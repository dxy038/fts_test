Pulmonary sequestration is a relatively rare malformation. Infection with common pyogenes is a frequent feature in the evolution of this disease. We report a case of intralobar sequestration infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis  in the absence of any other site of tuberculous infection. The patient underwent surgical removal of the affected lobe and subsequent antituberculous chemotherapy. At 1-year follow-up his clinical status is excellent.

Objective: We explored whether smoking is associated with cancer screening behaviors. Methods: We used data from the 2007 Florida Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the Florida Tobacco Callback Survey to examine screening behaviors related to four cancer types (breast, cervical, prostate, and colorectal). Using multiple logistic regression analyses, we examined the association between smoking status and health screening behaviors. Results: For 10 of the 11 cancer screening variables, being a current smoker was significantly associated with being less likely to ever have been screened and also less likely to be compliant with screening guidelines. For breast and cervical cancer, level of nicotine dependence was also significantly related to compliance with screening recommendations; women with higher levels of dependence were less likely to be compliant. Conclusions: Our results support the notion that individualsâ€™ actions related to their health are consistent across different types of behaviors. We found that smokers were less likely to engage in cancer screening behaviors. In addition, among smokers, individuals with greater nicotine dependence had lower compliance with some screening tests. Physicians should ensure that their patients who smoke are receiving appropriate and adequate screening for cancer.

The objective of this work was to compare the physiochemical (molecular weight distribution and amino acid composition) and rheological (viscosity property, gel strength and melting point) properties of gelatins from skins of carp caught in winter to those obtained for the summer equivalents. Gelatins from winter and summer fish skins were extracted at 60, 70 and 80 °C. SDS-PAGE patterns for gelatins extracted under the same conditions showed that the degradation of gelatins from winter fish skins were more severe than that of the summer ones. The imino acid contents of the winter and summer gelatins extracted at 60 °C were very similar, showing 190 and 188 residues/1000 residues, respectively. The gelatins from summer fish presented higher melting points and gel strengths, as well as better viscosity properties than the winter equivalents (P < 0.05). The differences in the rheological properties between winter and summer gelatins may be explained by different thermostability of interstitial collagen molecules (from which gelatins were derived) in the two seasons.

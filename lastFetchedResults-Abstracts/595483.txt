Objective: To assess the different morphological types of atherosclerotic lesions in cigarette smokers and Hukka smokers in our population. Methodology: This descriptive study was conducted at the mortuary of King Edward Medical University Lahore and Department of Pathology Allama Iqbal Medical College Lahore from June 2007 to July 2009. Heart, aorta coronary arteries and renal arteries were collected from dead bodies. One to four areas of tissue were taken from aorta and each artery in all cases. Sections were prepared from paraffin blocks. These were stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin stain. Special stains were also performed to differentiate all the components of atherosclerotic lesions. Results: A total of 130 human autopsies were carried out in this study. Out of these, 84 were smokers (62 cigarette and 22 hukka somkers). The analysis was carried out on these 84 cases. The mean age of smokers was 48.63+16.079. Fibrolipid plaques and complicated/ calcified lesions were seen in predominantly more cases in cigarette smokers, than hukka smokers in aorta, coronary arteries and renal arteries. Conclusion: This study shows distribution of different atherosclerotic lesions in cigarette smokers and hukka smokers in our population. The raised atherosclerotic involvement in cigarette smokers as compared to hukka smokers is evident from the results.

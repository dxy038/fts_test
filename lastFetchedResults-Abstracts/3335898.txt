Objective of this study was to investigate reflection of emotions based on different stories onto EEG. EEG data that used in this study have been acquired from database University of California San Diego. EEG signal was filtered to frequency range that contain important sub-bands of EEG by using discrete wavelet transform to analyze reflection of emotion based on different stories onto EEG. Power spectrum estimation of EEG that filtered to related frequancy range was obtained by using Burg method. Diffrerent power spectrum densities onto EEG signal were obtained for each different emotions based on different stories. There are similar studies in literature and results that were obtained in this study support the similar studies.

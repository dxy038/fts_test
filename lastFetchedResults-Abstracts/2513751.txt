Wastewater contains many organic and inorganic contaminants that can cause serious damage to
the environment and health of people, Therefore, they have to be eliminated before being downloaded into
sensitive areas. Different methods of wastewater purification have been used for contaminants removal.
However,they present some technical and economic limitations. Thus, new methods of nutrients removal by
microalgae based on phytoremediation techniques, become promising methods due to its viability.The objective
of wastewater treatment is to improve and purify the water. For that, the removal of all or some of the nutrients
present in water is carried out, resulting in a reusable or suitable water to be returned to its natural
environment. This study investigates the capacity of Chlorella Vulgarismicroalga as a potential candidate for
removing the phospho-rous and organic matter from wastewater. The strain of microalga was cultivated in
synthetic wastewater at room temperature with artificial illumination and aeration. Algal growth parameters
such aspH, chemical oxygen demand, phosphorus, cell number, optical density and dry weightwere
measuredduring experimental period. Under these conditions, microalgae were able to remove the phosphorus
concentration by more than 99%. By other hand, the chemical oxygen demand was reduced at 71%. After
9days of cultivation, the biomass concentra-tion increased from 0.05 to0.57 g/L.The results of this study
suggest that growing Chlorella Vulgarismicroalgaein wastewater offers a new option of applying algae to
manage the nutrient load. After then obtained biomasscan be usedfor biofuel production.

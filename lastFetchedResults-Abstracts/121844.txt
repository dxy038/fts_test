BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cholinergic syndrome (cholinergic crisis) is an extremely dangerous complication of anticholinesterase drugs such as neostigmine. Isolated forearm technique (I.F.T) with IV injection of neostigmine is used for the evaluation of awareness which is an deliberate problem in narcotic based anesthesia. This method is used for evaluation of ischemia of the anterior spinal artery and weakness of upper extremity motor after operation of cervical spines.
CASE: The case was a 43 year old women with dislocated Cl- C2 fracture who was candidated for cervical spines surgery. After I.F.T, induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation (muscarinic and nicotinic) cholinergic symptoms of crisis were developed that the cause of this presentation was I.F.T with injection of neostigmine.
CONCLUSION: Since, the evaluation of awareness is not so predictable by I.F.T procedure, it is recommended to use other modem techniques such as bispectral index, nerve stimulators and evoked potentials.

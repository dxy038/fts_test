Introduction: Effective research management at the universities requires managerial skills.
Objective: This study was conducted to assess the managerial skills of the research managers at the Universities of Medical Sciences in Iran in 2003.
Materials and Methods: Self-administered questionnaire containing 21 items was designed to assess the technical skills (methodological, technological, budgeting), conceptual skills and the human skills of the managers. The rating scale of 5 degrees was used. The consuming time on each skill and the managers' motivation for work were also asked.
Results: Of the total number of 78 managers, 50 answered. About 60% of them have assessed their skills at high degree and 40% moderate or weak. Their assessment revealed that they are weaker in technical skills such as quantitative approach, data analysis, and resource identification, budgeting and financial skills. Concerning conceptual skills, they needed to be trained in systems approach, designing, situation analysis and prediction.
The most of the managers' time was spent on methodological skills (35.7%) and the other skills took the following ranks respectively: conceptual skills (22.4%), budgeting and financial skills(15.4%), human skills(14.5%), technological skills(11.8%). A personal incentive had more effects on their function (39.7%), and the organizational task was the second effective factor.
Conclusion: It is concluded that managerial skills of the research managers should be empowered within the framework of in-service programs basing on the educational goal proposed in the paper.

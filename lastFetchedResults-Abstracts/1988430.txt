The objective of this study was to investigate the profiles of phenolic phytochemicals in the leaves of Korean purple perilla (cv. Bora, Perilla fructescens) using reversed-phase C18 column chromatography and HPLC with DAD-ESI/MS analysis. Changes in their contents were also the first reported through eight different harvest times during two months. They were characterised as five anthocyanins and three phenolic acids including cyanidin-3,5-di-O-glucoside (1), cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (2), cyanidin-3-O-(6-O-caffeoyl)glucoside-5-O-glucoside (3), cyanidin-3-O-(6-O-coumaroyl)glucoside-5-O-glucoside (4), cyanidin-3-O-(6-O-coumaroyl)glucoside (5), caffeic acid (6), rosmarinic acid (7), and rosmarinic acid methylester (8). Significant differences were observed between individual and total phytochemical contents, especially, cyanidin-3-O-(6-O-coumaroyl)glucoside-5-O-glucoside (4) and rosmarinic acid (7) exhibited the predominant constituents. Among different harvest times, the highest content was found with 82.473 mg/g on 21st September, while the lowest was 39.000 mg/g on 17th August. These results may be useful in determining the optimal harvest time at which phenolic phytochemicals reaches a maximum level in mid-September.

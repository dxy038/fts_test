The objective of this article is introducing the sedimentation and precipitate potential of fresh water in guy bolagh region placed on the north west of Shahriar – Tehran. (Rainfall year 1390). This research is done by the descriptive method, part time period and use of RAYZNER and saturation parameter and SHULER diagram.     In this study these parameters: (alkalinity, calcium hardness, electrical connectivity, temperature and PH) were analyzed. The results of experiments and calculations suggest it hand and average saturation index versus 0/54, and the average index rayzner against 13/7 is. Based on a standard table ministry of health figures indicate deposition and slightly corrosive drinking water wells in the village Guy Bolagh is based on results and accomplishment ,the fresh water of this region is sedimental and a little corrosion that this factor is influenced by  regions  geology and continent features. So in the area of water quality parameters based on PH, alkalinity, hardness and … should be Occur. In this regard, use of corrosion resistant materials and pipes and consider using incendiary devices deposition.

The initial findings from user trials convinced us that a fully integrated solution on a smart phone platform is the ultimate design objective. A smart phone is a perfect I/O and capture device for applications weÂ´re targeting. We estimate that the reader/writer will share 80 percent of a wireless local-area-network (WLAN) system, so the silicon real estate increase would be minimal when implementing our reader/writer. More than IS times faster than existing RFID technologies, the batteryless Memory Spot system supports reading, writing, and appending of megabytes of digital content.

Ant colony algorithm offers us a effective method to look for shortest routing. This article aims at two goals, namely shortest rescue routing and shortest rescue time, and it sets up a multiple-objective vehicle routing problem(VRP) model. In order to increase speed of convergence, the article presents a new style of pheromone update-rank-based ant colony algorithm based on elite ant and improves visibility. The results of simulation experiments show that the improved algorithm surpasses existing algorithm in the performance and has better convergence.

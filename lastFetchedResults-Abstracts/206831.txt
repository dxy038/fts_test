As their names show, nominative and objective adjectives represent the characteristics of the nouns they modify in both languages. Along with expressing the characteristics of the nouns they modify, these two adjective types indicate the action inherent in the verbs from which they are derived. In Persian, nominative and objective adjectives can be derived from all verbs, in Russian, however, objective adjectives can only be derived from transitive verbs. While in Persian only objective adjective contain the concept of time, in Russian nominative as well as objective adjectives represent the concept of time both in form and in meaning.

The objective of the project was investigated that the relationships between cytochrome c and fibroblasts proliferation. The electron transport from cytochrome a3 to CuB was blocked by sodium azide and the action of Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in cell membrane was inhibited by ouabain. Light emitting diode was stimulated after sodium azide and ouabain treatment to investigate whether cytochrome c was related to fibroblasts proliferation. We also realized whether two inhibitors affected ATP synthesis at the same time. The results will be realized whether fibroblasts proliferation by light emitting diode stimulation was related to ATP synthesis in mitochondria. Furthermore, the mechanism of fibroblasts proliferation by light emitting diode stimulation was also demonstrated.

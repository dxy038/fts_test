Community discovery in complex network has become an interesting topic in recent years. Multi-objective optimizations can entirely handle community discovery problem instead of single objective optimizations. Thus a multi-objective genetic algorithm approach is proposed for community discovery in complex networks in this paper. We improved MOGA-Net [1] proposed by Pizzuti by applying effective searching on search space at genetic algorithm steps. We tested our approach and achieved better results on synthetic networks and real life networks.

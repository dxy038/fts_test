Our purpose is to compare the performance of the IEEE standard multi-band power system stabilizer to that of a proposed self-tuned fuzzy stabilizer. The comparison is based on a bench mark system that consists of a 4-machine two-area power system. The objective is to damp local- and inter-area modes of oscillations that appear following large disturbances. The proposed stabilizer is hierarchical. It consists of two fuzzy systems. The first one provides an excitation signal while the second one acts online as a supervisor to tune the scaling factors of the first. The consequents of the rule base of the supervisory fuzzy system are set based on particle swarm optimization. Effects of loading conditions, fault locations, and loosing a generating unit are investigated by simulations. The merits of the proposed stabilizer are highlighted.

Abstract
Objective
Sayehmiri et al. recently conducted a meta-analysis to explore the relationship
between zinc and copper metabolism and autism spectrum disorders (ASD).
Recent reports have elucidated a full behavioral profile of mice exposed to
prenatal zinc deficiency and documented a phenotype similar to that found
in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). These studies suggest that significant
alterations in Zn metabolism may be an important nutritional component in the
development of ASD.
Materials & Methods
The idea that prenatal zinc deficiency may be to blame is cursorily challenged.
Epidemiological studies show that high-income countries with a low estimated
prevalence of inadequate zinc intake report the highest prevalence of ASD.
Consistent with other reports indicating a link between air pollution and ASD, it
has recently been proposed that use of the herbicide, glyphosate, in agriculture
may serve as an instrumental variable in predicting later neurodevelopmental
impairment via emissions of the agricultural air pollutant, nitrous oxide (N2O).
Results
Work in anesthesiology has demonstrated the neurological effects from
subanesthetic doses of N2O, including its inhibition of the alpha 7 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor (?7), a receptor coupled to both central nitric oxide (NO)
metabolism and peripheral anti-inflammation.
Conclusion
This correspondence explores how the aforementioned nutritional phenotypes
found by Sayehmiri et al. in their systematic review may be a compensatory
mechanism to counter the effects (namely, ?7 inhibition) of air pollutant
exposures occurring during the most critical stages of fetal development.

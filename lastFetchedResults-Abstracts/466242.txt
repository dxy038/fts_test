Objective: Our purposes were to investigate patients’ opinions of hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, and hormone replacement therapy and to evaluate whether their outlook and experience influenced the overall satisfaction and continuation of hormone replacement therapy. Study Design: We conducted a questionnaire survey of 200 patients before and 2 years after hysterectomy with or without bilateral oophorectomy. Postoperatively all patients received long-term estradiol and testosterone replacement. The inquiries of patients’ views included (1) preoperative awareness of indication and outlook, (2) postoperative recovery, symptom relief, and experiences with hormone replacement therapy, (3) perceived benefits and problems, (4) changes in physical well-being, psychologic state, and sexual activity, (5) continuation of hormone replacement therapy, and (6) overall satisfaction. Results: The outlook toward hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, and hormone replacement therapy was positive in 77.4%, 87.1%, and 76.3%, respectively. The experience was positive in the majority, with a satisfactory postoperative recovery (70.6%), complete symptom relief (77.9%), and minimal side effects with hormone replacement therapy (5.2%). The benefits included improved physical well-being (79.9%), lower depressive symptoms (32.0%), and better sexuality (31.4%). The continuation rate of hormone replacement therapy was 97.4%, and overall satisfaction was positive in 88.7% of patients. The independent predictors of satisfaction were outlook toward hysterectomy and incomplete symptom relief. Conclusion: The outcome of hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, and hormone replacement therapy was satisfactory to most patients. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;183:1427-33.)

We present a number of broadband, 2-18 GHz, active MMICs intended for use in broadband active distribution networks. These networks are often part of a radar transmit or receive array antenna and are often passive and lossy structures. The possibility of gain in the distribution network reduces the need for additional amplification and can improve the system dynamic behaviour as well as noise performance. The MMICs considered in this paper are an active power splitter an active power combiner and a bidirectional power splitter/combiner. The circuits have been fabricated using a 0.2 &#956;m GaAs PHEMT foundry process from OMMIC. Measured results show good agreement with simulations

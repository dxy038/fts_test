Background and Objectives: During the initial stages of an emergency, using emergency
food products (EFP) is very important due to no access to cooking utensils and appliances, ruin
of foundations and displacement of people which uprooted from their homes. The emergency
food products (EFP), a term used to cover a range of products such as fortified biscuits,
compressed food bars and nutrient dense pastes that are transported easily and can be consumed
immediately.
The objective of this project was formulation of emergency biscuit which cover daily
requirements to energy, protein and micronutrients and improvement of sensory property of
resulting biscuit.
Materials and Methods: In this study, biscuits (with different formulations) were produced
according to the EFP nutrients table which prepared by 10M. These emergency biscuits should
satisfies all nutrient requirements (energy, protein, vitamins and minerals) for a population of all
ages over 6 months for initial crisis phase and appropriate for use as the sole source of food
materials for up to IS days.
For this purpose, live Iype formulations were prepared and then sample that had better
technological feathers was select. Sensory evaluation of the emergency biscuits was performed
by a 100 members taste panel that was selected from students and employers of Tabriz
University.
Results: The results of the work showed that there was not significant differences between
emergency biscuit and convenient biscuit produced by same manufacturer(p>O.OSl.
Conclusions: The formulated emergency biscuit had relatively good acceptability and could
be used in emergency situations.

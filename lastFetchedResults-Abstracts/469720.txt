Objective
The purpose of this study was to examine nondelivery, pregnancy-associated hospitalizations in the United States and the factors associated with them.
Study design
Population-based nondelivery hospitalizations during pregnancy were obtained from the 1999 and 2000 National Hospital Discharge Survey. Ratios of hospitalizations per 100 deliveries were calculated and analyzed by age, race, and payment source.
Results
The pregnancy-associated hospitalization ratio for 1999 through 2000 was 12.8 per 100 deliveries (95% CI, 11.8-13.8). Hospitalizations were highest among young women, African American women, and women without private insurance. Preterm labor, nausea and/or vomiting, and genitourinary complications accounted for one half of antenatal hospitalizations.
Conclusion
Pregnancy-associated hospitalizations declined during the 1990s. This may represent a decline in maternal morbidity or a change in management of pregnancy complications. Future research should be expanded to assess trends in morbidity treated in settings outside of hospitals.

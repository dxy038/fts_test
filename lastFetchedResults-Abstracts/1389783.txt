The objective of this study was to compare the cardiopulmonary effects of a xylazine or romifidine loading-dose, followed by a constant rate infusion (CRI) of the same α2-agonist. Nine research horses were treated in a randomized, blinded, crossover design with xylazine or romifidine. After instrumentation, a loading dose of intravenous xylazine (1 mg/kg) or romifidine (80 μg/kg) was administered, immediately followed by a CRI of xylazine (0.69 mg/kg/h) or romifidine (30 μg/kg/h) for a duration of 2 h. Cardiopulmonary variables were recorded before bolus administration, during CRI, and for 1 h after discontinuing drug administration.

ificant decrease in haemoglobin concentration (tHb), arterial oxygen content (CaO2), oxygen delivery ( D ˙ O 2 ), mixed venous partial pressure of oxygen, heart rate, and cardiac output ( Q ˙ t ) followed the loading dose with both treatments. Carotid arterial blood pressure (ABP), systemic vascular resistance, and right atrial pressure (RAP) increased significantly. The increased ABP was followed by a significant decrease compared to baseline. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure increased significantly with romifidine only. No significant changes in stroke volume, arterial partial pressure of oxygen, and oxygen consumption were observed. Changes in Q ˙ t and RAP were more pronounced with romifidine. During CRI, tHb, and CaO2 were significantly higher with romifidine, whereas D ˙ O 2 did not differ between treatments.

l, cardiopulmonary effects were more pronounced and lasted longer with romifidine compared to xylazine. However, during CRI, there was no difference in D ˙ O 2 between drugs. With both α2-agonists, cardiovascular effects were most pronounced after loading dose administration and tended to stabilize during CRI.

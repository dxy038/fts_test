The objective of the proposed work is to find the effects on the read performance of passive 13.56 MHz radio frequency identification system (RFID) when it was in close proximity to different types of metals and liquids. The performance degradation was measured in terms of change in read rate and read distance between tag and reader. In order to analyze real time environment, five types of materials with different material characteristics were undertaken for this study. Experiments were conducted in laboratory settings with different orientation and positions of metals with respect to the reader antenna and tags. Also tests were conducted to read the tag when it is tagged on the liquid container. From the results observed, it was found that the performance of the RFID system was affected when they were in the vicinity of metals and liquids and it was strongly depends on the orientation and position of the metals with respect to the reader and tag antenna.

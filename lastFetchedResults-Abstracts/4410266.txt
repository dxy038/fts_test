This paper presents a bidirectional double-boost dc-dc converter with higher efficiency for renewable energy applications. The proposed converter uses a non-dissipative RCD snubber, that not only reduces the voltage stress but also provides better efficiency to the converter. This bidirectional double-boost dc-dc converter operates under two modes namely charging and discharging. Under both charging and discharging modes, simulation waveforms have been obtained using MATLAB SIMULINK and thereby efficiency is evaluated. The various operational details of the proposed dc-dc converter has been discussed throughout the paper.

In this paper the design optimisation of both the stator and rotor of a reluctance synchronous machine, while taking inverter losses into account, is considered. The objective is to maximise the efficiency of the drive system (motor and inverter). Analytical calculations, based in part on finite element analysis results, are used to determine the drive system efficiency. The results show that by maximising drive system efficiency, the motorÂ´s power factor is automatically improved to reduce inverter losses. With the same stator diameter, number of stator slots and stack length as a premium efficiency induction motor, the reluctance synchronous machine drive system efficiency is shown to be superior to that of the premium efficiency (IE3) induction machine drive system on a 5.5 kW power level.

Partner selection is a very popular problem in the research of HMS, the key step in the formation of HMS is the decision making on partner selection. In this paper, collaboration process between holons is modeling with contract net protocol; and an activity network based multi-objective partner selection model is put forward. Then a new hybrid self-adaptive PSO (HAMPSO) algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve the multi-objective problem. PSO employs a collaborative population-based search, which is inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking. GA provides the optimization parameter of PSO to get a good performance during the hybrid search process. HAMPSO implements easily and reserves the generality of PSO and GA. The hybrid algorithm combines the high speed of PSO with the powerful ability to avoid being trapped in local minimum by velocity mutation. We compare the hybrid algorithm to both the standard PSO and GA model. The simulation results show that the proposed model and algorithm are effective. Moreover, such HAMPSO can be applied to many combinatorial optimization problems by simple modification

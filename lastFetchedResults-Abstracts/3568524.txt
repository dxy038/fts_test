An integrated starter/alternator (ISA) is normally designed to have high pole structure (10-14 poles) for high starting torque. However, its back electromotive force (EMF) at the peak revolutions per minute should be less than its battery voltage for the power flow control. For example, the back-EMF of a 12-pole ISA should be 42 V at 6000 r/min. These types of conflicting requirements lead to a nonclassical motor design that has extremely large field-weakening range (8:1&#8764;10:1). In this paper, we are considering the use of an induction machine instead of a permanent synchronous machine. As an idea for solving the voltage limit problem, two inverters are utilized with an objective of sharing the required voltage. The secondary inverter only takes care of the reactive voltage component that grows very fast in high-speed operation. Therefore, an extra voltage source is not required for the secondary inverter. Only a capacitor bank suffices for the secondary inverter.

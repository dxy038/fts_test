Cotrimoxazole is an antibacterial drug and is used for treatment of bacterial infections diseases. The objective of this research is to study the effect of different doses of cotrimoxazole on the hematological factors in adult male rats. In this study, 50 male wistar rats, each weighting 250+ 25g were used. Animals were divided into five groups of ten. The control group was received normal feed, the withness group was received propylene glycol and the three experimental groups were given oral doses of 30, 60 and 120 mg/kg cotrimoxazole for the period of 14 days. The blood samples were taken on 14th day and hematological factors were measured by culture counter including RBC, WBC, MCHC, MCV, MCH, HB, HCT, PLT. The statistical analysis of the results indicated a siginificant reduction (p<0.05) in RBC and PLT in two experimental groups which were received cotrimoxazole of 60 and 120 mg/kg in comparision with the control group. All the experimental group showed significant reduce (p<0.05) in MCHC and HCT in comparision with the control group. The groups received different doses of cotrimoxazol showed no significant changes in WBC and HB in comparision to control groups (P<0.05).

This paper presents a Fuzzy Dynamic Programming (FDP) methodology for finding the best preventive maintenance schedule of generating units in a centralized power system. If there is not any feasible solution for crisp model, the Fuzzy model could be a help for finding the best schedule with minimum violation. Objective function is to maintain units as earlier as possible to improve reliability, save maintenance expense of damaged machines. Various constraints such as spinning reserve, duration of maintenance and maintenance crew are being taken into account. In a case study, introducing a centralized power system with six generating units, and implying FDP, the solution will be obtained.

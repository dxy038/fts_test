A technique for fast multi-objective design optimization of antenna structures is presented. Our approach exploits variable-fidelity electromagnetic (EM) simulations, auxiliary co-kriging surrogate models, and design space reduction aimed at reducing the computational effort related to EM data acquisition necessary for surrogate model construction. The proposed technique is illustrated through the design of UWB MIMO antenna.

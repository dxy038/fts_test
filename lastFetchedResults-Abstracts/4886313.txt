Multimedia services have become a dominant part of the network and content providerÂ´s service portfolio. A formal modeling methodology for video quality assessment not only affords the providers a clear cause-effect management view of their services, but also helps to guide management and planning operations. We examine the relation between network performance and perceived video quality through VIDAR, a comprehensive VIDeo quality Analyzer in Real-time. VIDAR links network performance to objective frame quality (eSSIM), and modify eSSIM values by subjective filters. Through experiments, we show that VIDAR helps providers to better understand and assess the impact of the network performance on perceived video quality.

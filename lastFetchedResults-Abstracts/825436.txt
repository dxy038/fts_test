First-of-a-kind experimental data on the quenching of large masses of corium melt of realistic composition when poured into pressurised water at reactor scale depths are presented and discussed. The tests involved 18 and 44 kg of a molten mixture 80 w% UO2-20 w% ZrO2, which were delivered by gravity through a nozzle of diameter 0.1 m to 1 m depth nearly saturated water at 5.0 MPa. The objective was to gain early information on the melt/water quench process previous to tests that will involve larger masses of melt (1.50 kg of mixtures UO2ZrO2Zr). Particularly, pressures and temperatures were measured both in the gas phase and in the water. The results show that significant quenching occurred during the melt fall stage with 30% to 42% of the melt energy transferred to the water. About two-thirds of the melt broke up into particles of mean size of the order of 4.0 mm. The remaining one-third collected still molten in the debris catcher but did not produce any damage to the bottom plate. The maximum downward heat flux was 0.8 MW m2. The maximum vessel overpressurisation, i.e. 1.8 MPa, was recorded with 44 kg of melt poured into 255 kg of water and a gas phase volume of 0.875 m3. No steam explosions occurred.

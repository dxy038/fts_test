We evaluated the morbidity of nephrectomy in patients older than 80 years of age.

n June 2002 and March 2011, 2,530 patients underwent surgery for renal tumor at 5 French academic centers. Of these patients, 180 (7.1%) were 80 years of age or older; 22 (12%) and 158 (88%) patients underwent partial and radical nephrectomy, respectively, and 47 (26.1%) of whom were treated with a laparoscopic approach.

atient age was 82.3 years. Median Charlson score was 4. Mean preoperative glomerular filtration rate was 47 ml/min. A total of 136 complications were recorded in 70 patients (38.8% of all patients). Of these patients, 28 (15.5%), 25 (13.9%), and 17 (9.4%) experienced 1, 2, and 3 or more complications, respectively. According to the modified Clavien classification grade I, II, III, IV, and V complications were observed in 7, 81, 19, 23, and 6 patients, respectively. The transfusion rate was 31.1% (56). On logistic regression analysis, the parameters of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 2 to 4 (P = 0.035) and preoperative glomerular filtration rate less than 30 ml/min (P = 0.03) were independent predictive factors of morbidity.

ity and mortality are significant in the octogenarian population. The risk of complications should be considered in decision making for patients with renal cell carcinoma who were older than age 80 years.

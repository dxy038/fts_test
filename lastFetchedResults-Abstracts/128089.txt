BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Gout is a condition characterized by acute arthritis and hyperuricemia, but the prevalence of hyperuricemia and the level of serum uric acid (SUA) in acute gout is not known exactly. The present study was performed to determine the frequency of hyperuricemia in patients with gout and to compare the SUA level in acute gouty arthritis with control group.
METHODS: SUA level during the acute gouty arthritis diagnosed according to clinical criteria was measured by an enzymatic method in the fasting state and compared with age and sex matched controls. The frequency of hyperuricemia (SUA>7 mg/dl) was also determined during the acute gout attack.
FINDINGS: 57 patients (50 males, 7 females) and 57 controls (50 males, 7 females) were studied The mean age of patients and control group were 54+16 years and 56+14 years, respectively. The mean of SUA level in patients were significantly more than controls (8.5Â±1.8 and 5.3+1 mg/dl respectively, p<00001). Hyperuricemia was found in 75.5% of patients during the acute gout attack. In patients without hyperuricemia_ the mean of SUA level was 6.4+0.6 mg/dl that was significantly more than controls (p<0001).
CONCLUSION: Acute gouty arthritis is not always associated with hyperuricemia but the SUA level remains high in the majority of patients during the acute attacks.

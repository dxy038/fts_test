Objective: Our objective was to analyze the statistics on cesarean delivery rates and the factors that have led to a reduction in these rates. Study Design: A retrospective analysis was done of delivery statistics from a 10-year period, January 1, 1989, to December 31, 1998. We investigated the changes made in the methods of delivery during the study period. The data were divided into 1-year periods and analyzed by Ï‡2 tables. Results: The overall cesarean delivery rate decreased from 16.59% to 10.92%; the primary cesarean delivery rate decreased from 9.22% to 7.11% and the repeated cesarean delivery rate from 7.37% to 3.81%. All these decreases were statistically significant. An increase in the rate of active management of labor by increasing oxytocin use and encouraging a trial of labor after previous cesarean delivery was also statistically significant. No changes in the outcome were observed in terms of neonatal morbidity and mortality rates. Conclusion: We found that our working plan for management of labor and delivery yielded and maintained a successful decline in the cesarean delivery rates without any negative effect on neonatal or maternal mortality rates. This low rate was maintained for a 10-year period. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;184:1535-43.)

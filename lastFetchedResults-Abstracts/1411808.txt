The stratum corneum includes keratinocyte cells; this is the first defense layer which stands in the face of pathogenic microorganisms. Identifying the components of stratum corneum can provide plenty of information on its resistance against superficial infections. Stratum corneum contains higher amount of amino acids which most of them can serve as a source of nitrogen for the growth and colonization of dermathophytes. The objective behind this study is to investigate and compare the quantity of amino acids in dogs diagnosed with dermathophytosis and in healthy dogs. 30 dogs suspected lesions of dermatophytosis and 30 healthy dogs were used in this study. Skin scraping samples from 30 dogs with no obvious skin lesions and from 30 dogs suspected lesions of dermatophytosis were taken. Amino acids were analyzed by high- performance liquid chromatography in both groups. Between two groups, significant differences were found for the rate of aspartic acids, serine and asparagine amino acids. Aspartic acid seems to play inhibitory role in growth and colonization of dermathophytes in a way that less of it is found in infected dogs compared with healthy counterparts. It seems asparagine and serine has a stimulatory role in the growth and colonization of dermathophytes. The inhibitory properties of aspartic acids are suggested to be used in the manufacture of more effective antifungal agents especially for chronic type of dermatophytosis.

Objective
Our aim was to study the effect of estradiol and raloxifene on collagen synthesis, by measuring the expression collagen I and III mRNA.
Study design
Nineteen nulliparous young adult rhesus macaques underwent oophorectomy and were treated for 5 months with estradiol alone, raloxifene, or no hormone. Tissue samples were acquired from the lateral vaginal wall, and included the paravaginal attachment and levator ani muscle. Expression of mRNA for collagen I and III was measured by in situ hybridization.
Results
Estradiol increased mRNA for collagen I and III compared with no hormone and raloxifene treatment (ANOVA, P< .05). Collagen mRNA was localized to fibroblasts in the vaginal connective tissue and the connective tissue investments of striated muscle. Collagen mRNA was not expressed in epithelial, smooth, and striated muscle cells.
Conclusion
Estrogen, but not raloxifene, increases collagen gene transcription and indicates stimulation of collagen synthesis in pelvic floor connective tissues.

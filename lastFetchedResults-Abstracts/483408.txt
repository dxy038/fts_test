Background: Bedsore is a serious complication and if not treated properly it can cause permanent problems for patients.
Objective: To determine the affects of topical high pressure oxygen therapy on healing of bedsore in patients hospitalized at different medical centers in Qazvin.
Methods: Through a randomized single blind clinical trial, 100 patients were selected and randomly divided into 2 equal control and experimental groups. The experiments were carried out at ICUs, Neurology wards, and Orthopedic Units of different hospitals. While the control group was only given routine wound care, the members of the experimental group received topical high pressure oxygen (10 L/m) for 20 mins, 3 times a day as well as the routine wound care. Bedsore size was measured pre-treatment and remeasured every 48 post-treatment in both groups. Data were analyzed using indipendent t-test and discriptive statistics.
Findings: The majority of patients were females (51%) with an average age of 70.02Â±13.81 years old. The average size of bedsore in control and experimental groups before treatment was 31.809 cm2 and 28.724 cm2, respectively. The average size of bedsore after treatment was 30.02 cm2 in control group and 13.37 cm2 in experimental group. There was a significant difference between two groups (p<0.05).
Conclusion: Based on the findings of the present study, the topical high pressure oxygen therapy was found to be highly effective in healing of bedsore. Hence, the application of topical high pressure oxygen therapy as an auxiliary method of treatment is recommended.

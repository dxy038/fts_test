The objective of this work is to apply a previously derived mathematical model in order to explain how different factors influence the long bone growth rate, leading to bone growth disorders, including limb asymmetry. The mathematical model was derived in our earlier work by conducting mass balances of the different regions of the growth plate and by using previously reported data. In the current work, the model was used to determine that at least 10 months of additional growth of one of the tibias is required to produce clinically significant leg asymmetry. The model was next used to explain that vitamin C deficiency, IHH overexpression, and a BMP-2 implant have a greater affect on the tibia growth rate and therefore the final tibia length when these perturbations occur earlier in life for extended periods of time. This is extremely important information, especially for the use of BMP-2 implants in certain surgeries, since such implants could have substantial effects on growth and development if used too early in life.

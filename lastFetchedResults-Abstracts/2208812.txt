The objective of the present work was to evaluate the possibilities to obtain quasicrystalline phases in bulk samples of the Al92Fe3Cr2Mn3 (at.%) alloy. Three process of rapid solidification were used to produce: (a) as-quenched ribbon, (b) wedge casting samples and (c) centrifugal force samples. The microstructures of the two bulk samples were compared with the as-quenched ribbon obtained by melt-spinning. The microstructures were evaluated by a combination of transmission and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. In both bulk samples we have observed the presence of quasicrystalline and polycrystalline aggregates with varied morphologies and also intermetallic phases radiating from quasicrystalline grains. In the wedge shape sample quasicrystalline microstructures has been observed for thickness up to 0.8 mm. Calorimetry and X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the quasicrystalline phase is stable up to 450 °C and its transition for crystalline phases is completed above 520 °C.

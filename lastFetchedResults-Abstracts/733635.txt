Objective
Preliminary comparison of cyclists and motorists on: (1) distance lived from campus and, (2) the impact of transportation mode on physical activity.
Methods
A purposive sample of students (n = 50; cyclists = 26, motorists = 24) living < 5 miles from Arizona State University campus wore an accelerometer and completed a travel log for two on-campus days during fall 2005–spring 2006. Residence distance to campus was calculated by geocoded addresses (n = 45; cyclists = 23 vs. motorists = 22). Final outcome variables were: distance lived from campus, accelerometer time moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, steps/day, total time moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (logged minutes cycling + accelerometer-derived moderate-to-vigorous physical activity), and minutes total active commuting (logged walking + cycling).
Results
Groups were significantly different for: distance lived from campus (cyclists = 0.6 ± 0.6 vs. motorists = 2.0 ± 1.1 miles; p < 0.000); steps/day (cyclists = 11,051 ± 4295 vs. motorists = 9174 ± 3319; p = 0.046); total time moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (cyclists = 85.7 ± 37.0 vs. motorists = 50.3 ± 23.8 minutes; p < 0.001); minutes in motorized transport (cyclists = 24.9 ± 27.5 vs. motorists = 61.6 ± 32.9; p < 0.001); and total active transport (cyclists = 59.4 ± 32.4 vs. motorists = 29.5 ± 20.0; p < 0.001).
Conclusion
Among students living within 5 miles of campus, cyclists lived relatively closer to campus, accumulated more minutes of physical activity, and spent more time in active transportation than students who used motorized means.

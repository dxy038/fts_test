Due to evolving technological and societal change, the United State healthcare delivery system is experiencing significant challenges. And Health Information Technology has been identified as a means to assist in adapting with those challenges. Health IT has been shown to be associated with improved care, reduced cost and better patient experience. The objective of this study is to provide a much needed analysis model for evaluating Health IT adoption. Currently there is a lack of specific framework for evaluating Health IT adoption. In this study we draw on Resource Based Theory to identify HIT adoption capabilities; Software Engineering to represent the entities and relationships in the adoption process; and System Dynamics to test spread of Health IT adoption. Our results show that integration of these three methods provides meaningful results, and a previously absent comprehensive framework for analysis of Health IT adoption.

This paper presents a curvelet based approach for image reconstruction. The objective of the method is to obtain a retrieval image containing as much information as possible for face feature extraction. One attempts have been proposed for the image reconstruction using the wavelet transform. Since face images have several objects and curved shapes, it is expected that the curvelet transform would be better in their feature extraction. The simulation results show the superiority of the curvelet transform to the wavelet transform in the visual quality and the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) points of view.

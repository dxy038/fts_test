This case of study applied to the sports context (Gre&#770;mio Arena Soccer in Brazil) has the objective to measure dynamically the time spent during the accommodation of fans in a stadium bleacher. The metric used to evaluate it was the occupation time. In this study it was considered four different occupation scenarios of the bleachers characterizing ways to drive fans to their seats. The selected scenarios were: (1) random entry, (2) entry driven by a dispatchers, (3) numbered seats; (4) numbered seats with dispatcher. Building experiments using the simulation software SIMIO it was observed that the policy based on the dispatcher results in a shorter total occupation time. Additionally, the research analyzed factors that could make difference, such as physical feasibility to support the large number of people, as well as cultural aspects.

As a new type of difficult machining materials, cutting characteristics of the 7A04 A-alloy are still not very definite. Additionally, the fluid Cylinder made of 7A04 A-alloy is easy to have deformation due to the thinner wall thickness during the machining processes, and also there are few experience references on the choice of the cutting parameters. Using the objective function established on the cutting parameters of the rough turn, the cylindrical turning parameters of the aluminum alloy hydraulic cylinder are restrained based on the machine power, machine feeding mechanism, workpiece deflection, tool life, cutter arbor rigidity, surface roughness of workpiece, rotate speed of spindle, amount of feed and so on. Imposing the penalty function method under MATLAB, the optimization of cutting parameters has been realized. Adopting the optimization parameters, the processing effect is good. The efficiency is improved by percent 20.48 compared with the experience.

To vary and improve risk assessment method of port facility security, a new risk assessment approach based on a comprehensive model (DHGF model) is developed, which integrates the Delphi method, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), grey theory and fuzzy evaluation method. A comprehensive evaluation to the target port facility on security is obtained from qualitative analysis to quantitative analysis by the establishment of a complex risk assessment index system on security environment, security management and emergency management. To testify the feasibility and effectiveness of DHGF model, a practical example is given. The result shows that the application of DHGF model in port facility security assessment makes the conclusion more objective and credible.

Background and Objective: Acute bronchiolitis is one of the most common reasons for inflammation, small airways obstruction, and lower respiratory tract infection in infancy. Owing that there has been no study on the efficacy of hypersaline 3% in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis in Iran, the present study was undertaken to deal with this issue.

Materials and Methods: This doubleblinded clinical trial was carried out in Hajar Hospital of Shahrekord in 20132014. 70 patients under 2 years of age with bronchiolitis were assigned to two groups of 35 each. The first group received nebulized Ventolin while the second group was given nebulized hypersaline 3% three times a day. Subsequent to these administrations, recovery duration was compared in both groups.

Results: The mean and standard deviation of recovery duration in the Ventolin group was 4.14plusmn 0.9 days and in the hypersaline 3% group was 3.06plusmn 0.6 days. Ttest and mean recovery duration was significantly lower in the hypersaline 3% group (Plt 0.001).

Conclusion: Nebulizer hypersaline 3% had a better therapeutic effect than Ventolin in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis. Therefore, the use of this drug, rather than Ventolin, is recommended for the treatment of acute bronchiolitis in children under two years of age.

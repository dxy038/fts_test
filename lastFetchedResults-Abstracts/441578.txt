Background. Surgery for pleuropulmonary aspergilloma is reputed to be risky. We reviewed our results, focusing attention on the postoperative complications.
Methods. During a 20-year period, 87 patients were operated on for pulmonary (86) or pleural (3) aspergillomas. Seventy-two percent of patients were complaining of hemoptysis. Eighty-nine resections were performed because there were two bilateral cases. Seventy percent of aspergillomas had developed in cavitation sequelaes from tuberculosis disease. Thirty-four patients had severe respiratory insufficiency that allowed us to perform only lobectomy (18), segmentectomy (2), or cavernostomy (14).
Results. Thirty-seven lobectomies (five with associated segmentectomies), two bilobectomies, 21 segmentectomies, 10 pneumonectomies, and 17 cavernostomies were performed. Total blood loss exceeded 1,500 mL in 14 cases, and 71% of patients required blood transfusion. There were five postoperative deaths (5.7%), related to respiratory failure (2), infectious complication (1), pulmonary embolus (1), and cardiorythmic disorder (1). Incomplete reexpansions were frequently seen in patients undergoing lobectomies or segmentectomies. No death or major complications occurred in asymptomatic patients. During follow-up, none of the patients had recurrent hemoptysis.
Conclusions. Surgical resection of aspergilloma is effective in preventing recurrence of hemoptysis. It has low risk in asymptomatic patients and in the absence of underlying pulmonary disease. Incomplete reexpansion is frequent after lobectomy and segmentectomy, especially when there is underlying lung disease. Cavernostomy is an effective treatment in high-risk patients. Long-term prognosis is mainly dependent on the general condition of patients.

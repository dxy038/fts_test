The aim of this paper is to introduce a computer program developed to provide objective, quantitative data useful to ensure proper implant selection when having to use a tissue expander for soft-tissue reconstructions. The only data to be supplied are the length and the width of the defect to be reconstructed, or the projection and the semicircumference of the involved (or contralateral) breast in case of breast reconstruction. In our opinion, although its use is not aimed at replacing clinical judgment based on experience and careful observation, this program may be considered a simple and useful adjunct for the inexperienced surgeon (or the occasional operator) planning to use a soft-tissue expander.

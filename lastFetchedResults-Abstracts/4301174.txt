In this paper we propose a routing algorithm based on Swarm Intelligence studies. In particular, this algorithm is based on AntNet routing with the extensions of novel metrics for the multi-objective optimization, that are minimum hop count and traffic load balancing. In order to build an optimal solution, the proposed algorithm will make use of ANT agents that consist of probe packets sent on the HAPs network. We have chosen as reference network a HAPs mesh in order to get advantages of the dynamic characteristics of these platforms. In this work we perform a comparison of a classical shortest length path and our algorithm that will try to find the minimum hop path respecting a maximum end-to-end delay bound and an equally distribution of the traffic on the HAPs network.

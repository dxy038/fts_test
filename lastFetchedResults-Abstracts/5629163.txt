Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gases in EarthÂ´s atmosphere, which is affecting air quality and contributing to global climate change. Emission of CO<sub>2</sub> comes from fossil fuel burning, deforestation of the Earth, and human exhale. There has a significant gap for variables between anthropogenic and natural sources and sinks of CO<sub>2</sub>. Satellite observation of CO<sub>2</sub> has been identified that it can provide the precise and accurate data globally, which sensitive to the small regional biases. The global atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> increased from pre-industrial value of about 280 ppm to 379 ppm in 2005. We present measurements from Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography (SCIAMACHY) included on the European environmental satellite ENVISAT, launched on 1st of March 2002. Main objective of this study is to examine the CO<sub>2</sub> distribution over Peninsular Malaysia using SCIAMACHY level-3 data. They are derived from the near-infrared nadir observations of the SCIAMACHY at the University of Bremen through scientific WFM-DOAS retrieval algorithm version 0.4. Maps of time averaged (yearly, tri-monthly) CO<sub>2</sub> was generated and analyzed over Peninsular Malaysia for the year 2003 using PCI Geomatica 10.3 image processing software. The maps show dry-air column averaged mixing ratios of CO<sub>2</sub> (denoted XCO<sub>2</sub>). It was retrieved using the interpolation technique. The concentration changes within boundary layer at all altitude levels are equally sensitive through the SCIAMACHY near-infrared nadir observations. Hence, we can make observation of CO<sub>2</sub> at surface source region. The results successfully identify the area with highest and lowest concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> at Peninsular Malaysia using SCIAMACHY data. Therefore, the study is suitable to examine the distribution of CO<sub>2</sub> at tropical region.

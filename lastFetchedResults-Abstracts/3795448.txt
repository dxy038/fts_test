The paper describes the operating principle, design features and measuring characteristics of wirewound shunts. Fast response and reduced thermal-resistance drift are the main goals to be achieved, although a sturdy structure is also required to meet the demands of an industrial laboratory environment. A low cost, making the shunt competitive to impulse current transformers, is another design objective. Useful in many applications, these shunts are primarily employed for recording neutral current during impulse tests of power transformers.

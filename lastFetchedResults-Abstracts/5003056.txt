Service robots require simple programming techniques allowing users with little or no technical expertise to integrate new tasks in a robotic platform. A promising solution for automatic acquisition of robot behaviours is the programming by demonstration (PbD) paradigm. Its aim is to let robot systems learn new behaviours from a human operator demonstration. This paper describes a PbD system able to deal with assembly operation in a 3D block world. The main objective of the research is to investigate the benefits of a virtual demonstration environment. Overcoming some difficulties of real world demonstrations, a virtual environment can improve the effectiveness of the instruction phase. Moreover, the user can also supervise and validate the learned task by means of a simulation module, thereby reducing errors in the generation process. Some experiments involving the whole set of system components demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the approach.

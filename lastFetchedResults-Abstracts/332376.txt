Objective
The study evaluated the clinical performance and marginal adaptation of direct and semi-direct class II composite restorations in a split-mouth design over 3.5 years.
Design

44 upper posterior teeth in 11 adults with primary carious lesions were treated with 22 direct and 22 semi-direct restorations. Conventional cavities were prepared for both types of restorations. A fine fine hybrid composite (APH) and a multifunctional adhesive system (Prisma universal bond 3) were used for all restorations. The incremental ‘3-sited light curing’ technique was applied to direct restorations. Semi-direct inlays were prefabricated on silicone casts and post-cured using light and heat. Clinical performance was evaluated using modified USPHS parameters, while marginal adaptation was judged on replicas, using SEM and a standardized evaluation technique.
Results

Clinical results after 3.5 years revealed a 100% retention rate with no fractures, sensitivity or recurrent caries for both types of restorations. SEM-evaluation of the occlusal margins showed at the tooth-restoration interface relatively low rates of marginal openings over the observation period (4–8%). Marginal restoration fractures ranged between 1 and 2%, marginal tooth fractures between 3 and 9%. Differences between the restorative techniques and after the different time observation periods were not statistically significant. Proportions of marginal fractures and openings at the restoration-luting composite interface were less than 10% after 3.5 years.
Conclusion

The results indicated no significant differences for direct and semi-direct fine hybrid composite restorations in medium size cavities in posterior teeth with respect to clinical performance and marginal adaptation over 3.5 years.

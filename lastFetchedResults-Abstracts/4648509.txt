Islanding operation of distribution systems having significant penetration of distributed generation (DG) is becoming an important option for economical and technical reasons. Implementation of intentional islanding of DG improves the continuity of supply and reliability of power system. In this paper, comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (CLPSO) is used to optimally partition the distribution system in case of main upstream loss. The objective is to minimize the active and reactive generation cost and the unserved power cost while satisfying system operational constraints. The solution incorporate generations re-dispatch and load shedding. Finally, the effects of intentional islanding with and without utility owned DGs on the system reliability indices is studied. The proposed algorithm shows effectiveness when applied to radial or meshed systems.

A container drayage transportation problem with the objective of decreasing carbon emissions during transportation is researched. Based on a determined-activities-on-vertex (DAOV) graph, a mixed-integer linear programming model of the drayage transportation problem is established. The speed and precision of solving this model using LINGO are tested. This model is also compared with traditional models which minimize the total working time. The effects of the width of time windows, the ratio of inbound containers and the ratio of empty containers are analyzed. The results indicate that this method could decrease carbon emissions significantly and hence has important academic meanings.

Operation and operator technologies used in new generation geometrical product specifications (GPS) provide the necessary knowledge basis for digitization and standardization in verification process of geometrical products. This paper analyzes the operator formation for perpendicularity error evaluation of an axis, and presents mathematical models and the objective optimization functions of every association operation based on the minimum zone solution. A multi-population genetic algorithm based read-coded is then introduced to solve the optimization problem. The basic idea and steps of the algorithm are described in detail. Finally, the measurement process of the perpendicularity error evaluation of an axis based on real-coded multi-population genetic algorithm is realized through an example. The experiment indicates that the proposed method is efficient and feasible. The result of evaluation is accurate and unique.

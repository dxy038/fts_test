Fuelwood moisture content is an important parameter for small and medium-sized heating plants. Optimal storage location and good fuelwood storage maintenance promotes drying efficiency and ensures good fuelwood quality. The effective drying period is limited to spring and summer. It is known that partial debarking of wood will enhance drying and improve fuelwood quality.

m of the study was to test strip debarking as a mean to speed up the drying rate and to lower moisture and bark contents. The prerequisite was that debarking had to be integrated into the processing phase of a single grip harvester. The changes made in the harvester head had to be simple, easily installed and inexpensive.

chanical objective was solved by drilling holes into the delimbing knives and placing bolts through the knives. In this manner the bolt head would strip bark off the stems when fed through the delimbing knives. The qualitative goal was to see if debarking improved drying rate and if harvesting season and species played a role.

ta was collected on non-frozen and frozen pine wood in spring 2005 and in winter 2006, and on non-frozen birch in spring 2007. The debarking results of the non-frozen pine were 3–6% of the total surface area for the normal harvester head and 7–9% for the modified harvester head. The results for frozen pine were correspondingly 1% and 2–2.5%. The debarking results of non-frozen birch were 5–6% and 5–8%. Both studies of pine show that the bolts in delimbing knives doubled the amount of bark removed. There was no significant difference in birch.

limbed Scots pine fuelwood storages reached 30% moisture content on fresh weight basis during the first drying season at landing. This result was obtained independently of the rate of debarking or the harvesting season. Seasoning over the second summer lowered the moisture content of pine fuelwood by another 5% units to 25%. Birch reached 20% during the first season.

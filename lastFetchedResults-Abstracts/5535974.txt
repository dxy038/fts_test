Long-range maneuver transfer consumes the most fuel and time of the rendezvous process, and it is a multi-variable, multi-extremum optimization problem, which is difficult to solve using traditional optimization algorithms. This paper researched the mathematical model of long-range maneuver transfer of spacecraft with impulse thrust, and optimized the parameters of orbit transfer based on a class of novel stochastic optimization algorithms, estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) with minimum fuel-time consumption being the optimization objective, and compared with genetic algorithms (GAs). Simulation results showed that EDAs were effective method for solving long-range maneuver transfer.

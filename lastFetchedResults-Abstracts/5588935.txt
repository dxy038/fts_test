Dynamic facility layout problem (DFLP) has garnered much attention lately. At the current time, researches in this area are mainly on the distance-based objective or quantitative aspect of DFLP. However, focusing on the quantitative objective alone is not adequate to reflect situations in the real world-a little consideration is given to the quality aspect of facility layout such as the adjacency of facilities. This paper proposes two multiple criteria models for solving this type of facility layout problem-MUGHAL proposed by Dutta and Sahu and UrbanÂ´s additive model-by incorporating them into the meta-heuristic framework of ant colony optimization (ACO) for solving a newly proposed problem of dynamic multi-objective facility layout.

Mean age of smoking onset was 15.9±4.5 years. Among the affecting factors on cigarette smoking, smoking by close friends (OR=4.3), alchohol consumption (OR=3.0) and male sex (OR=2.8) showed the highest relationships with cigarette smoking. The rate of cigarette smoking was lower in students who were saying their regular daily prayer (OR=0.52) and those who had higher academic marks (OR=0.68).

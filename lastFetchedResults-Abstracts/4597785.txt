This paper presents the application of an optimized torque controller for a switched reluctance motor (SRM) based on look-up tables. The method is based in the correct adjustment of the converter turn-on and turn-off angles with the purpose of improving the average torque. The final objective is the correct computation of switching angles when the motor is operating in a wide speed range to 42 V for an automotive application. The design of a T.5 kW, 4000 rpm, 8/6 SRM from a CAD-model was established in a previously communication. While the controller and its validation was entirely developed using Matlab-Simulink in conjunction with finite-element software.

Visualizations have been used for teaching and learning but research on their integration in classroom instruction is not that extensive. Recommendations by existing learning taxonomies for instructional strategies to use for given educational objectives are at a macro level. However, with instructorsÂ´ instructional objectives being at a more granular level, it becomes difficult for them to decide which strategy to use for their objective and how to implement it. The goal of this paper is two-fold - a) create and validate a mapping strategy between instructional objectives and instructional strategies with visualization and b) recommend an implementation plan for the chosen strategy. In this paper, we present a set of instructional objectives that instructors have while teaching with visualization in the classroom and mapped them to instructional strategies with visualization. A preliminary validation of this mapping was done through a qualitative survey. We also provide stepwise implementation plan for each strategy.

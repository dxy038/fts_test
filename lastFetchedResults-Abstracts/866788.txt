This paper addresses a shop scheduling problem for the side frame press shop in a truck manufacturing company. In the problem, a set of n jobs to be scheduled on two machines. All the jobs require processing by the first machine more than once in their operation sequences with reentrant work flows. An unusual aspect of the problem is that the setup times required for a job in the first machine depend not on the immediately preceding job but on the job which is two steps prior to it. Redefining the job elements, the problem is formulated into a general two machine flow shop problem which has a set of job-element precedence constraints. The problem is solved with a modified dynamic programming with the objective of the minimum makespan. An optimal schedule is found utilizing the sequence dominance condition and a decision-delay scheme. A numerical example is presented for the illustration purpose.

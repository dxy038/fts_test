Objective(s): The role of aluminum (Al) in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases has been implicated in several studies. However, the exact mechanisms of cytotoxic effects of Al have not been elucidated yet. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of L-type calcium channel antagonist, nimodipine (NM), and lithium chloride (LiCl) on Al-induced toxicity in PC12 cells. Materials and Methods: PC12 cells were treated with Al-maltolate (Almal) in the presence and absence of different concentrations of NM (50-150 Î¼m) and/or LiCl (0.5-1.0 mm) for 48 hr. Cell viability, apoptosis, and catalase (CAT) activity, a marker of oxidative stress, were then measured using MTT, flow cytometry and enzyme assay, respectively. Results: The results showed that Almal, dose dependently induced cell death, apoptosis and CAT activity in the PC12 cells. NM significantly increased cell viability and decreased apoptosis and CAT activity of Almal-treated cells in a dose dependent mode. LiCl reduced CAT activity and increased cell viability in Almal-treated cells, without significant effect on apoptosis (P=0.74). Conclusion: These findings suggest that NM and Li may have benefits in the prevention of Al-induced cytotoxicity through decreasing oxidative stress.

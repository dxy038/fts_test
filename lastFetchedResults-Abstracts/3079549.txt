The localization is a transverse problem to many fields. In medical applications, high accuracy localization of instruments in confined environment is of main importance. The main objective of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of a high accuracy radiofrequency localization for minimally-invasive surgery. A new approach of carrier phase indoor radio localization based on a multiple transmitters/single receiver architecture is proposed. Results from both simulation and real measurements show that, in a multipath propagation environment, a millimeter accuracy can be obtained

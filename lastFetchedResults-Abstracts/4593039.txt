This paper aims at building a responsibility model based on the concepts of accountability, capability and commitment. This modelÂ´s objective is, firstly, to help organizations verify the organization structure and detect policy problems and inconsistencies, and secondly, to provide a conceptual framework to support them in defining their corporate, security and access control policies. Our work provides a preliminary review of the research performed in that field and proposes, based on the observations, an UML responsibility model and a definition for all its components. Thereafter, we suggest and explain a deontological logic formalization of the most significant concepts. To achieve that, our innovation stands in the adaptation of the traditional threefold classification from the alethic logic to an adapted threefold classification that targets ldquoresponsibilityrdquo and based upon which commitment is somewhat refined.

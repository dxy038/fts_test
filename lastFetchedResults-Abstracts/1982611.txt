The objective of this study was to compare the composition of fatty acids stored in the various parts of swordfish. Muscle and organ sections of a series of swordfish samples were collected. Their chemical analysis allowed the classification of swordfish as a semi-fatty fish, with its byproducts totalling 35.6% of the total fatty acids (TFA) and its white and red muscles (MR) 7.2%. The highest contents were found in the liver (26%), the gonads (4.7%) and the red muscle (RM) (4.5%). The UFA/SFA ratio as recommended by nutritionists is 3; in the liver, skin and RM samples this ratio was, respectively, 3.5, 2.8 and 2.7. There is a high level of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) in swordfish. More than 40% of the muscular tissues are made up of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of the n-3 series (EPA + DHA). The byproducts contain more than 30% of monounsaturated acids characterised by the fatty acids of the n-9 series and particularly by oleic acid.

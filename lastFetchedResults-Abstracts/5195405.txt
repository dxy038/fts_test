Nowadays, traffic signal control is becoming an important part of urban traffic control system, and providing an effective traffic signal control system for a large complex traffic network is becoming more and more challenging. In this paper, we propose a new approach to manage the urban traffic system. It is based on new technologies of recognizing vehicles and traffic lights. With this, we can treat each vehiclepsilas movement individually and it allows us to distinguish different kinds of vehicles such as public and emergency vehicles. Then we propose a Branch and Bound approach to control traffic lights in a simple intersection with the objective of minimizing the evacuation time of the intersection, and for a further step, improving the service quality of urban traffic.

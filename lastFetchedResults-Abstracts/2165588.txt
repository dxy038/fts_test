Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) have become a significant cause of infection with the emergence of HIV/AIDS, primarily Mycobacterium avium complex members, and NTM transmitted to humans from the environment (water, fruit, vegetables, beef, and milk). The objectives of this study were to show the presence of mycobacteria in milk and to determine their role as possible sources of human infection. For this, raw milk samples (N = 35) were decontaminated with sodium dodecyl (lauryl) sulfate (SDS)-NaOH and inoculated on to Löwenstein–Jensen medium. After confirming positive 15 slides, isolated from milk by Ziehl–Neelsen technique, they were identified by PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis (PRA). Nine hospital isolates which were identified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex by BACTEC were used at control group. We have detected Mycobacterium terrae, Mycobacterium kansassii, Mycobacterium agri at the end of the identification. Two mycobacterial raw milk isolates were not able to be identified by PRA. PRA patterns' were found to be similar to those which obtained University Faculty of Medical by BACTEC. The results showed that raw milk is to be possible sources for human infection. That is why UHF sterilized milk should be consumed.

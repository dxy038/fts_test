Objective
This study evaluated the influence of Carisolv™ (Medi Team) for resin adhesion to sound human primary and young permanent dentin.
Methods

The buccal surfaces of 28 primary molars and 64 premolars were used. Two adhesive systems and resin composites were used; SE: Clearfil SE® (Kuraray) and Clearfil APX® (Kuraray), and SB: Single Bond® (3M) and Z250® (3M). Six groups were prepared. Groups 1–2 were primary dentin and Groups 3–6 were permanent dentin. Groups 1 and 3: SE was used. Groups 2 and 4: treated with Carisolv™ and then primed, SE was used. Group 5: SB was used. Group 6: treated with Carisolv™ and then etched, SB was used. The microstructural effects of primer or etchant, and Carisolv™ plus primer or etchant applied to dentin were evaluated by SEM. In addition, the microstructure of the resin-dentin interfaces of each group was studied using SEM. Shear bond strengths (SBS) were tested, and the failed surfaces were observed using SEM. Data was statistically analyzed using ANOVA with subsequent application of Fisher's PLSD at p<0.05.
Results

The mean SBS (unit: MPa) of Groups 1–6 were: 27.8, 19.2, 21.3, 21.7, 6.7 and 7.6. The SBS of Group 2 was significantly lower than that of Group 1. There was no significant difference of the SBS among Groups 1 and 4, 2, 3 and 4, and 5 and 6. In SE groups, the hybrid layer for primary dentin was thicker than that for permanent dentin.
Conclusions

Carisolv™ treatment before priming significantly decreased the SBS to primary dentin in SE groups, but did not influence the SBS to permanent dentin in both SE and SB groups.

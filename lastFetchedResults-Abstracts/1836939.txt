Metastatic disease is a well-known complicating factor in the treatment of renal cell cancer. Whereas radical nephrectomy usually is curative in cases of localized disease, no adequate treatment has been established for metastatic renal tumors. Identification of specific chromosome changes or genes responsible for metastatic behavior may lead to new strategies of treatment in the future. In light of this, we cytogenetically analyzed a metastasis of a chromophobe renal cell carcinoma arising in a 73-year-old male and compared the results with genetic data on primary chromophobe renal tumors. The chromosomal pattern of the present case showed, next to the extensive chromosome losses specific for the chromophobe subtype, structural rearrangements involving chromosomes 1, 5, 12, 15, and 18. Determining whether or not (some of) the observed structural changes are important for the metastatic behavior of chromophobe renal cell tumors will have to await further genetic studies on metastases of renal cancer.

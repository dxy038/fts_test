With drastic market competition, the effective management of supply chain has become more and more important. A multi-product, multi-stage supply chain management model based on vendor managed inventory (VMI) was established by the method of multiple-objective programming, which could describe the capability and profit of supply chain members. Then, an application was given for testing the effectiveness and feasibility of the model. Moreover, by comparing with the no implementation of VMI supply chain management model, that the VMI can improve supply chain performance is validated.

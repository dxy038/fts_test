Through the analysis of Rayleigh model, an explanation model on the quality effect of peer reviews is constructed. The review activities are evaluated by the defect removal rate at each phase. We made Hypotheses on how these measurements are related to the product quality. These Hypotheses are verified through regression analysis of actual project data and concrete calculation formulae are obtained as a model. This explanation model can be used to (1) evaluate the effect of peer review, especially the upper steam review quantitatively, (2) make concrete review plan and to set objective values for review activities, (3) evaluate the effect of each peer review activity or method.

Introductions: Surgical Site Infection (SSI) is the most commonly reported nosocomial infection among
hospital surgical inpatients. Determining measurable perioperative factors for SSl may provide
information on reducing complications and improving outcome.
Objective: Assess the predictive risk factors of tissue and wound complications in open colorectal
operation patients.
Materials and Methods: We studied 186 consecutive patients who underwent elective eoloreetal
operation (due to pathologies such as colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease. familial adenomatous
polyposis and so on) in a cohort study between February 2004 and September 2006 in a tertiary hospitaL
The main outcome of surgical site infection included incision or organ/space. Multivariate analysis was
performed to assess the independent association of every factor with SSI. Also odds ratio (OR) with 95%
eonfidence interval were reported.
Results: The mean age of patients was 49.4Â±t6.5 year, and 50.5% were females. The most common
preoperative diagnoses included colorectal cancer (84.9%) and familial adenomatous polyposis (10.7%).
Eighteen (9.7%) of patients suffered SSl. Of measured variables. mechanical preparation with (In
OR~O.053 & p valuc-u.uuz. smoking (OR~c29.422 and p valueen.Gl l ), type of wound (OR~ 12.87 and p
value-eu.Gf ), operation time (OR~3.14 and p valueeu.Ou l) and colostomy (OR~12.42 and p value~OOI9)
independently predicted SSl.
Conclusions: The incidenee of SSI in patients who underwent elective coloreetal operation in present
I
study could conform to results of the previous studies literature. Perioperative mechanical preparation,
smoking, type of wound, operation time and colostomy independently predicted.

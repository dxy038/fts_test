This paper considers a single-channel pseudo-monopulse tracking receiver system which is capable of processing both aerial vehicle antenna tracking and its downlink data signal reception. In order to obtain the single-channel monopulse ratio (MR) curve near to a conventional three-channel MR curve, we mathematically define two objective functions in terms of minimizing mean squared error. By solving these two problems numerically, local optimal design parameters are obtained.

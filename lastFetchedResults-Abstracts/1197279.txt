The objective of this work is to study the effect of non-uniform double slot suction (injection) into steady laminar water boundary layers over a sphere with variable viscosity and Prandtl number. The implicit finite difference scheme with quasi-linearization technique has been applied to find the non-similar solutions and also to overcome the difficulties arising at the starting point of the stream-wise coordinate, at the edges of the slot and at the point of separation. Results indicate that the separation can be delayed by non-uniform double slot suction and also by moving the slots downstream direction but the effect of non-uniform double slot injection is just the opposite.

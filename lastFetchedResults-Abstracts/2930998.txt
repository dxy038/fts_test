The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) has embarked on a comprehensive effort to advance the state-of-the-art in meteor burst (MB) communications. The principal ARPA MB link performance objective is the demonstration of daily-average MB link throughputs in excess of 1 kbps for unconstrained point-to-point communications, versus 100 bps for conventional installations. This order-of-magnitude increased throughput permits the use of advanced digitized voice processors developed by the US Naval Research Laboratory. In addition, ARPA seeks to enhance link performance between an unconstrained base station and a disadvantaged terminal. The core technologies integrated in this effort include adaptive antenna arrays, advanced MB modems, and digitized voice processors. The authors describe the ongoing high-ERP meteor burst link experiment (HEMBLE), present link performance predictions, and suggest several applications for advanced MB communications

Nanoparticles are larger than individual atoms and molecules but are smaller than bulk solids. Hence they obey neither absolute quantum chemistry nor laws of classical physics and have properties that differ markedly from those expected. The important objective of the present study is to produce high purity nano powders using pulse power technique. The advantage of the pulse power generation of nano powders is that the particle size could be controlled by varying the injected power and is a cost effective method of generation of metal nano powders. In the present study, the influence of polarity of the charging voltage, changing voltage magnitude, pressure of the operating medium and the length and size of the exploding wire on the production of the nano particles were analyzed. The mechanism of generation of nano particles using pulsed power technique is explained in detail. The micro structural and thermal properties were analyzed through TEM, AFM, WAXD and TGDTA studies. The relationship between different control parameters on the particle were explained in detail.

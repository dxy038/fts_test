Malnutrition among children is rampant in Pakistani Society specially in the underprivileged groups. A cross-sectional study was undertaken to assess the etiological factors in vulnerable group of children 6 months to 2 years of age. It was found that still majority of women didn't give colostrums to their babies, while more than 50% of mothers didn't start weaning at right age. Moreover majority of the children were fed commercial weaning formulas. All these factors were found to be significant players in causing malnutrition in this age group.Malnutrition is common among all sections of the Pakistan population, but is of greatest consequence in young children. In Pakistan, 48% of all children below jive year age are undernourished1. For majority children, growth faltering starts at four to six months. The National Family Health Survey data also highlights the critical period of six months to two years. Data available from various states shows a similar picture1. The percentage of malnutrition continues to rise between six months to two years and thereafter plateaus. Around 40 to 50 per cent of children are malnourished by the age of two year3.What is the solution? How can malnutrition be prevented in this vulnerable child population? Supplementary feeding programs are not the only answer as their services are utilized by children three years and above. Lack of economic resources is not a major constraint in all families. The present pilot study was undertaken with the objective to assess the etiological factors playing a role in causation of protein energy malnutrition (PEM) in children (6-<12 months) in two urban slum communities in Peshawar.

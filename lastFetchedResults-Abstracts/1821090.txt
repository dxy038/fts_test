Objective
istence of stem/progenitor cells in dental tissue has been suggested but their characterization in the human tooth germ remains elusive. The purpose of this study was to investigate these cells in human dental follicles and dental papillae at the crown-forming stage and compare their potential for hard tissue formation.

d dental follicle cells (DFCs) and dental papilla cells (DPCs) derived from dental follicles and dental papillae at the crown-forming stage and compared their proliferative capacity, cell surface antigens and ability to form hard tissue in vitro and in vivo.
s
FCs and DPCs had extensive proliferation ability, expressed similar cell surface antigens and were capable of forming hard tissue in vivo as well as in vitro. However, there were two differences between DFCs and DPCs. First, DPCs had a significantly higher calcium accumulation than that in DFCs. Second, DFCs expressed a cementoblast marker, whereas DPCs expressed an odontoblast marker.
sions
pose that dental follicles and dental papillae at the crown-forming stage contain different types of stem/progenitor cells and may have hard tissue-forming ability in a possibly origin-specific lineage direction.

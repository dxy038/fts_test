Chronic smoking increases number of pulmonary emphysema patient. It is difficult to cure pulmonary emphysema, because alveoli are destroyed. Early discovery is desired to stop the progress of the disease. Diagnosis imaging by CT images gives early detection. But diagnostician mares a diagnosis basis of their experience, and it is subjective. I compare expiratory and inspiratory state of CT images of lung to give objective criterion to discriminate degree of severity of pulmonary emphysema.

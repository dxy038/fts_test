This paper deals with the problem of the coupling due to the electromagnetic interactions between array antennas and the structure of an aircraft. The objective is to propose a methodology to insure good performances of direction finding by limiting as much as possible the effects of coupling. The context is Electronic Support Measures (ESM), and we consider a large interferometer array in order to obtain a high precision goniometry of emitters on the ground. The goal of the methodology is to define the geometry of the interferometer - the position of the antennas - that limits as much as possible the effects of electromagnetic coupling.

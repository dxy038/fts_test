Cost and safety are two key elements when designing a good construction site layout planning (CSLP). Previous research works always considered CSLP from the aspect of reducing cost and treated SCLP as a single objective optimization problem. In the paper, CSLP was designed by a multi-objective optimization (MOO) model using modified Pareto-based ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, which could find a Pareto solution (trade-off layout) to fulfill the requirement of reducing cost and improve the site safety level simultaneously. Furthermore, in order to apply MOO model to solve unequal-area problem, the random grids-recognition strategy was employed in the proposed MOO model to solve the unequal-area site layout problems without increasing the computational complexities. A case study of a residential building project is used to validate the proposed MOO model and the results are very positive.

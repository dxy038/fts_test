This paper theoretically investigates data distortion caused by resolution conversion in DCT (discrete cosine transform) based layered coding system. The system is attractive because it can not only compress large amounts of video data but also convert the scale of reconstructed pictures. However only a few attempts have so far been made at the degree of aliasing error. In this paper we treat the DCT system as a filter bank so that we can evaluate the system in the frequency domain. As a result of our study the system is theoretically evaluated from the multirate stand point and the DCT system is compared with other layered coding systems, e.g. subband coding and Gaussian/Laplacian pyramid, by means of one objective measure

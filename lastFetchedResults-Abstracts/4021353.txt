Simple and robust engineering rules for dimensioning bandwidth for elastic data traffic are derived for a single bottleneck link via normal approximations for a closed-queueing network (CQN) model in heavy traffic. Elastic data applications adapt to available bandwidth via a feedback control such as the transmission control protocol (TCP) or the available bit rate transfer capability in asynchronous transfer mode. The dimensioning rules satisfy a performance objective based on the mean or tail probability of the per-flow bandwidth. For the mean objective, we obtain a simple expression for the effective bandwidth of an elastic source. We provide a new derivation of the normal approximation in CQNs using more accurate asymptotic expansions and give an explicit estimate of the error in the normal approximation. A CQN model was chosen to obtain the desirable property that the results depend on the distribution of the file sizes only via the mean, and not the heavy-tail characteristics. We view the exogenous &#8220;load&#8221; in terms of the file sizes and consider the resulting flow of packets as dependent on the presence of other flows and the closed-loop controls. We compare the model with simulations, examine the accuracy of the asymptotic approximations, quantify the increase in bandwidth needed to satisfy the tail-probability performance objective as compared with the mean objective, and show regimes where statistical gain can and cannot be realized

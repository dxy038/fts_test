We present a downlink opportunistic scheduling algorithm when there are user equipments (UEs) served by multiple mobile terminals (MTs) in a time- slotted cellular system. We study two scenarios, namely Scenario (i) when the scheduler knows the presence of such UEs; and Scenario (ii) when the scheduler has no knowledge of the presence of such UEs. We establish the optimality and present the main properties of our scheduling scheme. Simulations under High-Speed Down-link Packet Access (HSDPA) model are implemented which show that our algorithm works well and provides an approximately 20% performance improvement for the UEs served by multiple MTs as compared to previous opportunistic scheduling schemes. Furthermore, our algorithm is able to provide better overall performance even in the worst case. The objective behind this research work is to establish the performance of cellular systems that provides differentiated quality of service (QoS).

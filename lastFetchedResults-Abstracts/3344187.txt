DC-DC conversion is the chief stem of Power Electronics and is progressing rapidly. Many new topologies are still created every year. The Zeta converter is another converter topology to provide a regulated output voltage from an input voltage that varies above and below the output voltage. The benefits of the Zeta converter over the SEPIC converter include lower output-voltage ripple and easier compensation. The non-pulsating output current of the Zeta converter allows for the use of small output capacitors for satisfying the load voltage ripple requirement. The objective of this paper is to design and implement the CCM mode operation of non-isolated Zeta converter. The design formulas for the continuous conduction mode (CCM) are given. This paper deals with design and steady state analysis of closed loop non-isolated Zeta converter using PID control technique. The simulations have been performed by using MATLAB/Simulink. Through simulation it is confirmed that a PID compensation method improves the output response of the system.

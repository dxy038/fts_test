Power balance control techniques applied to parallel AC to DC converters for single-phase SEPIC rectifier modules is presented. The analysis and simulation results of such system with nearly unity power factor using single voltage loop control and inductor current calculator for input current wave shaping and output voltage regulation have been shown. Each converter operates in continuous conduction mode and hysteresis current control with lockout switching-frequency at 100 kHz. The objective is to keep output voltage constant and current sharing in each converter equally, while keeping the power factor very close to unity. Analysis and simulation results indicate that such scheme is effective and parallel AC to DC converter has a high power density and fast transient response. The circuit is designed to operate at DC output voltage 48 V, output power 1,500 W.

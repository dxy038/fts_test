This paper describes our experience with requirements-based validation test generation of Electronic Flight Instrumentation System (EFIS) software for small commercial jets. In 1992, Honeywell Technology Center (HTC) began a long-term project to develop a fine-grained EFIS requirements domain model using object-oriented techniques. Our long-range objectives were to automate the generation of software life-cycle artifacts such as system requirements documentation, test matrix, test software, and graphical prototypes based on the EFIS requirements model and demonstrate their reusability across various products. In 1993, to help justify the continuation of the work, we established a short-term objective of automatically generating requirements-based tests used in the V&amp;V of the aircraft display software. We developed rule-based requirements models that described both the static and dynamic characteristics of the aircraft display system. The test generator algorithms used these rule-based requirements models along with information about the testing apparatus and policy-rich testing methodology to automatically generate test plans, automated test equipment (ATE) code, and expected test results. This paper focuses on our process of automating V&amp;V test artifacts, the challenges we faced, the algorithms we developed, and the benefits we realized. WeÂ´ll also briefly discuss our ongoing efforts in automating additional display software life-cycle artifacts

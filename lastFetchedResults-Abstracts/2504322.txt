Background: There is increasing evidence that psychological factors like anxiety and
depression can affect IVF/ICSI treatment results.
Objective: This study aimed to clarify the role of women’s anxiety and depression on
the outcome of ART cycles using Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI).
Materials and Methods: This was a prospective pilot study. One hundred six (106)
consecutive women undergoing ICSI cycles were enrolled between January 2006 and
2007. Age, duration and cause of infertility, number and score of transferred embryos
were recorded for each patient. Data regarding the state of anxiety and depression of
each volunteer were collected using the translated and validated Iranian Cattle Anxiety
and Beck Depression Inventories.
Results: Among 106 women enrolled in the study, 25 cases (23.5%) of clinical
pregnancies occurred. In univariate analysis, there was no significant difference
regarding age and cause and duration of infertility between groups. Number of
transferred embryos was significantly associated with higher pregnancy rates (3.4± 1.15
vs. 2.5±1.38 in pregnant and nonpregnant group respectively). Among the 106
participants, 73.58% had anxiety and 30.18% showed various degrees of depression.
Out of 28 patients with no anxiety, 21(75%) and out of 74 patients with no depression,
24(32%) became pregnant. There was significant association between
depression/anxiety and pregnancy rate (p=0.034 and p=0.00 respectively). Logistic
regression model showed that anxiety/depression affect the outcome of ART
significantly.
Conclusion: It is crucial to identify infertile patients at greater demand for
psychological support before starting ART cycles.

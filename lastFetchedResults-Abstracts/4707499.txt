This paper describes designing and testing systems for inspection of web materials using a development environment simulated in software. This environment comprises five sub-systems: sensing, detection, characterization, validation and decision making. Given a specific inspection problem the system is customized by incorporating specific algorithms into each of the sub-systems. In order to illustrate the customization, the paper uses an example of inspection of a nonwoven material. The inspection objective is to quantify the randomness and homogeneity across the material. This task requires using statistical modeling to characterize texture. The paper discusses a theoretical approach based on a Poissonian model, its efficient implementation, and steps required to implement this procedure online

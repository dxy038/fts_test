A research project was carried out from 2004 to 2006 to survey the dieback causes of Arizona
Cupressus trees, in Gadir park, located nine kilometers south of Qom. In this project some quantitative
and qualitative properties of the trees were surveyed. The collected data and different information of sail,
water and plant were divided into four groups, according to different rate of trees dryness and were
analyzed as random complete block by four replication. Results showed that based on ANDVA table,
there is a significant difference in trees freshness, Cl, B, Cu and Zn amount (I%) and P, K and Fe (5%)
between four groups of trees. The results of leaf analysis showed that CI, B and Zn were highest in the
trees with less seore of survival. Therefore, unsuitable soil and salinity of water were detected the most
important causes of Cupressus's dryness in this research. The salinity of water and soil in addition to the
aggregation of substances and their absorption with the trees had caused nutritional and physiologic
disorders and consequently, the weakness and dryness of trees. The analysis of tree's leaves showed that a
large amount of Na and CI were absorbed by the plants which had caused a toxicity of these elements.
There was also a high density of Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu which shows nutritional imbalanee due to the
salinity. Due to the fact of weakening and intensifying of unfavorable conditions. secondary factors like
fungus Nattrossia mongiferae affect the plant and have made faster the process or dryness.

Several well-tested gating circuits for physical scale counts for fast reversal of bidirectional counters are described&#194;&#191;all derived from the triple or more basic readout signals required to make such counting possible. Reversal errors are noted, and ways to reduce them. These arrangements are speed-limited. Direct-current-gating voltage producers are described for fast counters, together with problems arising from them. Note is made of inter-decade coupling in such circuits.

Introduction: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent worldwide. Low 25 hydroxyvitamin D3 concentration is inversely associated with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and probably cardiovascular disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate of association between vitamin D deficiency and cardiovascular risk factors among diabetic patients. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study, which investigated 119 type 2 diabetes patients, was conducted in Mashhad between December 2007 and March 2008. Coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular diseases in the subjects were confirmed, and blood biochemical parameters, including laboratory risk markers of cardiovascular disease were determined. Serum 25 (OH) D was measured during winter to determine the correlation between vitamin D deficiency and cardiovascular prevalent and the laboratory variables. Results: Mean patient age was 55.3±11.2 years. Mean 25 (OH) D concentration was 32.4±21.6 ng/ml. Prevalence of vitamin D level / deficiency D was 26.1% among diabetic patients, difference with control group not being significant (P=0.12). Overall, 36 (30.3%) patients were positive for coronary vascular disease (CVD). The correlation between hypovitaminosis D and CVD was not significant (p=0.11). Patients with vitamin D deficiency had significant differences in body mass index (P=0.003), metabolic syndrome (P=0.05), high sensitive CRP (P=0.009), microalbuminuria (P=0.04), and glumerolar filtration rate (P=0.02) compared with patients with sufficient vitamin D; FBS, HbAic, lipid profiles, homocysteine, uric acid and insulin resistance were not related to vitamin D deficiency. Conclusion: Results showed an association between hypovitaminous D and coronary risk markers indicating the importance of this vitamin in cardiovascular health.

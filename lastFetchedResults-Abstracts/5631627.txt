The objective of the paper is to present a description of the various control functions necessary for the operation of advanced automated transit systems. These control functions are hierarchical in nature and range from scheduling and routing to control of velocity and spacing between individual vehicles. Proposed solutions to the various control problems which arise in advanced automated transit systems are discussed.

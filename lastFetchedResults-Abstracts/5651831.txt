In last two decades there has been tremendous efforts for research of digital wireless communication system. The coming generation of wireless communication system is demanding for better quality of service with high spectral efficiency and data rate. To meet the demand of high data rate transmission with good quality a novel system is available i.e. multi-carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA). It is a fusion of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technique. The objective of this paper is to provide a comparative study on performance enhancement of Multicarrier CDMA system. This comparison illustrates, how can performance of MC-CDMA system parameters such as BER, Capacity, MAI reduction, PAPR, System complexity etc. can be improved with various algorithms and techniques. This paper will be very informative for the interested researcher to continue their research in the field of CDMA wireless communication.

Results: A total of 26 documents met the criteria. 13 of them were RCTs, 3 were case-control trials and 10 case series trials. The mean percent scores of these RCTs, case-control trials and case series trials were 35.3, 23.5 and 33.75 respectively. Conclusion: For the reports of acupuncture for tension-type headache, the overall quality RCTs, case-control trials and case series trials were low.

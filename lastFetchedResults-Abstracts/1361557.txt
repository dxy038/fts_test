Objective(s): Recently, applications of MnO2 nanoparticles and microparticles in industry,
pharmacology, and medicine have considerably expanded. Mn distribution and clearance from
brain and spinal cord tissue compared with muscle tissue of rats after single subcutaneous
injection of nanoparticles and microparticle of MnO2. Pain sensory threshold of rat was evaluated
as neurologic consequence of the particles on CNS activity of rats.
Materials and Methods: Rats divided to control and two experimental groups. Each experimental
group received a single subcutaneous injection of MnO2 nano- and microparticles, respectively.
Acute pain thresholds of rats were evaluated by tail immersion method and its weight gain was
recorded during these weeks. Samples taken from brain, spinal cord and muscle tissues of rats,
once every 2 week for 8 weeks. The tissue Mn level was measured by inductively coupled
plasma-mass spectrometry method.
Results: Both particles size passed from blood barriers. Unlike brain tissue, manganese
completely cleared from spinal tissue after 8 weeks in both groups. Clearance of Mn from muscle
tissue is not complete in both of the groups. Weight gain of rats in both groups was slower than
control rats. In microparticle group, rats showed progressive analgesia (p < 0.05). In nanoparticle
groups, rats showed hyperalgesia for first 4 weeks and analgesia during remaining weeks.
Conclusion: Change in MnO2 particles size affect on Mn distribution and clearance from central
nervous system. Effect of particles on whole body metabolism varied with its size too. Finally,
comparison of pain response of rats among particle treated groups indicates that neurobiological
mechanism affected by particles is varied with their size during times after administration

A propagation experiment is being carried out in Madrid, with the objective of gaining insight on the slant-path propagation channel in the Ka-band. The received level of the Eutelsat HB-6 satellite beacon at 19.7 GHz is measured with an experimental receiver. The main results presented in this paper correspond to individual events of attenuation and scintillation, as well as a preliminary statistical analysis of the first complete year of data.

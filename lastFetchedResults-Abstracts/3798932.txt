The improved National Airspace System (NAS), when implemented, will make automation available in air traffic control services from takeoff to landing wherever such automation is warranted. This aim is to be achieved in stages and this paper will concern itself primarily with the first stage implementation, called NAS En Route Stage A. This first stage is designed to provide a significant amount of automation for the Air Route Traffic Control Centers, with an objective of assisting the air traffic controller in his job and providing an increased level of efficiency and safety in the Air Traffic Control System. The modular nature of the Central Computer Complex which is to be implemented and the design principles used in specifying its characteristics are discussed in addition to the computer programing being developed to perform the required tasks.

The objective of embolization is to selectively block or reduce blood flow through abnormal vascular structures. It is desirable to quantitate blood flow, and the authors are investigating appearance time and first pass distribution analysis (FPA) algorithms applied to angiographic image sequences. The emphasis is on developing a practical method for relative flow measurement that can be provided during a procedure. Preliminary results include color-coded images of arrival times that give a very useful visualization

Handover is the most important part in mobile communication because it transfers ongoing calls or data from one point to another point when the user equipment (UE) moves. In order to reduce handover failures the deployment femtocell in Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks has been done. LTE is the new standard recently specified by the Third Generation Partnership Program (3GPP) on the way towards fourth-generation mobile. LTE is a new technology that becomes an important part of everyday life and for the future which is consists of heterogeneous networks. Femtocell or HeNB can help to fulfill the upcoming demand of high data rate in a wireless communication system and can extend the coverage area. The main objective of the study is to analyze the performance of intra and inter handover in probabilities of false initiation handover, probabilities of handover failures when the cell is overlapping.

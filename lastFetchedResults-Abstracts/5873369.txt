This paper proposes Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication to share the resources in fast manner with the help of large area communication between the nodes in the network. The big size and good stability properties of P2P files in network give rise to the use of highly effective capacity planning and topology matching techniques as a promising solution to manage P2P communications in shared area network. In this paper, we are using a novel topology matching algorithm based on Probability and Statistics in Metropolis-Hastings method. In our Peer-to-Peer communication accuracy of detecting the overlay topology of a large scale peer to peer network will be challenging and we can share the resources between two different peers without any failure and fast manner transactions. The objective of this work is to design a fast data sharing between the peers communication and minimize the transaction time. In future P2P-communication optical access networks with the nanodevices, which must be designed to meet the requirements of Peer-to-peer communication in a resource-efficient manner.

This research was a pilot study for urban feature interpretation and change analysis using multisource data. Data are used Landsat TM, IRS-1C, and Russian 2m high resolution photographic image (DD-5). The objective of this research is to analyze change in land cover from agricultural land to a construction site or residential development using multisource information fusion. Firstly, this study is to fuse the spectral information from Landsat TM combine it with the spatial information from DD-5 and IRS-1C. This data combination is essential for the change detection and analysis. Secondly, this study is to compare the development of the town, which is based on natural and artificial features before the new town construction. The agricultural and forest area were destroyed and urbanized by 5 new town constructions of The Seoul metropolitan region. The authorsÂ´ conclusions are that multisource imagery with moderate spatial resolution has potential to improve the performance of detailed information to policy maker for regional planning and decision making

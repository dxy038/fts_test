Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of telomerase activity in complete hydatidiform moles with subsequent development of persistent gestational trophoblastic tumor. Study Design: By means of the standard telomerase repeat assay, we examined telomerase activity in 4 normal placentas, 31 complete hydatidiform moles (16 cases of uneventful regression, according to serum levels of Î²-human chorionic gonadotropin, after evacuation and 15 cases in which persistent gestational trophoblastic disease developed after evacuation), 7 invasive moles, and 5 choriocarcinoma tissue samples. Results: Telomerase activity was detected in 13 of 15 (86.7%) complete hydatidiform moles in patients who eventually underwent chemotherapy for the treatment of persistent gestational trophoblastic tumors. All 9 patients with metastatic disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III) had telomerase activity in the initial molar tissue sample. In contrast, telomerase activity was evident in only 3 of 16 (12.5%) complete hydatidiform moles from patients with spontaneous remission after evacuation (P< .05). Telomerase activity was detected in all 7 invasive moles and all 5 choriocarcinoma tissue samples but was not detected in normal placentas. Conclusion: The presence of telomerase activity in complete hydatidiform moles is associated with the development of persistent gestational trophoblastic tumors, such as invasive moles and choriocarcinoma.

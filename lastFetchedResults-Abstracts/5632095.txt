Many researchers have been encouraged to investigate the design, posture and stability of biped robots in order to replicate the anthropoid gait. This paper addresses the design and development of a bipedal robot. It presents a combination of the design considerations and simplicity of design to provide a test bed for autonomous biped robots. Kinematic models of the biped robot are also developed and simulated prior to experimentally verifying the performance of the system. Overall, a low cost, open system biped robot is the underlying objective on which new gait algorithms and controllers will be developed to further the research in the field of humanoid robots.

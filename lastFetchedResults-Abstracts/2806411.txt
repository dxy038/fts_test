In enterprise microgrid such as steel plants, the self-generating output is not equal to the electricity load because of the electricity load uncertainty and the self-generation power plantÂ´s limits. In order to decrease the unbalance punishment cost caused by the non-equality, electricity self-balancing multi-levels model in which load uncertainty is described by a certain interval and the objective is to minimize the unbalance punishment cost and load shifting cost at the worst case is built based on the robust optimization in this paper. The multi-levels model is equivalently transformed to single level model using a set of constraints instead of the lower problem to improve the efficiency of solution. Finally, the paper tests an enterprise microgrid and the results show that proposed approach can decrease the total cost and the unbalance obviously.

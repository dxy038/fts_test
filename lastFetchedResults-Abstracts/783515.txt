Background Adversities in the early
mother-infant relation pose a hypothetical risk for
addiction. We studied the association between very
early separation and later development of substance
use disorder. Method A follow-up study was performed
of subjects temporarily isolated from their
family immediately after birth to adequate nursing
homes in order to protect them against morbidity
and mortality for tuberculosis. The average separation
time was 7 months. The index cohort consisted
of 3,020 subjects born in 1945–1965. For every index
subject, two reference subjects were matched
for sex, year of birth and place of birth. We were
able to obtain the SES of the family of origin as
recorded in 1971 from Statistics Finland. Finnish
Hospital Discharge Register was used to identify
subjects with substance use disorder arising from
childhood to middle age, between January 1,1971
and December 31, 1998. Results The 28-year
cumulative incidence of alcohol use disorders was
4.2% in the index cohort and 3.1% in the reference
cohort (rate ratio, RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1–1.8). The
incidences of hospital-treated drug abuse or
dependence were 0.6% and 0.2% (RR 2.5, 95% CI
1.2–5.1), respectively. The differences in socioeconomic
status of the family of origin did not explain
the differences found. Conclusions Substance use
disorders were more prevalent among subjects
temporarily separated at birth from their mothers
because of tuberculosis in the family than in the
reference cohort. While risks experienced during
pregnancy, delivery and childhood are alternative
explanations, this result suggests that very early
temporal separation from the mother at birth may
have had unfavourable but modest effects on later
psychological development, including vulnerability
to addiction.

Background: Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The use of some antioxidant compounds in dietary food stuff such as vitamin E and Oak fruit (Quercus) husks hydroalcoholic extract (OHE) may inhibit the production of oxidized LDL and decrease both the development and the progression of atherosclerosis.
Objective: The present work investigated the effects of OHE on LDL oxidation induced-CuSO4 quantitatively in vitro.
Methods: This study was an experimental research performed in Khoramabad province during 2010.  Fasting blood samples were collected from normal people followed by LDL isolation. The population study was divided into five groups (1: control; 2: those exposed to CuSO4 without treatment, and groups 3-5: those exposed to CuSO4 and treated with OHE (0.2, 2, and 20 µg/ml, respectively). Later, the formation of conjugated dienes, lag time, and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured. Inhibition of Cu-induced oxidation was investigated in the presence of several concentrations of OHE (0.2, 2 and 20 µg/ml). Data were statistically analyzed by SPSS 13 using Mann Whitney test. 
Findings: OHE was found to have the ability to inhibit the CuSO4-induced LDL oxidation. Administration of oak (Quercus) husks hydroalcoholic extract (OHE) showed an increased rate of 2.2, 3, and 4.3 fold s at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 20µg/ml against oxidation in vitro.  Also conjugated dienes decreased 13.33%, 46.66% and 80.00% at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 20 µg/ml of OHE, respectively. The inhibitory effects of OHE on LDL oxidation at concentrations used were dose-dependent.
Conclusion: This study showed that the OHE has the potential to prevent the oxidation of LDL in vitro and it may suggest that this compound is capable of producing a similar effect in vivo.

This paper deals with a distributed control for load frequency of power networks based on iterative gradient methods. The control objective is to minimize the quadratic cost function of load frequency control problem, and we apply this distributed control methodology to complicated large scale electrical power networks by using iterative gradient methods. Finally, simulation results of distributed large scale power network systems including distributed generations, batteries, and renewable energies in order to show the effectiveness of the load frequency control compared with decentralized control and centralized control.

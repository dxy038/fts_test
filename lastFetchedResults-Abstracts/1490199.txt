Environmental toxicity is judged to be in a “dark ages” period due to longstanding limitations in the implementation of the simple conceptual model that is the basis of current aquatic toxicity testing protocols. Fortunately, the environmental regulatory revolution of the last half-century is not substantially compromised as development of past regulatory guidance was designed to deal with limited amounts of relatively poor quality toxicity data. However, as regulatory objectives have substantially increased in breadth and depth, aquatic toxicity data derived with old testing methods are no longer adequate. In the near-term explicit model description and routine assumption validation should be mandatory. Updated testing methods could provide some improvements in toxicological data quality. A thorough reevaluation of toxicity testing objectives and methods resulting in substantially revised standard testing methods, plus a comprehensive scheme for classification of modes/mechanisms of toxic action, should be the long-term objective.

The paper surveys several unconventional concepts of nuclear power and propulsion systems which have been proposed during recent years. The unconventional aspects of these concepts reside partly in their indicated performance capability and partly in the scanty discussion they received thus far by other workers in the field. It is the objective of this survey to bring these proposals to renewed attention and discussion among those concerned with progress in space power and propulsion systems. Beside the magneto hydro dynamics (MHD) accelerators, also included are electro gas dynamics (EGD) and fusion propulsion concepts whose indicated performance characteristics warrant a closer scrutiny because of their potential attractiveness for the future aerospace transportation systems.

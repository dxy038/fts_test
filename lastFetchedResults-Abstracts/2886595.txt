The vast majority of today´s internet video services are consumed over-the-top (OTT) via reliable streaming (HTTP via TCP), where the primary noticeable delivery-related impairments are startup delay and stalling. In this paper we introduce an objective model called the delivery quality score (DQS) model, to predict user´s QoE in the presence of such impairments. We describe a large subjective study that we carried out to tune and validate this model. Our experiments demonstrate that the DQS model correlates highly with the subjective data and that it outperforms other emerging models.

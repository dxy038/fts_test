Red band reflectance factor data from NASAÂ´s Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) were used to create maps of woody plant canopy cover, fractional height, and aboveground biomass for the southwestern United States, via inversion of a geometric-optical (GO) model provided with reflectance magnitude and anisotropy via a Li-Ross bidirectional reflectance distribution model. Crown cover, canopy height, and biomass distributions are compatible with those seen in other data sets, although there are anomalies associated with the use of the same set of background prediction coefficients over the 10-year period.

In this paper experimental results of a wind energy conversion system obtained in real time are presented. The modelling of the different parts of the studied system is described. Simulation results achieved in different conditions are compared to those obtained experimentally. The work presented constitutes a part of a bigger project entitled MACsyME (Modelling, Analysis and Control for Systems with Multiple Energy Sources) The main objective is to a implement a real strategy of total management of multi-energy sources.

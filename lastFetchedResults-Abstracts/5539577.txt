It is significantly necessary to make a in-depth research on the mechanical performance of Ginkgo under Compression Loading for improving the design and manufacture of ginkgo processing machinery. In this paper, we, firstly, use LDS-W10A microcomputer controlled electronic materials testing machine to do the compression tests on the ginkgo in Southwest of China. Secondly, we carry out the multi-objective duplicate orthogonal test, taking ginkgo broken force, crushing energy consumption and the broken rate of almonds as target parameters, and the parts of putting press, loading rate and moisture content rate as factors respectively. At the same time, we obtain optimum Technology Parameters Constitution of Ginkgo-nut Shelling through the comprehensive evaluation of the Membership-Degree and Least Significant Range (LSR). The results show that when ginkgos are compressed with different moisture content rate along three different directions, there is apparent elastic deformation, but no obvious biological yield point. Tthe direction of ginkgo pressure, pressure rate, moisture content rate is significantly correlated with synthesis rate index (p&lt;;0.05). For the best quality of Ginkgo-shelling, the reasonable technology parameters constitution is as follow: Y direction compression loading, extrusion rate between 10 and 55mm/min, and moisture content rate of 23.72% (w.b.). Besides, the results provide a theoretical basis for improving the processing technology of ginkgo.

This paper presents the study on the cost analysis for the Video-on-Demand (VoD) system exploiting the advantages of the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture. Our objective is to tackle the problems in analyzing cost and to come up with efficient cost analysis model (CCAM) thereby enhancing the revenue to the system. We adopt a partially decentralized P2P architecture with a cluster based approach to find the probability of the requests for the videos in that cluster and to place the videos closer to the customers. The results of the simulation experiment demonstrates that most of the video requests are delivered to the customers almost immediately with a faster response-time. The results also indicate that our approach accomplishes maximum revenue with less rejection ratio and a moderate peer-load when compared to the conventional approach which uses random arrival pattern contributing a substantial revenue to the VoD system.

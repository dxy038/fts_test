Cassava starch films were produced by casting with the objective to investigate the effect of glycerol and amylose enrichment on its properties. The effects of different amylose quantities (6.3, 15.6 and 25.0 g/100 g of starch) and glycerol contents (20.0, 32.5 and 45.0 g/100 g of starch) on filmogenic solution were evaluated in barrier and mechanical properties of films. Enrichment of amylose in films formulation produced starches in filmogenic solutions with amylose contents ranging between 25.5% and 36.6%. Mechanical and barrier properties of cassava starch films were influenced by glycerol and amylose contents (Tukey test, p ⩽ 0.05). The enrichment of filmogenic solutions with amylose solution originates stronger and more permeable films. Glycerol behaved as a typical plasticizer in starch films; with increasing glycerol concentration, water vapor permeability, strain at break and puncture deformation increased, and stress at break, Young’s modulus and puncture strength decreased.

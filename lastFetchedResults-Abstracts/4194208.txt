In the decision-making support system of electrical power planning, the planning is not only an optimal program, but also a multi-objective, multi-factor, uncertain and complicated decision-making problem. In order to realize the simulating decision-making, the multi-attribute fuzzy optimal selection (MADOS) are presented to be used to make decision for mixed multi-attribute in system planning in this paper for the first time. The MADOS is unified for quantitative objectives and qualitative criteria. The quantitative objectives of schemes can be calculated to form an eigenvalue matrix with the optimal programming. The qualitative criteria can be evaluated fuzzily to form an evaluation matrix through the expert system based on the planning knowledge. The relative membership matrix of different attributes can be calculated by the unified and relative subordinate degree. The weight of multi-attributes can be confirmed through comparison matrix. The distances to optimal and to inferior extremes and maximum relative subordinate satisfied degree of the schemes, which is gained by further calculation, are used to make decision. The practical example shows that quantitative and qualitative methods are combined and the whole performance of planning is taken into account. It is practical and efficient to use the simulating making-decision in the support system for electrical power planning.

The results of fire detector testing carried out in the Bell-Northern Research´s Environmental Test Facility in Ottawa, and the results of fire extinguishment testing carried out in the Factory Mutual Research´s Fire Test Center in Rhode Island, are discussed. The objective of the fire detection tests was to evaluate the performance of several types of fire detection system under the variety of air flow conditions found in the ambient environment of central offices housing electronic switching systems. The fire extinguishment tests confirmed various design parameters related to the fire sprinkler protection of digital telecommunications equipment in support of Bell Canada´s proposed program to equip key central offices with automatic fire sprinkler systems. From the extinguishment point of view, fire sprinklers have been shown to be an effective way of preventing the spread of flame beyond the frame of fire origin

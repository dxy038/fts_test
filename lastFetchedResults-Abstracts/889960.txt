Aim: The purpose of this study was testing the structural relationships between objective stress, academic stress, coping styles, reactions to stressors and academic satisfaction. Methods: In the correlational study, 300 students (150 male and 150 female) completed the Objective Stress Variables (Kariv & Heiman, 2005), the Student-Life Stress Inventory (Gadzella, 1991), the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations-Short Form (Cohan, Jang & Stien, 2006), and the Multidimensional Studentsâ€™ Life Satisfaction Scale (Huebner, 1994). Results: In this model, objective loads with academic stress and academic stress with emotion-oriented coping and reactions to stressors showed a significant positive relationship and the results indicated a significant negative relationship between academic stress with task-oriented coping and academic satisfaction. The results showed significant positive relationship between task-oriented coping and academic satisfaction and significant negative relationship between emotion-oriented coping and reactions to stressors with academic satisfaction. Results indicated that relationship between objective and subjective stressful experiences with reactions to stressors and academic satisfaction by task and emotion-oriented coping styles is mediated partially. In mediating models of task and emotion-oriented coping, models' predictors accounted for 31? and 27? of the variance in academic satisfaction, respectively. Conclusion: These results stress on importance of training for adaptive coping strategies.

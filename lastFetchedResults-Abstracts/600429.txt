Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the relation between tendon integrity and functional results following the arthroscopic treatment of small- and medium-sized rotator cuff tears. Methods: Arthroscopic repair was performed on 26 consecutive patients (21 women, 5 men; mean age: 55.9 years; range: 33-72 years) with small- and medium-sized tears of the supraspinaÂ¬tus tendon. Patients were postoperatively evaluated at 12 and 24 months using the Constant and UCLA functional outcome scores and ultrasound examinations. Results: The supraspinatus tendon did not heal in nine patients (34.6%) and was partially healed in three (11%), 12 months after surgery. Mean postoperative Constant and UCLA scores of these patients were 73.1 and 27.8, respectively, which were not significantly different from those with an intact tendon on the final follow-up (Constant: 78 and UCLA: 30; p=0.107 and p=0.164). Both rating systems reflected significant improvement with treatment (p<0.01). The mean age of patients with a re-tear was 66.8 years, which was significantly higher than those with an intact repair (54 years; p<0.01). Conclusion: The arthroscopic repair of small and medium-sized supraspinatus tendon tears yields good long-term results independent of tendon integrity. Healing potential may be decreased with increased age.

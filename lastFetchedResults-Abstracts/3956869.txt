Bidirectional associative memory (BAM) has been widely used to solve classification problems such as pattern recognition, data compression, etc. Since Jeng et al. (1990) proposed the exponential BAM (eBAM), which has a high storage capacity and error-correction capability as well as being simple to implement, a great deal of research has gone into further improving its performance. The capacities of various eBAMs are derived and compared

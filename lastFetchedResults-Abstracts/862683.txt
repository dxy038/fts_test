We consider the two-machine flowshop scheduling problem where jobs have random
processing times which are bounded within certain intervals. The objective is to minimize
total completion time of all jobs. The decision of finding a solution for the problem has to be
made based on the lower and upper bounds on job processing times since this is the only
information available. The problem is NP-hard since the special case when the lower and
upper bounds are equal, i.e., the deterministic case, is known to be NP-hard. Therefore, a
reasonable approach is to come up with well performing heuristics. We propose eleven
heuristics which utilize the lower and upper bounds on job processing times based on
the Shortest Processing Time (SPT) rule. The proposed heuristics are compared through
randomly generated data. The computational analysis has shown that the heuristics using
the information on the bounds of job processing times on both machines perform much
better than those using the information on one of the two machines. It has also shown
that one of the proposed heuristics performs as the best for different distributions with an
overall average percentage error of less than one.

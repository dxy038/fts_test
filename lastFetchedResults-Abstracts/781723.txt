Objective: To determine seroprevalence of small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) infections among goats in South Tyrol, Italy.
Design: Prospective serological study.
Material and methods-animals: 15,980 goats older than 6 months from 1973 goat herds in South Tyrol were tested by an ELISA
for the presence of SRLV antibodies. 3148 goats were 6–14 months old (AG 1), 3273 goats were 15 to 26 months old (AG 2) and
9559 goats were older than 26 months (AG 3).
Results: Serological examination revealed that seroprevalence of SRLV among goats was 23.6% and herd prevalence was 38.0%.
Seroprevalence was significantly higher (P < 0.002) in AG 3 (25.1%) than among goats in AG 1 (20.6%) and AG 2 (20.0%),
respectively. Seroprevalence of dwarf goats was significantly (P < 0.001) lower (4.0%) when compared with the indigenous,
mainly prevalent breed “Passeirer Goat” (24.6%), dairy breed (25.6%) and mixed breed (10.7%). Seroprevalence was significantly
higher (P < 0.001) among goats born indoors (November–April: 24.2%) than in the animals born outdoors (May–October:
20.0%). Seroprevalence among female goats (23.6%) did not differ significantly from male goats (23.7%).
Conclusions and clinical relevance: SRLV infections among goats in South Tyrol, Italy, are evident. Birth indoors with its consequences
(close contact, kids suckling by diverse dams or by milk pool) is also a risk factor for SRLV infections in South Tyrol. In
future more clinical outbreaks may occur, and therefore establishing measures to prevent the spreading of the disease is necessary.
Installing a control or eradication programme seroprevalence and genetic and economic aspects must be considered.

Objective: The bacterium Oceanimonas sp. (O. sp.) GK1 is a member of the Aeromonadaceae
family and its genome represents several virulence genes involved in fish and
human pathogenicity. In this original research study we aimed to identify and characterize
the putative virulence factors and pathogenicity of this halotolerant marine bacterium using
genome wide analysis.
Materials and Methods: The genome data of O. sp. GK1 was obtained from NCBI. Comparative
genomic study was done using MetaCyc database.
Results: Whole genome data analysis of the O. sp. GK1 revealed that the bacterium possesses
some important virulence genes (e.g. ZOT, RTX toxin, thermostable hemolysin,
lateral flagella and type IV pili) which have been implicated in adhesion and biofilm formation
and infection in some other pathogenic bacteria.
Conclusion: This is the first report of the putative pathogenicity of O. sp.GK1. The
genome wide analysis of the bacterium demonstrates the presence of virulence genes
causing infectious diseases in many warm- and cold-blooded animals.

This paper presents an original use of evolutionary algorithms in order to approximate by a closed form the inverse kinematic model of analytical (non-analytical) and general manipulators. The objective is to provide a fast and general solution to the inverse kinematic problem when it is extensively evaluated in the design processes of manipulators. A mathematical function is evolved through genetic programming according to the known direct kinematic model to determine an analytical expression which approximates the joint variable solution for a given end-effector configuration. As an illustration of this evolutionary symbolic regression process, the inverse kinematic models of the PUMA and GMF Arc Mate are approximated before applying the algorithm to general 6R manipulators.

The objective of this study was to investigate existing fishing, capture and post-capture practices and their effects on the quality of tuna with respect to histamine and other amines. The study was undertaken in the northeastern coast of Brazil from December 2007 until December 2008. Fishing was performed at high-ocean by pelagic trawl using stainless steel boats and Spanish or American technology. Illex argentinus was used as baits. The fish were insensibilized, bled, eviscerated, rinsed with seawater and stored with flake ice. Histamine was not detected in 95% of the samples whereas histamine levels ranged from 4.92 to 6.90 mg/kg in 5% of the samples. Every lot analyzed complied with the European legislation, and the fish were classified as good quality. No significant difference was observed on histamine levels between fish that were captured dead and alive. The results indicate that the prevalent fishing, capture and post-capture practices used by boats from Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, are ensuring good quality tuna.

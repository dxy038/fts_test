The principal objective of this paper is the statically study of pre-processed Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) images. Different statistical tests are applied testing for distributional assumption in general and for normality in particular. Results of our statistical study are tested on a sample of SAS image filtered using a specific homomorphic filter depicted in our previous work [1]. Accordingly, hypothesis tests and graphical testing methods has been exploited to select the best representative of a filtered sample image SAS in order to perform a follow detection process.

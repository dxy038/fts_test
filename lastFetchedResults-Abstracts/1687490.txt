A new approach to polymer molding simulation is presented, based on a mathematical imaging algorithm (F. Darsonville, P. Michoud, G. Courbebaisse, M. Jourlin, R. Favier, J.C. Charpentier, Entropy Revue 206 (1998) 61â€“64). A model is elaborated using discrete propagation of distances as a tool to simulate dynamic injection. The present objective involves the examination of this approach based on mathematical metrics. This paper concerns recent progress in the formulation of this problem.

The main objective of the work described in this paper is to develop an algorithm to detect QT, other ECG intervals and to find any correlation between QT, ST, QRS, Heart rate (HR) of normal and IUGR children at 10 yrs. The cohort under study is described in chapter 2 as 41 IUGR and 34 as normal. The ECGs of 24 hour for each child were used to find any differences between the two groups. Normal children have QRS intervals during awake (73.96 &#177;13.65 ms) and asleep (78.75&#177;14.76 ms), and IUGR has (73.94 &#177;12.85 ms day, 75.98&#177;14.80 ms night), and IUGR children have a slightly higher corrected QTc (418.25&#177;28.92ms Day, 437.22&#177;20.17 ms night), compared to normal (411.37 &#177;36.13 ms day, 431.79&#177;20.12 ms night). At 10 years of age the measured ECG intervals of all normal and IUGR children was unable to show any deviation from the normal paediatric limits. IUGR children are relatively more prone to longer QTc intervals.

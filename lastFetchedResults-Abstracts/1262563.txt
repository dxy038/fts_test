Salinity could damage cellular membranes through overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), while antioxidant capacities play a vital role in protecting plants from salinity caused oxidative damages. The objective of this study was to investigate the toxic effect of salt on the antioxidant enzyme activities, isoforms and gene expressions in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Salt-tolerant ‘Quickstart II’ and salt-sensitive ‘DP1′ were subjected to 0 and 250 mM NaCl for 12 d. Salt stress increased the content of lipid peroxidation (MDA), electrolyte leakage (EL) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), to a greater extent in salt-sensitive genotype. Salt-stressed plant leaves exhibited a greater activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), peroxidase (POD, EC 1.11.1.7), ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11) at 4 d after treatment (DAT), but a lower level of enzyme activity at 8 and 12 d, when compared to the control. Catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) activity was greater at 4 DAT and thereafter decreased in salt tolerant genotype relative to the control, whereas lower than the control during whole experiment period for salt-sensitive genotype. There were different patterns of five isoforms of SOD, POD and two isoforms of APX between two genotypes. Antioxidant gene expression was positively related to isoenzymatic and total enzymatic activities during 12-d salt-treated leaves of two genotypes, with a relatively higher level in salt-tolerant genotype. Thus, salt tolerance could be related to the constitutive/induced antioxidant gene, leading to more efficient enzyme stimulation and protection in perennial ryegrass.

The new requirements of metropolitan area networks (MAN) have resulted in the emergence of new data transport technology, resilient packet ring (RPR). The key performance objective of RPR is to simultaneously achieve high bandwidth utilization, spatial reuse, and fairness. In this paper, a fairness conception based upon ingress aggregated flow is defined for RPR, then a fairness algorithm described in the draft of IEEE standard for RPR is analyzed and an improvement is produced to achieve better performance. At last, the simulation results are given to prove the conclusion.

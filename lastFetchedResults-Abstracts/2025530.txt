The Frequency Assignment Problem is
assignment of frequencies or channels to establish link
between base station and mobile transmitter in cellular
system. To avoid interference, minimum separation between
assigned frequencies is required. This problem is NP-hard.
Due to limited availability of spectrum and reuse of same
frequencies at different geographical locations, an excellent
assignment is to be done, which must satisfy electromagnetic
constraints with respect to demand in each cell. This paper
presents a novel DGWCHD algorithm for frequency
assignment problem in cellular radio networks. The objective
is to assign the frequency satisfying electromagnetic
constraints for given demand with minimum use of frequency
bandwidth. The proposed algorithm is based on real wild
animal such as dog’s intelligent strategies during chasing and
hunting their prey. The proposed algorithm is implemented
on benchmark Kunz’s test problems, which are practical
FAP problems based on area around 25 regions in Helsinki,
Finland. The DGWCHD algorithm has been used for call
ordering and FEA strategy for assignment. The performance
of the proposed novel DGWCHD algorithm has been
compared with other nature inspired techniques. The results
obtained are very optimistic and encouraging

The task of objective perimetry is to scan the visual field and find an answer about the function of the visual system. Flicker-burst stimulation-a physiological sensible combination of transient and steady-state stimulation-is used to generate deterministic sinusoidal responses or visually evoked potentials (VEPs) at the visual cortex, which are derived from the electroencephalogram by a suitable electrode array. Here, the authors develop a new method for the detection of VEPs. Based on the periodogram of a time-series, they test the data for the presence of hidden periodic components, which correspond to steady-state VEPs. The method is applied successfully to real data.

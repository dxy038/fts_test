A library of 30 trisubstituted pyrimidines were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antimalarial and antitubercular activity. Out of the 30 compounds synthesized, 23 compounds have shown in vitro antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum in the range of 0.25–2 μg/mL and 16 compounds have shown antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra, at a concentration of 25 μg/mL.

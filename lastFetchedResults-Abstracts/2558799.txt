Objective: To assess the neuroprotective effects of local administration of 17- beta- estradiol on nerve
regeneration. Methods: Sixty female Wistar rats were overiectomized and divided into four experimental groups (n=15),
randomly: In autograft group a segment of sciatic nerve was transected and re-implanted reversely. In shamsurgery
group sciatic nerve was exposed and manipulated. In transected group left sciatic nerve was transected
and stumps were fixed in adjacent muscle. In treatment group defect was bridged using a silicon conduit filled
with 10 Î¼L (0.1 mg/mL) 17- beta- estradiol. Each group was subdivided into four subgroups of five animals each
and nerve fibers were studied in a 12-week period. Results: Behavioral, functional, biomechanical, electrophysiological and gastrocnemius muscle mass findings
and morphometric indices confirmed faster recovery of regenerated axons in treatment group than in other
groups (p<0.05). Immunohistochemical reactions to S-100 in treatment group were more positive than that in
other groups. Conclusion: Local administration of 17-beta-estradiol improved functional recovery and morphometric indices
of sciatic nerve. It could have clinical implications for the surgical management of patients after facial nerve
transection.

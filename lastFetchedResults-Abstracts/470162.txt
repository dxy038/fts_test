Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the perinatal outcome of spontaneously conceived triplet pregnancies in relation to chorionicity.
Study design
In this retrospective study, maternal, neonatal, and chorionicity data were collected from 88 sets of triplet pregnancies that were delivered at >20 weeks of gestation from 3 tertiary referral centers in the United Kingdom. The data were collected between January 1986 and December 2000. There were 49 sets of trichorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancies and 39 sets of triplet pregnancies with a monochorionic pair (ie, dichorionic triamniotic triplets). The outcome of each pregnancy was assessed in relation to chorionicity.
Results
The overall perinatal mortality rate was 151.5 per 1000 total births, with dichorionic triamniotic triplets having a 5.5-fold higher risk than trichorionic triamniotic gestations (odds ratio, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.5-12.2). The dichorionic triamniotic triplets have a higher risk of delivery at <30 weeks of gestation (odds ratio, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.6-11.8; P< .05) and birth weight of <1000 g (odds ratio, 53.6; 95% CI, 17.5-164; P< .05) than those of trichorionic triamniotic pregnancies. The neonatal morbidity in terms of respiratory distress syndrome (P< .001), anemia (P< .01), and intraventricular hemorrhage (P< .001) were higher in dichorionic triamniotic compared with trichorionic triamniotic triplets. The premature rupture of membrane (odds ratio, 7.5; 95% CI, 3.5-15.7) and twin-twin transfusion syndrome (odds ratio, 14.9; 95% CI, 6.6-4) were independent risk factors for perinatal death.
Conclusion
In spontaneously conceived triplets, the incidence of dichorionicity was 44%. The dichorionic triamniotic triplets have a 5.5-fold higher risk of adverse perinatal outcome predominantly because of twin-twin transfusion syndrome and premature rupture of membranes.

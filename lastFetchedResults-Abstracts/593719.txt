Title :Study and comparison of response of normal and learning disabled students on beery's test of Visual –Motor Integration.objective: This research was done in order to investigate and compare of the response of normal students and different groups of the students with learning disorders(LD), on beery's test of Visual –Motor Integration.Methodology: Four groups were assessed. Forty-five persons were assigned for normal students and Forty-five persons in three groups each consisting of 45 students were assigned for LD students. Three kind of disorder were considered, reading-dictation disorder, mathematic-dictation disorder and mathematic disorder.Results:  The ANOVA results between normal and LD students in respect of the beery's test on the ?/2 =0.01 and P=0 were shown that there were significant differences between all groups and the normal student's test response was better than LD students.  Furthermore the scheffe test was indicated the following results. There was a main and meaningful difference P < 0.05, between answer of the LD groups and the normal group. The similar amount was obtained when we assessed and compared the students with dictation-reading disorder and the students with mathematic disorder. It means that the second group performance has been better than the first one. There wasn't any meaningful difference between the students with reading-dictation disorder and math-dictation disorder (P > 0.05), also comparison of the students with math- dictation disorder and math disorder was shown the similar result (P > 0.05).The whole result of this study can be helped and used to recognize and improve visual and motional/motility disabilities and disorders.

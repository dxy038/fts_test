e-Photon/ONe (El) is a network of excellence focusing on optical networking and funded by the EU in the VI Framework Program. The main objective of the network of excellence is to promote the "integration" of the research of institutions with different expertises towards a common goal. One of the instruments implemented in E1 are the Virtual Departments (VDs), working groups that gather researchers around big topics in optical networking to exchange results, promote joint research and identify new topics. VD1 is devoted to core optical networks and this paper wants to report the main results achieved at the end of the two years of the project, with particular focus on the joint research activities

A worker assignment for machine cluster in the manufacturing cell was discussed in this paper. The objective of this paper is two folds. First, it aims to demonstrate a calculation of the maximum number of machines which one worker can optimally operate without an idle time on the machine. Then, the simulation software program is utilized to evaluate various proposed improvement alternatives based on maximum machine efficiency criteria. In this study one of the hard disk drive manufacturers in Thailand was explored. Previously, one worker was assigned to service eight semi-automated machines in the cluster. The main tasks of the worker were loading, checking and recording. Due to the fact that workload of the worker and the machine cycle is not balanced so the utilization of the worker cannot be maximized. Therefore, the optimum number of machines which one worker can ideally service is calculated. It is found that one worker can optimally serve up to eleven machines. However, other alternatives are also explored. As a result, by systematic work elimination, one worker can service up to fourteen machines per cycle with 96.09% machine utilization.

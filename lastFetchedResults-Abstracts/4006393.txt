Design optimisation is a primary objective in computer-aided engineering. In the paper the optimisation of a linear variable differential transformer is used as an example. The study shows two typical features of computer-aided engineering: first that analysis techniques can be used to give measurements of system parameters that could not be achieved in a practical experiment; secondly that the design optimisation involves application-specific extensions to the basic techniques. Using the data from computer-evaluated measurements a transducer design which gives a linear output voltage is achieved

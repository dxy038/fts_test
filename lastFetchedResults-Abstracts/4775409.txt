Optimisation studies have explored the application of a number of strategies. These include principally gradient methods and genetic algorithms. The former require the calculation of gradients that link design parameters with system response and combined with optimisation routines, they are used to find the best design according to a specified objective function and design variable constraints. Although they require gradient calculation, they are less computationally demanding, but are restricted in their search field. Gradient-based optimisation is one of the most popular strategies in tackling optimisation in engineering design problems.

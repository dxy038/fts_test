In this paper, an algorithm is presented to optimize a PFHE through minimizing three different objective functions: the number of entropy generation unit, total annual cost (TAC) and combined entropy generation and TAC. First, Minimization of total number of entropy generation units for specific heat duty requirement under given space restrictionsand minimizationof TAC are considered as objective functions using Particle swarm optimization (PSO) and are treated individually. Heat exchanger length, fin frequency, numbers of fin layers, lance length of fin, fin height and fin thickness or different flow length of the heat exchanger are considered for optimization. The result show that if TAC is selected as an objective function, the rate of convergence and optimization will be improved, then sum of entropy generation and cost was selected as the best candidate for objective function.

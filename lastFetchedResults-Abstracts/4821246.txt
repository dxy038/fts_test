US Steel Engineering has developed an innovative technique to project management and implementation entitled Design for Start-Up (DFSU). The engineering department applies this thorough approach to all capital and cost projects at US Steel. The overall objective of Design for Start-Up is to execute a project with a clear focus on achieving the full realization of the financial benefits to the overall venture, without negatively impacting productivity or quality. In 1993, two large capital projects were approved that were critical to the future success and competitiveness of the Mon Valley Works. The power system reliability 6900 volt project and the force feed forward project directly affect production on the 80" hot strip mill and also tie into other areas of the plant. In order to ensure the success of these projects, Design for Start-Up was stressed and executed to the fullest extent. This paper focuses on the DFSU steps, methods, and actions utilized by US Steel to implement the 6900 volt and force feed forward projects

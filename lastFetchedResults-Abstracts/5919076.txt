Optimality principle based sink tree methodology for adaptive static routing using multiple route configuration scheme is an innovative strategy for integrating dynamic routing protocol attributes seamlessly into static routing. In context of incapability to dynamically adapt to network topology failures and high management overhead, static routing still offers robustness to routing convergence failure, external route spoofing and easy prediction. This paper proposes a static routing strategy with an objective of extending its ability to adapt to logical network topology changes, equipment failures or network outages ´on the fly´. This strategy will involve discovery of all possible static routes from a specific source router to destination router, analyzing and ordering their applicability using optimality principle based sink tree approach. A random subnet composed of fifteen routers is simulated and mapped to sink tree and most obvious paths between random source and destination are analyzed. Static routes are traced to extract information about hop count from source to destination. The hop count information is recorded for each static route trace and comparative analysis is performed. Based on this comparison the static route are sorted in order of preference as per optimality principle and are offered to router as secondary routes in event of failure of primary preferred static route, thereby retaining the benefits of static routing while still availing the flexibility of dynamic routing to some extent.

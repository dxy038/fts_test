The threat of terrorism is a constant reminder of the significance of developing effective strategies to safeguard the population. This is particularly important in large, densely populated areas, which can often be the primary targets of a terrorist attack. In such a situation, the implementation of a depopulation plan becomes very challenging to manage. This paper explores one possible method of addressing rapid evacuation of densely populated urban environments in response to a terrorist threat through an in-vehicle embedded system model. The objective of the model is to determine feasible technologies that enable mobile ad-hoc mesh communication to safely depopulate an urban area.

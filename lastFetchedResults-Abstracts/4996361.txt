For the characteristics of supply chains in the enterprises, it raises the evaluation factors in the partner selection in the mining enterprises, and constructs multi-objective optimization model of partner selection in mining enterprises, combined with the degree of the close relationship between business. And then, it introduces the application of genetic algorithm in partner selections of the mining enterprises. Finally the typical experiment, by using the MATLAB Genetic Algorithm Toolbox for calculation, shows that using genetic algorithm to optimize partner selection in the mining enterprises is feasible and effective.

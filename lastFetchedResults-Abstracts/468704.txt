The purpose of this study was to implement and assess the R-I-M-E (Reporter, Interpreter, Manager, Educator) system as a method for evaluation for medical students during the obstetrics and gynecology core clerkship.
Study design
With the R-I-M-E method (which is an objective framework for evaluation), mid clerkship review sessions are held during which residents verbally assess each student on competencies that include problem identification and reasoning skills, communication skills, physical examination skills, written documentation, and professional attributes. The clerkship director provides timely feedback to the students. Residents and students were surveyed to assess their attitudes about the R-I-M-E method.
Results
Most of the attitudes of residents and students were positive about the R-I-M-E evaluation system. The directors feel that R-I-M-E method allows more meaningful, complete, and timely feedback to students, especially in areas that are traditionally difficult to assess, such as professionalism.
Conclusions
The R-I-M-E method is an effective evaluation tool for medical students during an obstetrics and gynecology clerkship and is well received by teachers and learners.

The objective of this study was to find a pretreatment process that enhances enzymatic conversion of biomass to sugars. Rapeseed straw was pretreated by two processes: a wet process involving wet milling plus a popping treatment, and a dry process involving popping plus dry milling. The effects of the pretreatments were studied both in terms of structural and compositional changes and change in susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis. After application of the wet and dry processes, the amounts of cellulose and xylose in the straw were 37–38% and 14–15%, respectively, compared to 31% and 12% in untreated counterparts. In enzymatic hydrolysis performance, the wet process presented the best glucose yield, with a 93.1% conversion, while the dry process yielded 69.6%, and the un-pretreated process yielded &lt;20%. Electron microscopic studies of the straw also showed a relative increase in susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis with pretreatment.

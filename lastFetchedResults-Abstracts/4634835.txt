This paper deals with a methodology of sizing hybrid systems solar/wind/battery optimized by minimizing the annualized cost system (ACS) and the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) using multi-objective genetic algorithm. The developed methodology was applied using the hourly solar, temperature and the wind speed data collected for one year on the site of Potou located in the northwestern coast of Senegal. The annual average hourly load profile of a typical remote village located in the northwestern coast of Senegal which energy is of 94 kWh/day has been used. The obtained results show that the cost of the optimal configuration strongly depends on the loss of power supply probability (LPSP). For example, the cost of the optimal configuration decreases by 25 % when the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) grows to 1% from 0%.

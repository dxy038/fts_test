As part of the NavyÂ´s Integrated Topside Design effort, the Science and Technology Community initiated several technology demonstrations for the development of reduced signature sensors to produce a low-observable surface combatant. The objective of the Multifunction Electromagnetic Radiating System (MERS) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) is to demonstrate the feasibility of combining at least four shipboard functions (direction finding, JTIDS (joint tactical information data system) transmit and receive, UHF line-of-sight transmit and receive, and IFF (identification friend or foe) transmit and receive) into a single, low observable, lightweight antenna system. The principal benefits of this integration are to lower topside weight, dramatically decrease the total number of antennas aloft and decrease the radar cross section contribution of these antenna functions to a negligible level. The key beneficiaries of the MERS technology may include new construction ship programs such as future DDG 51s, DD 21, LPD 17 Class ships, as well as active fleet LHD 1, CG-47 and DDG-51 Class ships

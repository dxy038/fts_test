This paper concentrates on the bidirectional motion estimation problem for applications at very low bit rate. The missing frames in the original video sequence are predicted by the decoder using only the received frames with not additional information. The same selected moving objects on each decoded frames, are initially meshed from quadrilateral blocks which are then deformed using specific warping functions. The positions of the mesh nodes are adapted to the objectÂ´s edges in such a way that the reconstruction error is as small as possible. Afterwards, the position displacements of these nodes are used to predict those of the moving objects in the missing frames. Finally, the meshed objects are reconstructed thanks to the predicted nodes. The proposed approach is integrated in the H.264/AVC video coding standard. Simulation results present the performance of the proposed bidirectional motion estimation.

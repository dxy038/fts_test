In this paper we present a design of a peripheral for microblaze soft core processor as part of a R+D project carried out in cooperation with three different companies. The objective of the project consisted in the development of an embedded system with a SoC implemented on a FPGA custom-designed board. This work addresses the design of a digital data processing peripheral included as a part of the target SoC application, that process digital signals via the digital inputs on a proposed board. Peripheral functionality is configurable for each digital signal independently and is configured from the software running on the microblaze processor core.

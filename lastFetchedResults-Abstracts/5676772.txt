The objective of this research is the development of a general purpose image understanding system. The object-oriented libraries described in this paper contain object definitions of image features, operators to deal with these features, and a framework for storage. Upon creation of an image feature, links are established from this feature to source features and upon request other links may be established to otherwise related features. Referring to single features or groups of features may be done by a property selection rule. The first aim is to find and store perceptual groupings found in an image by bottom-up processing for later use by a top-down image understanding system

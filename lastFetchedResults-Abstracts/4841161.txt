This paper summarizes the studies conducted by Alcatel Espace and Alcatel Alsthom Recherche to design a new generation of fault tolerant 100 Gbits mass memories for satellites, based on VLSI components. In the context of space applications, stringent dependability constraints have to be met and fault tolerance is a design objective. To reach this tolerance mechanisms including error detection and tests are needed

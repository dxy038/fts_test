Objective(s):Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness and it is related to oxidative stress based on numerous studies. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are members of multigenic family, which have important role in cells as an antioxidant. In the present study, we examined the polymorphism of GSTT1 and GSTM1 deletion genotypes (T0M1, T1M0, and T0M0) in 100 Glaucoma patients (41with primary open angle glaucoma (PCAG), and 59 with primary closed angle glaucoma (POAG)) compared to 100 healthy subjects. Materials and Methods: GSTM1and GSTT1 polymorphisms were determined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Results: GSTM1 and GSTT1 null deletions genotypes were determined in 22 (53.7%) and 7 (17.1%) patients with PCAG and 34 (34%) and 15 (15%) in healthy subjects[VAIO1] . Comparison between patients and healthy subjects regarding GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes revealed increase of GSTM1 null deletions genotypes in patients with PCAG (P=0.03). Conclusion: It was concluded that the increased frequencies of GSTM1 null in patients with PCAG could be a risk factor for incidence of PCAG in the Iranian population.

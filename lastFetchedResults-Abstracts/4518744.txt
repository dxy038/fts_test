In this work, we present the synchronizer as a significant part of a synchronous communication system. At high-speed communication, the synchronous system is advantageous over the asynchronous one, due to its greater transmission efficiency. We begin presenting four synchronizers which are the analog, the hybrid, the combinational and the sequential. All this synchronizers operate at a VCO frequency equal to the transmission rate. After, we present two more sequential versions, operating one at half rate and the other at a quarter rate. Our main objective is to test all this synchronizers in terms of output jitter as function of the input noise.

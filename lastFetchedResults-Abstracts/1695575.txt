Wisdom and belief in God are the basic conditions in order to enter the humans in the way of thinking (doctrine) and move them to the reality. In fact the human beings have been trying to recognize the reality of God by the various ways. They have wanted to satisfy the innate sense of the worship in their selves, although the humans have not been able to know the essence of God for long eras and their tries for comprehend this essence has been limited to the material thoughts and they have failed. During the history, many people have investigated this principle and its various aspects but it seems that the Sufi doctrine has considered it more profoundly, especially the high rank Gnostics such as Mowlana Jalal-ad-Din Muhammad Balkhi and Sheikh Mahmoud Shabestari.  The objective of the present study is to investigate the worldview of two above- mentioned Gnostics in the field of wisdom and the way to achieve the better recognition of God. On the basis of the results obtained from the research which has been done in the field, in spite of the variety observed in the views of the two poets, Mokashefeh is the one which is considered superior to others and this has been proven in the current investigation.
Key words:
Mowlana, Shabestari., wisdom, God, Heart.

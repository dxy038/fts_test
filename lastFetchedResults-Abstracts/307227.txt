Objective: Immunosuppressive therapy after liver transplantation may be a risk for kidney dysfunction. This work was designed to determine whether Tamm-Horsfall Protein (THP) could be considered as a marker for nephrotoxicity.
Design and Methods: THP was determined by an ELISA method in serial 24-h urine from liver transplant patients. Fourteen patients suffered renal insufficiency (LTr1) and 20 showed no acute renal damage (LTr2) after liver transplantation.
Results: No clear association could be seen between daily THP excretion and plasma creatinine levels by comparing serial samples collected at the same time. Nevertheless, significant differences were observed in pretransplant THP excretion between both groups of patients. The results (Median/Interquartile Range) were: Controls: 113.2/84.9 to 146.8 mg/24 h (n = 30); LTr1: 36.9/18.3 to 54.5 mg/24 h (p 0.001 with respect to C and LTr2); LTr2: 90.8/61.5 to 139.7 mg/24 h.
Conclusions: The higher pretransplant synthesis and/or secretion of THP seem to have a protective role on the kidney during and after liver transplantation.

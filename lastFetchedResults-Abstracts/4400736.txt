This paper describes the design and construction of an angled ultrasonic transducer for blood flow measurement. The transducer was constructed using as sensing element, a commercial 8 MHz PIC255 piezoceramic, Insulcast 501 and Rexolite 4422 as backing and matching layer materials respectively. The objective of this work was to design and construct a single element transducer for pulsed wave Doppler blood flow measurement, with an angle of 60&#176; resonating at approximately 8 MHz. Results show that the overall performance of the transducer fulfils the requirements of its design and it is possible to use it for blood flow measurement applications.

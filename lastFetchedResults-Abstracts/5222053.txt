In this paper a multi-objective criterion function is introduced to maximize annual energy input (AEI) and minimize permanent magnet (PM) volumes in a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). First, a PMSG is designed and modeled analytically to achieve above mentioned targets. After that, effects of various generator parameters on the two above-mentioned objective functions are analyzed using this model. The PMSG parameters and dimensions are then optimized using a genetic algorithm incorporated with an appropriate objective function. The results demonstrate an considerable enhancement in PMSG performance. Thus, finite element method (FEM) is utilized to prove the analytical results. Comparison between simulation and experimental results presents a good agreement between estimated and practical results.

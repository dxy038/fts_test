Vulnivaccine, a vaccine against vibriosis caused by Vibrio vulnificus serovar E (formerly biotype 2), confers acceptable levels of protection to eels after its administration by prolonged immersion in three doses. Recently, a new pathogenic serovar, named serovar A, has been isolated from vaccinated eels in a Spanish freshwater eel farm. The main objective of this work was to design a bivalent vaccine, and to study its effectiveness against the two pathogenic serovars. With this aim, eels weighing around 20 g were immunised with the bivalent vaccine by oral and anal intubation, intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) and prolonged immersion. The overall results indicated that: (i) the new vaccine delivered by oral and anal intubation induced protection levels higher than 80%, to that achieved after i.p. vaccination; (ii) oral and anal vaccination induced a significant systemic and mucosal immune response; (iii) the protection after vaccination by whichever routes was related to antibody titres in plasma; (iv) mucosal and systemic compartments showed different kinetics of antibody production; (v) evidence for passive transfer of antibodies from plasma to gut mucus were found after i.p. and anal vaccination, and finally, (vi) vaccination did not enhance the production of lysozyme, in plasma or mucus. In conclusion, this new vaccine is effective in protecting eels against vibriosis caused by the two eel-pathogenic serovars of V. vulnificus, the oral delivery system is a promising way which may be used in intensive culture facilities during the whole growth period of eels.

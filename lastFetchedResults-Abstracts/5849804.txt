There is currently an ongoing revolution in in vivo optical imaging. Important new developments allow for unprecedented visualization of tissue microstructure and enable quantitative mapping of disease-specific endogenous and exogenous chromophores. With these advances, optical imaging technologies are becoming powerful clinical tools for non invasive and objective diagnosis, guided treatment and for monitoring therapies. This report seeks to capture the current state of the art in optical imaging, emphasizing to new technology platforms that have achieved adoption and implementation in clinical setting.

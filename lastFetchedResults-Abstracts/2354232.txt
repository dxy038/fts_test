Objective: Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) are increasingly used in sunscreens, biosensors,
food additives, pigments, manufacture of rubber products, and electronic materials.
There are several studies about the effects of NPs on dermal fibroblast or keratinocytes,
but very little attention has been directed towards adipose-derived mesenchymal
stem cells (ASCs). A previous study has revealed that ZnO-NPs restricted the migration
capability of ASCs. However, the potential toxicity of these NPs on ASCs is not well understood.
This study intends to evaluate the effects of ZnO-NPs on subcutaneous ASCs.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, In order to assess toxicity, we exposed
rat ASCs to ZnO-NPs at concentrations of 10, 50, and 100 ?g/ml for 48 hours. Toxicity
was evaluated by cell morphology changes, cell viability assay, as well as apoptosis
and necrosis detection.
Results: ZnO-NPs concentration dependently reduced the survival rates of ASCs as revealed
by the trypan blue exclusion and 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium-
bromide (MTT) tests. ZnO-NPs, at concentrations of 10 and 50 ?g/ml, induced a
significant increase in apoptotic indices as shown by the annexin V test. The concentration
of 10 ?g/ml of ZnO-NPs was more toxic.
Conclusion: Lower concentrations of ZnO-NPs have toxic and apoptotic effects on
subcutaneous ASCs. We recommend that ZnO-NPs be used with caution if there is a
dermatological problem.

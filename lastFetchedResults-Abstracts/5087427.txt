Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) is a typical cardiac pathology with symptomatic episodes occurring at unpredictable moments. Production of an objective instrumental documentation on ambulatory patients based on ECG is still a problem. This might be obtained with a portable instrument given to the patient for a self-documentation of pathological events. We have realized a low-cost and easy-to-use portable solid-state recorder. PAF analysis is based on the morphology of RR interval-series and derived-series histograms. The system is able to detect online QRS complexes, to calculate RR interval values and to memorize histograms. Recorded histograms are transferred to an external output device (personal computer, printer, video). The system makes it possible recording of more than 24 histograms and a few months of stand-by

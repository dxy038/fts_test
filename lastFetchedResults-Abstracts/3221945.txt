A fuzzy regression model illustrates the potential possibilities inherent in the target system by including all data in the model. Tanaka and Guo employ exponential possibility distribution to build a model, while Inuiguchi et al. and Tajima are independently working on coinciding between the center of a possibility distribution and the center of a fuzzy regression model. Typically, samples influence and distort the shape of the model if they are far from the center of data. Yabuuchi and Watada have developed a model for describing the system possibility using the center of a fuzzy regression model and an approach that mends the distortion of the model. This model is a fuzzy regression model building through possibility maximization. The objective of this paper is to analyze the Japanese economy using our model, and to show the usefulness of our model by analysis results.

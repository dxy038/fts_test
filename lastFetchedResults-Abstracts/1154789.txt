Various strategies for on-line feedback control for forming operations have been proposed, e.g. expert and database systems, response surface, neural network, etc. The paper presents a new framework for the design of controllers for highly non-linear systems, the framework is based on classical state space control theory combined with a non-linear finite element model and a non-linear optimization scheme for identification of the feed-back gain factors. The process is controlled through distributed blank-holder force and variable total blank-holder force and the objective is to control the flange draw-in.

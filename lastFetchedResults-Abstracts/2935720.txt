WDM multihop networks require that their virtual topology and routing algorithm be simple and efficient while providing extremely high performance. To comply with this, the interconnections of the bidirectional manhattan street network (BMSN) is hierarchically rearranged. The resulting virtual topology constitutes a four-connected MSN-based network called the hierarchical MSN (HMSN). Having the same node degree as BMSN, the proposed HMSN increases no H/W complexity. Routing in HMSN is not also a serious burden to the overall processing overhead since it is a simple two-level extension of the deflection routing used in the two-connected MSNs. Nevertheless, HMSN performs better than the competing BMSN. This improvement in network delay and throughput is verified through numerical implementations

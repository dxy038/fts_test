The topology of the overseas Defense Communications System (DCS) is characterized by the interconnection of a number of major switching and transmission nodes. As these switching and transmission networks become more sophisticated and evolve into a fully digital architecture, the need for having real-time status and control reporting and monitoring capability between these nodal sites and its affiliated centralized AO&amp;M control facility will become more imperative. The proposed architecture will explore the utilization of the AN/FCC-100 (V) Low Speed Time Division Multiplexer (LSTDM) for the integrated routing of System Control (SYSCON) information between these nodes and the centralized Administration, Operation, and Maintenance (AO&amp;M) centers. The ultimate objective of this architecture is to assist the Theater Communications Command (TCC) in fulfilling Joint as well as Combined communications requirements in a Theater-level environment.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to characterize placental expression of the prostaglandin synthase enzymes cyclooxygenase (COX) -1 and -2 and prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH, a degrading enzyme).
Study design
Forty-one women between 20 and 37 weeks' gestation and 39 matched term controls with either spontaneous labor or premature rupture of membranes were enrolled in a prospective case-control study. The relative amounts of placental RNAs at delivery were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Results
Placental COX-1 RNA decreased with advancing gestational age at delivery (R2 = 0.13, P = .001), and increased by 43% when chorioamnionitis was present (P = .006). Among patients presenting at term, oxytocin use was associated with 30% lower expression of COX-1 (P = .01). COX-2 and PGDH were not associated with these variables.
Conclusion
Placental COX-1 RNA at delivery decreases with advancing gestational age and with oxytocin use at term. Thus, expression of placental COX-1 is not constitutive. Placental expression of COX-2 and PGDH do not correlate with gestational age, chorioamnionitis, or oxytocin use.

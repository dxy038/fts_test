Objective. The aim of this study was to find the optimal choice of luting cement to Synthoceram, an aluminum oxide-reinforced glass ceramic material. The bond strength of five different commercial luting cements to the ceramic material was evaluated. The effect of surface treatments, etching, sandblasting, silanizing, and combinations of these treatments was also investigated.

Methods. Shear bond strength tests were performed using the ceramic material as substrate with each of the luting cements. Cements rods were prepared on pre-treated ceramic surfaces. The shear bond strength was determined 24 h after cementation. The effect of surface treatments: etching, sandblasting, and sandblasting followed by etching, respectively, on the morphology of the material, was investigated with SEM.

Results. The shear bond strength increases significantly from Ketac Cem, Rely X Luting, Fuji Plus, Panavia F to Xeno Cem. The surface treatments etching and/or sandblasting followed by silanization generally provide the highest bond strength values.

Significance. Based on the results of this study, the use of resin composite based cements is preferred for cementation of an all-ceramic restoration with an aluminum oxide-reinforced glass ceramic base. Surface treatment of etching and/or sandblasting followed by silanization is recommended.

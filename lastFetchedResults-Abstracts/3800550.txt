We propose a novel architecture for a fault-tolerant multiprocessor environment. It is assumed that the multiprocessor organization consists of a pool of active processing modules and either a small number of spare modules or active modules with some spare processing capacity. A fault-tolerance scheme is developed for duplex systems using checkpoints. Our scheme, unlike traditional checkpointing schemes, requires no rollbacks for recovering from single faults. The objective is to achieve performance of a triple modular redundant system using duplex system redundancy

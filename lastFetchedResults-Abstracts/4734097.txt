We study co-primary spectrum sharing concept in two small cell multiuser network. Downlink transmission is explored with Rayleigh fading in interfering broadcast channel. Both base stations and all the users are equipped with multiple antennas. Resource allocation with joint precoder and decoder design is proposed for weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem. The problem becomes mixed-integer and non-convex. We factor the main objective problem into two subproblems. First subproblem is subcarrier allocation where we assume that each subcarrier can be allocated to multiple users. Gale-Shapley algorithm based on stable marriage problem and transportation method are implemented for subcarrier allocation part. For the second subproblem, a joint precoder and decoder design is proposed to obtain the optimal solution for WSR maximization. Monte Carlo simulation is employed to obtain the numerical results to compare the two methods.

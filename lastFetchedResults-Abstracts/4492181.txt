The occurrence of the recent tsunami and earthquake tremors looks so alarmed. The government and the residents are concerned with the ability of the buildings constructed to withstand the vibrations resulted from the earthquakes. The challenge is to develop an Earthquake Simulator that can generate sine wave and real earthquake signal playback. Use National Instruments (NI) LabVIEW, and the PCI-6221 module, to create an easy-to-use software and hardware solution for controlling large public earthquake simulators in this paper. This system is named as the earthquake simulator system. The objective of the Earthquake Simulator System is to act as a test platform for the structural analysis of scaled down modelling of buildings under earthquake vibrations and also as a platform to train the public on the safety awareness to tackle the situation during an earthquake event. The experimental results will show the platform can honestly reproduce the historical earthquake.

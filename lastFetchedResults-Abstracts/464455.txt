OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate peripheral joint laxity during pregnancy and to determine whether serum relaxin levels are associated with increased joint laxity. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective observational study was performed. RESULTS: A significant increase in joint laxity was found in five of seven peripheral joints over the course of the pregnancy and post partum. There was no correlation with serum relaxin levels. There were no significant differences in joint laxity on the basis of parity, age, or prepregnancy exercise levels. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral joint laxity is noted to increase as pregnancy progresses. The cause of this change is undetermined. (AM J OBSTET GYNECOL 1996;174:667-71.)

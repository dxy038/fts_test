Rural farms have installed biomass waste to energy conversion systems to solve their manure disposal problems. These systems can however be sources of revenue to the farms, through sale of electricity to the grid. The farms also avoid the cost of grid electricity and propane, and can take advantage of renewable energy incentives. The existing waste to energy conversion systems were not designed with the objective of maximising revenue. The aim of this paper is to determine the cost savings that can be obtained from optimisation of the existing biomass waste to energy conversion systems.

Electronic advances over the last two decades have enabled the development of large-scale neural interface technology. Thus we can now use multielectrode arrays to transmit information out of the brain to directly control computers and robotic devices. More recently we have developed multi-electrode stimulating arrays to input information directly into sensory system of the brain. Since these devices provide direct access to individual neural circuits, one can now study neural information processing with greater precision. This technology also enables a new generation of bidirectional neural prosthetic systems that may alleviate paralysis and other neurological diseases. Finally, we have demonstrated the ability to use simple brain interfaces to remotely guide rodents through inaccessible spaces in order to perform surveillance and sensory detection functions

Inroduction & Objective: present study was aimed to evaluate the effects of addition of a synthetic antioxidant, MnTE, on motility and membrane integrity during the liquid storage (up to 72h) of goat semen.
Materials and Methods: Semen samples were collected using artificial vagina from three mature goats, mixed and diluted (1:20 v/v) with a Bioxell extender containing 0 (control), 0.01, 0.1 and 1 µM of MnTE. All diluted sperm suspensions were cooled to 5°C and stored until 72hr and sperm motility and membrane integrity were assessed in 0, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72hr post dilution. 
Results: With increasing storage time (0 to 72h), the percentage of motility and membrane integrity decreased in all treatments and control group. Addition of MnTE  at 0.01 and 0.1 µM concentration to the extender, improved goat semen quality, while addition of 1µM of MnTE had an adverse effect on motility and membrane integrity when compared to control.
Conclusion: extender supplemented with MnTE could reduce the oxidative stress provoked by liquid storage processes. The optimum concentration of MnTE seems to be 0.01 and 0.1µM for goat semen in liquid storage state. However, further supplementation of extender with 1µM of MnTE not only did not improve the results but inversely affected motility and membrane integrity in all treatment group.

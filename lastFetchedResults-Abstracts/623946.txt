Material and Methods: We conducted this pre-experimental study on 60 girl’s students, from a high school in Gorgan, selected via convenience sampling.  We asked the subjects to fill out the demographic data sheet and Dinner life satisfaction questionnaire, and divided them randomly in two groups of intervention and control.  For intervention group, a class of anxiety management was performed.  To compare the means, we used independent t- test and paired t- test. 
Results: The results show that there is significant difference between the life satisfaction of before and that of after education (P=0.028 ), but it is not true for control group.

This paper discusses a design rule of secure code over binary-erasure wiretap channels. The main objective of this work is to introduce our early work for the reader interested in practical secure code designs. The design rule introduced in this work is based on the coset coding scheme and generalized Hamming weights by taking advantage of a bounding technique. The bounding technique significantly simplifies the design of secure codes at various lengths, which has been known to require prohibitive complexity when secure codes are at lengths of practical interest.

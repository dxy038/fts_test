Macrofaunal abundance, biomass, diversity and species assemblages within Scripps and La Jolla Submarine Canyons are compared with those on the nearby continental shelf and slope. Our primary objective was to examine the effect of detrital aggregates on infaunal communities within canyons. Two submarines, a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), and a Soutar box-corer were used to collect samples. Within the canyons, organic enrichment by macrophyte detritus was evident from canyon heads down to 550 m, and evidence of strong currents (coarse sediment) was found down to 700 m. Infaunal density and biomass were higher in the canyons than outside at all depths where comparative data were available (100â€“500 m). Infaunal assemblages in canyons were distinct from those at reference stations. Both the canyon and non-canyons samples showed community differentiation with depth. Species diversity was generally high, but decreased with depth outside of canyons and increased with depth within the canyons. Low diversity at shallow depths within the canyon is attributed to a combination of organic enrichment and physical disturbance. Submarine canyons are commonly found to contain distinct species assemblages or higher faunal densities and/or biomass than nearby non-canyon regions at similar depths. Canyons are regular features along most ocean margins and appear to be important as sites of enhanced secondary production, provide diverse habitats, and act as conduits of coastal detritus to the deep-sea.

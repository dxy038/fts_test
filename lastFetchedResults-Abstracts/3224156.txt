Optimization-based design of electric machinery over a large design space requires the use of computationally efficient models to predict machine behavior. In this work, an analytical design model is developed for wound rotor synchronous machines (WRSMs), a key technology for power generation in marine applications. The model is designed to be used in a rigorous multi-objective optimization algorithm, providing the trade-off between competing mass and loss objectives. A formalized approach is presented to calculate the field distribution as well as qd-axis model parameters from design data containing material properties, stator and rotor geometries, and winding layout. The calculated parameters include resistances, inductances, and the back-emf of the machine.

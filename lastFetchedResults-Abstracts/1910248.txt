ines indicate that a patient with a pT1G3 tumor should initially receive BCG intravescial therapy, although cystectomy can be considered. In case of a recurrence, cystectomy is the treatment of choice. Although several new drugs and strategies are under development and in clinical research, there is only experience to some degree in BCG failing patients with thermochemotherapy, with promising results.

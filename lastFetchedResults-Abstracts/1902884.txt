Objective
racterize the population of infertile men with an incidental finding of testicular tumor diagnosed during infertility work-up and to describe their unique presentation and pathological findings.

pective study of 11 men in whom a testicular tumor was incidentally diagnosed during evaluation for infertility out of 150 patients who underwent orchiectomy over a 10-year period (1992 to 2002).
g
sity-affiliated urologic referral center.
t(s)
ile men with an incidental testicular mass who underwent radical orchiectomy.
entions(s)
ption of patient characteristics: age at diagnosis, presentation, history of undescended testis, and type of infertility.
utcome measure(s)
size and location and pathological diagnosis.
(s)
 patients met the studyâ€™s inclusion criteria, 11 tumors were identified and characterized. The tumors were usually small, centrally located and nonpalpable. Histologically, six were malignant germ-cell tumors and three were Leydig-cell tumors; two patients had no histologic evidence of tumor. All patients with a history of undescended testis had malignant germ-cell tumors.
sion(s)
e of trans-scrotal sonography enables early diagnosis of small nonpalpable tumors. A history of an undescended testis may necessitate a more aggressive approach, as these patients are at increased risk for testis cancer. Further studies are warranted to establish the yield of routine sonographic screening of infertile men and their specific management.

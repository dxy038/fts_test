Objective Male farmers in Australia have an
elevated risk of suicide. The aims of this study were to
investigate the rate of mental health problems amongst
farmers compared with non-farmer rural residents
and to investigate what additional factors might contribute
to an increased risk of suicide amongst farmers.
Method This study used a combination of quantitative
and qualitative approaches. First, using self-report
questionnaire data, we compared rates of mental
health problems (a common correlate of suicide) and
a number of personality measures between farmers
(n= 371) and non-farming rural residents (n=380). In
addition, semi-structured interviews with farmers
(n=32) were used to gain a richer understanding of
how the context of farming and mental health interact.
Results Five key findings emerged from the study. First,
in the quantitative study, we found no support for the
proposition that farmers experience higher rates of
mental health problems than do non-farmer rural residents,
but we identified potentially important personality
differences between farmers and non-farmers,
with levels of conscientiousness being significantly
higher amongst farmers and levels of neuroticism
being significantly lower. A strong association between
maleness and farming was also found. In the qualitative
study, participants indicated that farming is an environment
in which individuals experienced a range of
stressors but have limited capacity to acknowledge or
express these. In addition, there appeared to be significant
attitudinal barriers to seeking help for those
who may have mental health problems, particularly
male farmers. Conclusion The elevated rate of suicide
amongst farmers does not seem to be simply explained
by an elevated rate of mental health problems. Individual
personality, gender and community attitudes that
limit a person's ability to acknowledge or express
mental health problems and seek help for these may be
significant risk factors for suicide in farmers

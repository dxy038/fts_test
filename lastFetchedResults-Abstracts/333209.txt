The objective of this article is to evaluate the significance of resistive index in differentiation between benign and malignant breast lesions on duplex ultrasonographic examination. Resistive indices obtained in 106 breast lesions of 104 patients were included. Sixty-four were benign (mean age: 32.4 ± 11.1 years), and 42 were malignant lesions (mean age: 47.8 ± 11.4 years). The resistive index was classified as follows: below 0.49, from 0.5 to 0.59, 0.6 to 0.69, 0.7 to 0.79, and above 0.8. We analyzed and defined the optimal threshold value of RI between benign and malignant lesions. The mean values of the RI of benign and malignant lesions were 0.62 ± 0.095 (range 0.44–0.86) and 0.74 ± 0.097 (range, 0.50–0.92), respectively. The resistive index exceeded 0.7 in 80% of malignant lesions. The difference of the RI between malignant and benign lesions was statistically significant when the threshold value was 0.7 (P< 0.001). A resistive index over 0.7 may suggest malignant lesions. Due to the considerable overlap of the range of the RI, it may not be diagnostic in any single patient; however, it may be helpful in conjunct with gray-scale image.

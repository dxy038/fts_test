In downlink WCDMA systems, QoS and load management can be performed by a call admission control (CAC) algorithm. The objective of CAC is to guarantee high capacity and system stability, by accepting or denying an arriving bearer service access to the system, depending on the system load, the interference it adds to and receives from the existing connections, and the base station (BS) power limitation. Our contribution envisages the proposal of a flexible CAC framework regarding handover resource reservation, traffic activity monitoring and initial power allocation, in order to maximize the system capacity, while meeting quality of service (QoS) requirements throughout the dynamism of the connection duration.

The main objective of this cause- effect research was to study factors affecting students using library resources. The statistical population of the research consisted of graduate students in the Agricultural Faculty of University of Zanjan who were members of the agricultural library (N=432). A sample size of 168 students was selected using random sampling technique (n=168). Data were collected applying a questionnaire. The content validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by a panel of experts. The construct validity and composite reliability of the research instrument were tested by estimating the measurement model. The data were collected and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) multivariate technique. The results showed that five factors including: services quality, facilities and environment of library, resources quality of library, logistic services and infrasructures and equipments had a positive and significant effect on students using library resources. These factors, totally, explained about 64 percent of the variances of students using library resources. Also, the results indicated that total structure of the research model was confirmed based on the model fit indices and the theoretical model of the research was consistent with reality. Based on the findings, it was concluded that improving quality of services, providing suitable environment and facilities, increasing quality of library resources, providing appropriate supportive services and creating necessary infrastructures can directly lead to increase students using the library resources.

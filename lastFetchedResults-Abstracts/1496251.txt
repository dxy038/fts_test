Based on the knowledge developed in structural reliability theories, the objective of the paper is to present a reliability analysis model, which is formulated as a limit state up-crossing problem, and a probability calculation approach to determine the probability of bridge failure due to flutter. The limit state function is established as a function of the resistance variable given by the critical flutter speed and the load variable which is the extreme wind speed for a given return period at the bridge site. Three approaches based on the first order reliability method have been used in calculating the failure probability of the Yangpu bridge, a cable-stayed bridge with a main span of 602 m in Shanghai, China, as a numerical example.

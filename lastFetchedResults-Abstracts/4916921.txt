Based on improved AHP method and information entropy, a new nonlinear-objective programming model of combination determining weight is presented. In view of the grey information in the optimal selection of reconfigurable assembly line multi-objective scheduling, a decision-making model based on fuzzy grey relational analysis is proposed, and evaluation criterion of decision-making is constructed by the close degree of grey relation between decision vector and ideal reference vector which can make the results reliable and credible. Finally, this method is demonstrated to be reasonable and effective by a simulation example.

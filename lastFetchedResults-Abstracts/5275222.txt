A new architecture for implementing unidirectional and bidirectional self-healing interoffice ring networks using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology for growth is proposed. The working ring uses all-optical drop-and-add multiplexers at each office and the protection path uses optical amplifiers and optical switches. The use of WDM technology, combined with all-optical drop-and-add multiplexers, accommodates growth to a network capacity of more than 1 Tb/s

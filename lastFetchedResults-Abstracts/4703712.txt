This paper reviews the current practice of designing traffic signal systems, identifies shortcomings in the current procedures, and proposes using real-time simulation to provide students with a realistic laboratory experience. The paper takes the position that many of the shortcomings in current signal design practice are the result of a discontinuity between conceptual signal system models and current practice used for implementing those models. If engineering curricula are going to be developed that address this problem, it is essential that students obtain significant hands-on experience with deploying traffic signal controllers in a realistic environment. The authors of this paper advocate a real-time experience to achieve that objective

The objective of this paper is to investigate and analyze the transition criteria from interfacial to pullout failure mode in AHSS resistance spot welds during the tensile-shear test by the use of both experimental and analytical approaches. Spot welds were made on three dual phase steel grades including DP600, DP780 and DP980. A low strength drawing quality special killed (DQSK) steel and AISI 304 austenitic stainless steel were also tested as a baseline for comparison. The microstructure and mechanical strength of the welds were characterized using metallographic techniques and the tensile-shear testing. Correlations among critical fusion zone (FZ) size required to ensure the pullout failure mode, weld microstructure and weld hardness characteristics were developed. It was found that critical FZ size increases in the order of DQSK, DP600, DP980, DP780 and AISI304. No direct relationship was found between the tensile strength of the base metal and the critical FZ size. It was concluded that low hardness ratio of FZ to pullout failure location and high susceptibility to form shrinkage voids are two primary reasons for high tendency of AHSS to fail in interfacial mode. HAZ softening can improve RSW mechanical performance in terms of load bearing capacity and energy absorption capability. This phenomenon promotes PF mode at smaller FZ sizes. This fact can explain smaller critical FZ size measured for DP980 in comparison with DP780. The results obtained from the model were compared to the experimental results and the literature and a reasonable agreement was obtained.

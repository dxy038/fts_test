In this paper, a routing protocol to provide an enhanced multicasting service to mobile hosts in IPv6 based networks is proposed. The main purpose of the algorithm is to reduce both the number of multicast tree reconstructions and multicast service disruption time. The proposed multicast routing protocol is a hybrid method using the advantages of the bidirectional tunneling and the remote subscription proposed by the IETF Mobile EP working group. The proposed scheme satisfies the maximum tolerable transfer delay time and supports the maximum tunneling service. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol has better performance in the number of multicast tree reconstruction and the time of multicast service disruption than the previous protocols does.

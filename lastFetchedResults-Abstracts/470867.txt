Objective
The study was designed to assess the impact of 6 months of Balint training on self- and faculty-assessed measures of professionalism in obstetrics and gynecology residents.
Study design
Pre- and post-Balint training resident self-assessment and pre- and post-training faculty assessment using standard professionalism instruments were used to compare the resident Balint group to the group that did not participate. Participating residents also completed a qualitative assessment of the experience.
Results
Residents who participated were enthusiastic regarding the value of Balint in promoting self-reflection and gaining insight into self- and patient-care issues, both key components of professionalism. There were no significant differences in self or faculty assessment of professionalism between residents who participated in Balint and those who did not.
Conclusion
Six months of Balint training was successful in providing resident education in professionalism, measured by resident self-report. No differences were detected on 2 measures of professionalism between the training and control groups.

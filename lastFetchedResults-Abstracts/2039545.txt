Background & Objective: Clinical efficacy plays an important role in clinical knowledge and skill application. One of the ways to increase self-efficacy is using experience, and results of clinical research. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of evidence-based education on nursing students' self-efficacy.
Methods: This experimental study was conducted on 48 nursing students in their 3rd semester in Urmia University of Medical Sciences, Iran. The study subjects were selected using convenience sampling and randomly divided into 2 groups of intervention and control (n = 24). Considering the students ' training in the orthopedic ward, the intervention group participants were divided into 8 groups. Students in the intervention group were trained in evidence-based education in 2 sessions each lasting 2 hours. Self-efficacy was evaluated before and after training in the control and intervention groups using the generalized self-efficacy (GSE) scale. Data were analyzed using SPSS software, and chi-square, t-test, Mann-Whitney test, and Wilcoxon test. Data were analyzed using confidence interval of 95 Â± 2%.
Results: Of the students, 33.3% were female and 66.7% male. Mann-Whitney test showed the self-efficacy of the intervention group students to be significantly higher than control group students (P  <  0.001). No significant differences were observed in the control group.
Conclusion: Evidence-based education causes greater improvement in self-efficacy in comparison to conventional methods. Therefore, the use of this method is recommended in clinical education.

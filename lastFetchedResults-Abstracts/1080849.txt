The paper presents preliminary results of the Project LIFE04 ENV/GR/000099, related to the pressures and impacts analysis at the river basin of Anthemountas, located in Thermi, Thessaloniki, according to the provisions of Article 5 of the Water Framework Directive. The methodological approach developed and applied involves the determination of parameters related to point sources of pollution (e.g. population, industrial production, emission factors etc.) and non-point sources (e.g. agricultural) by using information on emission factors from the relevant activities in the area as well as geomorphological and hydrological conditions. Impact analysis requires the application of numerical approaches that will enable the prediction of key quality parameters, which, in combination with available monitoring data, can assist the evaluation of the likelihood that a water body will fail to meet the objectives of good status. Due to lack of biological indices, the evaluation is mostly based on chemical parameters and some eutrophication related biological indices such as algae. In the study area most of the pollution is related to agricultural practices and the predominant impacts are related to eutrophication and nitrates in the groundwater. It was concluded that only 10â€“15% of the water bodies can be identified as not being in danger of failing the good status objective.

Model predictive control (MPC) enables to handle multi-objective optimal operations and control in various kinds of process controls. In fact, simultaneous optimization of stability, quality constrains and economical optimality, sometimes it fails into ldquoinfeasiblerdquo solution. Then a supervisory control function in the hierarchical MPC configuration is proposed. It evaluates sensitivity of optimization and controllability in sense of ldquocontrol degrees of freedomrdquo and adjusts the control system structure as multi-input and multi-output closed loop system to be feasible. It realizes a kind of automatic ldquoPlug and Playrdquo function for control input. Some numerical simulations for general blending control in material process are evaluated to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

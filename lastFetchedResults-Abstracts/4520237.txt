The objective of this research work is to investigate the reliability of RFID in logistics systems. Starting from a general introduction of passive UHF RFID systems, the application of these systems in logistic systems and the technical challenges that are faced during application are discussed. Based on these discussions the set-up of RFID performance test is discussed and performance indicators are given. Finally typical results of readability tests are presented and conclusions are drawn on how to determine the reliability of the application of RFID systems in logistic systems

Summary
ilot study compares the results of medications calculations carried out by student nurses using an online assessment tool with the results of the same calculations carried out within simulated practice. The numeracy project, of which this is part, is funded by NHS Education for Scotland (NES).
ive
t the efficacy of a realistic computer-based assessment of pre-registration nursesâ€™ medication calculations skills by comparing outcomes from using an online assessment tool with a practical assessment tool in the style of an Objective Structured Clinical Examination OSCE. Both assessment methods used medicine calculations usually presenting authentically in the practice setting.

i-stage quantitative study using a cross-over design.

early 3rd year students on the adult branch of a pre-registration nursing programme at a large school of nursing in England.
s
s showed that, for assessing accuracy of calculation, there was a high level of congruence between the two methods.
sions
erised assessment of medications calculations using this particular platform is likely to closely mirror assessment of medication calculations done in a practical setting. As such it could be a useful adjunct to current assessment methods.

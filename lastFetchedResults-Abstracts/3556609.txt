Our mixed-reality platform helps train surgeons in minimally invasive surgery and objectively assesses their performance. The platform uses multicamera stereo inside a patient manikin to measure the 3D positions of unmodified surgical instruments. It uses this information to drive a mixed-reality, computer-mediated learning system and provide objective measures of surgical skill.

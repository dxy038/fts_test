The objective of this study is to improve the quality of life for the visually impaired by restoring their ability to self-navigate.

This device, constructed entirely from commercially available parts, enables the user to perceive distant objects via a different sensory modality. Preliminary data suggest that this device is useful for object avoidance in simple environments

Background: Adipokines such as Vaspin and Nesfatin have different biological roles and may be in relation to cardiovascular and hypertension related diseases. 
Objective: To investigate the effects of 12 weeks aerobic exercises on plasma levels of Vaspin and Nesfatin in hypertensive elderly women.
Methods: In this study, 30 elderly women with hypertension were randomly assigned to control and experiment groups. The training program included aerobic exercises which were conducted increasingly, 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Blood samples were taken before starting the exercise training and also 24 hours after the last training session. The data analyzed using the dependent and independent t-test for comparisons within and between groups.
Findings: Number of control group was 15; Age 56.10±9.8 years; Systolic blood pressure 13.10±0.87mmhg; Diastolic blood pressure 7.89±0.56mmhg, number of experiment group was 15; Age: 55.10±6.08 years; Systolic blood pressure 13.28±1.36mmhg; Diastolic blood pressure 7.76±0.78mmhg. After 12 weeks significant changes in serum levels of the control group was observed, increase in Vaspin and reduction in Nesfatin but there was no significant change of the serum level in the experiment one.
Conclusion: The results showed that the stimulation threshold is different in each adipokine compared to others and the 12 week aerobic exercise, has been prevented a significant increase of Vaspin or a significant reduction of Nesfatin.

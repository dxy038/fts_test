The technology of knowledge-based systems and expert systems, respectively, can already look back upon a fairly long &#8220;tradition&#8221;. However, as far as the practical implementations of knowledge-based systems in companies are concerned, it has only been a few years since a certain increase in use has become noticeable.

A particular emphasis lies on the collection of empirical data

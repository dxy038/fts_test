In this paper the H<sub>&#8734;</sub> methodology is applied to control design for a stall regulated wind turbine drive system operating at variable speed operation. It is considered a wind energy conversion system (WECS) supplying an infinite bus through static power converters. The main objective is to maximize the wind energy capture providing a reduction of detrimental dynamic loads. The weighting functions are chosen using the loop shaping concepts. The performance of proposed control structure is analyzed through simulation results

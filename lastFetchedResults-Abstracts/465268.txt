OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to examine clinical, microbiologic, serologic, and laparoscopic findings associated with perihepatitis.
STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective study of 157 women with a clinical diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease, 27 women with laparoscopically confirmed perihepatitis and salpingitis were compared with 46 patients with salpingitis alone.
RESULTS: Both current use or a history of ever using oral contraceptives was negatively associated with perihepatitis (p = 0.05 and p = 0.008, respectively). Moderate-to-severe pelvic adhesions were present at laparoscopy significantly more often in the perihepatitis-salpingitis group (70%) than in the salpingitis alone group (35%, p = 0.003). Antibody to the chlamydial 60 kd heat-shock protein at â‰¥0.5 optical density was detected in 67% of the perihepatitis-salpingitis group and in 28% of the salpingitis alone group (p = 0.005), and the median titer was significantly higher in the former group (p = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Compared with women with salpingitis alone, patients with perihepatitis-salpingitis do not have distinctive clinical or microbiologic findings but do manifest a higher prevalence of moderate-to-severe pelvic adhesions and both a higher prevalence and higher titers of antibody to the chlamydial heat-shock protein-60.

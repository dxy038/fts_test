With the increasing requirement to mitigate the problems of interference between users and electronic jamming, a reconfigurable pattern antenna is one of the solutions to resolve the problems. To switch radiation pattern in azimuth plane around a flat antenna, a Yagi patch antenna operated at higher mode is proposed. A bidirectional pattern using higher mode square patch is used as a driven element and electromagnetic-coupling with a parasitic element serving as a reflector provides a unidirectional pattern. The radiation pattern can be switched by switching feed-probe positions. Simulations were carried out at 2.45 GHz to find appropriate dimensions and validated by measurements.

Underwater wireless communication is an emerging technique in the field of communication. It is used to transfer data between underwater instruments. Electromagnetic signals are highly attenuated in the ocean because of their higher frequency. Sound waves on the other hand, propagate very well in underwater. Underwater communication is very challenging since the underwater channel contains various disturbances in the form of noise. It is observed that the noise due to wind has major role in affecting the underwater acoustic signals. The objective of this paper is to denoise the underwater acoustic signals affected by wind driven ambient noise. A new mathematical model has been developed for wavelet denoising. This new denoising method is based on the modified universal threshold value estimation method and new thresholding method. This method reduces the ambient noise content in the denoised signal and improves the SNR of the signal.

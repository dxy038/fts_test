This paper presents some methods for making comparisons between standards and items undergoing calibration. These methods may be used in a variety of measurements. The purpose is to accumulate data that provide objective estimates of the precision and that are also useful in detecting sources of systematic errors. This purpose is achieved in using some standard statistical designs in the scheduling of the work program. The problems of stating the uncertainty and of combining the uncertainties in a chain of calibrations are discussed.

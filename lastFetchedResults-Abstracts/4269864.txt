In the next generation cellular mobile multimedia networks, a resource allocation policy, which prioritizes handoff requests over new calls while making efficient use of the network resources, will be an essential component for successful operation. In this paper we develop a new handoff prioritized scheme which adapts the allocation policy according to the current traffic conditions. The goal is to minimize the new call blocking while keeping the handoff failures close to a targeted objective. This problem is formulated as a constrained semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) with average cost criterion. A simulation-based learning algorithm is developed to determine a control policy from direct interaction with the network without a priori knowledge of the network dynamics or traffic. Extensive simulations test the effectiveness of the algorithm under a variety of traffic conditions. Comparisons with other resource allocation policies, such as complete sharing and channel reservation, are presented

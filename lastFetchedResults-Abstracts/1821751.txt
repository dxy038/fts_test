Objective
esent study was designed to examine how oestrogen regulates proliferation, osteoblastic differentiation, collagen synthesis and periostin gene expression in primary human periodontal ligament (hPDL) cells.

ort interfering RNA (siRNA) technique was used to inhibit oestrogen receptor beta (ERÎ²) expression hPDL cells. hPDL cell were isolated and fully characterized. A colorimetric assay was applied for the determination of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). An ELISA kit was used to detect osteocalcin (OCN) levels. Collagen synthesis was determined by measuring the incorporation of L-[3H] praline. RT-PCR was performed to detection of periostin mRNA relative gene expression.

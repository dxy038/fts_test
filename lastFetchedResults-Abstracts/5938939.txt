The overall objective of the network security situation assessment is to establish security situation assessment system. This system can unify the large-scale network. First, it provides a security policy unified the whole network. It also provides the techniques for wide-area situation assessment. At the same time this system provides situational awareness and decision support tools for the implementation of network security command. Firstly, the information model of security situation was studied based on XML. Then the security situation value of system including three levels: service, host and network was analyzed and calculated. The-support vector regression machine was chosen for predicting the network security situation and determined the parameter values. Finally, the effectiveness of the method was verified through experimental analysis.

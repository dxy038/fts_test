This paper proposes a numerical model describing the transient behaviour of dielectric liquid of one-carrier pulsed injection. The main objective is the establishment of the mathematical model and presentation of the methods of its resolution to study the transient evolution of the potential, the charge density, the current density and the charges speed under DC high voltage. The model is based on PoissonÂ´s equation, transport and continuity equation. The resolution of this system is done with numerical methods namely finite differences and Euler methods. The results bring a good description of the transient charges transport for one-carrier pulsed injection under a DC high voltage.

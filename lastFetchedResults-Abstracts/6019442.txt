This paper is discussing about the collection of informations for military operations at the command level. A variety of sensors are available then, with different characteristics and ranges. The command is interested in helpful tools for the planning of these sensors. According to such objective, this work deal with the optimal covering of the requested information by the sensors. Inspired by the human operator methodology, it is based on a geometrical formalism of the sensors. A method based on the cross-entropy algorithm is proposed for optimizing the locations and geometrical parameters of the sensors in order to maximize the track covering

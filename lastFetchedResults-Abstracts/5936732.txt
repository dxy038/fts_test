A sophisticated impedance measurement technique, using an automatic digital ac bridge, is developed which is capable of providing fast and accurate real life measurement. The measurement technique employs LMS algorithm to achieve fast balance in real time. The present paper proposes to employ an intelligent neuro-fuzzy based accuracy improvement module for the LMS bridge. The objective of the neuro-fuzzy system is to add a synthetic phase offset to improve accuracy of the phase measurement in real life. The neuro-fuzzy system is successfully trained by employing particle swarm optimization (PSO), a relatively new combinatorial metaheuristic technique. The success of the proposed technique is effectively demonstrated by employing the bridge in real life for a variety of unknown impedances under measurement.

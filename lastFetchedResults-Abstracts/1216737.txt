Rolling schedule not only determines the rolling process to be going smoothly, but also affects the shape accuracy and structure properties of finished strip. In order to gain good strip crown and flatness, the calculation formulas of the most suitable rolling force and bending force are deduced. By taking relatively equal load of rolling power and good shape as objective functions, the optimization mathematical models of finish rolling schedule are established. By contrast, the rolling schedules after optimization can improve the rolling mill working status and ensure the strip crown and flatness to be good. At the same time, the setting value of bending force is improved and this leaves more space for on-line shape control.

In the need to consider the problem of preferences made by policy-makers in the process of performance evaluation when dealing with data envelopment analysis (DEA), the model of weight determination is built based on gray relational analysis and characteristics of the target level of analysis. Through linear weighting function to determine the right target General weight, this method reflects the implementation of the Decision-makers´ preferences and the role of the authoritative experts´ subjective experiences, as well as the relationship between the decision-making project itself and the objective. The rationality and effectiveness as well as its application advantage are demonstrated in the process of simulation analysis and comparison of the integrated preference weights of the DEA model in the comprehensive evaluation in students´ learning effects.

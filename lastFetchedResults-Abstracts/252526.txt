The objective of the present investigation was the determination of the
melting temperatures of the eutectic compounds Fe–C, Co–C, and Ni–C. Six eutectic
fixed-point cells of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) (Fe–C1, Fe–C2,
Co–C1, Co–C2, Ni–C1, and Ni–C2) and two cells of the Brazilian National Metrological
Institute (Inmetro) (Fe–C1V and Ni–C1V), useable for the calibration of contact
thermometers, were investigated. Their melting temperatures were calculated by
extrapolation of the emf-temperature characteristics of four stable Pt/Pd thermocouples,
which were calibrated at the eutectic fixed points and at conventional fixed points
of the IInternationalTemperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90).On the basis of the eight eutectic
fixed-point cells and seven independent calibration runs, the melting temperatures of
the Fe–C, Co–C, and Ni–C eutectics resulted in 1153.67±0.15◦C, 1323.81±0.27◦C,
and 1328.48±0.20◦C, respectively, with expanded uncertainties corresponding to a
coverage factor of k =2

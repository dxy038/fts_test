In this study the state-of-the-art extended particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods for solving multi-objective problems are represented. We emphasize in those, which use the co-evolution technique of the parallel vector evaluated PSO (VEPSO), analyzed and applied in a multi-objective problem of power systems. Specifically, reactive power control is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem and calculated using parallel VEPSO algorithm. The results are compared with those given by another multiobjective evolutionary technique demonstrating the superiority of parallel VEPSO

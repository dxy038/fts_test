A generalized multi-objective model is presented for minimizing the range of lateness and makespan on a multiprocessors job scheduling problem. It is proved that this job scheduling problem is an NP complete problem. So a heuristic algorithm is given to solve the scheduling problem. The numerical example illustrates that the heuristic algorithm is designed very well and can find very good approximate optimal solution

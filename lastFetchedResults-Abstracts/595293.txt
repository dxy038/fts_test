Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability of dynamic standing balance in individuals with and without low back pain (LBP) using Biodex Balance System (BBS). Material and Methods: Twenty three patients with LBP and 20 age-matched healthy subjects participated in this study. Bilateral and unilateral stance both with eyes open and eyes closed with the BBS over a period of 20s was assessed. The subjects were assigned to two groups (with and without LBP) by an independent observer. The tester was unaware of the group assignment and completed balance test using BBS. Two days after the first measurement session, the tester retested the subjects in the second measurement session in a random order, different from the first measurement session. Results: The results of this study showed that the intra-class correlation coefficient in normal subjects and those with LBP was between (0.91-0.95) and (0.88-0.96) respectively. The results showed that BBS is reliable for evaluating dynamic postural balance in subjects with and without LBP. A significant difference was found in Medial-Lateral Stability Index (MLSI) and Overall Stability Index (OSI) between subjects with and without LBP. Conclusion: The findings of this study showed high reliability for BBS to evaluate dynamic postural balance in subjects with and without LBP.

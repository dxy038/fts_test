This work presents the numerical investigations on the physical limitations and optimization of the nonlinear amplifying loop mirror (NALM) as a regenerator of phase-shift-keyed signals. The NALM consists of a bidirectional amplifier and a highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF), combined to a loop by a fiber coupler. The transfer functions for the NALM versus dispersion for an amplifier gain for anomalous and normal dispersion were studied. It should be mentioned that beside the nonlinear chirp, the NALM also causes spectral broadening and pulse shape distortions. Amplified spontaneous emission from the NALM amplifier is comparably lower and therefore negligible as a source of optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) penalty.

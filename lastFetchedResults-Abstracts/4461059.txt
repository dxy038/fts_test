Multiple description coding (MDC) can be used as an error resilience (ER) technique for video coding. In case of transmission errors, error concealment (EC) can be combined with MDC to reconstruct the lost frame, such that the propagated error to the following frames is reduced. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm based on a multi-hypothesis decoder (MHD), to improve the reconstructed video quality of MDC over packet loss networks. Both subjective and objective results show that MHD can help to achieve a better video quality than a traditional EC algorithm.

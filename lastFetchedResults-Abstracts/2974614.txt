Reports a technique for studying synchronization. A general mathematical technique is developed for investigating synchronization among many subsystems of a system. The frequency-wavenumber spectrum is explored to derive an objective measure of the synchronization coefficient (SC). The problems concerning the correlation and coherence methods of quantifying synchronization are solved by this technique. The technique is validated by various simulation studies and is then applied to a biological system: the brain, for electroencephalogram (EEG) synchronization. The usefulness of the technique is demonstrated for eight channels of electrocorticogram (ECoG) data recorded from one row of a subdural grid. The technique has the potential of being an objective measure of synchronization in general and of brain synchronization in particular. The principle of the technique may be applied to any system for investigating synchronization

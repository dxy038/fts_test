In this work, we study the topology enhancement problem of wireless sensor networks. Our research focuses on reducing the path-based vulnerability. The objective is to get as much information as possible for any target moving out of the surveillance area. We study intelligent targets that have the knowledge of existing sensor distribution. Under such assumption, we find the vulnerable paths that rational targets would like to take and block these paths to enhance the network detection performance. Simulation shows that by adding only a few numbers of new sensors on specific positions, we can greatly decrease the vulnerability of a randomly deployed sensor network.

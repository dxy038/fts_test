Real-world supply chain system usually operates in an environment with various uncertainties in many aspects of which demand uncertainty is especially significant and common. Therefore, it plays an essential and crucial role to strengthen the systemÂ´s robustness by controlling these fluctuations especially due to demand uncertainty into a rational scope. This study concerning a dual-objective problem aimed at a profitable and efficient functioning status from the perspective of robust optimization. In addition, a scenario analysis was conducted where the numerical example with known probability was put forth to describe changing demand state to general operational plans for decision making, as well as, to contrast the outcome of robust optimization and traditional method which led to an exploration in tradeoff between robustness and optimality.

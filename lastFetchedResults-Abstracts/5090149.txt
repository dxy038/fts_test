Distribution companies try to meet different goals such as increasing profitability, reducing investment and improving reliability indices. Therefore, distribution network planning has converted into complex multi-objective optimization problems. Mathematicians and operation research experts have developed many methods which can be used for solving these problems. Despite all efforts to develop applicable approaches for these problems, there is still no general consensus on project selection policy. Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each network optimization strategy selection in pragmatic manner is the objective of current research. In this paper, many methods used in network planning and reconstruction were categorised into few groups such as weighed sum, pre-emptive and Chebyshev. After that, the results of using each method were compared. The result of this research corroborates the claim that the approach used for combining multi-objective distribution network problem objectives has great effect on its optimal result.

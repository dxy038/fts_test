Introduction: Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the main infectious diseases in developing countries. The early diagnosis of TB is important for reducing its mortality & morbidity. Therefore this study was conducted to evaluate diagnostic role of High Resolution Computerized Tomography (HRCT) in active pulmonary TB.
Materials and Methods: in a clinical trial study 114 suspicious patients (70 males and 44 females with mean age of 45 years old) in imam Khomini Hospital during 2003 were evaluated. HRCT was performed on all the patients by ARTX model of Siemens CT Scan. The results of HRCT were compared with Sputum & Bronchoalveolar Lavage, Smears and Sputum culturing. Then, HRCT sensitivity, characteristics, accuracy, negatively and positively informative value and its adaptability index and para- clinical methods were determined. The data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics.
Results: In this study 20 patients had positive HRCT and positive paraclinical tests. 2 patients had positive HRCT and negative paraclinical tests. One patient had negative HRCT and positive paraclinical tests, and 91 patients had negative HRCT and negative paraclinical tests. The results indicated that HRCT sensitivity, characteristics, accuracy, and its positively informative value were 95.2%, 97.8%, 97.3%, 90.91% and 98.91% respectively.
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that HRCT can be an important diagnostic method for rapid diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.

The industrial developments in the last two decades and the industry requirement for practical knowledge have made it necessary to reconsider the classical engineering curriculum in the universities in the Western Balkan Countries. A multidisciplinary approach with focus on project oriented education was introduced to fulfill the requirements of modern technological society and industry. Based on the industry demands and EU best practices, a project-oriented approach in mechatronic education was introduced in 4 Western Balkan Universities in the frame of a Tempus project. Two different approaches for introducing student projects as part of project-oriented education are presented. The first one is the project oriented module Pro8, designed to simulate the future working environment of mechanical and mechatronics engineers. The second one are Mechatronic Design Studios established in 4 WBC Universities with the main objective of supporting project oriented education.

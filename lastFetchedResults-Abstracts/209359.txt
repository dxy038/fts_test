Objective(s): To determining of sodium nitrite in susage and compasion with amount of standard and change
uf nitrite in the course of time.
Methods: For sampling, took action in thirty different time production (P<O.05) from every one of eleven
factory products that enter meat products to Semnan Province and samples transferred to laboratory. For
determining of nitrite was used from standard number 923 thai has been given by Iran standard office.
After the determining of nitrite concentration in samples was taken action respect estimation of confidence
space mean with P<O.05 in total samples and was analyzed meanings with amount of standard.
Results: In examination. of nitrite in products gave in susags A 54.5 and 55.16, in B 33 and 26.33, in C 7.9
and 7.73, in D 32.1 and 3 U3, III E 23.4 7 and 19.23, in F 54.9 and 48.77 and in C (Tehran) 36.17 and 25.7, in
H 19.3 and 13.57, in L 20.43 and 22.9, in K 39.8 and 34. in M 36.6 and 14.63 milligram III kilogram that
amounts of theirs with P<O.05 had very meaning different with amount of standard. In examination A
products for determining of time effect amount of nitrite gave in first, seventh, tenth, fourteenth day in
manner 50, 43, 42, 39 and in F products in first, seventh, fourteenth in manner 52, 51, 42 milligram in
kilogram.
Conclusion: In products of A, D, F. B, E, G, C. H, K, L, M, amount of nitrite was lower than standard and
was not problem in this products.
Also with examination one sample of products two factories in different times was distinguished that amount
of nitrite decreases in meat products in the course of time.

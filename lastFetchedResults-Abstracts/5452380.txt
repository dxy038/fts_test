The objective of this work was to improve the quality life of a person with a disability, resulting from the amputation of a hand (wrist disarticulation), through the development and construction of a prototype of robot hand myoelectric; that means, that can to command by EMG signals (electromyography), but with the advantage that imply his construction to local level, because it avoids resorting to the importation of similar technology devices. Certainly the development of a technological prototype at a national level is not easy and our case was no exception, because was confronted several difficulties during the process, especially economic and the availability of some components; however, although all the inconveniences the prototype MROBI (Intelligent Robot Hand), became a reality. In the development of the same, three areas were fused to be exact, electromedicine, through analog channels constituted by instrumental amplifiers, which are responsible for the registration of biosignals, the development of software, both of microcontrollers, core processing (DSP) and subsequent control of the robot hand, as well as of the software of the PC for the monitoring of the biosignals registered and, Finally, the Mechatronics with the design and mechanical construction of the robot hand. Obtained as a result in a prototype of the three-fingered hand and wrist rotating, which can be commanded by pulses of EMG signal, each finger has a force sensor (FSR) to control the pressure exercised by the hand over the objects.

Background: Contrast sensitivity is an important aspect of visual function and is even more
important for ordinary daily tasks than visual acuity. Contrast sensitivity function may be
deteriorated to a significant level in diabetic retinopathy, especially in diabetic macular edema. The
objective of this study was to determine the impact of macular laser photocoagulation—as the
standard treatment of clinically significant macular edema—on contrast sensitivity function.
Methods: In a prospective noncomparative interventional case series, 17 patients with
clinically significant bilateral macular edema and no history of prior macular laser
photocoagulation were enrolled. Baseline visual acuity, contrast sensitivity function, and
fluorescein angiography were obtained and reassessed three months after macular laser
Results: Clinically significant macular edema resolved in 22 (65%) of 34 eyes, three months
after their first session of macular laser photocoagulation. The mean pretreatment visual acuity
was 24.5/40 (0.21 logMAR) ±10.3/40. Three months after macular photocoagulation, visual acuity
remained stable in 19 eyes, decreased in 12 eyes, and increased in three eyes. The mean posttreatment
visual acuity was 24/40 (0.24 logMAR) ±10.8/40. There was a statistically significant (P =
0.02) decrease in visual acuity following laser therapy. In subgroup analysis, this decrease in
visual acuity was only observed in those with unresolved clinically significant macular edema. The
mean contrast sensitivity threshold increased in all spatial frequencies by three months after
macular photocoagulation. The maximum rise was observed in the frequency of 6.4 cycles per
degree in the mid range of frequencies, with a pretreatment mean of 9.41 dB and a post-treatment 
mean of 11.50 dB (P<0.05).
Conclusion: Contrast sensitivity function improved after macular laser photocoagulation in clinically significant macular edema patients.

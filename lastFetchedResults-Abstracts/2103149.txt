Marek's disease (MD) is an immunosuppressive and proliferative disease of domestic chickens caused by a highly oncogenic cell-associated alpha-herpesvirus, named Marek's disease virus (MDV). Despite the availability of highly efficacious vaccines for control of MD and existence of lines of chickens which display differential genetic susceptibility or resistance to this disease, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of MDVâ€“host interactions. The recent advent of global or targeted gene and protein expression profiling has paved the way towards gaining a better understanding of host responses to MDV. The main objective of this review is to discuss some of the recent advancements made in relation to elucidating the mechanisms of MDV pathogenesis, host responses to MDV, genetic resistance/susceptibility to MD, and immunity conferred by vaccines. In this regard, particular emphasis has been placed on studies employing proteome and transcriptome profiling approaches. Finally, the utility of microRNA and RNA interference (RNAi) technologies for functional analysis of genes, proteins, and pathways that play a role in the complex interactions between MDV and its host is discussed.

A new diversity technique is proposed to combat Rayleigh fading in digital mobile radio systems transmitting speech signals. The speech signals are &#956;-law PCM encoded ( <img alt="\\mu = 255" src="/images/tex/11916.gif"/> , 8 kHz sampling, 8 bits/code word, 64 kbit/s data rate), and alternate data words are used to form two streams called "odd" and "even." The even stream is delayed by &#964; seconds and the streams are interleaved prior to radio transmission using two-level PSK modulation. At the receiver the odd data stream is delayed by &#964; and interleaved with the even stream. Consequently, if an error burst occurs, the effect of the reshuffling of the data stream is, in general, to place words with bit errors in juxtaposition to those correctly received. After &#956;-law PCM decoding of the words, a statistical error detection strategy is evoked to identify the erroneous samples. These samples are replaced by adjacent sample interpolation to give the recovered speech sequence. No recourse to channel protection coding is made. In our experiments a Rayleigh fading envelope was generated from a hardware simulator and stored in a computer, along with four sentences of speech. The system was then simulated and the recovered speech perceived. The objective performance measures were segmental SNR for the audio signal, and BER. Different error detection strategies were examined and restrictions on &#964; investigated. For a mobile speed of 30 mph, SNR values of 32, 21, and 16 dB were obtained for BER values of 0.1, 1, and 2 percent, corresponding to SNR gains over an uncorrected system of 3, 9, and 11 dB, respectively.

We introduce a stochastic model for dialogue systems based on Markov decision process. Within this framework we show that the problem of dialogue strategy design can be stated as an optimization problem, and solved by a variety of methods, including the reinforcement learning approach. The advantages of this new paradigm include objective evaluation of dialogue systems and their automatic design and adaptation. We show some preliminary results on learning a dialogue strategy for an air travel information system

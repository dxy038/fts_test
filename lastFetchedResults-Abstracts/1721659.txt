Jellyfish are a major problem to swimmers and a plague to fishermen. Presently, jellyfish are removed from the sea using a separator system and the jellyfish waste is discarded. Thus, the objective of this work was to produce bio-gas from Aurelia aurita using anaerobic digestion. Batch anaerobic studies were conducted to examine the effect of pre-treating waste jellyfish and using the waste for anaerobic hydrogen and methane gas production. Using this approach, jellyfish waste could be changed into renewable energy. The effects of sludge heat, sonication and freeze treatment on hydrogen and methane gas production in batch experiments were evaluated. The optimal treatment condition was determined to be freeze treatment at −70 °C for 20 min. The total amounts of hydrogen and methane gas produced from sludge that was heat treated for 20 min at 65 °C were 270 and 1640 mL/L, respectively. In addition, the total amounts of hydrogen and methane gas produced from sludge that was sonicated for 20 min at 25 kHz were 275 and 1670 mL/L, respectively. The total amounts of hydrogen and methane gas produced from sludge that was freeze treated for 20 min at −70 °C were 310 and 1800 mL/L, respectively.

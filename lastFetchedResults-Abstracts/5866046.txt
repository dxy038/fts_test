This paper presents a method to optimize motion from human motion for a humanoid robot with physical limits. Using the optimization scheme, objective functions incorporate spatial similarity with manipulability to preserve salient characteristics of trajectories, whereas constraints focus on representing angle, collision, velocity, and dynamic force as B-spline coefficients. To refine precision, in regions of high-frequency motion not adequately modelled by an initial splining, B-spline is extensible into a hierarchy so that optimization that meets global criteria can be performed locally. The proposed method will be shown to be effective in robotics and computer graphics applications.

The actual flexible job-shop scheduling problem usually involves multiple objectives optimization, more than one resource constraint and uncertain operation time. The model of dual-resource multi-objective flexible job shop scheduling problem, which considers dual-resource constraints of machines and workers and uncertain operation time constraint, is established, and it takes delivery satisfaction, cost, energy consumption and noise pollution as the optimized objects based upon the actual situation of flexible job shop. Then, an algorithm that combines grey simulation technology and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is designed according to the character of the model, and the algorithm process is presented.

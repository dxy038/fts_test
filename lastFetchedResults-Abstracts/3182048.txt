Actually, the ant colony optimization could search the best path that has only one path objective. It would be difficult to be adopted, because in the real case, the supply path has multi objectives. It is a need to improve the ant colony optimization for multiobjectives case. The objective of this paper is improve the ant colony optimization for solving multi objectives based supply path problem by using fuzzy ant colony optimization. The developed multi objectives fuzzy ant colony optimization was used to search the most optimum path of palm oil based bioenergy supply chain. The method was validated and verified with a real data set and the finding was analyzed and discussed.

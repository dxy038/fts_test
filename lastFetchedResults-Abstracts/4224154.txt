Engine design starts with parametric cycle analysis. This paper focus on design cycle analysis of a turbofan engine with Interstage Turbine Burner (ITB). The ITB, which is located between the high and low pressure turbine, i.e., transition duct . The objective of parametric cycle analysis (On-Design) is to compare the engine performance parameters (specific thrust and thrust specific fuel consumption), to design choices (compressor pressure ratio, fan pressure ratio, bypass ratio) between with and without ITB. The ITB engines are shown to provide significantly higher specific thrust with small increase in specific fuel consumption compared to conventional base engines. And then, the ITB engines also widen the operational range of flight Mach number and compressor pressure ratio. To simulate the on design cycle analysis for this paper, visual C++ language program will be used.

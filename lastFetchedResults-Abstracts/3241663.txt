A cultural algorithm, rooting from simulation of evolution of human being society, provides a new computable framework of evolution algorithms. A novel cultural algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was proposed in this paper. With the advent of the grid, task scheduling in heterogeneous environments becomes more and more important. After analyzing the model of grid scheduling problem, the CPSO algorithm was presented to solve the resource scheduling problem in grid computing. The optimal objective is to minimize the total completing time. The improved algorithm can keep all the advantages of the standard PSO, such as implementation simplicity, low computational burden, and few control parameters, etc. Simulation results demonstrate that it can be superior to the regular PSO. We also tested the CPSO algorithm with the Max-Min method to show the algorithmÂ´s efficiency.

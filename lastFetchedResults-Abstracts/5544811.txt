Urban off-road park facilities layout planning is an important component of the parking system planning and an integrated system engineering issue with multi-index and multi-constraint. This paper includes the study of the organizational mechanisms of parking facilities layout form and analysis of all factors that impact the public parking facilities layout. In this paper, the author established the simplified model of multi-objective optimization of the parking facilities site considering the highest social benefit of their layout. The Intelligent Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm is introduced to solve the model.

Objective: Our purpose was to assess the effect of age on the incidence of significant pathologic findings in patients with atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance. Study Design: This retrospective study evaluated nonreferred patients with Papanicolaou smears showing atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance over a 5-year period. Results: Two hundred eighty-one women (91%) with Papanicolaou smears showing atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance were available for follow-up. Significant abnormality was found in 90 subjects (32%), including 31 women (11%) with cancer. Older patients (â‰¥50 years old) have lower odds of high-grade cervical dysplasia (odds ratio = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.32-0.40) and higher odds of uterine cancer (odds ratio = 12.88; 95% CI: 1.78-567.60) compared with younger patients. Conclusions: Women with Papanicolaou smears showing atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance have a 1 in 3 chance of having significant abnormality. Evaluation includes colposcopy, endocervical curettage, and appropriate cervical biopsies. Patients >45 years require endometrial biopsies. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;184:1457-61.)

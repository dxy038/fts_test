This paper discusses about the use of low cost digital camera or known as non metric camera as photogrammetry tool for speeding up the process of acquiring aerial data. Digital camera can also be categorized as non metric camera. In photogrammetry, digital camera has been used for many diversified applications either in aerial photogrammetry or close range photogrammetry. The digital camera also has the potential to be used for landslide mapping and monitoring. In this study, a low cost digital camera has been used to acquire digital images of a simulated model build from sand and cement (dimension of 1m &#215; 3m) which represent some form of topographic surface. In the simulated model, an area was excavated to simulate landslide occur in the area. The acquired digital images of the simulated model were then processed using photogrammetric technique to the final photogrammetric output that is the digital orthophoto. The digital camera used is of high resolution and suitable for large scale mapping which does not involve large study area, require moderate accuracy and limited budget. The objective of this study is to investigate the capability of a low cost digital camera in generating three dimensional models, digital elevation model (DEM) and finally the digital orthophoto. The other objective of this study is to investigate whether the data captured using the digital camera can be used for volume determination that was excavated from an area in the simulated model. The results of the study showed that the low cost digital camera is capable of producing digital orthophoto and capable of determining the excavated volume of the simulated model.

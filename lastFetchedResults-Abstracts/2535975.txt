One of the main challenges for manufacturers in production systems on order is balancing between orders, inputs and limited resources. Hence, they have to choose some orders and reject the others. In addition, work schedule must be considered in order acceptance. In this research the integrated problem of scheduling and order acceptance in a no wait flexible flow line production system is discussed. In this study orders that canâ€™t be delivered in due date are rejected . Most researches are single objective optimization but in real world different objectives should be considered in the decision making. Therefor a biobjective model which maximizes profit and minimize delivery deviation, is presented. Due to the high complexity of the model, the exact methods are not able to produce the optimal solution , so the two meta heuristic algorithms MOSA and NSGA II for this problem were developed and their performance were compared through quantitative indicators in three different categories.

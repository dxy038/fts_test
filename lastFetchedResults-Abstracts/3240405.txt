The purpose of this study is to understand the electrophoresis of Titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) nanoparticles during electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique. This research was focusing on the effect of pH on the deposition behaviour of Titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) nanoparticles during electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique. The ceramic substrates were prepared by using commercial ceramic filter. The TiO<sub>2</sub> suspension were prepared by using non-aqueous solvent of alcohol and been characterized using Zeta sizer Nano series. The EPD was performed at 5V pulse-DC for 10 minutes. The deposited TiO<sub>2</sub> were then been analyzed by using Field Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM). It was identified that the IEP was at pH 2.36 and cathodic deposition were observed at all pH except for pH 2. This study has achieved its objective where the different behaviour of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles deposit was identified respected to vary pH. Future works will directed to increased the stability of TiO<sub>2</sub> suspension by using poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) for the same goal.

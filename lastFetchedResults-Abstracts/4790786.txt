This paper presents a Monitoring System for Xiaoqushan Seafloor Observatory in the East China Sea (XSOMS) to remotely monitor and control in situ multidisciplinary equipment performing individual and cooperative tasks. The monitoring architecture of XSOMS is first introduced, which contains three main components enabling bidirectional information flow of data and commands. Based on this, XSOMS is designed and developed utilizing socket, component, multithreading, and other programming technologies. The implemented XSOMS has been applied to the operational Xiaoqushan Seafloor Observatory and has demonstrated for its satisfactory usability and performance. Given this successful engineering trial, the proposed XSOMS design could be applicable and beneficial for similar efforts in future construction of seafloor observatory network both at home and abroad.

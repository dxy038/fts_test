Tradition reversing engineering technology is widely used to find security vulnerabilities of binary programs. However, it calls for human participation and relies on the analyzersÂ´ experience. In this paper, we propose a fault localization method based on bidirectional-slicing technology to help find the codes that cause the exception. This method develops novel optimizations on the traditional dynamic slicing and can obtain the key instruction sequences that lead to the exception efficiently. This method is proved to be efficient by both known and unknown vulnerabilities.

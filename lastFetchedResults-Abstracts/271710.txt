The objective of this paper is an analytical and numerical study of the dynamics and dynamic instability
of a slider!crank mechanism with an inextensible elastic coupler[ Special attention is given to the phenomena
arising due to modal interactions produced by the existence of multi!component\ speci_cally two!component\
parametric resonance[ Such modal couplings are very common in the bending!bending motions of _xed:
rotating beams[ The two!component parametric resonance occurs when one of the natural frequencies of
~exible parts of the mechanism is one!half or twice of the excitation frequency and simultaneously the sums
or the di}erences among the internal frequencies are the same\ or neighboring\ as the frequency of excitation[
The e}ects of two!component parametric resonance post on instability condition are also investigated[
Resonance generated by more than two component modes are neglected due to its remote probability of
occurrence in nature[ The mechanics of the problem is Newtonian[ Methods of analysis will consist of the
dynamics of small deformations superimposed on the undeformed state[ Without loss of generality and
based on the Euler Bernoulli beam theory\ the coupled nonlinear equations of motion of a slider!crank
mechanism with an inextensible ~exible linkage are derived[ The Newton|s second law is used to obtain the
boundary constraints at the piston end[ Galerkin|s procedure was used to remove the dependence of spatial
coordinates in the partial di}erential equations[ The method of multiple time scales is applied to consider
the steady state solutions and the occurrence of dynamic instability of the resulting multidegree!of!freedom
dynamical system with time!periodic coe.cients

One of the ways to influence the others is understanding the motivations of individuals. A motivation that could vary in different personality. One of the psychological issues in having effective communications with others is the understanding of human personality. Regarding that one of the human mind's products seen in nature is Architecture, therefor, maybe it would be possible to find a way to seek personality in architecture then try to understand and communicate with it. If we could raise this idea in human societies that each building creates its own objective character in architecture that presents different essence by having the same roots, perhaps it could have been paved a way to enrich the character of architectural monuments.
What is the buildings character? How could it find its roots in a building in order to emerge, and help it to grow in nature and become familiar just like wild Buttercups? Does it require an understanding of phenomenon, the motivation of presence and the influence on the reason of presence?
The attempt of this paper is to consider the role of cultural affairs and environmental factors in shaping the character of an architectural work with an emphasis on the phenomenology of Husserl suggesting the localization of existence and to obtain a clear definition of the architectural character in the process of communication. This article is theoretical and used the analytical method of research. With reference to texts and documents related to the keywords, we tried to analyze and describe the study and understanding and perception of the author from the texts and documents.

The objective of this study is to present the principles of a novel optical imaging technique, based on all active, multispectral, multifusion, spectral subtraction polarimetric imaging principles, for efficient interrogation of targets surrounded by scattered media, for biophotonics, defense, surface defects, semiconductor wafer inspection and monitoring. The novelty of the imaging principles consists in fusing spectral difference detection principles, with Mueller matrix polarimetric imaging principles, and Stokes polarization parameters. The experimental results indicate clearly that, high-contrast Stokes parameter polarimetric backscattered light spectral image differences, such as degree of linear polarization (DOLP) images, can be obtained from targets embedded in scattered media.

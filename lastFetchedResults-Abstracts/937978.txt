The objective of this paper is to devise a way to facilitate the use of fixed air monitors data in order to assess
population exposure. A weighting scheme that uses the data from different monitoring sites and takes into account
the time-activity patterns of the study population is proposed. PM2.5 personal monitoring data were obtained within
the European EXPOLIS study, in Grenoble, France Ž40 adult non-smoking volunteers, winter 1997.. Volunteers
carried PM2.5 personal monitors during 48 h and filled in time-activity diaries. Workplaces and places of residence
were classified into two categories using a Geographic Information System ŽGIS.: some volunteers’ life environments
are seen as best represented by PM10 ambient air monitors located in urban background sites; others by monitors
situated close to high traffic density sites Žproximity sites.. Measurements from the Grenoble fixed monitoring
network using a TEOM PM10 sampler were available across the same period for these two types of sites ŽPM10back
and PM10prox .. These data were used to compute a translator parameter  i that forces the measured PM2.5 personal
exposures ŽPM2.5persoi. to equate the average PM10 urban ambient air concentrations Ž PM10back PM10prox   2.
measured the same days. Average   was 4.2  g m3 ŽCI   3.4; 11.9 ., with true average PM personal exposure i 95% 2.5
being 36.2  g m3 Ž28.2; 44.1.. PM ambient levels at the proximity site and at the background site were respectively 10
PM  43.8  g m3 Ž37.1; 50.6. and PM  37.0  g m3 Ž31.8; 42.3.. In order to assess the consistency of this 10prox 10back
approach, six scenarios of ‘proximity’ and ‘background’ environments were accommodated, according to traffic
intensity and road distance.  i was estimated for the entire EXPOLIS population and for subgroups, using terciles
based on the percentage of time spent in proximity by each subject. Other similar studies need to be conducted in
different urban settings, and with other pollutants, in order to assess the generalizability of this simple approach to
estimate population exposures from air quality surveillance data.

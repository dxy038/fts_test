This work deals with satellite sun sensor placement using genetic algorithms. For a simplified but realistic problem scenario, this problem is solved and many simulation results are shown. The proposed methodology, which relies on numerical shadow analysis and multi-objective optimization, is discussed and a typical satellite design problem, that is frequently solved by a try-and-error approach, is converted into an optimization problem that can be solved automatically.

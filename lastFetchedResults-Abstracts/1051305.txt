The main objective of the present study was qualitative and quantitative assessment of anchovy stock, Clupeonella engrauliformis in Iranian waters of the Caspian Sea during (1995-2011). Over this period, total catch of anchovy kilka increased from 32000 tonnes in 2005 to 67000 tonnes in 1999 and decreased sharply to 80 tonnes in 2011. In the years 1995-1999, catch per unit effort (CPUE) was fairly constant (2.92-3.52 tonnes/(Vessels×Nights) which fell to 0.01 tonnes/(Vessels×Nights) in 2011.  Total biomass and spawning stock biomass (SSB) had the same trend as CPUE. During 1995-1999, total biomass of anchovy kilka ranged between 158500-185900 tonnes which dropped to 2000 tonnes in 2007. The SSB showed a downwardtrend from 105500 tonnes in 1997 to 1950 tonnes in 2007. In age compositions of the catch, age 3+ was the largest age group. From 2001 to 2003, age 2+ predominated. Finally, number of young specimens declined and age 6+ and 7+ groups were predominated in the last years. Present study indicated that the situation of the anchovy kilka is critical. A coordinated international effort is needed to provide implementation of sustainable management and responsible fishing activities in the whole Caspian Sea.

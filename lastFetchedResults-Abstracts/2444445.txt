Self-immolation is a high risk behavior and a way of life termination. Self-immolation, as the most painful of all forms of suicide, is not a common form of suicide in European countries. However, it is highly prevalent in developing countries particularly in Asia and Africa. The aim of this study was to assess the rate and leading factors of self-immolation and gender, geographical distribution, and social norms of affected patients referred to Khatamolanbia Hospital of Zahedan from March 2010 to May 2012. This descriptive and objective-based study was cross-sectional and retrospective with 750 burn patients; 315 of them had attempted self-immolation and most of them died. The data collection tool was a two partite questionnaire consisting of 17 questions (8 questions about personal details and 9 questions about self-immolation factors). 350 self-immolations resulting in death were reported in this study; these subjects were 16-25 years old, 67.25% female, 63.55% elementary school education, 74.20% married, 69.10% housewife, 61.05% resident of Saravan, 93.35% oil burns, 72.30% middle and low social class, 90.20% burn over 68%, 20% psychiatric illness history and being treated with antidepressants, 73.25% verbal and physical violence before burning, and 100% of the burnings took place inside a house and usually during the afternoon. Due to the high rate of self-immolations in this area, solutions for improvement of life quality and social norms should be reviewed and implemented.

The objective of this work was to investigate the possibility of montmorillonite/N-(carboxyacyl) chitosan coated magnetic particles (Mt/CACh-MPs) for the controlled delivery of drugs. Mt/CACh-MP was synthesized by hot intercalation technique to combine the advantages of biopolymer with clay. The drug delivery system was characterized by FTIR, SEM and XRD methods. Paracetamol was loaded onto Mt/CACh-MP for studying drug binding equilibrium, drug controlled release property and swelling property. The studies revealed that maximum loading of the drug is at pH 6.0 (84%). The drug binding isotherm fits the Sips model indicating multilayer adsorption. Mt/CACh-MP possesses high swelling capacity and can be effectively used in controlled as well as targeted drug delivery. In vitro release of paracetamol was affected by the pH of the medium and the release was found to be swelling controlled. These results demonstrated that Mt/CACh-MP was a new promising vehicle for controlled as well as targeted drug release.

GUI test automation is a trend, since (1) regression/sanity/smoke testing is one of the most potential areas to cut cost, which is the ultimate objective from the business perspective; (2) GUIs today constitute as much as 45-60% of total software code (Myers, 1995). GUI test automation, in essence, is to use development method to resolve test problem. It aims to replace manual operations by pre-defined test scripts, so that testing work can be laid more effectively and efficiently, more concentratively and less costly. In practice, automated test script will be written and executed to simulate human behavior such as mouse clicks or keyboard input to verify each function of system under test (SUT)

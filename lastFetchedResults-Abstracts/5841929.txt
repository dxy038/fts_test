We have developed a new auto-focus method using the image processing technology. This method consists of two steps. The first step is the preset of the objective lens condition with the feedback of Z-sensor. In the second step, the pattern recognition of a target hole pattern is performed prior to auto-focusing scan in order to scan E-beam accurately over the pattern. The measurement repeatability (3&#963;) can be achieved within 3.9 nm. The pass rate of 98.7% can be realized in the present auto-focus method

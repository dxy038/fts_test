Background. Management of newborns with interrupted aortic arch (IAA) remains challenging. Associated severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) have often led to increased mortality with neonatal biventricular repair. We review our experience with an alternative approach for this complex surgical problem.

Methods. From May 1991 to June 1999, 28 neonates were treated for IAA. Thirteen of 28 neonates (46%) had type B IAA, ventricular septal defect (VSD) and severe LVOTO (Z value –2 to –7; mean –5 ± 1.7). Mean age was 8 days (3 to 23 days old) with average weight of 3.3 kg (2.4 to 4.2 kg). Eight of 13 (62%) had anomalous right subclavian artery. Ten of 13 (77%) had thymic aplasia and chromosome 22 region q11 deletion. All 13 patients were treated initially with a modified Norwood procedure.

Results. There were no perioperative deaths. Complications included 2 patients with recurrent arch stenosis treated with balloon dilatation. Two patients had systemic arterial shunt revision. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 99 months old (mean 39 months). There were 2 late deaths unrelated to any operation. Nine of 12 patients had a second stage palliation consisting of a bidirectional Glenn shunt. Six patients went on to have biventricular repairs (3 Ross-Konno, 2 Rastelli, 1 VSD closure with LVOT resection). One patient had a modified Fontan operation and 5 patients are awaiting potential biventricular repair.

Conclusions. Children with IAA and severe LVOTO may be managed by initial Norwood palliation with an excellent outcome likely. This initial “univentricular” approach has enabled eventual successful biventricular repair despite severe LVOTO.

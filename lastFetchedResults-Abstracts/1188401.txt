With the ultimate objective of enhancing the impact strength and weatherability of nylon 6 engineering plastic, blending with poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) was studied. In the absence of a compatibilizer the two polymers phase separate, resulting in a deterioration of the properties. Since poly(methyl methacrylate) is known to be miscible with PVDF, we evaluated poly(methyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid) (P(MMA-co-MAA)) of low methacrylic acid content as the compatibilizer. The carboxylic acid groups in the MAA units were expected to react with the end amino groups of nylon 6 forming block or graft copolymers, P(MMA-co-MAA)â€“g-nylon 6, in situ, which will function as the actual compatibilizer. The amount of P(MMA-co-MAA) added, the MMA/MAA composition and heat treatment time were varied to study their effects on the miscibility, morphology, and mechanical properties of nylon 6/PVDF blends. The enhancement of the compatibility of nylon 6 and PVDF by addition of P(MMA-co-MAA) and the partial miscibility of nylon 6 and PVDF has been confirmed through DSC, dynamic mechanical testing, SEM of fracture surfaces, and tensile testing. The decrease in the crystallization temperatures on addition of compatibilizer in DSC experiments suggests that the compatibilizer enhances the interaction between the two components and retards the crystallization. The dynamic mechanical thermal analysis experiments suggest that the compatibility in the amorphous regions of nylon 6 and PVDF in particular has been enhanced. The increase in the heat treatment time in the molten state resulted in further enhancement of the miscibility. The enhancement of compatibility by addition of a reactive compatibilizer and heat treatment resulted in a significant increase in the energy of rupture in tensile testing.

This paper addresses the problem of voltage rise mitigation in distribution networks with distributed generation. A distributed automatic control approach is proposed to alleviate the voltage rise caused by active power injection. The objective of the proposed approach is not to control bus voltage but to guarantee that generator injections alone do not cause significant voltage rise: a solution in which distribution network operators (DNOs) are kept to their traditional task of voltage regulation for load demand. The approach is discussed in the perspective of effectiveness and adequacy. Its consequences to DNO control effort are evaluated. Illustration is provided for a single feeder with stochastic generation and transformer on-load tap-changing voltage regulation.

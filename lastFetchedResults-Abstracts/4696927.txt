Hybrid electrical energy storage (HEES) systems are comprised of multiple banks of heterogeneous electrical energy storage (EES) elements with distinct properties. This paper defines and solves the problem of scheduling multiple charge migration tasks in HEES systems with the objective of minimizing the total energy drawn from the source banks. The solution approach consists of two steps: (i) Finding the best charging current profile and voltage level setting for the Charge Transfer Interconnect (CTI) bus for each charge migration task, and (ii) Merging and scheduling the charge migration tasks. Experimental results demonstrate improvements of up to 32.2% in the charge migration efficiency compared to baseline setups in an example HEES system.

This study introduces an output regulation design methodology for a class of nonlinear systems with constant or dynamical biasing terms. First, the T-S fuzzy model is employed to represent biasing nonlinear systems about the operational point, which has the desired concerned output. Then, the control objective is transformed to stabilizing the new expressed fuzzy system. Next, based on the fuzzy representation, an output regulation controller is derived to achieve H-inf regulating performance. This design is parameterized in terms of a linear matrix inequality problem (LIMIP). Numerical simulation examples are given to verify the control performance of the proposed methods.

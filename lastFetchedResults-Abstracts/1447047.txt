Background and Objective: Mediastinal masses in children are a heterogenous group of
asymptomatic potentially life-threatening congenital, infectious, or neoplastic lesions that present
complex diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas.
Materials and Methods: The clinical and laboratory features of 65 patients who had open
biopsies in Ali-Asghar hospital over 11 years were reviewed.
Results: Seventy-two percent of cases were male and 28% were female. The age varied
between 2.5 months and 19 years. Eighty-four percent of lesions were malignant and 16% were
benign. Neurogenic tumors were the most common (36.9%). In order of frequency the following
lesions were the most common neuroblastoma (mostly in posterior mediastinum), Hodgkin’s
and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (mostly in middle mediastinum), and malignant small round cell
tumor (mostly in chest wall). Most patients were presented by fever (21.5%), dyspnea (20%)
and cough (12%), especially in Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Lymphadenopathy
(29.2%) and hepatosplenomegaly (13.8%) were the most frequent clinical signs. Laboratory
examination revealed anemia (29%), leukocytosis (35%), and high sedimentation rate
(21.5%).
Conclusion: The clinical presentation and laboratory findings of mediastinal and chest wall
masses are often non-specific and are variable, but according to their clinical data (i.e. age) and
location, only few important diagnoses should be considered.

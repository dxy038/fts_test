The objective of the model reference adaptive fuzzy control (MRAFC) is to change the rules definition in the direct fuzzy logic controller (FLC) and rule base table according to the comparison between the reference model output signal and system output. The fuzzy inverse model and a knowledge base modifier compose the MRAFC. Because of its improved algorithm, the MRAFC has fast learning features and good tracking characteristics even under severe variations of system parameters. The learning mechanism observes the plant outputs and adjusts the rules in a direct fuzzy controller, so that the overall system behaves like a reference model, which characterizes the desired behavior. In the proposed scheme, the error and error change measured between the motor speed and output of the reference model are applied to the MRAFC. The latter will force the system to behave like the signal reference by modifying the knowledge base of the FLC or by adding an adaptation signal to the fuzzy controller output. In this paper, the MRAFC is applied to a permanent magnet synchronous motor drive (PMSM). High performances and robustness have been achieved by using the MRAFC. This will be illustrated by simulation results and comparisons with other controllers such as PI, classical and adaptive fuzzy controller based on gradient method controllers.

The main objective of the reactor safety is to keep the reactor core in a condition, which does not permit any release of radioactivity into the environment. In order to ensure this, the reactor must have sufficient safety margins during all possible operational conditions (normal as well as accidental). To accomplish this, a study has been carried out, for the analysis of loss of flow accident (LOFA), which is one of the probable scenarios among other possible events such as reactivity-induced-accidents, loss of coolant accident, etc. The study has been carried out for Pakistan research reactor, PARR-1, which was initially converted from HEU to LEU fuel. It is a swimming pool type reactor using MTR type fuel. Presently, a new core is proposed to be assembled containing LEU and some of the used (less burnt) HEU fuel elements. The accident is assumed when the reactor is running at a steady-state power level of 9.8 MW. Computer code PARET and standard correlations were employed to compute various parameters. Results predict nucleate boiling in the core but the temperatures would remain far below the fuel clad melting point.

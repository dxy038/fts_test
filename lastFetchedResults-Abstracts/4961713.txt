The thermal management of electronic components will be challenging due to their continually rising of high heat flux densities but decreasing of sizes. The design of cooling equipments with simple configuration and high work efficiency is important for the whole system´s work safety. In this paper fin-fin heat sink´s work characteristics are calculated and the optimal design criterions are gained based on genetic algorithm (GA). A compositive optimization model that reflects the dynamic response and pressure drop traits is developed through the analysis of thermal capacity(C<sub>t</sub>) and time constant(tau). Finally, results for the equipment´s optimal design under different design strategies were got from the optimum calculation. Results show that optimization aimed at the compositive evaluate objective on the time constant tau and the pressure drop DeltaP of the heat sink can lead to satisfactory effects. These results may provide references to designers and further research on micro-electronic components´ cooling.

We focus on model-based networked control of general linear dissipative distributed parameter systems, the infinite dimensional representation of which can be decomposed to finite-dimensional slow and infinite-dimensional fast and stable subsystems. The controller synthesis of such systems is addressed using adaptive proper orthogonal decomposition (APOD). Specifically, APOD is used to recursively construct locally accurate low dimensional reduced order models (ROMs). The ROM is included in the control structure to reduce the frequency of spatially distributed sensor measurements over the network by suspending communication. The main objective of the current work is to identify a criterion for minimizing communication bandwidth (snapshots transfer rate) from the distributed sensors to the control structure considering closed-loop stability. The proposed approach is successfully used to regulate the thermal dynamics in a tubular chemical reactor.

The quality of service (QoS) will not be maintained when a communication link failed in a network. In order to assure reliable QoS requirements, a scheme to automatically reroute label switched paths is needed in MPLS network when communication links or routers failed. The time to recover a failed path is important to support the QoS guarantees by quickly rerouting connection. The objective of this paper focus on the analysis of recovery time when a failure path is detected. To analyze the recovery time, M/G/1 queueing model with capacity c is used. Using this model, we formulate the relationship among the failure rate of a routing path, the repaired rate to restore an alternative routing path or a protection path, and the number of availably alternative paths or protection paths to be planned.

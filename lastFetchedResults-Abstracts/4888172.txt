In this paper Hinfin loop-shaping design method as the frequency domain approach was applied to aero-engine control system to overcome the problem of lack of design transparency in the traditional time domain approaches. The controller design method should be carried out in the frequency domain, via selection of the Hinfin loop-shaping weights, open or closed-loop singular value plots were shaped to simultaneously meet performance and robustness specifications. In order to ensure maximize the robustness of the closed loop, multi-objective genetic algorithm was proposed to obtain the global optimum loop-shaping weights. The hardware-in-the-loop simulation based on the real-time simulation platform was carried out, and the results verified that the excellent performance of the Hinfin loop-shaping controller used for aero-engine controller, as well as the practicability of genetic algorithm used in the selection of weight functions.

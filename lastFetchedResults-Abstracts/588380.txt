SaebTabrizi is a great figure in Persian literature. He makes illuminating links between various issues by comparing the subjective themes to the objective phenomena. An important feature in his works is the use of children’s behavior to portray adults’ daily occupations. For instance, he uses playing games, turning over pages of a book, throwing stones at trees, running, crying, hugging one’s mother, and growing teeth to refer to negative aspects of adults’ daily occupations like wasting one’s life, bothering the wise, complaining, love, and superficial praying.  This paper is an attempt to explain how Saeb has employed features and activities that often associated with children to make moral and didactic points.

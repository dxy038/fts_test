This paper derives a production line capacity assignment problem with consideration of equilibrium requirement from the production in cold rolling area of Iron &amp; Steel Industry. The problem is characterized by multiple kinds of material supply with various available times. The task of the problem is to determine the utilized capacity of the production lines in cold rolling area in order to sufficiently utilize the capacity of the each production line and make the supply to each downstream production line equilibrated. To solve this problem, a mathematical programming model with non-linear objective function is formulated. Then it is linearized to a linear programming model which can be optimally solved by CPLEX. Finally, the performance of the proposed formulation is evaluated by the experiment results based on real operational data.

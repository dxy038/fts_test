A model for a transportation system in a manufacturing environment is presented and some relevant control problems are presented and discussed. The proposed model assumes that the transportation system consists of several vehicles whose movement is constrained to make use of a fixed network in the plant layout. An optimization objective is stated for the transportation system, decoupled from the control of the rest of the manufacturing system

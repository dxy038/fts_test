Lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoids that are selectively taken up into the macula of the eye where they are thought to protect against the development of age-related macular degeneration. Current dietary databases make it difficult to ascertain their individual roles in eye health because their concentrations in foods are generally reported together. The objective of this work is to determine the concentrations of lutein and zeaxanthin, separately, within major food sources of dietary xanthophylls as determined by NHANES 2001â€“2002 intakes. Corn and corn products were found to be major contributors of dietary zeaxanthin whereas green leafy vegetables were major contributors of dietary lutein. The predominant isomeric xanthophyll form was trans for all foods. Processed foods contained more cis xanthophyll isomers than fruits and vegetables. These data will provide added information to the current databases for lutein and zeaxanthin content of commonly consumed foods as well as enhance the validity of estimates of dietary intake of these xanthophylls and their respective contributions to health.

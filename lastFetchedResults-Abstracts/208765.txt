Over the last decade, evolutionary and meta-heuristic algorithms have been extensively
used as search and optimization tools in various problem domains, including science, commerce,
and engineering. Ease of use and broad applicability may be considered as the primary reasons for
their success. The honey-bee mating process has been considered as a typical swarm-based
approach to optimization. in which the search algorithm is inspired by the process of real honey-bee
mating. In this paper, the honey-bee mating optimization (HBMO) algorithm is applied to three
well-known mathematical problems. To demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm, these three
problems are chosen from well-known constraint and unconstraint mathematical problems with
continuous decision and state variables having all the complexities of optimization problems. The
proposed HBMO algorithm results in a feasible, near-optimal solution in an acceptable number of
mating flights. To emphasize the capability of the developed algorithm in handling these problems.
results are compared with those of a well-developed genetic algorithm (GA). Although the HBMO
algorithm is at the early stages of development the results obtained by the present algorithm are if
not better but surly equally convenient to those employing genetic algorithms. A real-world water
resources problem, in the field of water resources management is selected as a case study. The
developed model is applied to a reservoir with 60 operational periods with the objective function of
minimizing the root mean square error of release and demand. The results show that in this problem
the algorithm arrives at the global optimum which is gained by non-linear programming.
The results are promising and the algorithm arrives at the global optimum which is gained by nonIinear
programming.

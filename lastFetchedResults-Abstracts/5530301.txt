To enable the selection of methods in any domain, a detailed and context dependent performance description of the methods is required. In cases, where this description has to be generated by an evaluation, the introduction of context can be done cleverly without increasing the number of evaluation runs. However the more detailed performance evaluation delivers several objective entries for one test case. This results in a new type of problem, a multiple multiobjective optimisation. This paper presents a novel genetic algorithm and a novel performance metric that deals with the specific of this type of problem in a robust way.

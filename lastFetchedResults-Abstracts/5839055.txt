Binary sequences having good aperiodic autocorrelation functions (ACFs) with low range sidelobes are required for many communication applications. However, few such good binary sequences are available having large sequence length. In this paper nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is used to generate biphase pulse compression codes from length 49 to 100. Pulse compression technique avoids the transmission of a signal having small pulse width and high peak power for better range resolution. The efficiency of these codes depends upon the energy content in the range sidelobes of their autocorrelation functions. Peak sidelobe level (PSL) and integrated side lobe level (ISL) are the two performance measures for pulse compression codes. In this paper the multi objective problem is designed by taking PSL and ISL as the objective functions.

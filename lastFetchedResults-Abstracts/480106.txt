Background: Treatment for tobacco dependency involves a combination of behavioral therapy, antidepressants, and nicotine replacement therapy. This study was conducted in order to compare the outcome of smoking cessation by using each of the four forms of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) among participants using Trazodone tablet 50 mg.
Materials and Methods: In this non-randomized quasi-experimental study the efficacy of four mentioned forms of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) including patches, gums and microtabs and two forms of NRT together was evaluated. Smoking cessation while using Trazodone was also studied. All the smokers who referred to the smoking cessation clinic of Iranian National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (NRITLD), Tehran, Iran from Oct. 2005 to Oct. 2007 entered the study. They attended 4 weekly sessions followed by 2 sessions in the next 12 months. 
Results: A total of 286 subjects participated in this study. Trazodone was prescribed for them and 253 used at least one form of NRT. There were 181 (74.6%) males. The mean age was 42.43Â±13.4 yrs.
Thirty three cases selected nicotine patches, 99(39.4%) used nicotine gums, 64(25%) chose microtabs and 57(23%) preferred using two types of NRT simultaneously. A total of 152 participants (60%) quit smoking at the fourth session. At the fourth session, it was proved that nicotine patches had the highest success rate and were most efficient for quitting smoking (94%). Also, after 6 and 12 months follow-up it was found that nicotine patches were most effective for abstinence.
Conclusion: Nicotine patches used in combination with Trazodone tablets could result in higher success rates for smoking cessation.

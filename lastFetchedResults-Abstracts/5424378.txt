The field of wearable computing deals with a great deal of hardware, software and wireless communication collaboration. The objective of this research is to conduct two sets of experiments using wearable computers in clean room-type environments for education enhancement. Embedded instruction via a wearable computer is offered here to aid users in performing tasks which require a high degree of hand-eye coordination. By embedded instruction, we mean that the users "learn while they are doing." The results of the proposed experiments show how well people are able to perform specific tasks with a wearable computer versus without a wearable computer in clean-room type environments. These environments were chosen because they are places where manual procedural task are done and could benefit from the use of a wearable computer by increasing productivity and improving efficiency in training. Several aspects of human factors were analyzed and evaluated, as well as time improvements.

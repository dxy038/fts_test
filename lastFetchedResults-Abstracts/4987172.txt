This paper presents an analytical study on the outage performance of amplify-and-forward (AF) two-way relay system with multi-antenna relay node (RN). Two major bidirectional protocols, i.e., two time slots multiple access broadcast (MABC) protocol and three time slots time division broadcast (TDBC) protocol, are considered. For both considerations, we first assume that instantaneous channel-state-information (CSI) is unavailable at RN, thus RN just simply uses the fixed relay gain derived from statistical CSI to scale the received signals before forwarding. We then consider the scenario where RN can obtain the instantaneous CSI to perform the zero-forcing (ZF) relay precoding. The closed-form expressions of outage probability are derived for all cases. Based on these expressions, the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) is further obtained for the MABC protocol. The analytical results show that, for non-precoding MABC scheme, the diversity order is only 1, which is independent to the relay antenna number M. While for the ZF-precoding case, the diversity order of M - 1 can be obtained.

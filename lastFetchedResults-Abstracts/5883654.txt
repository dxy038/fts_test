In the paper, the analytical solution was got based on the heat transfer theory and seepage theory with the boundary conditions. The solution was proved effective and applied by a indoor testing with the same boundary conditions of the analytical solution. The indoor testing also showed that the permeability coefficient with the inverse method by the temperature field model testing inosculated the field measurement value well. It found that many subjective and objective disturbances can be avoided using the temperature field to detect the permeability coefficient.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess the value of the fetal middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity in the prediction of anemia within 24 hours of the death of one monochorionic twin in twin-to-twin-transfusion syndrome and to establish the correlation between middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity and hemoglobin concentration in fetuses who are at risk for acute anemia.
Study design
Doppler examination of the middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity was performed in 20 monochorionic survivors of pregnancies that were complicated by twin-to-twin-transfusion syndrome that occurred between 20 and 34 weeks of gestation. Doppler examination was performed before cordocentesis and after intrauterine transfusion when appropriate. Both hemoglobin concentration and middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity were expressed in multiples of the median. Severe anemia was defined as hemoglobin concentration of <0.55 multiples of the median, and we used the cutoff point of 1.50 times the median values at any gestational age to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity in detecting moderate or severe anemia.
Results
Fetal anemia was confirmed in 10 of 20 fetuses. We performed seven intrauterine transfusions. The sensitivity and specificity of middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity in the prediction of severe fetal anemia were of 90%, with a false-negative rate of 10%. The correlation between peak systolic velocity and hemoglobin concentration both before and after transfusion was evaluated by regression analysis and was strongly significant.
Conclusion
In fetuses who are at risk of acute anemia, the measurement of middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity was found to be a reliable noninvasive diagnostic tool and may be helpful in counseling and planning invasive assessment.

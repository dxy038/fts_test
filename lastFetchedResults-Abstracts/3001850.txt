The main objective of DfE is to give a support to develop environmentally friendly products. Thus, DfE must base on a very operative approach. A good DfE tool integrates environmental aspects directly in the product design process. DfE is, in the PE philosophy, a methodological framework which is to adapt to the specific needs of its application. Thus, e.g. a DfE tool in the automotive industry might need other functions and interfaces than a DfE tool in electronics industries.The paper gives an overview about industries needs concerning DfE tools, insight in existing DfE tools and the tells about actual development work to an integrated solution

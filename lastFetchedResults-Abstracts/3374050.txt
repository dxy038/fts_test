A traffic study and the results of a full scale simulation of the No. 3 ESS switching network are presented. Following a brief description of the network and the simulation techniques, the various parameters affecting network performance are discussed and the load-service curves are given for these parameters. In particular, the network capacity is studied for various numbers of concentrator groups and the differences between blocking probabilities of intraand interconcentrator group calls are discussed. The network is analyzed with different path-hunt algorithms. A path-hunt procedure, which yields a significantly higher average load per terminal (at objective service level) than any other tested, is found and discussed in detail. The results are first obtained for the case Where the network terminals are loaded equally. Then, the effect of a nonuniform load distribution is studied and the results are shown.

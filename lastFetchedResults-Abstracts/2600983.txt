Introduction: Alzheimer is a neurodegenerative disease which is characterized by progressive memory loss, diminished cognitive ability and behavioral disturbances such as anxiety-like behaviors. Quercetin is a polyphenolic compound with antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. 
Objective: Purpose of this study is evaluated anxiolytic effect of quercetin and its nanocrystal in model of Alzheimer’s disease.
Methods: In this experimental study, forty-nine male rats were randomly divided into seven groups, as follows: control group (intact rats), vehicle (received distilled water orally and intrcerebroventricullary), disease (received 10µg/rat STZ intracerebroventricularly and distilled water orally) and disease treated groups (received quercetin and its nanocrystal at doses of 10 and 25 mg/kg/day orally for four weeks after injection of STZ). Elevated plus maze (EPM) test was used to assess anxiety- like behaviors.
Results: Results indicated that icv-STZ injection significantly decrease percent of open arm times (%OAT) and percent of open arm enters (%OAE) in the EPM test (P < 0.001) and treatment with the quercetin and its nanocrystal significantly increased these behavioral indexes in the end of third and fourth weeks (P < 0.001). Furthermore, treatment with quercetin nanocrystal increased %OAT and %OAE more than the quercetin.
Conclusion: This study showed the protective effect of quercetin and its nanocrystal in the prevention of anxiogenic-like behaviors induced by Alzheimer’s model of rat and treatment with quercetin nanocrystal was more effective than quercetin.

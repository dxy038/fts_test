Power allocation across users in two adjacent cells is studied for a wireless code division multiple access (CDMA) network with mixed voice and data services. We assume that each user has a utility function that measures the userÂ´s satisfaction, or utility, as a function of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Each particular service (voice or data) is associated with a different utility function. We consider the forward link. Our objective is to allocate transmitted power to maximize the total utility summed over all active users subject to rate and power constraints. We show that the maximum utility can be achieved with a pricing scheme. We characterize the solution to a one-cell utility maximization problem with fixed interference from the other cell. For two-cell utility maximization, the two cells must cooperate to achieve the maximum utility.

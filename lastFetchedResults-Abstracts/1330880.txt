The freezing process is widely used in the food industry. In the 70s, French regulation authorities have created in collaboration with the food industry the concept of «surgélation» process with the objective of improving the image of high quality frozen foods. The process of “surgélation” which could be translated as “super freezing” corresponds to a freezing process for which a final temperature of −18 °C must be reached “as fast as possible”. This concept was proposed in opposition to a conventionally “freezing” process for which no specific freezing rate is expected and the final storage temperature can be of −12 °C only. The objective of this work is to propose a methodology to evaluate the mean amount of frozen ice in a complex food as a function of temperature and to deduce a target temperature that must be considered as the temperature for which the food may be considered as “frozen”. Based on the definition proposed by the IIF-IIR red book, this target temperature has been defined as the temperature for which 80% of the freezable water is frozen. A case study is proposed with a model food made of two constituents.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of infantile adverse events from exposure through breast-feeding to maternal citalopram therapy.
Study design
This was a prospective, observational cohort study. Women who were breast-feeding were placed in three groups on the basis of citalopram use: group 1 consisted of 31 women who were depressed and were undergoing citalopram therapy, group 2 consisted of 12 women who were depressed but were not undergoing citalopram therapy, and group 3 consisted of 31 healthy women who were matched to group 1 by maternal age and parity. Data collection included infant feeding method, medication use, and adverse events.
Results
There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of adverse events in the three groups (3/31 events, 0/12 events, and 1/31 events in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The average dose of citalopram that was used in group 1 was 25.3Â±11.4 mg per day (range, 10-60 mg/d).
Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective, controlled study to examine the safety of citalopram during breast-feeding, which should be continued during maternal citalopram therapy.

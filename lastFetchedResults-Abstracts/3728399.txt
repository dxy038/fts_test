An Industry Assessment Study (IAS) was conducted to evaluate the present reliability of powerhouse motors and to identify design and operational characteristics which, through advanced development, offer the potential of increased motor, and therefore, power plant reliability. The primary objective of the IAS was to collect, analyze, and interpret candid, detailed information concerning motor application, operating factors, installation, manufacturer, failures and causes of failures. The survey data covers 6312 motors from 168 generating units representing 65 utilities. This data covers 40 percent of the population surveyed. The large quantity of data allows a meaningful analysis when it is broken down into smaller groupings.

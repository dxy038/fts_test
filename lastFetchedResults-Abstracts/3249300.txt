Manpower is driving up DoD costs while DoD budgets are shrinking; therefore the DoD customer seeks a solution to enable increased mission capacity along with staff reductions. One way to accomplish this is through an autonomous capability to support end-to-end mission activities. The Mission Information Autonomous Intelligent Decision Engine (MiAide) approach for meeting this objective is to create a system of systems (SoS) that work together to enable automation of tasks previously done by humans. MiAide is built upon a novel, but standards-based architecture, that equips MiAide for real end-to-end DoD mission scenarios using a context switching decision engine that distributes actionable information for each specific mission phase to an intelligent mission console (IMC) user interface. The IMC provides secure and high quality communications between mobile end-users and the Mission Operation Center, and it enables graceful handover between operators of different mission phases. MiAide has been demonstrated for aspects of both manned and Unmanned Air Systems (UASs) and proven to reduce staffing while improving mission capacity (e.g., multiply number of missions and mission functions) across all stages of the mission life cycle.

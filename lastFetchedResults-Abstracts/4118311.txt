Certain sensors such as IKONOS produce panchromatic and multispectral (MS) images at different spatial resolutions. Several efforts have been made to increase the resolution of these MS images using panchromatic image information. In this paper, we present a fast and efficient panchromatic sharpening method that accurately estimates missing high-frequency components. We also use a postprocessing technique to correct color distortion. Experimental results show that the proposed method produced high-quality images and outperformed existing panchromatic sharpening methods in terms of objective quality measures such as universal image quality index, <i>Q</i>4, relative average spectral error, Erreur Relative Globale Adimensionnelle de SynthE??se, and correlation.

| Introduction:
According to the definition given by the National Institute of Health, obesity is a chronic dis¬ease that may cause some other diseases in humans. Body mass index (BMI) is used for the evaluation of obesity. Obesity will be considered sever when BMI is over 40. In such cases, lipid disorders could be speculated.The objective of this study was to assess the frequency of lipid disorders in subjects with the BMI of above 40.Two hundred patients with the BMI of over 40 were entered in this prospective study. Their lipid profile including serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL and HDL were determined and correlated with the ratio of BMI and Waist to hip. The effects of other risk factors such as diabetes, pregnancy and osteoporosis on the subjects' lipid were also evaluated.The average age of the obese subjects was 40 years, ranging from 19 to 63. 81% of the subjects were female. The mean level of BMI was calculated as 44.42 ± 4.4 (40.04- 67.62). Additionally, the mean level of cholesterol, LDL and HDL were 244 ± 30.63,159 ±31.22and 33.95 ± 2.72mg/dl, respectively. As for the mean level of triglyceride, the findings of the study came up with an average of 168.69 ± 72.16 (72- 260).The frequency levels of abnormal LDL and HDL were found to be 81.5% and 100%, respec¬tively. The average ratio of Waist to hip was measured as 0.86 ± 0.2. 11.5% of the subjects were suffering from diabetes.The findings of the study suggest no significant correlation be¬tween diabetes, pregnancy or osteoporosis with BMI.Lipid profile in obese subjects showed abnormal cholesterol, LDL and HDL level that in¬crease the risk of cardiovascular events.

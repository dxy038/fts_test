Based on the theory of heat transfer and the constitution of drum brake, it was analyzed the process of heat creating and dissipating of drum brake, and the 3-D finite-element numerical simulation model of temperature was built. Taking the rear drum brake of a passenger car as the objective, software ANSYS was used to simulate the temperature rising process of braking drum in five continuous braking conditions. The three-dimension temperature distribution of braking drum was obtained, and the characteristics of transient thermal field were studied. Finally, the results provided guidelines for the further design and improvement of drum brake.

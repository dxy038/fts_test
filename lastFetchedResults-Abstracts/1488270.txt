The objective was to determine the shelf life of foal meat (Longissimus dorsi) stored in four different packages: (i) vacuum, (ii) overwrap and (iii) two modified atmospheres (MAP): high O2 MAP (80% O2 + 20% CO2) and low O2 MAP (30% O2 + 70% CO2) stored at 2 Â°C during 14 days. Shelf life evaluation was based on pH, colour, lipid and protein oxidation, microbial counts and sensory assessment of odour, colour and appearance. Based on aerobic bacterial counts, the shelf life of foal meat samples in overwrap and high O2 MAP packages would be 10 days at most, almost 14 days in low O2 MAP and more than 14 days in vacuum packaging. Scores for sensorial evaluation were unacceptable after 10 days of storage in samples in overwrap and MAP packs, but they were still acceptable in vacuum ones. Moreover, for all packaging conditions except vacuum, which remained constant, a decrease in redness (a*) and an increase in carbonyl content and TBAR'S values was observed with storage time. High O2 levels negatively affected foal meat quality, while anaerobic conditions extended shelf life to 14 days.

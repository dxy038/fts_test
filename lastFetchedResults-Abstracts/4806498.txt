In the article are analyzed the possibilities of the real-time data exchange between small mount device (SMD) &#8220;Assembleon Topaz X&#8221; and PLEX EPR information system. Main objective of the project was not only to design solution for the real-time data exchange for the SMD mentioned above, but also to design the standard applicable to all needful machines and PLCs in the factory which are or would be connected with PLEX ERP system (based on the proposed solution). The proposed solution and standard corresponds with the global aim - create extendable modular system for the real-time data integration of the production outputs, states and data with PLEX with all the benefits (e.g. extendibility, connectivity with the various systems and networks, connectivity with the various systems and networks etc.).

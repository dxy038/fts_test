Objective
This paper estimates the rates of lifetime nonreceipt of influenza immunization among elderly and examines variations in the lifetime nonreceipt of immunization by gender, race and ethnic group, socioeconomic status, access to health care, and health status.
Methods

Cross-sectional, nationally representative data on 5557 adults older than 50 years of age and living in the community from the 2000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey are used. Lifetime nonreceipt of influenza immunization was analyzed with bivariate and multivariate statistical techniques.
Findings

Thirty-one percent of the elderly reported never receiving influenza immunization and 20% reported irregular immunization. Higher odds of lifetime nonreceipt of vaccination and irregular vaccination were seen among African-Americans, youngâ€“old, current smokers, and those with no usual source of care.
Conclusions

Future campaigns to increase immunization rates should be tailored to target this hard-to-reach group of individuals.

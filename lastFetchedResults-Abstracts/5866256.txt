We consider optimal allocation of resources to users in a downlink OFDMA system to support heterogeneous applications consisting of both deadline-sensitive (DS) and best- effort (BE) users. Given the user rate-requirements and long- term statistics, the proposed persistent scheduling algorithm allocates the minimum resources to ´just´ meet the deadlines for DS packets. The remaining resources are optimally split to maximize a rate objective for BE users. We resort to a greedy- tone allocation algorithm to solve the optimization problem. By considering persistent scheduling instead of instantaneous scheduling, the proposed scheme´s complexity and required feedback overhead is significantly reduced, hence a practical algorithm for a real-system.

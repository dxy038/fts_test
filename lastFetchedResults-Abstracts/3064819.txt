The stochastic job shop static and dynamic scheduling has been analyzed in this paper. Based on the probability theory, an algorithm is developed to estimate the amount of scheduling-scheme. It has been pointed out that the actual amount have the scheme for process time based job shop scheduling is far less than the theoretical ones. The objective-functions of stochastic job shop scheduling have been analyzed and a multi-objective function has been developed. Considered the characteristics of stochastic and variable processing time, some scheduling rules and dynamic scheduling policies with variable criterions are proposed, which can more efficiently optimize the stochastic job shop scheduling effect than the traditional ones.

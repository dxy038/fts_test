Indoor wireless communication systems experience deep multipath fading due to the presence of people, antenna movement, and other environmental factors. The objective of this paper is to present results concerning envelope fading and large-scale attenuation properties of the signal based on narrowband measurements carried out at 21.6 and 37.2 GHz with and without antenna diversity. By using various transmitter-receiver arrangements in measurements which were taken over one floor of a university building, envelope statistics of received signal are produced with and without antenna diversity. It is shown that the statistical distributions follow the Rayleigh curve and hence a diversity gain close to 10 dB can be obtained for an availability of 99%. Power law exponents and wall loss factors are also calculated to assist in the design of future indoor radio systems in the millimeter frequency range

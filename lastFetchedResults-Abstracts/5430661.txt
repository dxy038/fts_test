The Characteristics-Analytic Hierarch Process model to determining attribute weights based on Topsis is built.This model makes fully use of Analytic Hierarch Process that has hierarchical structure and clear thinking, and uses AHP inversion methods to determine the weights of decision makerÂ´s preference. The model based on Topsis is used to selecting the characteristics group of AHP, which defines the distinctive characteristics of individual decision-making unit through the close degree and makes the determining the characteristics group has full objective basis. Thus, the subjectivity in this process has been avoided and the contradictions by more multi-index attribute to be overcome. Empirical practice and simulation analysis on evaluation of student learning show the advantage and applicability of this model on relative fields.

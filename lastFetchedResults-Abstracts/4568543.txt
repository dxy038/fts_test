However, in practical engineering, users may not always be interested in finding the so-called global best solutions, particularly when these Pareto-optimal solutions are quite sensitive to the variable perturbations, which cannot be avoided in practice. In such cases, practitioners are interested in finding the robust solutions which are less sensitive to small perturbations or noise in variables. In this paper, a new robust multi-objective optimization algorithm is proposed, where the emphasis is to find the robust frontier instead of the global Pareto-optimal frontier. In the proposed algorithm, the robustness preference of user is incorporated into the optimization process to guide the optimization. A series of simulations are presented to validate the feasibility of the algorithm. The results show that the algorithm has a good robust and preference performance.

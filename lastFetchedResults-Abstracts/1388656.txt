The objective of this paper is an analytical and numerical study of the transient dynamics of a beam–mass system carrying multiple masses moving along an initially curved beam. An attention is given to the phenomena arising due to the initial curvature, initial imperfection, of a beam and the motion produced by the existence of multiple moving masses.

thod used in the analysis is Newtonian. The mechanics of the interface between the masses and the beam is determined by modeling the masses as rigid bodies that are rolling on an initially curved flexible structure when the moving masses are set on motion. Based on the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, the mechanics, including effects due to friction and convective accelerations, of the interfaces between the moving masses and the beam are obtained.

 of present study shows that the initial curvature of a beam can result significant effects to the dynamics of the system even if the initial imperfection of the beam is small. The magnification of the amplitude of response of the system due to the initial deviation of beam depends on the initial speed of mass, the applied forward/retard force on the mass, and the friction between the mass and the beam.

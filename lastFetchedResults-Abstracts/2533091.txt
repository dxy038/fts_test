Background and Objective: High prevalence of parasitic infections can be the result of asymptomatic infections. A number of regular and ongoing epidemiological studies are prerequisites in order to control these infections. This study was carried out with elementary school students to achieve an overview of the spread of parasitic infections in Zanjan city, Iran.

Materials and Methods: In this crosssectional study, using random cluster sling, 854 of 612 yearold students were selected from 10 primary schools in Zanjan by three methods of direct smear, formalinether concentration and Scotch tape.

Results: Overall, 139 students (16.3%) were found to be infected by intestinal parasites. The protozoa Entamoeba coli (4.56%), Chilimastix mesnili (4.33%), Blastocystis hominis (3.04%), Giardia lamblia (2.34%), Iodamoeba butschlii (1.87%), Enterobius vermicularis (1.52%), Endolimax nana (0.46%), Dientamoeba fragilis (0.23%), Hymenolepis nana (0.11%), Sarcocystis (0.11%) were the most common parasite types. There was a significant difference in parasite prevalence between age and parentsrsquo  education. However, no significant difference was found with gender, family income, and residence.

Conclusion: The results indicated that the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in primary schools was in low level and in comparison with 1994rsquo s study in Zanjan city it has significantly decreased. With regard to the prevalence of intestinal parasites in study areas, improvement of health awareness among students and parents especially in the field of personal health seems necessary.

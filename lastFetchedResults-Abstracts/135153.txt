Introduction: Noise is one of the hazardous factors in work places such as textile industries. The objective of this study is to determine noise pollution in textile industries in Kermanshah (2001).
Materials & Methods: This study is an analytical-descriptive one. The study was done in 2 steps. In the first step the characteristics of the work place & buildings were completely determined; then according to the method of ISQ & NOISH; the buildings were divided in 2 *2 squares and the level of sound pressure was measured. The noise was analyzed and the SIL factor was calculated by using the results. In the second step, by using a chronometer, time was measured, job analysis was done and the Leq factor was measured. The results were compared with the standard by using Z statistical method.
Results: The results showed that the level of noise was 93.44+3.28 db, which was higher than the standard (P<0.05). This study also showed that the level of pressure of noise was high in frequencies of 500-4000 HZ. The level of speech interference in these industrial group was 78.51+2.3 and that of Leq was 87.9+3.23 which showed that the Leq)(actor was higher than the standard (P< 0.05).
Conclusion: According to the above results we can conclude that controlling noise pollution in textile industries is very important. The spectrum of noise showed that the level of interference of sound was high.

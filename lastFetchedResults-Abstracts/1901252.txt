We have shown that six different internal image antiidiotype antibodies (Ab2) raised against the combining site of the murine monoclonal antibody G250 (MAbG250; Abl), which specifically reacts with a human renal cell carcinoma (RCC)-associated antigen, induce antigen specific humoral and cellular responses in mice. These six Ab2 can be divided into four mutually exclusive groups: (1) NUH31 and NUH51, (2) NUH44 and NUH82, (3) NUH71, and (4) NUH91. Immunization with NUH82 or NUH91 resulted in Ab3 sera that gave complete protection against tumor challenge. In this study, we tested the antitumor efficacy of NUH82- and NUH91-induced mouse sera (Ab3 sera; Ab3-82 and Ab3-91) in mice with established subcutaneous human RCC xenografts.

ere treated 3 times per week by intraperitoneal injection of Ab3 sera (0.2 ml) or MAbG250 (250 Î¼g) for 6 weeks. Treatment of NU12 human RCC xenografts of approximately 20 mm3 expressed as tumor size index (TSI) with NUH-Ab3 sera or MAbG250 resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition compared with tumors treated with Ab3 sera from mice immunized with control immunoglobulin (Ab3-MOPC). In all Ab3-NUH treated mice, tumors stabilized or disappeared completely. In contrast, Ab3-MOPC treatment did not result in any antitumor effects. Tumor remnants in Ab3-NUH treated animals contained viable tumor cells surrounded by infiltrating mouse cells, whereas no infiltration was observed in control tumors. These findings demonstrate that Ab3 sera obtained from NUH82- or NUH91-immunized mice are very effective in eradicating established RCC [i.e., Ab2 vaccination may be able to eradicate (minimal) residual disease in RCC patients].

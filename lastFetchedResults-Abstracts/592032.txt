Background: Timely notification is of great importance in
health emergencies. So identifying the most important sources of
information used by people in emergencies seems necessary. The
objective of this study was to assess peoples’ level of awareness
concerning the symptoms, routes of transmission, prevention, and
treatment of H1N1 at the time of the pandemic and also to identify
their most important source of information.
Methods: Two telephone surveys were performed at the beginning
of levels five and six of the pandemic at a four?month interval on
two populations. Using a questionnaire, random phone numbers
were called and 662 and 701 individuals from Tehran were surveyed
at the two phases, respectively.
Results: Peoples’ level of awareness concerning the disease,
symptoms, its routes of transmission, prevention, and treatment
of H1N1 had increased in the second phase of the study. At the
same time, people were less afraid of the disease in the second
phase. The most important sources of information used were TV,
newspapers, and radio, respectively.
Conclusions: Mass media including TV and newspapers were
recognized as the most important sources of information used
by the people in emergencies. It seems that designing educational
programs and synchronizing the media’s policies with health
authorities can help fight future health emergencies and prevent
delays in notifying people.

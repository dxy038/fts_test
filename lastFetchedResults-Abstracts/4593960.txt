An air-flow meter, developed primarily for the measurement of air intake into an internal combustion engine, is described. The well-known process of corona ion deflection in a gas flow together with proper electrode geometry and a detection scheme provides the conceptual basis for a humidity-insensitive ionic air-flow sensor. Output characteristics of the sensor, such as response time and range of operation, are discussed and compared to those of a production hot-wire meter of the type that is currently used with electronic fuel injection systems. Unlike the hot-wire transducer, the proposed sensor is shown to allow for bidirectional measurement of the air flow. The transient response time of the ionic sensor is shorter than that of the hot-wire transducer.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

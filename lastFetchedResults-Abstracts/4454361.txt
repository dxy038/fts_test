In this paper, for speed control with torque ripple minimization of switched reluctance motor drives an optimal speed controller based on Elitist-Mutated Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (EM-MOPSO) with good accuracies, and performances is presented. The control mechanism is composed of an adaptive sliding mode speed controller to determine the appropriate current command and a hysteresis current controller. In the adaptive sliding mode controller, the heuristic parameters are usually determined by a tedious and repetitive trial-and-error process. By using EM-MOPSO, the trial-and error process is eliminated. The optimal parameters of adaptive sliding mode controller and turn-on and turn-off angles are chosen by applying a multi-objective function, including both Integrals Squared Error (ISE) of speed and torque ripple. The performance of this EM-MOPSO based controller has been demonstrated by simulation in MATLAB/SIMULINK software for a four phases, 4-kw SRM.

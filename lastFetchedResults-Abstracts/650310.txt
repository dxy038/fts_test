For the last few decades, over 200 papers have been published in the Cr(VI) biosorption research field. Most early studies have claimed that Cr(VI) was removed from aqueous phase through an anionic adsorption, but this approach has been lost old original position. It has been newly explained that these findings were misinterpreted due to errors in measuring the concentrations of different chromium species in the aqueous phase, insufficient contact time required for equilibrium and the lack of information about the oxidation state of the chromium bound to biomaterials. Although ‘adsorption-coupled reduction’ is now widely accepted as the mechanism of Cr(VI) biosorption by natural biomaterials, a number of researchers still believe that Cr(VI) is removed by anionic adsorption onto the biomaterials. Therefore, the objective of this study was to show reliable evidences that the removal mechanism of Cr(VI) by natural biomaterials is ‘adsorption-coupled reduction’. Sixteen natural biomaterials were used to study the Cr(VI) biosorption. Not only Cr(VI) but also total Cr in the aqueous phase were analyzed. X-ray photoelectron spectroscope was also used to verify the oxidation state of the chromium bound to the biomaterials. Finally, the removal behavior of Cr(VI) by each biomaterial was described by a kinetic model based on a redox reaction.

A new method for structural optimization is presented for successive
approximation of the objective function and constraints in conjunction with Lagrange
multipliers approach. The focus is on presenting the methodology with simple examples.
The basis of the iterative algorithm is that after each iteration, it brings the approximate
location of the estimated minimum closer to the exact location, gradually. In other words,
instead of the linear or parabolic term used in Taylor expansion, which works based on a
short step length, an arch is used that has a constant curvature but a longer step length.
Using this approximation, the equations of optimization involve the Lagrange multipliers
as the only unknown variables. The equations which depend on the design variables are
decoupled linearly as these variables are directly obtained. One mathematical example
is solved to explain in details how the method works. Next, the method is applied to the
optimization of a simple truss structure to explain how the method can be used in structural
optimization. The same problems have been solved by penalty method and compared. The
results from both methods have been the same. However, because of the long step length
and reduction in the number of variables, the speed of convergence has been higher in the
presented method.

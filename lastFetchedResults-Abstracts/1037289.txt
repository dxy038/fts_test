The objective of this present paper is an investigation of aging-impact coupling upon the polyester matrix E-glass fibers composite materials in hygrothermal environment. In the first part of the study, laminate composite plates were aged in an artificial hygrothermal environment using a climatic chamber at 50 °C temperature and 95% of relative humidity. The gravimetric readings showed discrepancy with respect to Fick’s law which indicates the non-Fickian character of the moisture absorption kinetics. The application of the Carter–Kibler’s model confirmed the Langmuir’s behaviour governing the absorption up to a lap time.

In the second part of the study, low energy impacts test were carried out on both aged and non-aged composite plates in a bending configuration on two metallic supports. The impact loads were applied using drop-mass tower. The mechanical responses of aged and non-aged plates such as impact force, bending, contact duration, energy dissipation and damage are highlighted and analyzed.

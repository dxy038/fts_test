This paper presents a discrete time–cost–environment trade-off problem for large-scale construction systems with multiple modes under fuzzy uncertainty. A multi-objective decision making model is established in which the total project duration is regarded as a fuzzy variable. To deal with the uncertainty, the fuzzy numbers in the model are defuzzified by using an expected value operator with an optimistic–pessimistic index. The objective functions are to minimize the total project cost, project duration, crashing cost, and environmental impact. Furthermore, a fuzzy-based adaptive-hybrid genetic algorithm is developed to find feasible solutions. The one-point crossover and repairing strategy for mutations are designed to avoid infeasible solutions. Finally, the Jinping-II Hydroelectric Project is used as a practical example to demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the model. Results and a sensitivity analysis are presented to highlight the performance of the optimization method, which proves to be very effective and efficient compared to other algorithms.

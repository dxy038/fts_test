An effective methodology for a robust global optimization of electromagnetic devices is developed based on the gradient index and multi-objective optimization method. The method transforms a given optimization problem into a multi-objective optimization one by adding another optimization target for minimizing the gradient index. The performance and robustness of the obtained optimal designs from the proposed algorithm are investigated through a numerical experiment with the TEAM Workshop Problem 22.

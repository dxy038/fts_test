As QoS-based resource management is becoming increasingly hot, the research on grid QoS plays a fundamental role in service-oriented grid environment. Grid QoS is classified into five categories in virtual organization layer in our early research. In this paper, we propose a kind of scheme to measure grid QoS based on this classification. In the scheme, the grid QoS parameters are quantified respectively. And QoS of grid application is put forward and the measurement model is applied to scheduling heuristics, so that grid QoS can be used as a critical part of a scheduling heuristicÂ´s objective function and to implement, analyze and compare resource management systems. Finally, we make a simple simulation and results indicate that applying the measuring model to scheduling heuristic as objective function can enhancing the performance of grid environments drastically

To acquire more accurate CT image segmentation results of gallstone, this paper presents a Lore-Based FCM algorithm to conquer the deficiency of tradition FCM method. A penalty term is introduced to objective function to enlarge the range of specified class and achieve higher segmentation accuracy. The result of simulation shows that Lore-Based FCM can obviously improve the segmentation quality. The improved algorithm is more rapid and efficiency than the traditional FCM.

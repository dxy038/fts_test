Background/objective
c polymorphisms in cytochrome P-450 (CYPs) and glutathione S-transferase (GSTs) genes can influence the appearance of tumors by the formation of new enzymes with altered activities. In the present study, 5 polymorphic variants were examined in 154 patients with prostate carcinoma and in 154 controls.
als and methods
alysis was carried out through PCR-based methods. The statistical methods used were odds ratio and confidence interval (95% CI), Ï‡2, Fisher, and Mann-Whitney.
s
udy showed absence of association for CYP1A1*2B, CYP1B1*2, GSTM1*0, and GSTT1*0. The statistical analysis implied a positive association of variant CYP3A4*1B for prostate cancer. The combined analysis of CYP1A1*2B, CYP1B1*2, and CYP3A4*1B genotypes showed positive association. The analysis of histopathologic parameters detected statistically significant differences for Gleason score and biochemistry recurrence risk. The presence of the GSTT1*0 genotype in red meat consumers increased the risk for this disease.
sion
olymorphic variants analyzed can influence the development and the progression of prostate cancer.

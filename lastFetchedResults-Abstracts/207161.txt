In this article the effort has been taken to define conspiracy as an objective act, a hidden planning and a series of measurement undertaken in an illegal, amoral and. usually violent way to achieve certain goals and purposes at the price of endangering others' interests and rights, while conspiracy theory is defined as the elaborative and subjective method to analyze events which is formed in conspiracy - minded individuals mentality and usually based on a speculation about conspirators' role. Three major components of the conspiracy theory are the conspirator, conspiracy -minded individual, assumptions and techniques of analysis which are discussed. Conspiracy theory is neither culturally, nor geographically bound, rather it is a universal phenomenon which has' been taken in different countries and cultures. I have tried to show the universality of conspiracy theory by collecting enough evidences from different countries. These evidences are quite prevalent in all countries, namely the assassination of JFK, extension of Aids virus, UFO, drugs distribution and the terrorist attack of September 11th in USA are events that are analyzed by some groups and individuals in America within the "analytical" framework. In England, death of George the first and Princess Diana in an automobile accident are the further examples of conspiracy theory which is discussed throughout the article. Some authorities in this field believe that the Middle East more than other countries is infected by the "analytical" framework. Finally the article conclude that conspiracy theory is a vast and universal phenomenon of varied shapes and types.

Presents a case study that evaluates two software quality attributes: performance and availability. We use three programs based on two architectural styles: pipe-filter and batch-sequential. The objective of this study is to identify the crucial factors that might have an influence on these quality attributes from the software architecture perspective. The benefit of this study is that early quality prediction can be facilitated by an analysis of the software architecture. The results from this study show that it is feasible to select a better architectural style based on variations in the execution environment to attain higher availability and/or better performance. Moreover, we demonstrate the effects of these variations on the quality measurements

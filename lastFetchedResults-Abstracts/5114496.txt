A new architecture of optical line terminal for fully colorless bidirectional wavelength division multiplexed passive optical networks is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. It is implemented by injection-locked Fabry-Perot laser diode and optical carrier suppression. Error free transmissions (bit error rate of 10<sup>-9</sup>) of both 1.25-Gb/s downstream signal and upstream signal are executed at three representative wavelengths (1530.364 nm, 1540.14 nm, and 1556.713 nm). Accordingly, both optical line terminal and optical network unit are colorlessly operated within 25 nm range.

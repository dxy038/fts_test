In this paper, the facility location problem with immobile servers is studied. In proposed model,
tow objective functions have been considered: (1) minimizing the average customer waiting time and
(2) minimizing the fixed cost of facility installation. The M/M/K queuing system has been used to
formulate the problem. Also Customers are assumed to visit the closest open facility. Simulated
Annealing algorithm with LP metric framework has been used to solve the proposed model. Several
examples are presented to demonstrate the applications of the proposed methodology.

The transformation of the US Army to the Objective Force will rely heavily upon the use of modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) for analysis, including assessment of our ability to fight in urban environments. Current model research for military operations in urban terrain (MOUT) is disjoint. Current models are judged to be insufficient as a foundation for simulation of urban operations. The Army Model and Simulation Office (AMSO) has formed a Focus Area Collaborative Team (FACT) to address these issues. The MOUT FACT directs all future urban operations modeling efforts to ensure that new simulations credibly depict MOUT. The MOUT FACT employs a top-down approach designed to (1) identify the best urban M&amp;S projects that will address prioritized deficiencies and (2) identify potential collaboration opportunities. This paper details the methodology employed by the MOUT FACT to develop the urban M&amp;S research plan and the results of its efforts to date.

The Scientific and accurate evaluation on enterprise´s compensation system can find out the key factor influencing compensation management efficiency. Appraising enterprise´s compensation system is a very complicated process, influenced by a lot of subjective factors and objective factors, while existing assessment methods are mostly the preliminary quantitative analysis, a lot of influencing factors are not simple good or bad, but have both bad aspects and good aspects, and having the great fuzziness and uncertainty. It is very difficult to draw an accurate conclusion by way of quantitative analysis. Fuzzy mathematics has incomparable advantages comparing with other methods in dealing with such fuzzy problem. Based on the basic principle of fuzzy mathematics, this research constructs evaluation index of enterprise´s compensation system from four respects: fairness, motivation, competition, economic. AHP method is used to determine the weights of the indexes. A theory model of appraising enterprise compensation system is set up. Its application is also exemplified. This appraising model provides theoretical references for enterprise human resources managers to measure quality of different salary system and establish improvement scheme.

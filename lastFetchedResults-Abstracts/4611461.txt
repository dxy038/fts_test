The introduction of new technologies to meet the growing demands of multimedia traffic is on the rise. To cope with this challenge, efficient mechanism is required on all TCP/IP layers. Therefore, this paper studies the performance of routing protocols over Wi-Media ultra-wideband (UWB). The objective of this study is to determine which routing protocol can better meet the quality of service (QoS) for multimedia traffic. The comparison made among three protocols, namely dynamic source routing (DSR), ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV), and temporally-ordered routing algorithm (TORA), respectively. The extensive set of simulations has been carried out for video streaming. The metrics used to evaluate the routing protocols are packet loss, throughput, average end-to-end delay, average jitter, and routing overhead. Simulation results and their analysis show that, when there is single source DSR routing protocol perform better QoS for video traffic in terms of higher throughput, the slighter average end-to-end delay, smaller jitter, and less routing overhead. However, in case of multicasting, AODV protocol proves to be the best choice..

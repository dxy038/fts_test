The objective of the present study is to develop montmorillonite (Mt) based PLGA nanocomposites for oral and controlled release carrier for an antidepressant drug, venlafaxine hydrochloride (VF). VF loaded CPN were prepared using double emulsion solvent evaporation technique. The synthesized CPN were compared with respect to morphology, particle size, physical status of VF and Mt and in vitro drug release to the corresponding biodegradable PLGA nanoparticles. Mt based VF-PLGA nanocomposites suggest the possibility of designing the oral and controlled release formulations to minimize the drug administration frequency and the occurrence of side effect thereby increasing the effectiveness of drug and hence improving patient compliance.

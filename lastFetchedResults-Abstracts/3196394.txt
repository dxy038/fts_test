This paper deals with a decentralized control of smart grid by using overlapping information for load frequency of power networks introducing distributed power generations. The control objective is to minimize the cost function of load frequency control problem. We expand the state space of the system of power networks and propose a decentralized state feedback control of subsystems for the expanded system. Then we contract the decentralized feedback law to match the original system. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the load frequency control by using the proposed decentralized control method through the simulation result of decentralized large scale power network systems.

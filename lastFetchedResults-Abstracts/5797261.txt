This paper presents an investigation of university-industry technology transfer in robotics and intelligent systems in Canada. The objective of the investigation was to determine which mechanisms for technology transfer are most effective and how to bring about an increase in effective technology transfer. This study shows that the most effective methods for transmitting and exploiting knowledge in the field of robotics and intelligent systems involve accessing the knowledge source directly (as opposed to acquiring the knowledge produced), building relationships, and focusing the research effort on a particular application or need. Strategies for increasing effective technology transfer include: involving industry in applied research, increasing industry R&amp;D investment, increasing funding for the most effective technology transfer mechanisms, and changing the university environment to facilitate, properly evaluate, and reward interaction with industry

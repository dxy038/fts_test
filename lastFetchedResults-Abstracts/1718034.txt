Objective
rpose of this research note is to explore the validity of college student samples for criminology and criminal justice research. Some scholars have suggested that college populations are comprised of individuals who are different from the rest of society and that the use of college students for social research may distort our theoretical understanding of crime and criminality.

tional Youth Survey is used to assess, college studentsâ€™ self-reported behaviors, frequency of behaviors, and attitudes in relation to the general population.
s
sults indicate that there is almost no statistically significant difference in behaviors and only minor differences in the frequency of behaviors and attitudes.
sion
ndings from this investigation suggest that while college students may be culturally unique, this uniqueness does not seem to affect validity.

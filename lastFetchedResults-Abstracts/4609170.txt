Roget´s International Thesaurus is a valuable source of structural and semantic information. However, it is difficult to use this information in a knowledge representation system because the structures were not produced using a formal methodology. To achieve the objective of formalizing the structural and behavioral representations of Roget´s International Thesaurus, the application of concept lattices and object-oriented analysis to Roget´s is examined. The application of constraints to Roget´s International Thesaurus and concept lattices in order to represent the behavior are examined

Most significant part of radar target detection problems can be solved by using the method of statistical detection theory. Here the objective of the proposed optimal detection algorithm is to give a maximum detection probability for fixed false alarm probability. It is assumed that target is stationary and energy reflected from the target is distributed. The proposed detection algorithm has a squared sliding window in order to combine the reflected signals from the target. As the energy reflected from the target is more distributed, the proposed detector is superior to conventional non-coherent detector. The detection is based on one transmitted pulse against a background of white Gaussian noise (WGN). The performance of the proposed detector is analyzed and simulation has been done in order to verify.

The objective of this study is to develop a general design and performance evaluation model for the system designers in the initial design phase of the integrated manufacturing system based on the RAM(Reliability, Availability and Maintainability) and life cycle cost(LCC). The methodology proposed in this research includes the following three-step generative approach. First, a deterministic approach to find the optimal system configuration for the initial system configuration is considered under the assumption that the system availability is one(no failure and maintenance), and in second step a stochastic simulation model based on RAM and LCC is developed. Using the results of this two-stage simulation, a system performance index(SPI) was developed for the performance evaluation of the system. In the last step we developed a simulation model using FACTOR/AIM to consider a variety of performance factors and compared the results through a sample example.

The use of formal methods is an effective means to improve the reliability and the quality of complex systems. The objective of this work is to adapt one of these methods to UML, so that the systems development depending on this notation can benefit from it. We propose a formal semantic framework, based on rewriting logic, for UML. Thus, we lean on the category model to give precise and sufficient semantics to the various UML diagrams used in system specification. A transcription tool of UML abstract model to Maude object-oriented module is developed. It is able to handle class and sequence diagrams of realistic size.

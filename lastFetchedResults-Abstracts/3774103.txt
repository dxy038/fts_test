The problem of repositioning urban emergency service vehicles on the transportation network is discussed. Repositioning problems deal with real-time movement of available servers to better anticipate short-term future requests for service. It is assumed that there are two distinguishable service units in the network and that repositioning can take place to any node of the network. The objective is to find the optimum repositioning policy that minimizes the long-term expected cost (total travel time) of operating the system.

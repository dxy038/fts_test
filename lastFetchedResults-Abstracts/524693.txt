A 7-year-old boy was referred to us with a 3-month history of swelling and pain on his left ankle. On laboratory evaluation, he only had an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. X-ray showed an extensive lytic lesion of the talus bone. Chest roentgenogram was normal. The Mantuex skin test was negative. Histological examination of the biopsy tissue showed granuloma and caseating necrosis of tuberculosis. Talectomy with 6 months of antituberculous chemotheraphy resulted in a good clinical outcome

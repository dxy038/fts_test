The transmission of digital or analog signal utilizing the power line of a limited area is a simple and economic transferring method.; but the problem of reliable transmission has never been solved. The objective of this paper is to enhance the communication reliability during the design of a low-voltage power line communication system (PLCS) used in data transmission of middle and low data rate up to 10 kbps. The commonly used modulate-demodulate modes in PLCS are summarized. The channel characteristics was discussed. By analyzing the results of measurements, this paper presents optimized methods to enhance the communication reliability of the low-voltage PLCS. Detailed design methods are demonstrated while relevant schematic figures are provided. These design methods have been successfully applied to the low-voltage-power-line-based public address system (PAS) of an intelligent housing estate. A satisfactory performance has been found to increase the noise-resistant ability and the transmission distance of the system.

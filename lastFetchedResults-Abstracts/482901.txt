Background and Objectives: Atmospheric transport is a key mode of microbial dispersal and the transmission of airborne microbe can have significant impacts on human health. The main objective of this study was to determine the concentrations of airborne bacteria in a children's hospital. Materials and methods: Three sampling points were selected. Airborne bacteria were collected with 6 days interval at  each location using Quick take 30Â® sampler at an sampling rate of 28.3 1 min-1 from November 2007 to March 2008.
Results: The results showed that the highest indoor density of bacteria was 429 CFU/m3 that founded in oncology ward. Bacteria identified were representative of normal flora of the skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.
Conclusion: Our analysis revealed that colony of bacteria in 14% in patient room exceeded available guideline value for indoor air quality. That 11% cases was found in the oncology ward.

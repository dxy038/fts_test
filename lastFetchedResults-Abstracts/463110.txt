Objective
To report program acceptance and progress after 4 years of a heart disease prevention program.
Subjects

All Olmsted County, Minnesota residents aged â‰¥20 years.
Methods

The analysis is based on independent population-based interview samples from 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2003; a dietary questionnaire mailed to interviewees; and blood pressure and cholesterol data from medical records of consenting Olmsted County residents. National, Minnesota, and Olmsted County Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System trends for fruit and vegetable consumption, body mass index, participation in physical activity, and smoking are compared. The data were analyzed in 2005.
Results

More than 90% of the population considers CardioVision 2020 to be a good, very good, or excellent idea. The program is associated with a 25% reduction in the number of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke and small but significant increases in consumption of fruits and daily physical activity. The population meeting the serum cholesterol goal increased from 52.0% in 1999 to 57.5% in 2003, and the population meeting the blood pressure goal increased from 53.7% in 1999 to 59.9% in 2003. However, attempts to quit smoking and the amount of time spent in physical activity did not increase. By 2003, nearly 9% of the population reported making a behavior change because of CardioVision 2020. Compared to Minnesota and national trends, fruit and vegetable consumption increased significantly in Olmsted County.
Conclusions

The population of Olmsted County views CardioVision 2020 in a positive light. Positive changes in several personal behaviors and risk factor levels have occurred.

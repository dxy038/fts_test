Equipment support force spatial configuration (ESFSC), as an important content of equipment support command, has a direct influence on equipment support time-efficiency. On the basis of analyzing the characteristic of ESFSC, this paper makes the orientation for the ESFSC problem in the network location domain, and makes the network location extense model of ESFSC based on multiple objective decision-making (MODM) theory, and uses genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the ESFSC problem. Experimental results reflect that the method proposed by this paper has good flexibleness and operability, can satisfy the complex need of ESFSC and has good applied values.

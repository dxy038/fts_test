Objective: This study was undertaken to evaluate the outcome of in vitro fertilization (IVF) in patients with advanced pelvic endometriosis and previous surgical treatment. Study design: A case controlled study was performed. Results: Patients with the diagnosis of stage IV endometriosis with previous surgical treatment were treated by IVF (group A = 85). An age-matched group of patients (group B = 177) with tubal factor infertility were treated with the same protocol of IVF. In group A, cycle cancellation because of poor response occurred in 29.7% compared with 1.1% in the control group (relative risk 26.03, 95% CI 6.02-112.45). There were 13 (15.3%) clinical pregnancies per stimulated cycle in group A compared with 93 (52.5%) clinical pregnancies in the control group, P< .0001 (odds ratio 0.29, 95% CI 0.15-0.55). Conclusion: The outcome of IVF in stage IV endometriosis with previous surgery was significantly lower compared with an age-matched group of tubal factor infertility.

The objective of this work was focused on the use of a new natural lignocellulosic material based
on palm stems for adsorbing of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) in water. The palm stems powder (PSP) was
characterized using different techniques. The effects of different operating parameters on the adsorption of
Cr(VI) ions were investigated. The results show that the increase of the temperature and the initial Cr(VI)
concentration leads to increase the adsorption quantity of Cr(VI) on PSP up to the a maximum in the range of
1.5-2.5 mg/g. On the other hand, the results of the adsorption isotherms follow the Freundlich model and the
kinetic adsorption follows the pseudo-second order reaction. In addition, the thermodynamic study indicates
that the adsorption process which depending the solution pH, is an endothermic and spontaneous phenomenon.
Overall, our results show the adsorption behavior of this raw material that can be used as a low-cost alternative
to commercial materials.

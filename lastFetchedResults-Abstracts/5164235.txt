In subsurface radar applications, it is often experienced that the requirements for the resolution and the penetration depth contradict each other. For example, pre-excavation survey of archaeological sites may require one to detect buried objects of the order of 10 cm at a depth of 1 m. In such a case, the compromise will be the use of around 500 MHz, for which the target is on the order of a radar wavelength. We refer to the target in such a situation as a `small objectÂ´. It is thus hard to identify the shape of the object with conventional signal processing such as the synthetic aperture method. Our objective is to develop a robust high-resolution imaging algorithm applicable to targets whose dimension is close to the radar wavelength. In order to avoid instabilities in super-resolution techniques, we limit the freedom in the estimation by properly modeling the target as well as the parameters of the medium

We have developed a confocal microscope using MEMS devices for laser scanning in all three axes. This full-MEMS laser scanning system is equipped with a MEMS lens scanner for deep scanning and a MEMS mirror for two-axis lateral scan. The MEMS lens scanner can move an objective lens axially by 515 &#956;m at only 3.2 V. The two-dimensional MEMS mirror can achieve &#177; 20&#176; optical scan angle at 4.5 V. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional confocal reflectance images of microparticles embedded in PDMS and acute rat brain tissue are obtained. The axial and lateral resolutions are measured as 9.0 and 1.2 &#956;m, respectively.

Since B-to-B commercial websites play a decisive role in electronic business and trade, the evaluation and selection of them are very important. There have existed many methods for evaluation on commercial websites nowadays. But there are very few patterns of evaluation that are widely recognized and accepted so far. To tolerate subjective and objective factors that might influence evaluation results, an AHP-Fuzzy method was introduced. Six top B-to-B commercial websites were selected as models of evaluation. By employing online survey data on a famous consultant website, the whole process involving indicators selecting and scoring was simplified. A ranking list was established according to the quantitative evaluation. As an experimental practice in reality, the evaluation activity aims at helping decision makers to determine ways of execution and investment, as well as helping customers or clients to choose their favorite websites as partners.

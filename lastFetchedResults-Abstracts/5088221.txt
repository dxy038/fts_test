Numerical predictions of the flow created by a closed-end pipe expanding or contracting radially were compared with an analytical solution. Both singleand multi-block versions of the finite volume code FLOW3D were used. Flows of this type are of interest because they can be used as simple models of the flow in potential assist devices known as Skeletal Muscle Ventricles (SMVs). The work to be discussed is part of a comprehensive research programme on SMVs which comprises in vivo, in vitro and numerical studies. The main objective of the numerical study is to help in the design or streamline of an optimum ventricle shape and inlet/outlet configuration. Predictions of the flow fields inside simple model SMVs are presented

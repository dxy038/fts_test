Summary form only given. The objective of this study was to determine the water and filler content of five different hybrid glass ionomers (GI) after aging in distilled water at 37 &#176;C for 7 days. The materials were A.) Encapsulated and B.) hand mixed Variglass (Caulk Dentsply, Milford, DE) C.) Photacfil Aplicaps (ESPE Premier, Norristown, PA) D.) Fuji II capsules (GC corp., Tokyo, Japan) and E.) Vitremer (3M, St. Paul, MN). Based upon the mass loss with increasing temperature and the residual mass, the percent water and filler content of the materials were determined. Comparison of the results using ANOVA and the Tukey test (p &lt;.05) reveals that the water content is significantly different for every material and the filler contents are different for every material except C and D

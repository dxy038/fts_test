In this paper, the design of an impedance-adapting
bidirectional transformer coupling circuit for low-voltage powerline
communications is described. It is shown that transmission
through the transformer is governed by series resonance of the
leakage inductance and coupling capacitance. At low frequencies
though, the magnetizing inductance plays an important role in filtering
the power waveform. The coupling transformer, if properly
designed, can equalize terminating impedances on either side
for maximum power transfer. Furthermore, these equalized terminating
impedances facilitate symmetrical bidirectional band-pass
transmission.

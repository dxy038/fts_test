A new genetic algorithm for solving the agile job shop scheduling is presented. The objective of this kind of job shop scheduling problem is minimizing the completion time of all the jobs, called the makespan, subject to the constraints. Initial population is generated randomly. Two-row chromosome structure is adopted based on working procedure and machine distribution. The relevant crossover and mutation operation is also designed. It jumped from the local optimal solution, and the search area of solution is improved. Finally, the algorithm is tested on instances of 8 working procedure and 5 machines. The feasibility of GA is showed by simulation result.

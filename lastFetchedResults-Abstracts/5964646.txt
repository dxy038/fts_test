Previous objective speech quality assessment models, such as bark spectral distortion (BSD), the perceptual speech quality measure (PSQM), and measuring normalizing blocks (MNB), have been found to be suitable for assessing only a limited range of distortions. A new model has therefore been developed for use across a wider range of network conditions, including analogue connections, codecs, packet loss and variable delay. Known as perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), it is the result of integration of the perceptual analysis measurement system (PAMS) and PSQM99, an enhanced version of PSQM. PESQ is expected to become a new ITU-T recommendation P.862, replacing P.861 which specified PSQM and MNB

Blood flow in the blood vessel of the cardiovascular system has been the central point of experimental and theoretical investigation. The objective of the study is to determine the blood flow in the cardiovascular system using Darcy ´s law, Reynold´s number and Poiseuille´s equation. The blood flow in the above system has been numerically calculated for both normal and abnormal patients. A new algorithm has been introduced to the visit the blood vessels in a robust manner which avoids loops and provides us the results in an easier manner. Flow analysis in the above system is analyzed by invasion percolation.

It is essential for the Power Managers to study the impact of contingencies on system security and to identify the best ways to improve the system security by proper use of FACTS controllers in the Power System Network. This paper presents three different selection factors to decide the best location to place TCSC in order to improve the system security under contingencies. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized for finding the settings of the TCSC to be placed on the line selected based on the three factors. The optimization gives the solution of TCSC settings with the objective of minimizing the severity of overloading of the system for the considered contingencies. The proposed approach is examined and tested on IEEE 6 bus system and also tested in Indian Power Utility Network supplying to major metropolitan city.

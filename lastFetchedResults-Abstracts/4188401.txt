The main objective of the present study is to characterize the viscoelastic properties of rat brain stem using an indentation technique. The viscoelastic formulation for a flat indenter was verified with finite element analysis and its limitations were determined. The results showed that up to 30% effective shear strain, the material behavior was linear viscoelastic.

Telecommunication systems mainly need highly reliable power supplies with high efficiency. Other important issues are related to the noise and electromagnetic interference (EMI), which are produced by the power supply. Low EMI means low shielding cost and low distortion of the main communication signal. To meet such essential requirements, a high performance bidirectional Cuk converter-based power supply is proposed in this paper. The converter provides high efficiency, low noise, and low EMI. In addition, the converter has high power density, low cost, and electric isolation. These advantages are achieved from integrating the magnetic components of the converter, the input inductors, the output inductor, and the isolation transformer, on one magnetic assembly. In this paper, the conventional 42 VDC power supply architecture for telecommunication systems is briefly described. A modified system that utilizes the integrated magnetics bidirectional Cuk converter is explained. Finally, the full design integrated Cuk converter, simulation results, and practical performance evaluation are presented.

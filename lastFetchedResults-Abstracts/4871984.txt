We investigate in this paper the problem of visual tracking control in the cooperative dual-manipulator system, where the control objective is to make the projection of the feature point follow a prespecified trajectory on image plane by properly regulating the plant. Due to using the uncalibrated camera with eye-to-hand configuration in this setup, hence, an adaptive algorithm is designed to estimate the camera parameters. In addition, independent-depth interaction matrix that is independent of the depth information of the feature point with respect to the camera is employed in the visual servoing control scheme such that the systemÂ´s closed-loop dynamics equation appears as a linear form. Finally, the system stability is proved and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified in the simulations and experiments.

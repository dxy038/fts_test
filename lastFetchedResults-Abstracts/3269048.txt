This paper presents an evaluation tool for demand side management of domestic hot water systems. The objective of the demand side management is to reduce peak residential demand via direct load control. The evaluation tool employs an energy flow and sectionalized temperature model of the domestic hot water tank and uses bottom-up approach to build an aggregated residential hot water load profile. The potential reduction of peak loads is investigated via simulations of various shutdown programs that control the power supply to the hot water tank. Issues such as the user comfort, load diversity and payback effect are addressed.

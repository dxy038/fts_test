We describe a rare case of spontaneous rupture of a hepatic metastasis from renal cell carcinoma that was treated successfully by hepatic arterial embolization. A 65-year-old woman, who had been undergoing immunotherapy for inoperably disseminated renal carcinoma and lung metastases, presented with severe abdominal pain in a state of hypovolemic shock. Computed tomography revealed a highly attenuated mass lesion in the right lobe of the liver and massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage. Subsequent hepatic angiography showed extravasation from the feeding right hepatic artery. Transcatheter embolization of the right hepatic artery was subsequently performed, and the patient made an uneventful recovery. Although hepatic rupture due to metastatic cancer is extremely rare, transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is an appropriate and useful treatment for massive hemorrhage caused by spontaneous rupture of liver metastasis.

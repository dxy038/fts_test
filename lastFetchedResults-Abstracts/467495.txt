Objective: This study was undertaken to determine whether covering gowns reduce the rates of contamination of surgical scrubs. Study Design: Seventy-five clinicians had pieces of fabric from clean scrubs attached to two areas of their scrub suits. Participants wore a covering garment when wearing scrub suits off of designated areas (n = 25), did not wear a covering garment (n = 25), or wore scrub suits outside the hospital (n = 25). Subsequently, the fabric was assessed with culture in enhanced broth media and blood agar. Results: Although there was a trend toward lower rates of contamination in the group that did not wear a covering garment, the difference was not significant. At no point, and at neither site of fabric attachment, did those who wore a covering garment demonstrate any advantage in regard to levels or frequency of contamination. Conclusion: Wearing covering garments over scrub suits does not reduce rates of contamination. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:1154-5.)

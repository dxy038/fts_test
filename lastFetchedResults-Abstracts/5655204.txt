Solar photovoltaic driven refrigeration represents an application which warrants major attention as a market opportunity, especially in northern latitude countries. Not only are the economics favourable but the technology represents a means to achieve CO<sub>2</sub> reduction in the transportation area. The objective of this work was the development of a photovoltaic system to replace the diesel generator used on conventional trailers. The system is sized in such a way as to provide power to allow the same operational regime as that of the diesel chill refrigerator. The performance of the trailer has attained its design brief of the daily required deliveries of chill produce throughout the year. An update of the results of operation of the solar powered, refrigerated delivery trailer operated by one of the leading food retailers in the UK, J Sainsbury plc is also included

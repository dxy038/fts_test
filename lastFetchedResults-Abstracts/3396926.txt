This paper presents an algorithm for network reconfiguration based on the heuristic rules and fuzzy multiobjective approach. Multiple objectives are considered for load balancing among the feeders and also to minimize the real power loss, deviation of nodes voltage, and branch current constraint violation, while subject to a radial network structure in which all loads must be energized. These four objectives are modeled with fuzzy sets to evaluate their imprecise nature and one can provide his or her anticipated value of each objective. Heuristic rules are also incorporated in the algorithm for minimizing the number of tie-switch operations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through an example.

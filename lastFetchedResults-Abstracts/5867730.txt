The angle of site for smart ammunition terminal trajectory is difficult to be designed and the time of activating the fuse in the fuse-warhead coordination is difficult to be determined. A design for the damage effectiveness simulation able to be quantitatively evaluated was proposed to solve these problems. Based on the model of damage effectiveness, and the principle of maximizing the damage effectiveness, the timing of fuse detonation and angle of site being the variables, the optimal value range of each variable was obtained through comparing the simulation results. The computing simulation was testified, using a certain radar target as the objective. The results prove that the simulation is able to evaluate the design variables in the quantitative way.

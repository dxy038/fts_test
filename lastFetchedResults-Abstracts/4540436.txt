The architecture design process requires to define several design alternatives and to compare them in order to choose the most relevant system architecture given a set of objectives. Nevertheless, designers are generally constrained to restrict their studies to a small set of alternatives due to time constraints and combinatorial aspects of the problem. The objective of our method is to assist them by automatically generating a larger number of design alternatives. Based on the description of the problem under the form of a model, an algorithm first synthesizes design alternatives (a physical architecture associated to a functional allocation) based on the functional architecture of the system, the system interfaces, a library of available components and user-defined design rules. Chains of components are sequentially added to an initially empty architecture until all functions are fulfilled. The design rules permit to guarantee the viability and validity of the chains of components and, consequently, of the generated architectures. The design space exploration is then performed in a smart way through the use of an evolutionary algorithm, the evolution mechanisms of which are specific to system architecting. Evaluation modules permit to assess the performances of alternatives based on the structure of the architecture model and the data embedded in the component models. These performances are used to select the best generated architectures considering constraints and optimization objectives. Iterating over the evolution-evaluation-selection process permits to increase the quality of solutions and, thus, to highlight the regions of interest of the design-space which can be used as a base for further manual investigations. The SAMOA (System Architecture Model-based OptimizAtion) tool is introduced in the paper and examples of results are presented.

Security classification in science and technology has aroused strong feelings, but there is little objective information about its effects. This paper presents the opposing, and highly subjective, points of view; summarizes objective studies of information flow; and reports an investigation of the flow of restricted and unrestricted information in a large research-and-development laboratory. The investigation showed that security classifications had little effect on the laboratoryÂ´s procedure and output; however, additional research is indicated. Altogether this paper demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining empirical data on the effects of security classification on technical communication-data that are much needed, in view of the ongoing controversy.

In this paper, an intelligent process and product quality assurance (PPQA) Web services for capability maturity model integration (CMMI) assessment is proposed. The intelligent Web services are implemented by following the specific goals of PPQA process area of CMMI and contain an evaluating processes and work products service (EPWPS), a providing objective insight service (POIS), an ontological reasoning agent (ORA), and a message notification service (MNS). With the help of this intelligent Web services, the stakeholders of the project can get the noncompliance reports, evaluation logs, and quality assurance reports through the provided user interface. In addition, they also can receive an email to get the established reports during performing quality assurance activities. The simulation results show that the intelligent Web services can support the PPQA of CMMI assessment effectively.

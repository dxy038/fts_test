With the rapid growth of mobile communications, solving the channel assignment problem has now become a new challenge in research. In this paper, we present the channel assignment problem (CAP) from a multi-objective approach. From this new idea, the communication system can be easily managed in case of an unexpected rise in demand in some particular cells. We carry out the experiments with the Philadelphia problem.

Low-power, high-speed and multi-functions are key factors towards the future Si ULSIs. Recently, the physical limitations of Si MOSFETs have been discussed as the device dimensions are scaled down to 0.1 /spl mu/m and below. Therefore, novel Si devices which operate normally in ultrasmall structures are needed to construct the future ULSIs with feature sizes of less than 0.1 /spl mu/m. The objective of this paper is to report the first observation of the negative differential conductance (NDC) in a three-terminal Si tunneling device, in which the active device length is less than 0.01 /spl mu/m.

Introduction & Objective: The plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is an important regula-tor of fibrinolysis at sites of vascular injury and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of thrombosis at the arterial sites. The aim of this study was to examine the effect one month aerobic exercise and vitamin E consumption on plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.
Materials & Methods: In this quasi experimental study thirty inactive healthy collegiate fe-males voluntarily participated in the study and were randomly divided into three groups: training with vitamin (endurance training accompanied by 400 IU/day vitamin E), vitamin (400 IU/day vitamin E) and control (No vitamin and no exercise training). Endurance train-ing included 4 weeks of running on treadmill, 3 days a week. The duration and intensity of exercise in each session for the first week was 30 minutes at 65% of maximum heart rat and for the three remaining weeks were increased by 5 min and 5%, respectively. Two blood samples were taken before and 48 hours after training for measuring PAI-1 antigen.
Results: Data analysis revealed that PAI-1 antigen increased in control group significantly (P?0.05), while PAI-1 decreases and increases in training with vitamin, and vitamin groups, respectively were not statistically significant. Changes in PAI-1 were significantly different among the three groups (P?0.05), but using analysis of covariance it was revealed that these differences were due to differences in resting levels of PAI-1.
Conclusion: Based on the findings of present study, it could be concluded that short-term regular training combined with vitamin E consumption and chronic vitamin E consumption singly result in improvements in fibrinolytic system due to decrease or prevention of PAI-1 antigen.

In this paper, we present our initiative on a new direction of research for bringing into the common fold context-aware computing and Web services-oriented computing. Our long term research objective is to allow users to satisfy their needs regardless of their location and the resources that are considered in the performance of the services. Our contribution is the enhancement of the service discovery and composition by taking into account the available contextual information. As a first step towards this goal we are in the process of designing a new service description based on context.

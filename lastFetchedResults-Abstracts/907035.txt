The objective of this paper was to investigate whether food planning strategies mediate the association between living arrangements and fruit and vegetable consumption amongst women aged 40 years and over. A community sample of 473 women aged 40 years and over from metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, provided survey data on their living arrangements, education, fruit and vegetable consumption and the amount of food planning they undertake. Fruit and vegetable consumption was significantly higher amongst women who lived with others compared to those living alone. Food planning was found to mediate the association between living arrangements and fruit consumption by 8% and vegetable consumption by 13%. This study provides evidence of a mediating effect of food planning on the relationship between living arrangements and fruit and vegetable consumption. With the ageing of the population increasing the potential for a rise in the number of single-occupant households, identifying ways of helping individuals to plan their food purchasing and preparation may increase fruit and vegetable intake.

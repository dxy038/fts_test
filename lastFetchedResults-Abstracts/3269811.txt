We introduce a novel gate sizing approach that considers both the gate switching activity (SA) and gate input vector control leakage (IVC). We first extract SA using simulation and find promising input vectors. Next, in an iterative framework, we interchangeably conduct gate sizing and refining the IVC. As dictated by the new objective function, our algorithm conducts iterative gate freezing and unlocking with cut-based search for the most beneficial gate sizes under delay constraints. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks in 45 nm technology, showing promising improvement, achieving up to 62% (29% avg.) energy savings compared to the traditional objective function.

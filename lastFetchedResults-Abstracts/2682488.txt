Abstract
Background and Objective: Cell therapy is one of the attractive and novel approaches in the treatment of chronic wounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the function of bone marrow derived hematopoietic stem cells (CD93) in the treatment of diabetic ulcers.

Materials and Methods: In this study, 15 BALB/c strain mice, weighing 25-30 g were used, of which 10 were made diabetic by streptozotocin (STZ). Circular skin lesions 6 mm in diameter and 2 mm depth were created in the skin of mice. Studied mice were divided into 3 groups including normal mice without diabetes (sham), diabetic mice without transplanted CD93 cells (Control) and diabetic mice that underwent CD93 cell transplantation twice (density of cells: 1 Ã— 107). The parameters of wound area, wound healing, differentiation and survival of CD93 cells were calculated on days 7, 14 and 28 after cell transplantation using the fluorescent microscope and DiL labeling antibody with Image J and SPSS softwares.

Results: The most difference in the level and rate of healing was related to cell group and the control group, respectively (p  < 0.05 and p  < 0.01). Immunohistochemical study of CD93 marker showed viability and activity of stem cells at the wound site until 28 days after transplantation.

Conclusion: CD93 stem cell transplantation significantly accelerated diabetic wound healing process and these cells are introduced as an appropriate option for diabetic wounds cell therapy.

The objective of this paper is to compare the energy yield and generated electricity cost of several commercially available small wind turbines under low wind speed condition. Many small wind turbines were not able to generate the amount of electricity promised by the manufacturers. The predicted annual energy yield simulated using manufacturersÂ´ power curve were sometimes higher than actual measured values by up to a factor of two. Furthermore, above a rotor size of 3 m, large diameter turbines performed better, having both low generated electricity cost ( &#8364; /kWh) and high annual energy yield per swept area (kWh/m <sup>2</sup>).

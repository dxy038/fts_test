Supplier selection is a key stage in the formation of a successful virtual enterprise. The process can be considered as a multi-objective problem. In this paper, the weighted support vector regression (WSVR) technique is proposed toper form automated evaluation of the potential suppliers. Experimental results indicate that desirable outcome can be obtained by using the WSVR method in supplier selection. In comparison with SVR, the WSVR-based method not only improves training efficiency, but also possesses higher accuracy.

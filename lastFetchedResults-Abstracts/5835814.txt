This paper presents a dynamic boost converter as input stage for a high efficient double 120deg flattop modulation based three-phase inverter. The boost converter can be regulated with hysteresis control or predictive PWM. The objective of the input stage is to provide a dynamic and accurate current into a pulsating DC-link. The algorithms are verified with simulations and experiments using a prototype. Both results show that the designed input stage can provide the required dynamics and accuracy for the three-phase inverter operating with double 120deg flattop modulation.

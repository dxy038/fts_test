This paper presents a preliminary work on a resonant circuit, also called AC-dipole. The resonance frequency of the circuit is changed by the mean of a variable capacitor connecting an inductor. For this purpose, a bank of switched capacitors of different values are connected to the main circuit through bidirectional switches. An experimental validation of the principle is performed on a resonant circuit containing two precharged capacitors. The switches are implemented with close-control driver circuits, allowing zero-voltage and zero-current switching by the mean of both current and voltage polarity measurement. In order to maintain the magnitude of oscillations in the circuit, a regulating system is proposed with its simulation.

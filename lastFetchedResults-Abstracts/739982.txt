We summarized most of the rheumatologic manifestations of tuberculosis (TB) and the occurrence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis disease associated with rheumatologic diseases. We established 4 different categories: (1) direct musculoskeletal involvement of M. tuberculosis, including spondylitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and tenosynovitis; (2) M. tuberculosis as an infectious pathogen in rheumatologic diseases, particularly with the use of newer agents such as tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors; (3) antimycobacterial drug-induced rheumatologic syndromes, including tendinopathy, drug-induced lupus, and others; and (4) reactive immunologic phenomena caused by TB, such as reactive arthritis, erythema nodosum, and others. In addition, Bacille-Calmette-Guérin vaccination used for the prevention of TB or as a chemotherapeutic agent for bladder carcinoma also may be associated with musculoskeletal adverse events. We conclude that M. tuberculosis can directly or indirectly affect the musculoskeletal system.

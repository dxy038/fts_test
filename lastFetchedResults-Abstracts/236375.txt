Pine residues originated from cuts and forestry tasks were studied with the main objective of using them as an alternative source of energy. Calorific values were measured using a static bomb calorimeter in an oxygen atmosphere. From these measurements a value of 7500 kJ kg−1 for the mean lower heating value of these kind of residues was found. A rational and sustainable exploitation of the calorific energy contained in these residues can yield a gross benefit of € 2.8×108 per year through its transformation in electric energy. The study was made along one year, using samples collected in different previously characterized zones. Some other parameters such as: elementary composition, heavy metal content, flammability, and bioclimatic properties were also determined.

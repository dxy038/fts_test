A sufficient multi-hop hexagonal clustering for grouping of sensor nodes can increase the energy efficiency to enhance the lifetime of sensor node in wireless sensor network (WSN).The main objective of WSN is to gather the important real time data from coordinating sensor nodes and save the energy of sensor nodes by providing path cost relay routing in complex nodes deployment. In this paper, sensor node saves the energy in node density field (NDF) to increase the lifetime of WSN. For data management, energy efficient routing perform tree based relay routing algorithm to transmit the important data from sensor location to sink node. The propose model routes the data through hexagonal edge relay and provides shortest path minimum spanning tree routing to control the transmission power in WSN. The energy of sensor node in node density field is simulated on MATLAB. Simulated result shows that NDF outperforms the direct reporting method of data transmission to sink in WSN.

It is critically important to develop intelligent mobile robots to effectively reduce the effects of nuclear radiations to perform desired rescuing tasks in critical emergency situations. One of the good examples is the recent nuclear disposing damage to the Japanese nuclear power plants after the earth quick occurred in the northeast of Japan. In this study, a nested fuzzy logic control system is designed for mobile robots to effectively reduce the effects of those lower-frequency nuclear radiations on rescuing robots. A coarse and a fine fuzzy controller are combined together to realize this objective. The simulation and experimental results of this study confirmed the effectiveness of this nested fuzzy control system in reduction of the effects of lower-frequency nuclear radiations on mobile robots. This is the first paper related to this topic to be presented.

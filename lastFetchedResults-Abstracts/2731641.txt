In Insulated gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) modules, ceramic substrates are used as insulation between semiconductor chips and the ground potential. The substrate, semiconductor chips and connections are covered with silicone gel to prevent partial discharges (PDs) from occurring. In this work, partial discharges are investigated on laboratory samples made of metalized substrates embedded in silicone gel and various liquids. Substrates are made of aluminum nitride (AlN), alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), or glass/epoxy composite. The objective is to determine the actual origin of PDs, by changing the nature of encapsulating material and substrate. The various liquids used are first characterized using a point-plane geometry. Experiments show that a rather large discrepancy on the PD behavior can be due to the ceramic substrate itself. "Good" and "bad" substrates can be identified on the basis of PD measurements. The influence of the sample preparation (degassing procedure) is also evidenced. The main conclusion obtained in this paper shows that partial discharges do not occur within the encapsulating material, contrary to most previous hypotheses, but within pores existing in sintered ceramic materials. Changing the substrate nature has a large influence on PD behavior, whereas a modification of the encapsulating material has almost no effect.

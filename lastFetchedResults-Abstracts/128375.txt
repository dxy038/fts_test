Objective: This study assessed the validity and reliability of the Persian version of Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire-44 (OBQ-44) among the Iranian population. The questionnaire is a self administrated instrument which was developed by the Obsessive Compulsive Cognition Working Group to diagnose and assess the level of obsessive beliefs. Method: This standardization involved a sample of 360 Tehran University medical students who volunteered to participate, and were test-retested at an interval of 5-14 days using OBQ-44-Persian, Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI), and Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R), STAI [full form], and BAI [full form]. Eventually, data from 222 students were analyzed. Results: To calculate the concurrent reliability, internal consistency with Cronbach' s alpha (0.92) and split half with corrected correlation (0.94) were computed; and the reliability coefficient for retest OBQ-44 (r= 0.82) was used for non-concurrent reliability. The results indicated an excellent internal consistency and consistency of the test scores at an interval of 5-14 days. To assess the reliability of OBQ-44-Persian, its correlation with OCI-R and MOCI was obtained that was 0.57 and 0.50 respectively and statistically significant. For construct validity, factor analysis was used. The values obtained by ML method showed that OBQ-44-Persian was saturated with 3 highly correlated factors that indicated convergence of these factors, which fulfilled the standardization purposes for OBQ-44. Conclusion: In conclusion, the results support the OBQ-44-Persian as a valid instrument to assess the level of obsessive beliefs in the Iranian population.

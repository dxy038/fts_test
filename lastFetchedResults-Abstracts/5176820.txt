In this paper, we address the problem of FSM state assignment to minimize area and power. The objectives are targeted as single/independent as well as multi-objective optimization (MOP) problems. Methods for estimating area and power of an FSM are presented. A fuzzy-based aggregation function is employed to combine the two objectives. The work employs genetic algorithm for search space exploration. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed measures

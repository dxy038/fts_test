Analyzed the present situation of emergency braking during train high speed movement and the merit and operational characteristic of permanent magnetic brake system were introduced. Considered the characteristic of emergency braking and service braking, the necessity of applying permanent magnetic brake and united brake control was expounded. Based on this, studied the control strategy and united brake flow with the control objective of braking distance, and calculated the emergency braking distance with different level of adhesion used and non-adhesion brake ratio, then discussed the change of braking distance with using united brake control before and after. The results proved that there are good effects on shortening braking distance and improving working conditions of main braking system with using magnetic brake system in high speed railway.

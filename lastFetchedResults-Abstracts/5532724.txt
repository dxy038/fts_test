The main objective of the research is to propose an authentication model that exhibits the authentication in more secured fashion. The proposed authentication model is based on the reformation mapping method and works in two stages. Firstly, it reforms the user created password and stored it in the form other than its original form. Depending on the nature of the password i.e. linear or two dimensional, this reformation can be performed by rotation or shuffle techniques. Secondly, the reformation can be applied either to the user entered password or to the stored password at the time of authentication. This reformation ensures that the user entered password can be mapped appropriately with the stored password. The possible application of the proposed model is discussed using linear passwords and two dimensional nxn passwords. The proposed authentication model improves the security of the password by reforming its original form and hiding it from the hackers.

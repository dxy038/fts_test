Finite-time optimal control problems with quadratic performance index for linear systems with linear constraints can be transformed into Quadratic Programs (QPs). Model Predictive Control requires the online solution of such QPs. This can be obtained by using a QP solver or evaluating the associated explicit solution. Objective of this note is to shed some light on the complexity of the two approaches.

The aim of the novel adaptive fuzzy logic controller (FLC) proposed in this paper is to eliminate buffer overflow at the reception side of an Internet channel. The elimination improves channel reliability and leads to shorter service roundtrip time (RTT) because of reduced retransmission. The FLC combines the extant, less adaptive PID controller with fuzzy logic, which divides the original PID control domain into finer fuzzy regions. Then, every region is governed by a predefined fuzzy rule or simply a don´t care state that requires no computation or parametric changes. The goal of the don´t care states is to offset the FLC complexity so that the controller execution time is reduced. The FLC adaptively maintains the given safety margin &#916; of the chosen objective function {0, &#916;}<sup>2</sup>. The value for &#916; is normally a preset difference between the buffer length and the queue length. The repeated timing analyses for the FLC with the Intel´s VTune performer analyzer confirms its capability for supporting real-time computing efficaciously.

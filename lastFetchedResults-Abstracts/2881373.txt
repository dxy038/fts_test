This paper proposes a single-phase AC/DC/AC converter system for a grid-connected asymmetrical parameter type two-phase induction generator. For the front end converter, variable hysteresis band current controller is utilized to maintain DC link voltage constant and to allow bidirectional power flow. For the machine side, a carrier-based space vector pulse width modulation technique is used for controlling the three-leg voltage source converter providing variable voltage and variable frequency. The proposed drive system is simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK. Comparative performance evaluation under unbalanced and balanced phase voltage of the induction generator and various speeds is given.

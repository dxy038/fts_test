Introduction & Objective: Staghorn renal calculus is still common in our community. Open surgery and/or combination of endourology and ESWL are used for staghorn treatment. We report our results of PCNL monotherapy for staghorn renal calculus. 
Materials & Methods: During 3 years, 107 patients with staghorn renal calculi underwent PCNL operation. We tried to remove all stones using only this method. The best accessing rout selected and more tracts were used if needed.
Results: 107 patients (79 male and 28 female), 8-87 years old (average 42.38 year) undergone PCNL operation. 33 cases had no hydronephrosis and various grades of hydronephrosis present in other 74 cases. Operation was done through one tract in 95 cases and 2 tracts in 11 cases and 3 tracts in one case. Re-operation was needed in 19 cases. Complete and relative stone free rate was 82% and 18% respectively. Mean hospital stay was 48 hours. No any significant complication occurred.
Conclusion: With technologic development, open surgery period is going to be ended. Although a combination of PCNL and ESWL is acceptable but removal of the staghorn with PCNL monotherapy is a great help for patients.

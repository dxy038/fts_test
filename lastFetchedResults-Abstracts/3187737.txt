Next Generation Networks needs adapted vertical handover decision algorithm. The mobile terminal has to seamlessly roam between a diversity of access networks while guarantying their applications QoS. In this paper, we present a new generic framework for vertical handover decision. Our framework aims, on the one hand, to assign each terminal to the network that fits its applications QoS and user preferences and on the second hand, to balance the load of the terminals over the available access points. This objective is insured by our vertical handover decision algorithm NPH (Nearest Performance Handover). Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in comparison to the existent ones.

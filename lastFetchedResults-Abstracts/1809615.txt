Background: Increased serum progesterone on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration may affect in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether progesterone elevation on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration is associated with poor IVF outcome. Materials and Methods: To determine the relationship between serum progesterone on the day of HCG and the outcome of IVF-embryo transfer treatment, 378 infertile patients undergoing IVF-embryo transfer at Yazd Research and Clinical Center for Infertility from October 2009 to March 2011 were prospectively studied. Results: In this study, absolute p-value and P/E2 ratio were not a good predictor
outcome of in-vitro fertilization but progesterone per metaphase II were predictive of implantation rate and pregnancy rate with statistically significant results but had no effect on the fertilization rate. Conclusion: We suggest avoided the increased progesterone that the cause of advanced endometrial maturation and impaired endometrial receptivity. If the progesterone is greater than 0.32 per oocyte metaphase II, the embryo transfer can be canceled and freezing all embryos for future transfer must be considered, to increase acceptance of the endometrium and thus increase the success rate.

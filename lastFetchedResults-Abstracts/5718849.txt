Part of the work done in PROFEMO (project for the design and implementation of a fault-tolerant multiprocessor system) is presented. The objective is the design of a reliable distributed system architecture and the implementation of a prototype. The approach is based on a layered, generalized transaction concept operating in an object-oriented environment. The architecture of MUTABOR, comprising a microprogrammable engine and address translation cache (ATC), is described. The functionality and the cooperation between the two units concerning object-oriented memory management and recovery issues are exhibited. Simulation results that were the basis for major design decisions concerning the ATC are discussed. The current state of the implementation of the prototype is discussed.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

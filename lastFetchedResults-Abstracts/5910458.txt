In this study we explored basic dimensions used to perceive humanoid robots and developed a scale to evaluate perception of humanoid robots, PERNOD. Previous studies of perception of humanoid robots used psychological scales created for interpersonal perception between humans. This study clarified the basic dimensions of perception of humanoid robots and developed PERNOD by means of psychological methodology. The results revealed six basic dimensions of perception of humanoid robots: Utility, Clumsiness of motion, Possibility of communication, Controllability, Vulnerability, and Objective hardness. The 6 dimensions of PERNOD were originally developed for humanoid robots. Thus, these dimensions represent the organization of knowledge used in the recognition of humanoid robots. Usability of PERNOD was discussed.

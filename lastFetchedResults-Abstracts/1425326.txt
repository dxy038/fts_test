Objective: The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a self-rating scale developed to screen for postnatal depression. The aim of this study was to validate a Norwegian translation of the EPDS, study its psychometric properties, and identify risk factors for postnatal depression. Method: EPDS was filled in by 411 women at 6â€“12 weeks postpartum. Of these, 100 were interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for DSM-IV major and minor depressive disorders. Results: When using a cut-off of 11 on the EPDS, 26 of 27 women with major depression were identified (sensitivity 96%, specificity 78%). An aggregate point prevalence of 10.0% of major and minor depression was found. A one-factor model accounted for 46.6% of the variance. Strongest risk factors for postpartum depression were previous depression, depression in current pregnancy, and current somatic illness. Limitations: Women screened using the EPDS who had a score above threshold, yet did not attend the diagnostic interview could cause the point prevalence of depression to be higher than indicated here. Conclusion: The Norwegian translation of EPDS functions equally well as other translations as a screening tool for postnatal depression. The risk factors that were found are compatible with other studies.

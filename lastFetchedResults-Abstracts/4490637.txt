Ranging is a fundamental issue in the DOCSIS-based HFC networks, because RTD (round trip delay) between the CM and the CMTS must be dynamically measured and ascertained through ranging schemes. This paper mainly researches the DOCSIS MAC ranging schemes in HFC networks, and proposes a solution to the CM initial ranging in the embedded environment. The design has been successfully applied to a bidirectional communication platform for HDTV, which contains a PHY ASIC chip and an ARM embedded kernel chip. The experimental results have shown that the presented solution can rapidly execute the initial ranging process with high accuracy, and provide fine performance as well as high reliability in various applications

The objective of this paper is to analyse the impact of different handover strategies on the service quality and network efficiency of non-GEO satellite diversity based systems. To this end, a quantitative analysis by computer simulation of different handover algorithms for mobile satellite diversity based systems is presented. The statistical but predefined nature of the constellation dynamics as well as the influence of the propagation channel in the handover mechanism enables the assessment of different levels of power and time hysteresis for different satellites within the network. Based on the above, two handover algorithms are proposed for different modes of handover operation and compared with existing handover schemes by means of case studies in suburban environments for a LEO and a MEO satellite constellation. The analysis includes the simulation of the constellations and the elevation dependent satellite channel.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of a low temperature anaerobic treatment to reduce viable populations of indicator microorganisms (total coliforms, Escherichia coli) and the presence of selected pathogens (Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica, Cryptosporidium and Giardia) in swine slurries from different sources. Experiments were carried out in 40 l Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBRs). Experimental results indicated that anaerobic digestion of swine manure slurry at 20 °C for 20 days in an intermittently fed SBR: (1) reduced indigenous populations of total coliforms by 97.94–100%; (2) reduced indigenous populations of E. coli by 99.67–100%; (3) resulted in undetectable levels of indigenous strains of Salmonella, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia. It can be considered as a promising method for reducing indigenous indicator and pathogenic microorganisms populations in liquid swine manure slurries.

A series of 9-sulfonylated/sulfenylated-6-mercaptopurines has been prepared by reaction of 6-mercaptopurine with sulfonyl/sulfenyl halides. These compounds constitute a new class of potent antimycobacterial agents, possessing MIC values against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv in the range of 0.39–3.39 μg/mL, as well as appreciable activity against Mycobacterium avium. Furthermore, a compound of this small series exhibited good activity (MIC under 1 μg/mL) against several drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis.

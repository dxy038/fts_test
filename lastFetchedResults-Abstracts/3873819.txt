One of the most difficult issues regarding speech codec design and evaluation is the analysis of the reproduced sound quality. Standard measurements [such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)] arenÂ´t adequate to make an accurate comparison between different codecs due to the masking phenomena of the human ear. The aim of this paper is to propose a simple objective test for the measurement of the coding distortion in analysis-by-synthesis codecs

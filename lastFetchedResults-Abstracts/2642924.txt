 Background Adsorption isotherms describe the relationship between
                            the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbed matter in the solution and
                            the amount of adsorbed matter on the surface of the adsorbent.
                            Objectives The main objective of the present research was to investigate
                            different adsorption isotherms for describing adsorption of humic acid
                            by nanoclay. Methods In this study, Langmuir, Freundlich, BET, Temkin
                            and Dubinin Radushkevich isotherms, for describing the behavior of humic
                            acid adsorption by bentonite and montmorillonite nanoparticles, were
                            examined. Results The results showed that due to the regression
                            coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>), humic acid adsorption on
                            bentonite and montmorillonite nanoparticles has greater compliance with
                            Dubinin Radushkevich isotherms. The value of E or average energy of
                            adsorption for humic acid by bentonite and montmorillonite nanoparticles
                            was 0.17 and 0.15 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, which
                            specifies that the type of adsorption of humic acid on both
                            nanoparticles was physisorption. The q<sub>max</sub> value
                            obtained from the Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms, for bentonite and
                            montmorillonite nanoparticles were 27.78 and 28.70 mg/g, respectively.
                            Conclusions According to the results of this study, bentonite and
                            montmorillonite nanoparticles have a great potential for the removal of
                            humic acid from aqueous solutions.

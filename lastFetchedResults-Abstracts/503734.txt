BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There are some reports indicating the effects of Tilia plathyphyllos Scop, in nervous disorders including seizure in traditional literatures. Since classical study is not available, in the present investigation, the effects of methanolic extract of Tilia plathyphyllos Scop on seizure induced by picrotoxin and pentylentetrazole were studied in mice.

METHODS: In this experimental study, groups of 5 animals pretreated with doses of 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg of methanolic extract of flowered branches of Tilia plathyphyllos, via intraperitoneal injection. After 20 minutes each animal received picrotoxin 10 mg/kg or pentylentetrazole 80 mg/kg intraperitoneally, for induction of seizure. Latency of seizure, death time and percent of death were determined in treated and control groups. FINDINGS: The latency of seizure induce by picrotoxin were increased in groups that pretreated with doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg of Tilia plathyphyllos extract, from 208 Sec to 298 (p<0.05) and 570 Sec (p<0.01) respectively. The latency of seizure induced by pentylentetrazole were increased with dose of 200 mg/kg, from 233 Sec to 351 Sec (p<0.01). In addition the dose of 200 mg/kg of extract delayed the death time induced by picrotoxin from 1237 to 1498 Sec (p<0.05) and pentylentetrazole from 1973 to 2508 Sec (p<0.01). The percentage of mortality from seizure induced by picrotoxin and pentylentetrazole from 100% were decreased to 80% (p<0.05) and 40% (p<0.01) respectively.

CONCLUSION: Methanolic extract of flowered branches of Tilia plathyphyllos delayed the onset of seizure, death lime and decreased the percentage of mortality from picrotoxin and pentylentetrazole. Further studies are needed for use of this, as antiseizure.

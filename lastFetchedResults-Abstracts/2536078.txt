The aim of this study was to compare and prioritize the viewpoints of customers, executives and supply chain on development strategies of sport discount cards. A 9-item questionnaire was distributed among three groups of sample: executives (n=65), customers (n=283) and supply chain (n=139). Construct validity of the questionnaire was evaluated by measurement model and exploratory factor analysis method which showed that it was appropriate given fit indexes. Also, the Cronbach's alpha reliability was achieved as 0.88 and time consistency was 0.74 according to the Pearson correlation coefficient method. The results showed a significant difference in the mean ranks of the main variable of development strategies among the three groups (P?0.001, x2=24.994). Also, there was a significant difference in the priority of 9 items of development strategies among these groups, that is to say the customers attached the greatest priority to communication with customers (P?0.001, x2=228.634) while supply chain attached their greatest priority to distribution channel (P?0.001, x2=92.576) and executives to key activity (P?0.001, x2=253.822). These results can be used to redesign the processes and establish the integrated information system for this business which leads to customersâ€™ more satisfaction and their loyalty development and the achievement of the main objective, i.e. to facilitate sport for all.

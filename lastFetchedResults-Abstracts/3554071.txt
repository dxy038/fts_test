The millimeter wave community has had a roller coaster career over the last thirty years. The reasons are varied and have been adequately documented in great detail in the literature. The results have, however, been traumatic in that great efforts have been started, promises made, and finally, deliveries not met, followed by a drought in support till the next resurgence. Happily, this condition has changed since the early 1970Â´s to a monitonically increasing support and interest, driven primarily by military requirements (see and fight on an obscured battlefield) and a still small but rapidly growing industrial/academia requirement. A barometer of this fact has been the increased publication rate, including special issues in this Journal plus the emergence of various specialist conferences. Today we stand on a threshold in the art, i.e., we must soon start delivering on our promises: Some other subtle issues also arise, specifically the question of industrial base. Picture, if you will, the hypothetical situation in which industry grows exponentially in the near future. Will there be an adequate industrial support base? Additionally, will second sources be available for system contractors? Obviously, the objective of this Special Issue is to present the latest efforts in the millimeter art, the previous comments being offered only as food for thought.

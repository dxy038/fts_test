A simple, new, mathematical model for the Hoffmann reflex is outlined. This model has been developed by considering phase synchronisation of the underlying neuromuscular processes by the electrical stimulation pulse. The novel approach used results in an analytical representation of the muscleÂ´s EMG response to a stimulation pulse. With this model, studies to provide insight into, and assessment of, the Hoffmann reflex in response to electrical stimuli delivered to the popliteal fossa at various intensity levels may be carried out. Indices based on the parameters of this model may be developed to provide objective Hoffmann reflex comparisons for the clinical assessment of reflexes in the diagnosis of nerve damage

Four objective measures and a subjective measure are used to evaluate the images reconstructed by a mean/quantized residual vector quantizer (MQRVQ) algorithm. These reconstructed images are also evaluated using a subjective evaluation method recommended by the international radio consulting committee. The subjective test results are analyzed. The strength of MQRVQ in coding high-detail pictures and texts is supported by the subjective ratings

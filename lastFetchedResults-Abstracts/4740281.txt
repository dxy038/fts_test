The research on routing efficiency of DHT P2P networks is a key element to promote the development of P2P networks. One reason is that a node´s logical ID is independent of its physical location, bringing tremendous delay to network routing. In this paper, we propose a structured P2P system with low network delay, named TB_Chord, which is extended to enable physical topology aware on the base of Chord. In the TB_Chord, nodelD is configured with prefix called domainID, finger tables are set bidirectional. The most important is TB_Chord neither has super node nor any other plus layer, which guarantees no extra maintenance cost or overhead and original chord´s advantages remaining. The routing algorithms, node arrival mechanisms are designed and tested. The results of simulation experiments suggest that the TB_Chord´s performance is obviously improved in the delay of routing and the hops of overlay network by contrast with the traditional Chord.

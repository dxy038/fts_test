Since elevator system was developed, the theory of elevators dispatching has come into being. More and more requirements are put forward in order to improve performance of elevator system with the development of high architectures. Technique of artificial intelligence has been applied to improve efficiency and service quality. Elevator group control system deals with dispatching of elevators in intelligent buildings. What the group control of the elevator traffic system deal with is a complex, random, multi-objective, non-linear, uncertain decision-making problem. In this paper, based on relative research achievements of China and others countries, the author analyzes the minimum waiting time respectively and explains how to arrange cars with this two principles. Moreover, A new dispatching t policy-booking optimization is put forward in this paper. A destination-booking button is set in every floor. And the center computer can obtain dates from floor monitor subsystem and passageway monitor subsystem. Then Estimation function of every elevator is calculated basing on these data. In the light of the result of calculation, an appropriate elevator will be selected to respond floor-calling. Because of the shortcoming s of traditional elevator group control system, a fuzzy control system is proposed in the paper. It aims at decreasing waiting time and energy loss. It optimizes the elevator group harmoniously. And a better control result is obtained.

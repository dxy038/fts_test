To optimize the comprehensive performance of electric vehicles (EVs) equipped with automated manual transmission (AMT), a performance evaluation function that takes into account dynamic performance, economic performance and driver´s driving intentions is put forward. The approach proposed in this paper is based on a gearshift schedule optimization method based on genetic algorithm (GA) using the evaluation function as objective, the accelerator pedal position and velocity as design variables, and using motor efficiency to narrow solution space. Five gearshift schedules representing different driver´s intentions have been developed for a 3-speed AMT. Simulation results show that the proposed GA-based optimization method can improve the comprehensive performance of EV equiped with AMT effectively.

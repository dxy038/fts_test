Specimen used in the experiment was AISI 4140 steel that hardening at 51&#177;3 HRC. Studied factors were consisted of revolution speed of workpiece, feed rate, and depth of cut. Full factorial experimental design was conducted as 3 factors and 3 levels with 2 replications. The results revealed that influenced factor affected to surface roughness was depth of cut which showed significantly different to surface quality at the level of .01. Lower depth of cut would cause on good surface quality. On the other hand, higher depth of cut would cause on poorer surface quality. Interaction of factor was found that three factors were significantly to surface quality at the level of .01. Moreover, influenced factor affected to roundness was feed rate. Lower feed rate would be increase the better roundness. An interaction between revolution speed and depth of cut factors were significantly at the level of .01.

Computational intelligence techniques have appeared as efficient alternatives to solve complex problems, such as in multimodal and multidimensional spaces and optimization of multi-objective problems. These approaches are generally bio-inspired and many algorithms have been proposed in recent years. In this last decade, some efforts have been carried in order to demonstrate that these techniques can be useful to tackle tough problems in optical networks. This paper presents a review of some applications of computational intelligence in optical networking, such as in the impairment-aware routing and wavelength assignment, regenerator placement and physical topology design.

In real power systems, power plants are not in the equal space from the load center, and their fuel cost is different. With common utilization conditions, production capacity is more than total load demand and losses. Therefore, there are different criteria for active and inactive power planning in each power plant. The best selection is to choose a frame work in which the utility cost is minimized. On the other hand, planning in power systems has different time horizons, thus, for effective planning in power systems, it is very important to find a suitable mathematical relationship between them. In this paper we propose a modeling by selecting a Fuzzy Hierarchical Production Planning (FHPP) technique with zone covering in the mid-term and long-term time horizons electricity supply modeling in the Iran global compact network with spotting 15 zone electricity study, in terms of inclusive capacity, Max development, Max energy product of each production unit, reliability and autonomy constraints. Other objective functions include parameters that minimize production, development and security costs of the system considering capital recovery factor, interest rate that maximize total preference weights of power plants.

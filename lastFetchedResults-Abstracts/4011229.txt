This paper proposes a novel MAC protocol for wireless ATM networks, which is characterized by a contention-free mechanism of the reservation request and a deterministic nature of mobile-assisted (distributed) uplink scheduling under a framework of the dynamic reservation TDMA, as discussed in the current standardization activities of ETSI Project BRAN (broadband radio access network) and the wireless ATM working group in the ATM Forum. The design objective of the proposed MAC protocol is to guarantee the real-time constraint of the real-time VBR (rt-VBR) traffic class while maximizing the multiplexing gain among all ATM traffic classes, especially with a fixed length frame. The proposed deterministic scheduling scheme for the rt-VBR traffic class lends itself to implementing the minimal configuration of control data units for reservation request as desired under the limited wireless resources. Simulation experiments using statistically multiplexed MPEG-2 video streams are performed for a 25 Mbits/s wireless ATM access link scenario. It has been shown that the proposed framework guarantees the delay constraint of rt-VBR sessions along with its cell loss rate significantly reduced, while improving the average delay performance of the nrt-VBR in the range of 10%-30% without compromising the channel utilization as compared to the DSA++ system.

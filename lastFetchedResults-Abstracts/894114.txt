Task graph scheduling is a multi-objective optimization and NP-hard problem.
In this paper a new algorithm on homogeneous multiprocessors systems is proposed.
Basically, scheduling algorithms are targeted to balance the two parameters of time
and energy consumption. These two parameters are up to a certain limit in contrast
with each other and improvement of one causes reduction in the other one. The
problem is to achieve the trade-off between these two parameters. Pre-scheduling
algorithms are mainly aimed at modifying the structure of task graph to gain
optimal scheduling.
In the proposed algorithm the suitable number of processors for scheduling the
task graph is computed. The idea of Nash equilibrium is mainly applied to compute
the appropriate number of processors in such a way that the idle time of the
processors is reduced while their processing power is increased. Also, considering
the communication costs and interdependencies, the tasks are merged as their
earliest start time is reduced. In this way, the length of the critical path is reduced
while the degree of parallelism is increased and ultimately the completion time is
reduced. Our experimental result on a number of known benchmark graphs
demonstrates the effect of our proposed algorithm.

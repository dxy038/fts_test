Background: While the association between benzodiazepines (BZD) and single fall is long-known,
the association between BZD and recurrent falls has been few studied. Objective: The aims of this study were
1) to examine whether BZD were associated with recurrent falls while taking into account the effect of
potential confounders, and 2) to determine whether there was an interaction in terms of risk of falls between
BZD and balance impairment in a community-dwelling population-based adults aged 65 and older. Study
design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Three health centers in North-East of France. Population: 7643 communitydwelling
volunteers aged 65 and older. Outcome measures: The use of BZD, the Mini Mental State
Examination (MMSE) score, the Clock Drawing Test (CDT), the One Leg Balance (OLB) test, the Five
Times Sit-To-Stand test (FTSS), and a history of falls were recorded. Subjects were separated into 4 groups
based on the number of falls: 0, 1, 2 and â‰¥ 3 falls. Results: Among the 1456 (19.2%) fallers, 994 (13.0%)
were single fallers and 462 (6.1%) were recurrent fallers (i.e., > 2 falls). The number of falls increased
significantly with age (Incident Rate Ratio (IRR)=1.04, P<0.001), female gender (IRR=2.24, P<0.001), the
use of benzodiazepine (IRR=1.65 P<0.001) and especially while subjects used bromazepam (IRR=1.44,
P=0.006), clobazam (IRR=3.01, P=0.014) and prazepam (IRR=2.29, P<0.001). A low MMSE score
(IRR=0.96, P<0.001), an impaired CDT (IRR=0.91, P<0.001), and a bad performance at OLB and FTSS
(respectively IRR=1.85, P<0.001 and IRR=1.26, P<0.001) were related to the recurrence of falls. After
adjustment only the advance in age (IRR=1.02, P<0.001), female gender (IRR=2.15, P<0.001), clobazam
(IRR=2.54, P=0.04), prazepam (IRR=1.63, P=0.03) and OLB (IRR=1.55, P<0.001) were still significantly
related to the number of falls. Conclusion: The current study shows that the age, the female gender, the use of
clobazam or prazepam and a low score at OLB are related to the recurrence of falls.

Multimedia, including Internet traffic, can currently be multiplexed within the DVB/MPEG-2 formats and delivered direct to home users. Traditionally a slow terrestrial telephone link between the user and Internet service provider is used to request data. A direct return channel system will facilitate usersÂ´ high-bit-rate bidirectional communication via satellite. The return link could be used for the fast Internet access or large data exchanges that will be necessary in a multimedia world. The satellite system not only removes the need for wires but also increases transfer speeds. Satellite interactive terminals can establish network connections via satellite and a ground-based hub. The DVB/MPEG-2 format carries up to 45 Mb/s in the forward link, and a multifrequency time-division multiple access scheme allows up to 2 Mbit/s in the return direction. The return channel of the interactive channel for multimedia satellite networks underwent final standardization by ETSI in early 2000. This article reviews the system concept of a typical implementation. The key features of the return channel air interface, from transmission parameter to login procedure, are explained. In general, Internet packets are expected to be carried via DVB/MPEG-2 in the forward direction and via ATM in the return direction. The IP transportation techniques are described

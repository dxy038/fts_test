Based on the condition of power grid, the choice of strong and smart grid in China is analyzed. The concept and objective of strong and smart grid are proposed. Smart Grid is a long-term and comprehensive systemic project, its coordinated development issues has been analyzed from four main sides, in order to ensure the efficient, orderly and coordinated development, and to realize the comprehensive benefit of smart grid. First is coordination of physical power grid and smart technology application. The influence of smart grid on physical power grid development is analyzed from power grid efficiency and load performance, etc. The appropriate principle of smart technology application is analyzed based on the topological structure and operation demand. Second is coordinated development among generation, transmission, distribution, consumption and dispatching system. The corresponding and coordinated development issues between grid and power plant, transmission network and distribution network, customer and power grid, dispatching with other segments, communication and information with other segments are investigated. Third is coordination of technology upgrading and management revolution. Concerning grid planning, construction, operation, maintenance, and electricity marketing, the optimization suggestion of management pattern are proposed, to get technology and management promote mutually. Last is coordination of smart grid and emerging industry.

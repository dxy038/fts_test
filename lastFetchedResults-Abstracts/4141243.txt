Describes a new artificial speech signal (ASVQ: artificial speech by vector quantization technique) which reflects the average characteristics of the human voice. The ASVQ is intended for use as a test signal in the objective evaluation of speech coding system quality. To obtain the average characteristics, a very large speech data base is analysed, The ASVQ generation method which reflects the extracted average characteristics of the human voice is formulated. This method applies vector quantizing analysis to the speech data base. The LPC speech synthesis circuit is used to reproduce the average characteristics. Finally, the new artificial speech signal is compared with a human voice and the estimation accuracy of the subjective quality of speech coding systems and nonlinear distortions is evaluated

The objective of the present paper is to compare the scuffing life and break-in effect between unidirectional sliding motion (USM) and reciprocating sliding motion (RSM). The effect of the normalizing procedure on the scuffing life under different sliding motions also was investigated. The results of our study showed that RSM and the normalizing procedure had a disadvantage with regard to the scuffing resistance. These phenomena are related to the change in the hardness and the distribution of the residual stress due to the normalizing procedure. Also, it was found that it is possible to predict the scuffing life from the trend-line of the immediate loading tests in the case of as-received specimens. On the other hand, in the case of normalized specimens there is an important transition point in the magnitude of loading between early scuffing failure and infinite surfaces life. Finally, it was observed that the break-in procedure has a greater influence on the scuffing life under RSM than under USM in the case of normalized specimens.

This paper shows a new method to estimate the muscle forces in musculoskeletal systems based on the inverse dynamics of a multi-body system associated optimal control. The redundant actuator problem is solved by minimizing a time-integral cost function, augmented with a torque-tracking error function, and muscle dynamics is considered through differential constraints. The method is compared to a previously implemented human posture control problem, solved using a Forward Dynamics Optimal Control approach and to classical static optimization, with two different objective functions. The new method provides very similar muscle force patterns when compared to the forward dynamics solution, but the computational cost is much smaller and the numerical robustness is increased. The results achieved suggest that this method is more accurate for the muscle force predictions when compared to static optimization, and can be used as a numerically ‘cheap’ alternative to the forward dynamics and optimal control in some applications.

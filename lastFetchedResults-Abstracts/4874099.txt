In order to efficient, objective and comprehensive assessment of wheat flour processing accuracy, this paper introduces a new method to detect the wheat flour processing precision; it uses wheat flour three features of Whiteness, color, bran to design classifiers. The 240 different accuracy wheat sample images were analyzed and tested, experimental results show that CIE L*a*b*and OTSU algorithm can effectively extract of wheat color features and content of bran, classifier also achieves the expected effect.

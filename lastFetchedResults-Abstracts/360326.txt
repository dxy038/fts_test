Study objective: To study the effect of multiple-dose activated charcoal (MDAC) on salicylate clearance in pigs given high-dose IV aspirin. Design:  In a crossover design, six fasted pigs received 300 mg/kg IV aspirin followed by no treatment or MDAC (1 g/kg hourly for 6 doses by gastrostomy). Serum salicylate samples were obtained every 30 minutes for 6 hours. Results: The mean peak salicylate concentrations were 47.4±6.2 mg/dL and 48.4±3.9 mg/dL (P  =.74), and the areas under the time-serum salicylate concentration curve over 6 hours were 171,000±24,000 mg×minute/L and 188,000±18,000 mg×minute/L for the control and treatment arms, respectively (P =.22). This study had a 90% power to detect a 30% difference between arms. Conclusion:  MDAC does not enhance the clearance of salicylate after administration of high-dose IV aspirin.

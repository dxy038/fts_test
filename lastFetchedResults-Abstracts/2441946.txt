The objective of this paper is to argue the need for economics knowledge sharing and to demonstrate that it can be achieved with Semantic Web technologies. To this end, we first designed an economics knowledge sharing ontology (EKSO) to describe economic domain knowledge. We then implemented an ontology-based economics knowledge sharing system (OEKSS) based on the EKSO and Semantic Web technologies. The OEKSS included three search functions – basic search, knowledge navigation, and instrumental variable recommendation – to demonstrate how we can use shared economics knowledge in future research. In particular, an instrumental variable recommendation is made based on an instrumental variable recommendation algorithm (IVRA), which is a systematic and efficient way to find instrumental variables through EKSO in limited experimental environments. Finally, the paper presents a case study for IVRA that illustrates the usefulness and significance of the algorithm.

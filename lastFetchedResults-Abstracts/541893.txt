The objective of the current study was to evaluate chemical composition and degradation characteristics for eight forages harvested in July from the Tibetan plateau of China. Duplicate bags containing 2 g of forage species were incubated in the rumen of six ruminally cannulated Tibet Peng-Po sheep for 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. Significant differences were observed in degradation kinetics and effective degradability values of the different forages. The rapid degradable value and potential degradability for dry matter (DM) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) in Lagotis humilis was higher (P<0.01) than for the other forages. Carex satakeana had the most rapidly degradable crude protein (CP) fraction of all forages tested and Elymus nutans had the highest potential degradability of CP. L.humilis, C.satakeana and E.nutans had high effective degradability of DM and CP indicated their high quality as ruminal forage in cold areas of Tibet.

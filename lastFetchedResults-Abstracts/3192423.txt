In this paper, the performance of Bidirectional Contactless Charging System (BCCS) have been assessed by an electric circuit based battery model suitable for Electric Vehicles applications. The time, C-rate and SOC dependent electric circuit parameters of charge /discharge model are calculated using a polynomial equation. The charging system along with battery model is tested by simulation for a 2kW BCCS system and is able to transfer power in both the direction. The simulation results show that, the charging scheme could effectively maintain the longetivity of EVÂ´s and can supply power during Vehicle to Grid (V2G) operations.

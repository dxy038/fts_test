Background and Objective: Biochanin A, a bioflavonoid in red clover and soybeans, is well-known as an anti-diabetic and anti-lipidemic flavonoid. The aim of this investigation was to study the renal and hepatic effects of biochanin A in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats.

Materials and Methods: Diabetes was induced in Wistar rats by administration of streptozocin (35 mg/kg of body weight) intraperitoneally. Diabetic rats were treated with 10 and 15 mg/kg (body weight) of biochanin A in 5% DMSO for 30 days. Body weight and biochemical parameters including fasting blood glucose level (FBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), urea and creatinine were assessed.

Results: The data showed normalization and restoration of biochemical parameters such as body weight (BW), FBG, HbA1c and lipid profile in STZ-diabetic rats after oral administration of biochanin A. The results showed significant increases in hepatic enzymes, urea and creatinine in STZ-diabetic rats and oral administration of biochanin A significantly decreased AST, ALT, ALP, urea and creatinine. The data of this investigation also indicate that protective effect of biochanin A on hepatic and renal tissues is greater at a dose of 10 mg/kg as compared to a dose of 15 mg/kg.

Conclusion: Oral administration of biochanin A due to its anti-diabetic, anti-lipidemic effect has a protective effect on hepatic and renal function. The data of this investigation indicate that biochanin A is not toxic.

In this paper, a few schemes are presented to improve the performance of aggressive packet combining scheme (APC). To combat error in computer / data communication networks, ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) techniques are used. Several modifications to improve performance of ARQ are suggested by recent research and are found in literature. The important modifications are majority packet combining scheme (MjPC proposed by Wicker), packet combining scheme (PC proposed by Sindhu &amp; Chakraborty), modified packet combining scheme(MPC proposed by Bhunia), and packet reversed packet combining(PRPC proposed by Bhunia) scheme. These modifications are appropriate for improving throughput of conventional ARQ protocols. Leung proposed an idea of APC for error control in wireless networks with basic objective of error control in uplink wireless data network. We suggest a few modifications of APC to improve its performance in terms of higher throughput, lower delay and higher error correction capability.

The paper proposes fuzzy decision making based real coded genetic algorithm (RCGA) to solve the complex multi objective problem of environmental economic dispatch for thermal generators of the power system. Due to the increasing public and government concern towards reducing pollution, generator dispatch need to be carried out for cost, emission and loss minimization. This multi objective problem is converted into single objective problem by introducing a term called price penalty factor (PPF), which gives a set of non-dominated solutions known as Pareto optimal solutions and then depending upon the highest rank, best compromise solution is obtained by applying fuzzy decision making technique. This proposed method is tested on the standard IEEE 30-bus, six unit system. The results show the superiority of RCGA in producing fast and feasible solutions with stable convergence characteristics.

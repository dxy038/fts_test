Therefore, the objective of this paper is presenting appropriate methodology for improvement of this method and eliminating the limitations of this technique and introducing the modified taxonomy model. In the following of introducing the modified model, for better representing the difference, the two models is used to assess the level of development in rural areas of Mazandaran province. The research method is descriptive and applied, and libraries based on data of the 1385 Census. Results showed the more accurate the modified model compared with the contemporary taxonomy model. Development coefficient (Fi) and rank in these models have substantially different. Based on numerical taxonomy rural areas of Ghaemshahr Township with a grade of 0.455 are in rating 1 and rural areas of Ghaloga Township with a grade of 0.455 are in rating 3, Whereas with the modified model that to weight important indicators and also the direction of indicators (being positive or negative) is significant, Levels of development in rural areas of Ghaloga Township with a grade of .396 to rating 1 and Ghaemshahr Township to rating 2 change.

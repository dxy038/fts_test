In the multi objective framework particle swarm optimization technique is used to find the generation schedule of a short-range fixed head hydrothermal problem, through the improvement of the selection manner for global and individual extreme. The multi objective problem is formulated considering five objectives (1) cost (2) NOx emission (3) SO<inf>2</inf>emission (4) CO<inf>2</inf>emission (5) variance of generation mismatch with the explicit recognition of statistical uncertainties in the thermal generation cost, NOx, SO<inf>2</inf>and CO<inf>2</inf>emission curves and power demand, which are random variables. Solution to the problem is based on the generation of non-inferior solution, which allows explicit trade off between objective levels. The search for optimal set of multi objective optimization problem is done using PSO. Numerical simulation of two-sample system shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

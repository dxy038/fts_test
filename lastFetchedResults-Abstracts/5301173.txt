This paper addresses a possible solution to the problem of blackouts that occur on the grid due to increased loads during peak periods. The objective of this research is to identify technologies that could be employed to stabilize the grid by minimizing power fluctuations during peak load periods. In order to achieve this objective, distributed generating sources share the load during peak periods with the utility. These sources are called peak power shavers (PPS). The proposed system consists of a microturbine driving a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). The AC power generated from the PMSG is rectified and, along with a fuel cell, is connected to the DC-link. A PWM inverter delivers AC power to the grid connected load. For large steady state power demand changes, controlling the fuel flow rate to the microturbine and/or the hydrogen flow rate to the fuel cell can control the power flow from the PPS. For small load variations, changing the inverter modulation index can change the reactive power output while changing the phase angle of the output voltage can change the real power output

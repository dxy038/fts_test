The main objective of the algorithm presently developed is to reduce the discontinuous component of a robot systemÂ´s switching variable once the trajectory is entered into the sliding mode. The trajectory reaches the sliding mode in a shorter time and with a reduction in chattering. This is a natural extension of the work by R.G. Morgan et al. (1985). It also demonstrates improvements in system performance in the application of VSS (variable structure systems) to robot manipulators

This paper considers a collision avoidance control for multi-vehicle systems which are modeled as a class of hybrid systems, piecewise affine (PWA) systems. Using an equivalence between piecewise affine systems and mixed logical dynamical (MLD) systems, the collision avoidance problem is formulated as mixed integer programming for a trajectory generation problem. We propose an optimal trajectory path which guarantees that the vehicle moves to the objective point without collision. The closed loop system is constructed by two parts: a trajectory generation part and a local control part. Finally, simulation results and the experimental results are shown.

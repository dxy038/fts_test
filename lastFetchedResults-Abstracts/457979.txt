Background
Inflammation is important to vascular repair following injury, modulating neointimal proliferation and remodeling. Previously, we have shown that a low-intensity inflammatory response aggravates neointimal formation following balloon and stent injury. The present study examined whether modulation of the extent and timing of nonspecific inflammation mediates the local vascular response in an additive unidirectional or rather a bidirectional fashion.
Methods and results
Rabbits subjected to denudation and balloon injury of the iliac artery were treated with low (1 μg/kg) or high (100 μg/kg) doses of bacterial endotoxin (LPS) immediately after injury, or with early high-dose LPS administered 3 days prior to injury (preconditioning). Neointimal formation at 28 days was significantly increased in the low-dose group (0.537 ± 0.059 mm2) as compared with controls (0.3 ± 0.03 mm2). High-dose LPS did not significantly affect neointimal formation while early high dose significantly reduced neointima (0.296 ± 0.033 and 0.194 ± 0.025 mm2, respectively, n = 12–14/group). Arterial wall and systemically circulating interleukin-1β levels, and monocyte CD14 activation correlated with neointimal formation. Vascular remodeling was accelerated in animals treated with low- or high-dose LPS while not affected in the preconditioned group. Remodeling index inversely correlated with arterial matrix metalloproteinase-2 levels 6 days after injury.
Conclusions
The extent and timing of nonspecific inflammation that is concurrent with vascular injury can determine different and opposite vascular repair patterns.

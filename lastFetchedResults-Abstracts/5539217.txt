Implementation of a set of pyramid transforms in a hierarchical approach for a real television sequence which consists of a 3-D data information set is presented. The investigation is based on several visual and objective comparative criteria, including the relevance to the motion information. Several pyramid transforms for image sequence coding are investigated and compared. The nonorthogonal pyramid transforms are separated from the orthogonal transforms. The nonorthogonal pyramid transforms are easily implemented, permit exact reconstruction, and accept the introduction of an error-compensation method if the different levels are coded but the nonorthogonality of the decomposition causes an increase in the number of transform samples and a high global entropy value (a disadvantage for data compression). The wavelet pyramid transform is more computationally complex but gives the best results for global entropy values. The quincunx pyramid seems to be the most interesting, since it features many advantages of the other including the visual representation of motion information through a pyramid sequence

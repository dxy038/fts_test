Objective
Gene transfer of the telomerase catalytic subunit (TERT) into primary human stromal cells prolonged their lifespan. However, primary human stromal cells are actually composed of adipocytes, myofibroblasts, osteoblasts, etc. Our objective was to investigate the phenotype and hematopoietic-support of the human telomerized stromal cell (HTS) in clonal level.
Materials and Methods

We established HTS clones (HTS-1 to HTS-9) from a parental population of HTSs by limiting dilution. Hematopoietic-supporting activity of the HTS clones was examined by coculturing with CD34+ cells.
Results

HTS-1 to HTS-3 contained alkaline phosphatase (ALP)+ cells, and HTS-4 to HTS-9 were composed of both ALP+ and Î±-smooth muscle actin-positive cells. Although all HTS clones exhibited normal growth kinetics, one of the HTS clones exhibited a chromosomal abnormality. Moreover, the parental population of the HTS cells acquired an increased growth rate and anchorage independence after 4 years of culturing. Expression of hematopoietic growth factors, such as stem cell factor, angiopoietin-1, and hedgehog mRNA was detected in all HTS clones. The degree of hematopoietic progenitor support differed between the HTS clones, and the expansion level of CD34+ cells was the highest in HTS-8.
Conclusion

Human telomerized stromal cell clones exhibited the phenotype of hematopoietic supporting osteoblastic and myofibroblastic cells after long-term culture. Clinical application of HTS cells should be limited because of their potential for neoplastic transformation after hTERT gene transfer. HTS cells may be useful for analyzing the molecular mechanism of hematopoietic support of human stromal cells.

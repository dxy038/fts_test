This paper presents the architecture and the methods used to dynamically simulate the sea backscatter of an airborne radar operating in a medium repetition frequency mode (MPRF). It offers a method of generating a sea backscatter signal which fulfills the intensity statistics of real clutter in time domain, spatial correlation and local Doppler spectrum of real data. Three antenna channels (sum, guard and difference) and their cross-correlation properties are simulated. The objective of this clutter generator is to serve as the signal source for the simulation of complex airborne pulsed radar signal processors.

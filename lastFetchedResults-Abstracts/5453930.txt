During the last two years we have developed the Tiancalli project. This project includes the construction of TAC SCM compliant agents. The TAC SCM is a contest about different software agents competing in a simulated market that has been organized for four years by Trading Agent Research Group. In order to find the strength and weakness of our agent, we have made a statistic research with both 2005 and 2006 game results. The objective of this article is to present the results obtained in this comparison. Also it is important to discuss a more concrete basis about factors that must be modified, such as the ones which should be kept on the TAC SCM 2007

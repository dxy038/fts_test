The main objective of this research was to characterise and implement a monolithic millimetre-submillimetre wave active conical horn antenna array. Specifically, a 95 GHz quasi-optically fed ring mixer integrated with an annular slot ring antenna was used as the basic element of the proposed active antenna array. For efficient reception, a low cost micro-machined conical born antenna array was fabricated and placed below active elements. This paper presents a systematic study on the proposed array, including a novel unconditionally stable nonorthogonal approach for the conical array element analysis and a matrix manipulation technique for efficient antenna array modeling etc. Numerical simulations were verified at its distributed stages with experimental data in very good agreement and measurement results on the final array are presented.

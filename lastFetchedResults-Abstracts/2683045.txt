Reliable location routing problem considers a location problem with a vehicle
routing problem in order to select the optimal location of facilities and at the
same time the optimal routes for vehicles considering the unexpected failure
for facilities in which, all facilities may fail with a probability. In this paper, a
bi-objective mathematical model has been developed to minimize the total
costs and minimize expected value of total impedance value-weighted travel
distance. To approach the model to real world, two types of uncertainty in
model have been considered: 1) demand-side uncertainty and 2) supply side
uncertainty and also, impedance function has been utilized to operationalize
the concept of accessibility in transport planning research. To solve the model,
first ?-constraint method has been used for multi objective solution and then
we implemented a small-sized case study in an urban district in Iran. The
findings offer managerial insights into how various system parameters affect
the optimal solution.

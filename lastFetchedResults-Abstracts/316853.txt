Objective
To investigate the effects of growth hormone (GH) replacement therapy on bone matrix gene expression of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and markers of bone metabolism in women with adult-onset GH deficiency (GHD).
Design and methods
Nineteen women, mean age 45 (range 24â€“56) years, were included in a double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study for 12 months. Biochemical markers were measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Bone biopsies were obtained and BMD was measured at baseline and after 12 months.
Results
Maximum responses were observed after 6 and 12 months, for bone resorptive and bone formative markers respectively. GH therapy enhanced gene expression in cortical bone of IGFs, GH-and calcitonin-receptor (CR) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), however with the most pronounced effects on CR and IGF-I. Changes in IGF-I gene expression during longitudinal follow-up were significantly correlated with changes in both circulating IGF-I (r = 0.82, p< 0.05), changes in markers of enhanced osteoclastic activity, measured both locally in bone (CR, r = 0.87, p< 0.01) and in serum (CTX-I, r = 0.86, p< 0.05), as well as serum bone ALP (r = 0.96, p< 0.01).
Conclusions
This study indicates that both liver- and bone-derived IGF-I may be significant in mediating the effects of GH on bone metabolism in humans.

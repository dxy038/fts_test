The main objective of this study is to establish a virtual prototyping model of a flexible four-bar mechanism and perform co-simulations using both mechanism model construction and control strategy development tools for the structure. Taking the four-bar mechanism as an example, a co-simulation control approach is introduced to study multi-body flexible dynamics. Lagrange approach is first implemented to study the dynamics model of a rigid four-bar mechanism, and co-simulations are conducted to investigate the responses of its flexible form made of various materials. Then, controller strategies are exercised to demand the four-bar mechanism to response as requested. The study verifies the feasibility to control of flexible multi-body mechanismsÂ´ traces.

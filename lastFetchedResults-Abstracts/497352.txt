Speaking of curriculum, very often we think of some exact, preplanned curricula
determined for schools in advance. However in the new approach called Emergent
Curriculum, all the beneficiaries including students, teachers, parents, society and all of
whom are considered protagonists play some role in curriculum decision making and
formation oflearning. In Emergent Curriculum inspired by Reggio Emilia approach there is
no a preplanned curriculum, it means teacher and educational system swear by children
affect on what they are supposed to learn. In this study, the main research objective was
study of formation of Emergent curriculum and documentation of the process. For this
purpose, an ethnographical study has been employed. The research carried out in an
unofficial school in Tehran- the capital city of Iran. This school has been working since 3
years ago as a research project under supervision of a nongovernmental center. An
experienced teacher as well as 35 children participated in our study of which 23 were male
and all of them were 7-8 years old. To collect a deep understanding of Emergent
Curriculum implementation in the school, observing, listening to and describing
interactions in the class, recording events, interviewing the teacher and gathering pupils'
works and school's documents have been used. Categorizing observations, underscoring
main issues, organizing documents and interpreting the data were the main methods of
analyzing data. Findings have reported in 3 main groups: teacher's role in emergent
curriculum, project approach's role in implementing such a curriculum, as well as
challenges and future perspectives.

In this letter, a single-element antenna backed by ground plane with unique endfire &#8220;8&#8221;-shaped patterns in both the azimuth ( E-plane) and elevation ( H-plane) planes is designed and experimentally demonstrated. The endfire radiation patterns benefit from the novel radiation mechanism of surface-wave diffraction. The bidirectional endfire antenna figures a low-profile configuration with overall dimensions of 0.8&#955;<sub>0</sub> &#215;0.8&#955;<sub>0</sub> &#215;0.04&#955;<sub>0</sub>, consisting of a horizontal dipole located close to a high impedance surface (HIS). Experimental results show that the antenna performs narrow-beamwidth patterns in both the E- and H-planes, resulting in a relatively high gain (maximum gain of 4.92 dBi) compared to a traditional dipole antenna.

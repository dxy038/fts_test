State estimation is a significant problem in biotechnological processes, due to the general lack of hardware sensor measurements of the variables describing the process dynamics. The objective of this paper is to review a number of software sensor design methods, including extended Kalman filters, receding-horizon observers, asymptotic observers, and hybrid observers, which can be efficiently applied to bioprocesses. These several methods are illustrated with simulation and real-life case studies.

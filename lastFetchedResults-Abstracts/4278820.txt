In the structured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, distributed lookup protocol Chord can effectively solve the problem of resource location. However, because the routing table in Chord suffers serious information redundancy and the lookup direction of Chord is only clockwise, it is not very efficient. Therefore, a routing algorithm BNN-Chord (Bidirectional Neighbor´s Neighbor Chord) based on NN-Chord (Neighbor´s Neighbor Chord) is proposed in this paper. In order to improve lookup efficiency, BNN-Chord adds the coverage and finger density of routing table and repetitious entries are deleted, meanwhile, it introduces bidirectional routing mechanism. Simulation experiments show that our algorithm can remarkably reduce the average lookup path length compared with Chord and can improve system performance.

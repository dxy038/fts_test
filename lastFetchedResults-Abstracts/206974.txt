Introduction: This study reviews the sexuality and effect of priming in the memory
dividing : Explicit memory and Implicit memory. The main objective of this study is assessment of sexuality on rate of Explicit and Implicit Function that result of different rate of priming in two kinds of memory .
Method and materials: The universal investigation consisted of students of Tonekabon, I.A.U. (boys and girls). Every group consists of 100 persons selected by random method. Memory test was done by cued - recall and word - stem complete (wsc) test for Explicit memory and Implicit memory. Results: The hypothesis are that :
Significant differences between rateof priming effect in women's Explicit memory and rate of priming effect in men's Explicit memory .
Rate of priming effect in men's Implicit memory is beyond ratio to women's Implicit memory.
Experiment of these hypothesis showed that first hypothesis is not true, but the second hypothesis is confirmed (approved).
This is mining that sexuality effect is different in rate of priming of women's Implicit memory and men's Implicit memory. Therefore, increase of rate function Implicit memory in men, ratio to rate function woment Implicit memory . Conclusion: final Result of is that. men are over sensitivity (sensibility) ratio to surface feature data.

The browsing of quality videos on small hand-held devices is a common scenario in pervasive media environments. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for video adaptation based on content recomposition. Our objective is to provide effective small size videos which emphasize the important aspects of a scene while faithfully retaining the background context. That is achieved by explicitly separating the manipulation of different video objects. A generic video attention model is developed to extract user-interest objects, in which a high-level combination strategy is proposed for fusing the adopted three types of visual attention features: intensity, color, and motion. Based on the knowledge of media aesthetics, a set of aesthetic criteria is presented. Accordingly, these objects are well reintegrated with the direct-resized background to optimally match the specific screen sizes. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach

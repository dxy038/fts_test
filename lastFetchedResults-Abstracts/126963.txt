Introduction & Objective: Halothane is the most common inhaled anesthetic agent that is used for general anesthesia in Iran and some other countries. It is utilized for induction and maintenance of anesthesia.
Materials & Methods: We evaluated the probable effect of Halothane on platelet function by Bleeding time method. Sixty patients undergoing elective surgery were randomly assigned to total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) or Halothane for maintenance of anesthesia. The patients did not have any baseline diseases. Their age ranged from 20 to 60 years. They did not consume any drug that impaired Platelet function. The technique for inductions of anesthesia was similar in both groups. The groups were selected randomly in 2 groups. In group "A" maintenance of anesthesia was done by Halothane and in group "B" by TIVA method, consisting Midazolam and Alfenta for maintenance of anesthesia. We measured Bleeding time in the groups before anesthesia and 15 minutes after induction of anesthesia.
Results: Age, sex and number of patients were similar in the groups. In the control group (B) BT encountered very little differences (P=0.8) but in group "A" there was significant increase. (P=0.008). The bleeding time was prolonged by 22% in group A (Halothane) but no changes were seen in group B.
Conclusions: The results showed Halothane can increase Bleeding time in clinical dosage.

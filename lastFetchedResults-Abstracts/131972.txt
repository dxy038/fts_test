Objective. The aim of this study was prevalence of acute otitis media in children (6mo.-6yr.) with febrile convulsion admitted to the Pediatric Ward of Hospital, 2001-2002 (Khordad 1380-81).
Method: Fifty children (6mo.-6yr.) with febrile convulsion were admitted to the Pediatric Ward of Ghaern Hospital between the 15^ of Khordad 1380 to the 15th of Khordad 1381. All of them were examined within the first six hours of admission. A questionnaire was filled for each child.
Results: The patients' mean age was 27.59 months (range 6.5mo.-5yr.) 35 patients were male, and 15 were female. Fifty-four percent of all patients had simple and 46% had complex febrile convulsions. The most common disease was acute otitis media (36%), followed by upper respiratory tract infections (34%), and gastroenteritis (30%). Association of acute otitis media with febrile convulsion in males was more in females (88.9% ,vs 11.1%, P= 0.029)
There was not significant statistical relation between acute otitis media and febrile type convulsions (simple-complex) (P= 0.87).

Accidental pollution events often threaten people's health and lives, and it is necessary to identify a pollutant source rapidly so that prompt actions can be taken to prevent the spread of pollution. But this identification process is one of the difficulties in the inverse problem areas. This paper carries out some studies on this issue. An approach using single sensor information with noise was developed to identify a sudden continuous emission trace pollutant source in a steady velocity field. This approach first compares the characteristic distance of the measured concentration sequence to the multiple hypothetical measured concentration sequences at the sensor position, which are obtained based on a source-three-parameter multiple hypotheses. Then we realize the source identification by globally searching the optimal values with the objective function of the maximum location probability. Considering the large amount of computation load resulting from this global searching, a local fine-mesh source search method based on priori coarse-mesh location probabilities is further used to improve the efficiency of identification. Studies have shown that the flow field has a very important influence on the source identification. Therefore, we also discuss the impact of non-matching flow fields with estimation deviation on identification. Based on this analysis, a method for matching accurate flow field is presented to improve the accuracy of identification. In order to verify the practical application of the above method, an experimental system simulating a sudden pollution process in a steady flow field was set up and some experiments were conducted when the diffusion coefficient was known. The studies showed that the three parameters (position, emission strength and initial emission time) of the pollutant source in the experiment can be estimated by using the method for matching flow field and source identification.

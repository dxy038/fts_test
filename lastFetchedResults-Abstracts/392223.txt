Objective: Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is one of the most common infectious diseases of the head and neck region requiring surgical intervention to relieve symptoms such as severe throat pain, fever, dysphagia, and trismus. However, the appropriate management of PTA is still controversial. In Europe and the US, immediate tonsillectomy under general anesthesia has been accepted as the treatment for PTA. But in Japan, immediate tonsillectomy has been regarded as contraindicated for PTA because of difficulties encountered in the operation during the acute stage, as well as possible postoperative complications. Methods: A total of 103 cases of PTA treated at our clinic during the past 16 years were reviewed; immediate tonsillectomies had been performed in 99 of them. Surgical findings, postoperative course, and bacteriological examination were surveyed. Results: The results showed that immediate tonsillectomy under general anesthesia was carried out safely without complications. Dramatic relief of the symptoms was obtained within a few days following each operation. A high incidence of anaerobes was observed by bacteriological examination, suggesting that sufficient drainage is required to treat this disease. Conclusion: We conclude that immediate tonsillectomy should be performed for peritonsillar abscess.

For generalized plants with a specific structure we provide solutions of decentralized H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-controller design problems by convex optimization without any conservatism. We apply our framework to multi-objective control problems with time-domain and exact disturbance decoupling constraints and to the problem of designing robust controllers against uncertain stochastic disturbances

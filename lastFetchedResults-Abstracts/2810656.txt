This paper presents the study of an optimization technique that is developed to locate the optimal location and the size (power rating) of Distributed Generation (DG) for its installation to a distribution system. In this study, a new technique called Exponential Inertia Weight Particle Swarm Optimization is proposed where a new exponential driver is introduced in standard Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). It was tested on IEEE 10 bus radial distribution system. The result is then compared with the result from Artificial Immune System (AIS). The objective is to minimize overall system power loss and improving bus voltage profile (Vm). The proposed optimization technique is developed under MATLAB programming. Test results indicate that EIPSO can reduce the total system loss and improve the voltage profile better than AIS for the distribution system under various loading conditions. To display the presence of harmonics, the developed EIPSO was integrated with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) harmonic load flow algorithm.

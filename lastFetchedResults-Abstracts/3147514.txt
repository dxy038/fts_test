By analyzing the impact factors of railway dangerous goods station, there are so many indexes of impact factors that not easy to grasp the key factors. We use the rough ant colony algorithm to attribute reduction for simplify the indexes in this paper. Then the attribute significance of rough set is applied to allocate weight coefficient for the reduced factor indexes with more objective way, which overcomes the subjective factor of the traditional method of determining the weight. That we can take effective measures focused on the important factors.

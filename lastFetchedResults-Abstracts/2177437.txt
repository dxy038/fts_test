Cudrania tricuspidata Bureau (CTB) has been used to treat allergies and inflammatory disease as folk medicine in Korea. The objective of this study is to determine whether a glycoprotein isolated from CTB (75 kDa) has a preventive potential of allergic inflammation caused by bisphenol A (BPA) in BALB/c mice and RBL-2H3 cells. Production of immunoglobulin (Ig) E and releasing of β-hexosaminidase and histamine at treatment of CTB glycoprotein (5–10 mg/kg, BW) were evaluated in mice serum. Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), activator protein (AP)-1, expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide (NO) production and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 were assessed in RBL-2H3 cells. In the results, CTB glycoprotein (10 mg/kg, BW) inhibited the production of IgE and releasing of β-hexosaminidase and histamine. Also, the CTB glycoprotein (100 μg/ml) blocked phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, and the activation of AP-1, while it inhibited the NO production, activities of COX-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-6, but not IL-1β. Taken together, the results of this study indicated that the CTB glycoprotein modulates the expression of allergic inflammation-related factors via the suppression of MAPK/AP-1 activation.

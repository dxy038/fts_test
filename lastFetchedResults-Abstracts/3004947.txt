This paper describes the existing challenges being experienced by the Glennan Microsystems Initiative in its goal to commercialize microsystems technology for application in harsh environments. The Glennan Microsystems Initiative develops, applies and commercializes microsystems technology for harsh environments. This Initiative integrates and augments substantial microsystems resources that currently exist, focuses them on areas of industrial importance and bridges key, critical gaps to commercialization through strategic investments. This paper describes the project, including the market drivers and opportunities and particularly our focus on silicon carbide based microsystem devices. The objectives of the Initiative will be described as well as the approach to achieve the objectives and metrics to measure progress. These objectives include both a technology development objective and a commercialization objective. Some current technology results will be presented as well as a plan for future activities.

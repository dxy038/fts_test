The dominance of coal resources in many countries and the advantage of coal to generate power in terms of cost and abundance of energy supply make coal a critical source of energy. As a result, considering the climate change challenges and the carbon dioxide emission problems from coal-fired power plants, make the development of carbon capture and storage technology crucial to reconcile the conflict between carbon dioxide emission mitigation and the need for sufficient energy supply to satisfy the demand. The research objective of this study is to overview the assessment methods of carbon capture technologies and to propose a holistic evaluation model for them.

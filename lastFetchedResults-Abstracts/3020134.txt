The electronic signature is a basic service of PKI (public key infrastructure) which allows authentification, confidentiality, integrity and the non-repudiation of electronic transactions. It is becoming a fundamental component of secure transactions. It will soon be able to substitute for the written signature. In this context, our objective is to contribute to the development of the creation of new e-services necessary to the growth of electronic transactions: the role associated with the signature, the enabling and delegation of the signature and the control of the electronic signature/multisignature of a document.

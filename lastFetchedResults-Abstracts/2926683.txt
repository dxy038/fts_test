Due to the limitation of the dynamic range of VLSI circuits in the implementation of the exponential bidirectional associative memory (eBAM), the optimal radix must be found in order to get the maximal dimension for the eBAM. It is also necessary to update the radix when new pattern pairs are to be stored. An optimal updating algorithm for the radix is also present. Besides, a pattern pair training algorithm is proposed to ensure every trained pair stored in the eBAM will be recalled when an input pair is located in its basin with radius r

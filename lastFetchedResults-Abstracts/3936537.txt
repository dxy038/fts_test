Significant research and development efforts by industry and government laboratories were brought to fruition in 1996 with the approval of the American National Standard (ANSI) T1.801.03 entitled &#8220;American National Standard for Telecommunications-Digital Transport of One-Way Video Signals-Parameters for Objective Performance Assessment.&#8221; This standard provides a set of objective parameters that have consistently demonstrated high correlation levels with subjective evaluations of digital video impairments. The parameters are technology-independent and may be used to measure the performance of a wide range of digital video compression, storage, and transmission systems. This paper presents an overview of the ANSI T1.801.03 parameters and summarizes other relevant standards activities and contributions

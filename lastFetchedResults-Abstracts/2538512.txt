Background and Objective: Endurance activity affects muscle gene expression leading to the improvement of its function and effectiveness. Meanwhile, PGC1 alpha transcription factor increases mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscles. This study was designed to investigate the effect of an endurance activity program on pgc1 alpha expression gene of fast and slow twitch muscles.

Materials and Methods: 14 male wistar rats weighing 113plusmn;20 grams under controlled conditions were housed after familiarization (231plusmn;24 grams) and then were randomly assigned to control (n=7) and treatment (n=7) groups. The treatment group performed an endurance activity program (30 m/min, 50 min, and 6 sessions per week for 14weeks) on a motorized treadmill. 48 hours after the end of the last session, the rats in both groups were anesthetized and sacrificed and the soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles were removed. Real time RTPCR was used to determine expression levels of pgc1 alpha gene. Ttest was used to compare the results.

Results: 14 weeks of endurance activity increased pgc1 alpha gene expression in extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles. The rate of this gene expression in soleus muscle of treatment group was significantly higher (P=0.0001) in comparison to the control group and also in the treatment group extensor digitorum longus muscle was significantly more (P=0.006) than the control group.

Conclusion: Though endurance activity has similar effect on slow and fast twitch pgc1 alpha gene expression, it seems that the intensity of this effect is higher in slow twitch muscle.

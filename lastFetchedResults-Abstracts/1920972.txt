It is well recognized that ST-segment depression is due to subendocardial ischemia secondary to an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure is associated with increased left atrial pressure, resulting in left atrial wall distension that contributes to increasing P-wave duration (PWD). The objective of this study was to determine if PWD measured in leads II and V5 during maximum exercise stress testing could be a reliable predictor of myocardial ischemia. Patients with suspected coronary disease underwent maximum exercise stress testing with myocardial perfusion imaging. PWD was measured using leads II and V5 at rest and after exercise, with electrocardiographic complexes magnified 4 times (100 mm/s, 40 mm/mV). The change in PWD was calculated as Δ = PWDrecovery − PWDrest. ΔPWD and ST-segment changes were related to the absence or presence of ischemia (localized reversible perfusion abnormalities) on myocardial perfusion imaging scans. ΔPWD had sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 82%, negative predictive power (NPP) of 90%, and positive predictive power of 57%. ST-segment change had sensitivity of 34%, specificity of 87%, NPP of 80%, and positive predictive power of 47%. When ΔPWD and ST changes were combined, sensitivity increased to 79% and NPP increased to 91%. In conclusion, ΔPWD outperformed ST-segment changes in predicting myocardial ischemia on myocardial perfusion imaging scans. Furthermore, when ΔPWD and ST-segment changes were combined, sensitivity and NPP were also significantly increased. In this study population, measuring ΔPWD substantially increased the diagnostic value of maximum exercise stress testing.

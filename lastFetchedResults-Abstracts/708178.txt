Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of successful closed reduction (CR) of dislocated prosthetic hips performed by emergency physicians (EPs) as well as the incidence of acute complications.
Methods
The study design was an explicit chart review set at an academic ED with an annual census of 55 000. The study was performed on March 1, 1999 to February 28, 2004. Patients were identified using coded ED diagnoses, and data were obtained by a trained abstractor.
Results
One hundred twelve dislocations in 66 patients had attempted CR in the ED. Eighty-one had CR attempted solely by an EP with 91% success. Twenty-eight of the remaining 31 (90%) had successful CR performed by either an orthopedic surgeon or both an EP and an orthopedic surgeon. Overall, 10 patients (9%) failed ED CR. No postreduction complications were identified in any patient.
Conclusions
EPs can safely and successfully perform CR on patients with dislocated total hip arthroplasties.

The paper presents a method pointed out to detect and to correct the alterations of(i) exposure, (ii) out of focus, and (iii) Gaussian noise affecting contemporaneously the images acquired into flow cytometer measurement devices. These alterations reduce the image quality and interfere with the correct micro nucleus detection in lymphocyte. The objective of the proposed correction is (i) to make the image able to be correctly processed by the pattern matching algorithm in order to detect the micro nucleus into human lymphocytes, (ii) to minimize the doubtful detections, and (iii) to enhance the confidence that in the rejected images micro nucleuses are not included. Numerical and experimental tests confirm the validity of the proposed correction method and permit to evaluate the upper bound and lower bound of the admissible variation range of each alteration

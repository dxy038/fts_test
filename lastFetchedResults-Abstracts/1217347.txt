Background and Objective: Untreated phenyl ketonuria (PKU)
results in high serum phenylalanine and severe irreversible mental
and motor deterioration. The aim of this study was to investigate
the anthropometric incices and some of contributing factors in
disease control in patients suffering from PKU  < 18yr old in
Khuzestan province.
Subjects and Methods: This study was conducted in 2012 on 56
PKU patients aged 2 months-18yr (34 males, 22 females) in
Abuzar childrenâ€™s hospital, the only center for referral and
management of PKU in Khuzestan province. Weight and height
were measured using standard methods and were compared with
the WHO standards. Nutritional indices, including weight for age
(W/A), height for age (H/A), and body mass index for age (BMI/A)
were determined using WHO Anthro-software. Based on advised
serum phenylalanine levels, patients were divided to two controlled
and uncontrolled groups.
Results: W/A and H/A indices were lower than -2SD in 17.85%
and 15.09% of subjects respectively. According to height index
two patients had severe malnutrition ( < -3SD); both of them were
girls. Nine percent of patients (4 males, 1 female) had BMI <  -2SD.
Regarding W/A, H/A, BMI/A there were no difference between the
controlled and uncontrolled groups.
Conclusions: Anthropometric data in PKU patients showed an
inappropriate condition of growth without correlation to disease
control. Providing specific semi-synthetic foods (limited by cost)
and sufficient supplementation can improve these indices.

Software maintenance and evolution can be made easier with program comprehension techniques. The aim of this workshop is to gather together researchers working in the area of program comprehension with an emphasis on dynamic analysis. We are interested in investigating how dynamic analysis techniques are or can be used to enable better comprehension of a software system. The objective is to find common case studies, compare existing techniques, and find possible symbioses for existing solutions. Building upon the previous edition of the workshop, PCODA 2005, we aim to set up a forum for exchanging experiences, discussing solutions, and exploring new ideas.

A fundamental issue that must be confronted in any systematic synthesis of magnetic coils is the possibility of inventing equivalent yoke configurations, i. e., different combinations of core geometry and winding pattern that produce the same magnetic field in the region of electron interaction. It is claimed that this objective is achievable. A numerical procedure exists for determining the wire pattern that must be wound on a given core to reproduce a desired magnetic field. The approach was derived from an extension of the integral equation technique for field calculations. The complementary design issue of curve fitting practical winding patterns from knowledge of only the initial harmonics has been discussed in the preceding paper.

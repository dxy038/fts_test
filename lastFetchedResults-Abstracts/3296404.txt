As demonstrated in microelectronics, the batch fabrication based on the processing of wafers can lead to a significant reduction in prize as well as in size. This concept was adapted to the fabrication of imaging optics extensively used in mobile phone cameras relying on small pixels but was limited in resolution. UV-replication is the standard technique for the objective fabrication where a liquid polymer, which fills the molding tool of the lenses, is hardened using UV-radiation. This technique is essential in single aperture objectives as well as in innovate array camera approaches which are at the stage of commercialization.

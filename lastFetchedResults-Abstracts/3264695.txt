In this paper a bi-static, fully polarimetric Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Radar system for the detection of buried weapons as well as other man-made targets by scattering matrix decomposition is presented. A bulk good made of chunks of sand-lime brick is non-destructively inspected with the objective to survey the interior and to robustly detect discontinuities in the permittivity which might indicate a buried target. The method employs the theory of Pauli scattering matrix decomposition onto the quad-polarized Radar data to improve the detection decision. The investigations are applied to three scenarios, i.e. a model of an assault rifle, the same rifle completely buried under chunks of sand-lime brick and just a bulk good made of the same chunks. Within these investigations a novel broadband dual-polarized antenna which operates between 0.8 to 8 GHz was developed. The main features of the tapered slot lines Vivaldi antennas are a high polarization purity and a symmetric layout resulting in equal phase centres for both polarizations. The experimental validation promises for improved detection capability of buried targets by simultaneously providing high range resolution.

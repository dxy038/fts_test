Energy efficiency is one important issue of WSN(wireless sensor network). The energy of nodes should be well utilized in order to extend the network lifetime and to improve the network coverage while they are deployed over the area of interest. Here, an algorithm is proposed to deploy nodes, and it has the following characteristics: ensuring the traffic load balance among sensor nodes, almost completely exhausting the energy, satisfying the non-uniform distribution of event arrival in the monitored area, which always occurs in practice and is the essential improvement over the previous achievements. Our main objective is to thoroughly utilize the energy. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of our proposed algorithm.

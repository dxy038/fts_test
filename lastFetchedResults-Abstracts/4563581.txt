This paper presents a new type of antenna that can be used in linear wireless sensors networks (LWSN) in the ISM frequency band (2.4-2.48 GHz) with bidirectional characteristics in order to maximize the link efficiency. The antenna consists of an array of 4 transverse waveguide slots, fed out of phase, and the position of the slots has been optimized by means of simulations taking into account all secondary effects.

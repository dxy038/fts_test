By exploiting the reflective and refractive nature of high-frequency (HF) radiowave propagation through the ionosphere or the conducting sea surface, over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) systems perform wide-area surveillance at long range well beyond the limit of the horizon of conventional line-of-sight (LOS) radars. Improved characterizations of the targets can be achieved by using multiple OTHRs operating simultaneously as compared to a single OTHR operating alone. In this paper, we consider concurrent operations of two OTHR systems that occupy the same frequency band with different chirp waveforms. The objective is to respond to the advanced wide-area surveillance needs without reducing the wave repetitive frequency. For this purpose, a new cross-radar interference cancellation technique is developed and its effectiveness is verified through both analytical and simulation results

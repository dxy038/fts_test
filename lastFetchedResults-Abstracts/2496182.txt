Objective: The aim of this study ‎was to determine the oxidative ‎stress; serum level of Total ‎Antioxidant Capacity (TAC)and ‎Malondialdehyde (MDA) level ‎and the depression score among ‎the depressed rotational shift ‎workers in Shahid Tondgouyan ‎Refinery in Tehran (Iran).‎
Methods: A cross-sectional study ‎was conducted among all the ‎‎189 shift workers in Shahid ‎Tondgouyan oil refinery who ‎were eligible to participate in the ‎study.  They did not take any ‎antidepressants for two months ‎or any supplements for two ‎weeks prior to the study entry. ‎Written consent was obtained ‎from the participants. 21- Item ‎Beck Depression Inventory was ‎used to measure the depression ‎level. Furthermore, body weight, ‎height and systolic and diastolic ‎blood pressure were collected ‎from all the participants. The ‎levels of Total Antioxidant ‎Capacity (TAC) and ‎Malondialdehyde (MDA) were ‎measured by 8 ml fasting blood ‎sample. MDA was determined by ‎thiobarbituric acid reaction. ‎Serum total antioxidants were ‎measured using the ‎spectrophotometric ABTS. In the ‎ABTS test, 2,2’-azinobis (3-‎ethylbenzthiazoline-6-acid) ‎‎(ABTS) is converted into its ‎radical cation (ABTS•+) by ‎addition of sodium persulphate. ‎This blue-green radical cation ‎absorbs light at 734 nm. ABTS•+ ‎is reactive towards most ‎antioxidants. Descriptive ‎statistics, ANOVA, ANCOVA and ‎regression tests and correlation ‎were used to analyze the data ‎using SPSS software version 16‎‏.‏
Results:  The age of the ‎participants ranged from 21 to 52 ‎years. The mean age of the ‎participants was 30.58 year ‎‎(±6.97yr). Of all the participants, ‎‎28% (n= 53) had no depression ‎symptoms (depression score ‎between 0 and 9), 65.1% (n=123) ‎were categorized as having mild ‎depression (depression score ‎between 10 and 18) and 6.9% ‎‎(n=13) were categorized as ‎having moderate depression ‎‎(depression score between 19 ‎and 29). The participants’ BMI ‎ranged from 15.9 to 34.3; the ‎mean BMI of the participants was ‎‎24.82 kg/m2 (+ 3.81 kg/m2). The ‎mean of the serum TAC level ‎was 2.51 (± 0.56) mg/dl, and the ‎mean serum MDA level was ‎‎3.67(± 1.08) µmol/l. There was a ‎significant difference in the mean ‎TAC concentration between the ‎non-depressed group and the ‎group with mild depression ‎‎(p=0.029).‎
Conclusion: Depression was ‎associated with reduced mean ‎TAC concentration and an ‎increase in MDA level.  There ‎was a linear relationship between ‎the depression score and shift ‎work experience among the ‎rotational shift workers, which ‎showed a high level of stress and ‎depression among the shift-‎workers.‎

To evaluate the experimental teaching quality (ETQ), considering singe level index can´t reflect the ETQ comprehensively, a two-level evaluation index system is established based on the principles of the ETQ. The superior level is subdivided into several sub-aspects which can reflect the superior aspect more exactly. Then, in order to avoid the subjectivity of indexes weights, an entropy approach is introduced. Thereafter, considering the `multi-level´ and `grey´ features of the evaluation system, a model based on multi-level grey relational analysis (MGRA) is constructed to evaluate the ETQ. Finally, a case study is present to demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of the ETQ evaluation index system and MGRA model. The evaluation results show that MGRA is a scientific, objective and reliable approach which provides a new thought and method for the evaluation of ETQ.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that affect the quality of cytologic cervical cancer screening conducted in public sector clinics in Sonora, Mexico.
STUDY DESIGN: We assessed the quality of cervical cytology before and after a 2-hour training session and the implementation of cervical spatulas and endocervical brushes. Additionally, we conducted a cross-sectional study of reproductive aged women who attended public clinics in paired border communities in Sonora and Arizona. Cervical cytologic specimens (n = 2436) were collected and compared for adequacy and cytologic diagnosis and for the prevalence of human papillomavirus infection.
RESULTS: The training intervention achieved significantly improved the rates of satisfactory but limited smears and unsatisfactory smears. The cross-sectional study revealed comparable quality indicators for cytologic specimens that were collected in Sonora and Arizona clinics.
CONCLUSION: A high-quality cytology-based cervical cancer screening program is possible in public sector clinics in Sonora, with indicators similar to those achieved in comparable Arizona clinics.

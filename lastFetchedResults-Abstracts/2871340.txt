An urgent need for energy management has emerged all over the world because ever growing consumption demands will eventually surpass the supply of critical resources. Energy management should be more effective and efficient in smart cities. In this study, we propose a method for the energy management with a battery system of a smart city. An energy supply is optimized using the newsboy model. Energy management is discussed in light of optimization and the need to cater to demands for excess energy. A basic model of a smart city with a battery system is constructed. The model consists of eight houses and a power station. A battery is implemented in each house to supplement an energy shortage. The objective is to find the optimal energy supply which minimizes the cost function. The optimal energy supply and the minimum cost are varied with the cost coefficients for surplus and shortage of energy. First, the optimal energy supply is estimated if the cost coefficients are the same for surplus and shortage of energy. It is 0.4 kW/house; however, different battery systems are required for eight houses with different energy demands. Second, the effects of cost coefficients are investigated. The battery system is more required with a higher cost coefficient of energy surplus. The power station should supply a larger energy to a smart city with a higher cost coefficient of energy shortage. Actual energy demands on different types of buildings should be examined in greater detail for more effective and efficient energy management for a smart city.

The simulation of pedestrian crowd that reflects reality is a major challenge for scientists and research. Several simulation pedestrian crowd models have been proposed such as cellular automata models, agent-based models, regression models, etc. It is very important to note that agent based models are able, over others approaches to provide a natural description of the system and then to capture emergent phenomena and complex human behaviors. Usually, these models include psychological theories in order to obtain a more realistic simulation of pedestrianÂ´s behavior. However, a great number of them do not cover all the psychological factors necessary for a pedestrian located in a crowd. This causes a lack of realism. Thus, we propose a multi-agent simulation model which is based on psychological theories. It takes into account the major normal conditions of a simple pedestrian situated in a crowd such as his preferences, a realistic perception of the environment in which he is situated, etc. Our objective is to simulate realistically the pedestrian crowd phenomenon towards a simulation of a believable pedestrian behavior. The conducted experiments show that our model is able to produce realistic pedestrian behaviors.

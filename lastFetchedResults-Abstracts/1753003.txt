
Objective:
The purpose of this study is to present and analyze a model according to which
the prediction of job satisfaction based on self-efficacy beliefs, teacher's
sense of efficacy, job stress and hierarchy of needs in exceptional children's
teachers is investigated. Method:
To do this, 165 subjects (99 females and 66 males) among the exceptional
children's teachers of elementary grades in lorestan province were selected
using the multi-stage cluster sampling and were tested using the questionnaires
of JDI, SGSES, TSES, and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Results:
The findings showed that the job satisfaction of these teachers is lower than
average. In the first phase, the results of path analysis suggested that the
proposed model is not fitted; however, extracting the fit indices of the
corrected model confirms the coincidence between the corrected and the proposed
models. Based on the path coefficients, the effect of general self-efficacy on
teacher's sense of efficacy and the effect of teacher's sense of efficacy and
the hierarchy of needs on job satisfaction was confirmed. Also, a significant
relationship between job satisfaction and security/social needs was observed.
The analysis of demographic characteristics showed that the job satisfaction of
mentally handicapped group is more than that of the deaf group, but there was
no significant relationship between age, education and service years with any of
job satisfaction dimensions, and the relationship between sex and job
satisfaction was significant only in terms of satisfaction toward colleagues.
The difference between females and males in teacher's sense of efficacy and
needs levels (except the security needs) was significant; however, for general
self-efficacy and job stress, no significant difference was found between two
groups. &nbsp;Conclusion:
It can be concluded that job satisfaction is a multi-dimensional concept in
which more than one factor interfere.

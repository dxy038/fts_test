We consider regular logical topologies constructed from broadcast-and-select WDM networks. We reconfigure the nodesÂ´ locations by appropriately retuning their wavelengths but the original logical topology remains intact. We show that an optimal node reconfiguration results in as much as 20% performance gain for a bidirectional ring. Moreover, a high performance gain is also expected when the traffic pattern is a cluster type. More importantly, unlike the previous work, which was focused on a single topology, here we provide a unified approach to this optimal node assignment problem. We have thoroughly investigated the impact of topological structure, network traffic pattern, number of transceivers and the network size on the performance gain as a result of performing optimal node reconfigurations

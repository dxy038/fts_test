In this work, we investigate the problems related to the planning of the broadband powerline communications (B-PLC) access network. This design problem is subdivided into two main optimization parts; namely the generalized base station placement (GBSP) problem and the PLC channels allocation problem (CAP). These two problems are considered as multi-objective optimization problems; therefore, they are solved through different possible multi-optimization algorithms (MOA). The investigated MOAs and other required modules are implemented in a planning tool, which is designed for the planning of the B-PLC access networks and therefore it is called PANDeMOO (powerline communications access networks designer based on multi-objective optimization).

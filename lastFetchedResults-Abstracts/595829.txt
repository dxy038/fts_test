The aim of this study was to examine trends of the number of suicides in four municipalities of West-Herzegovina Canton (Siroki Brijeg, Ljubuski, Grude, Posusje) during the period 1984 through 2008, as well as case distribution by gender, age and how the suicides were committed. Study results showed the total number of cases during the studied period was 134. Number of suicide cases in the prewar period during 8 years (1984-1991) was 33. During the war period (1992-1995) the number of cases dropped to 15. Statistically significant growth of number of suicides (86 cases) in 12 postwar years (1996-2008), compared to prewar and war figures, is interesting. Gender distribution research results showed pres- ence of statistically significant difference in number of cases with males and females, with 106 and 28, respectively (p<0.01). Age distribution research showed that suicide cases are more frequent with two age groups (20-29 and over 60 years), with statistically significant difference compared to figures for the other groups. Breakdown of manner how suicide was committed is the following: hanging (32%), fire weapon (22.8%), drowning in water storage cisterns (11.2%) and other manners (14.60%). Significant growth of suicide number in postwar period indicates the need for further research of socio-economic determinants of health and war traumas with the objective of putting some light on etiological factors of this cause of death.

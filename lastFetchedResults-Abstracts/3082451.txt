Demands for the advancement of electronic packaging technology are relentless, from pursuing smaller package size with greater functionality to lowering the package cost. Notwithstanding, compared with "all-in-one" system-on-chip (SOC) technology, system-in-package (SiP) obviously demonstrates its own distinctive advantages where functions per unit area and costs are both reasonably justified, not to mention the favorable shorter development cycle time by using commercial off-the-shelf components. The objective of this study is manifold: as one of the most emerging packaging solutions with extensive market demands in recent years, system-in-package (SiP) possesses a number of advantages over conventional packaging approaches and therefore it is appealing to have further discussions on, accompanied with the overview on the SiP trends and applications. Besides, in order to develop timely products to response to this ever-changing consumer electronics market, this work illustrates the true needs to have good co-ordinations amongst various natures of industries, including integrated device manufacturers (IDM), semiconductor assembly and test subcontractors (SAT subcons), substrate suppliers and board assembly. Afterwards, we put forward explanations for the needs to have a centre with integrated package design, analysis and characterization capabilities to assist the industries to adopt SiP technology. Examples like advanced substrate designs, high-frequency electrical design/simulation for wireless applications and high-performance thermo-mechanical analysis for complicated geometry of advanced package are also included in this study. Basically, resources (human resources and infrastructure) and latest technical information are indispensable for timely and cost-effective SiP solutions, contributing to design for manufacturability and reliability. Discussions on modeling &amp; simulations and design for manufacturability are also included

We consider the problem of joint battery management and modulation optimization for maximizing the lifetime of a battery-powered wireless system while satisfying certain QoS constraints. A delay-constrained data transmission scenario is considered where the battery state information is only available at the beginning of the entire transmission duration. The corresponding problem is formulated as a multi-objective stochastic optimization problem, which is hard to solve. We approximately transform the original problem to be a multi-objective deterministic optimization problem by using a lower bound to replace the objective function of the original problem. The optimal and fast suboptimal solutions are developed. Simulation results are provided to show that the proposed algorithms can significantly increase the lifetime of the system.

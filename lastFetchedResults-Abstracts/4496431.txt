This paper reports a new approach to digital microfluidic systems based on asymmetric electrowetting-on-dielectric (AEWOD) mechanism. On the AEWOD device, droplets can be oscillated or continuously pumped on an open surface by none or limited control electric circuits. This paper presents: (1) the AEWOD phenomenon, (2) droplet oscillation controlled by AEWOD force, and (3) the demonstration of unidirectional and bidirectional droplet pumping on AEWOD device.

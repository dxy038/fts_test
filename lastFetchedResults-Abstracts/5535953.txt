For long time, the rationalization of distribution scientific and technological elements has been important issues of the regional coordination development. Based on the perfect mechanism, the paper establishes a linear programming model of effect of technology elements flow, under the restrict conditions of resources available, environmental bearing capacity, system constraints extent and the amount of scientific and technological elements. To maximize the objective function, the optimal solution is also presented in the condition of network with unipolar city. It is concluded that, on the perfect mechanism, in the regional economic system with unipolar elements of technology, non-competitive resources could realize Pareto optimal distribution by profit-making technology elements flow, whereas competitive resources could not reach Pareto optimal distribution, and that, when the marginal income of technology elements flow is equal to the marginal cost, profits of technology elements flow maximizes.

Background: Elderly people may benefit from sensory stimulation to increase food intake since
anorexia of ageing is prevalent among them. An optimal MSG concentration may increase the palatability of
foods but this depends on the food and chemosensory status of the taster. Currently, the results on taste enhancing
to increase intake are inconsistent. Objective: To find an optimal preferred MSG concentration in mashed
potatoes, spinach and ground beef and to determine whether this concentration increases consumption of these
foods among institutionalized elderly people. Design: Single blind within subject cross-over study performed at
the laboratory and in the residentsâ€™ own apartments. Participants: 33 elderly and 29 young people in the sensory
study and 53 elderly people in the intake study. Measurements: Pleasantness of the foods was rated of the foods
each with 0, 0.5, 0.8, 1.3 and 2.0 g of MSG/100g. Intake was measured by weighing back leftovers of 2 meals
with MSG (0.5% in mashed potatoes, 2% in spinach and ground meat) and without MSG. Results: 0.5% MSG
(p<0.05) was preferred in mashed potatoes but no optimal preferred concentration was found for spinach and
ground beef, possibly because of their complex taste. Intake was not different between the foods with and without
MSG or the total meal (all p>0.68). Conclusion: MSG (0.5% and 2%) does not guarantee a higher intake among
elderly. The chemosensory heterogeneity of the elderly population requires more individual flavor enhancement
to improve the dietary intake and sensory experience.

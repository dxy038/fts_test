Data mining is the extraction of knowledge from large databases. One of the popular data mining techniques is Classification in which different objects are classified into different classes depending on the common properties among them. Decision Trees are widely used in Classification. This paper proposes a tool which applies an enhanced Decision Tree Algorithm to detect the suspicious e-mails about the criminal activities. An improved ID3 Algorithm with enhanced feature selection method and attribute- importance factor is applied to generate a better and faster Decision Tree. The objective is to detect the suspicious criminal activities and minimize them. ThatÂ´s why the tool is named as &#8220;Z-Crime&#8221; depicting the &#8220;Zero Crime&#8221; in the society. This paper aims at highlighting the importance of data mining technology to design proactive application to detect the suspicious criminal activities.

The objective of this work is to solve the problem of fast dynamics which appears in the synthesis of LPV controllers using a single quadratic Lyapunov function. This can be a serious problem for controller implementation or computer simulation. The solution is achieved by means of an extra LMI added to the set of LMI\Â´s used to design the controller. This LMI defines the region where the poles of the "frozen" LTI closed loop system will be.

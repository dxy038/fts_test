Different tillage techniques affect the root absorption of macronutrients and trace elements. Our objective was to study the effect of conventional and zero tillage on the concentration of macro- and micronutrients and specially heavy metals and their distribution in soybean, wheat and maize plants in a area located far from contamination sources. The study was performed in a field experiment initiated in 1979 at the Agricultural Experimental Station located at Pergamino (Buenos Aires province, Argentina). The soil is a Pergamino Series Typic Argiudoll. The crops were wheat–soybean/corn in continuous sequence, in plots subjected to no tillage and conventional tillage. The experiment was a randomized block design, with four replications of each tillage treatment. Fertilizers were applied annually, averaging 90 kg N/ha/yr and 18 kg P/ha/yr. Wheat, corn and soybean were sampled in 1997 and separated into roots, aboveground material and grains. The three crops were analyzed for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), potassium (K), boron (B), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn). Macronutrient concentration was higher in grains than in roots (i.e. N in corn: grains, 11.5 g kg−1; roots, 6.9 g kg−1). Micronutrients and heavy metals concentration were higher, with the exceptions of Mo and Cd, in roots than grains (i.e. Zn in soybean: grains, 44.85 mg kg−1; roots, 64.73 mg kg−1 or Cr in wheat: grains, 1.77 mg kg−1; roots, 19.70 mg kg−1). The effects of tillage were limited for nutrient concentrations, but significant for heavy metals. Soybean appeared to be more sensitive than cereals to the apparent effect of soil tillage. Compared with early published data of soils at the same location, there was only a significant relationship between Zn concentration in soils and its accumulation in plant roots.

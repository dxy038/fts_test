Objective
This study was undertaken to determine characteristics associated with physical injury in female sexual assault victims.
Study design
All females who were 15 years or older presenting after sexual assault to an urban emergency department during a 34-month period underwent standardized evaluation. Analysis was performed by Ï‡2 and logistic regression.
Results
Of 819 women, 52% had general body and 20% had genital-anal trauma; 41% were without injury. General body trauma was independently associated with being hit or kicked (odds ratio [OR] = 7.7, 95% CI, 5.1-11.7), attempted strangulation (OR = 4.2, 95% CI, 2.5-7.2), oral or anal penetration (OR = 1.7, 95% CI, 1.2-2.3), and stranger (OR = 2.4, 95% CI, 1.7-3.4) assault. Genital-anal injury was more frequent in victims younger than 20 and older than 49 years (P<.05), in virgins (OR = 2.7, 95% CI, 1.4-5.4) and those examined within 24 hours (OR = 1.7, 95% CI, 1.2-2.4) and after anal assault (OR = 1.7, 95% CI, 1.1-2.6).
Conclusion
General body injury is primarily associated with situational factors, whereas genital-anal injury is less frequent and related to victim age, virginal status, and time to examination.

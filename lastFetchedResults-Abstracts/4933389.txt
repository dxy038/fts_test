In this paper, a new solution to improve the correlation matrix of two closely spaced antennas is illustrated. Contrary to the use of a decoupling network, a physical separator between the antennas is considered. And hence, the use of a metallic plane (PEC) and a metamaterial surface (with bidirectional PMC response) are compared in terms of correlation matrix improvement and radiation patterns.

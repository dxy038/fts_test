In this study, modern ICT and digital technology allow captured images to be transferred over Internet protocol to central monitoring centre. Internet protocol (IP) camera provides remotely and cost effectively monitor system. IP cameras also are flexible, powerful and wide ranging system applications. The objective of this study is to test the feasibility of using IP camera imageries for the particulate matter of size less than 10 - micron (PM10) measurements. Multispectral data have been collected by an IP camera for the purpose of determine air quality. The aim of this study is the retrieval of PM10 from IP imageries. PM10 measurements were collected simultaneously with the image acquisition using a DustTrak aerosol monitor 8520. The digital numbers (DN) for each band corresponding to the in situ data sets of PM10 measurements were extracted and then the digital numbers for the three visible bands, (blue, green and red), were converted into radiance and reflectance values. After that, the reflectance recorded by the digital camera was subtracted by the reflectance of the known surface and we obtained the reflectance caused by the atmospheric components. The results of PM10 measurements showed a high correlation between the estimated PM10 and measured PM10 values. This indicates that the high spatial resolution IP camera is very useful for PM10 mapping over USM campus. Penang, Malaysia.

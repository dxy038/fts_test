In the multi-core and multiprocessor domain, it is very important to make each processor high-utilization and make the workload balance for the large-scale real-time system. In this paper we propose a new heuristic partition scheduling algorithm-Base-Utilization (BU) algorithm. The objective of the algorithm is to decrease time wasting of each processor by means of allocating the tasks directly or indirectly onto appropriate processors according to the utilization of each task. Evaluation result shows that the algorithm can find the nearest full utilization and make the workload balance for each processors or cores.

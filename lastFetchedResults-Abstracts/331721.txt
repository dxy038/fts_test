Objective: The aim of this paper is to review recent developments in dental ceramics related both to the refinement of existing materials and technologies and to the development of new techniques.

Data sources: The appropriate literature has been reviewed and the relevant information selected for inclusion in this article.

Conclusion: It is concluded that the main advances are related to developments aimed at overcoming the mechanical shortcomings of ceramic materials, such as their inherent brittleness. Several new systems have been developed, some of which appear to be very promising, but there are, as yet, no data related to the long term performance of restorations by these new techniques.

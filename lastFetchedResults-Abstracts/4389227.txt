This study deals with decentralized and hierarchical control for electric power networks by using overlapping information. The control objective is to minimize the cost function of the load frequency control problem. The control law consists of three steps. We apply the decentralized hierarchical control methodology to large-scale electrical power networks consisting of distributed power storage and generation sources such as batteries and wind power generators. Through several numerical simulation results of decentralized power networks, we verified their stability, compared the proposed and the previous decentralized methods, and showed the effectiveness of the proposed method.

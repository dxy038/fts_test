A variety of image interpolation methods have been used in order to obtain high-resolution (HR) images. In this paper, we propose an advanced bilinear interpolation algorithm which improves edge components. The conventional bilinear image interpolation method has a serious problem such as blurring artifacts. In the experimental results, our proposed algorithm outperforms the bilinear image interpolation not only objective qualities but also subjective qualities.

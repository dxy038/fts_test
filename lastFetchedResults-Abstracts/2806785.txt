During recent days, the large problem space of very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits has led global routing problem to a NP Complete one. With the advent of three dimensional integrated circuits (3D IC) the problem has become more complex. In this paper, a multi-objective global routing technique is formulated using fuzzy logic to get rid of the limitations of deterministic approaches. During global routing the decision is taken from a fuzzy logic expert system depending upon some generated pre-routing guiding information. Proposed approach is mainly focused on the modern generation 3D ICs. This primary work is mainly incorporated in the standard cell design for 3D ICs. A two-pin global router tool is designed based on the proposed algorithm resulting 85-97% routability in negligible time for ISPDÂ´98 benchmarks.

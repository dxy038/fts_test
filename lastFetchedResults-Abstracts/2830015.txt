This paper deals with dynamic Multi-Vehicle Routing Problem in both deterministic and stochastic scenarios; the objective is to find the best paths for a fleet of vehicles, with the aim of visiting a set of targets. Based on the Cooperative Receding Horizon approach proposed in [4] for the Euclidean case, this paper i) develop a routing algorithm for graph-represented mission spaces, ii) presents a switching algorithm, which is able to dynamically change the vehicle behaviour according to the time-variable configuration of both vehicles and targets, as well as to handle the discovery of unknown targets. Simulations show the algorithm effectiveness.

This paper presents an approach to address conflicting motion tasks in multi-objective control of virtual humans. The novelty in our approach is that we can handle the inequality constraints and maintain the passivity as well. The targets associated with lower priority tasks are constrained so as to guarantee that the higher priority tasks can be sufficiently fulfilled. The multi-objective controller takes as inputs the desired task targets and computes the optimal task wrenches by solving an optimization problem. Finally, the joint torques are computed according to the optimal task wrenches. This control approach can be realized in real-time. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the behavior of a virtual human.

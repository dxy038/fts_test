Objective: The aim of this study was to measure and calculate oxygen transport variables in uncomplicated term pregnancies. Study Design: Ten normotensive primiparous women between 36 and 38 weeksâ€™ gestation underwent pulmonary and radial arterial catheterization as part of a larger study. Seven women had studies repeated at approximately 12 weeks post partum. Measurements were made with patients in the left lateral recumbent position after a 30-minute stabilization period. Cardiac output was measured with the thermodilution technique. Blood samples were obtained simultaneously from the pulmonary and radial arteries and analyzed in duplicate for oxygen content with a blood gas analyzer. Results: The oxygen contents of both arterial and mixed venous blood are significantly lower (P< .05) in the third trimester of pregnancy (15.96 and 11.97 mL/dL, respectively) than in the postpartum period (18.00 and 13.54 mL/dL). The fall in oxygen content during pregnancy prevents any significant increase in oxygen delivery in the third trimester (867.59 mL/min) relative to the postpartum period (806.50 mL/min, P not significant). Conclusion: This is the first report of directly measured oxygen transport variables in healthy pregnant women. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;180:406-9.)

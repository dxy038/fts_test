We evaluated a family with 30 members, 3 of whom had incessant polymorphous and bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (VT) that was electrocardiographically similar to that described in other familial polymorphic VT series; the VT was unrelated to exercise and asymptomatic. More subtle, but morphologically similar, ventricular arrhythmias were detected in 3 other family members. Genes related to intracellular calcium transport were specifically excluded.

Here we demonstrate the optical properties of a spherical aberration corrected transmission electron microscope by means of beam tilt series. The high-resolution capabilities are characterized by the measured residual wave aberrations up to the fifth order. Limits for the wave aberration coefficients are determined. We compare the phase-contrast transfer function of the corrected versus the uncorrected objective lens with the help of diffractograms. The information limit and the improvement of the point resolution is discussed.

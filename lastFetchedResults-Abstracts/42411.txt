In problems with large deformation, utilization of objective stress and strain tensors is necessary to handel rigid rotation of the body correctly. In this paper, an elemental form of Green strain increment tensor is derived, which is a new technique for the incorporation of an objective strain increment in finite element formulation. Based on the derived kinematic relations, a finite element formulation is developed which is capable to include large displacements as well as large rotations of the material particles.  To achieve the most effective procedure, the formulation has been derived based on the updated Lagrangian approach. The accuracy and stability of the present formulation and the related algorithm are tested in a numerical example, and the solutions are compared with the existing analytical solutions.

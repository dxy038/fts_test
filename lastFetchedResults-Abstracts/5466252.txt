The European Research Program ACTS (Advanced Communication Technologies and Services) started at the end of 1995 to support collaborative mobile research and development. Within ACTS the project FRAMES (Future Radio Wideband Multiple Access System) has been set up with an objective to define a proposal for a UMTS radio access system. During the first project year, an assessment of several multiple access schemes against UMTS criteria has been carried out within the FRAMES project. Based on this comprehensive evaluation, a harmonized multiple access platform has been designed consisting of two modes: FMA1, a wideband TDMA with and without spreading and FMA2, a wideband CDMA. In general, both FMA1 and FMA2 can fulfil the UMTS objectives and form the FRAMES input into UMTS standardization. However, FMA1 seems more suitable for bursty types of traffic and in addition to FDD also for asymmetric TDD operation while FMA2 is better suited for moderately varying circuit switched data in public radio environments. The paper describes the FMA concept, the FMA1 frame and burst structure and the service mapping. The joint detection aspects are examined together with the FMA2 frame structure and interfrequency handover

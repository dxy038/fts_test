Background and objective: Nasal carrier state play a significant role in pathogenesis of staphylococcal infections. Multiple factors such as HIV infection and stage of disease can increase nasal colonization rate. This study was conducted to determine rate of nasal colonization and its related factors in HIV infected patients.

Material and methods: In this study staphylococcus nasal carriage and its susceptibility pattern by disk diffusion method was performed in 300 HIV infected patients in Kermanshah behavioral consoling center.

Results: Among 300 cases 93% was male and 7% female. Mean age was 32 years old and 39.2%was in 31-40 years age group.51 case(17%)were coagolase positive staphylococcal nasal carrier . Colonization rate was more in female(23.5%) than male(76.5%)and carrier rate was 50.9% in female and 14.4% in male that was statistically significant.49% of carriers were in 31-40 years age group, difference in age groups was not significant.87% of total and 89% of carriers were IV drug injectors that had not significant role in colonization rate.

25 cases of carriers (49%) had CD4>500,20 cases(39.2%) 200-500 and 6(11.8%) <200. decreased CD4 count had statistical significant role in rate of carriage.

S.aureus showed 3.4% sensitivity to penicillin, 9.7% to oxacillin, 7.3% to methicillin, 83.2% to vancomycin and 100% to gentamicin.

Conclusion: This study showed that nasal carrier state of S.aureus was not different among HIV infected and nonHIV patients and colonized organism had acceptable antibiotic sensitivity.lt seems that carrier state is not needed to be treated in outpatients but in admitted cases should be evaluated.

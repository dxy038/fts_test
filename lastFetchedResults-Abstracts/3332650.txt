This work deals with simulation of average current dynamic controlled Non Isolated Bidirectional DC - DC converter with motor load in motoring and braking mode. The proposed cascaded converter has the advantages of transformer less operation. This converter can operate with steep conversion ratio. The enhanced topology is operated by soft-switching, continuous inductor current and fixed switching frequency. In the proposed DC-DC converter topology, the coupled inductor performance has been improved by the switched coupled-inductor. For fast charging stations, compact and efficient DC-DC converters with a high output power is required. The inductor current ripple will affect the performance of battery in vehicle. Due to current ripple battery gets heated and life of battery decrease. So to achieve a high power density as well as to implement current dynamics of inductor in closed loop is done in proposed converter. In this work current controlled two level non isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter in CCM for HVE is proposed. The proposed converter is carried out in MATLAB working platform and the output performance is analyzed.

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficiency of poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) surface modification with chitosan and gelatin. The properties of original PLLA films and modified PLLA films were investigated by water contact angle measurement and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA). The attachment and proliferation of bovine articular chondrocytes seeded on modified PLLA films and controls were examined. A whole cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Cell ELISA) that detects the BrdU incorporation during DNA synthesis and collagen type II secretion was applied to evaluate the chondrocytes on different PLLA films and tissue culture plates (TCPs). Cell function was assessed by measuring sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) secreted by chondrocytes. These results implied that chitosan and gelatin used to modify PLLA surface could enhance the chondrocyte adhesion, proliferation and function.

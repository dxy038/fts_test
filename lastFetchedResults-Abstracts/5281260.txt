An increasingly globalized world fosters the exchange of students, researchers or employees. As a result, situations in which people of different native tongues are listening to the same lecture become more and more frequent. In many such situations, human interpreters are prohibitively expensive or simply not available. For this reason, and because first prototypes have already demonstrated the feasibility of such systems, automatic translation of lectures receives increasing attention. A large vocabulary and strong variations in speaking style make lecture translation a challenging, however not hopeless, task. The scope of this paper is to investigate a variety of challenges and to highlight possible solutions in building a system for simultaneous translation of lectures from German to English. While some of the investigated challenges are more general, e.g. environment robustness, other challenges are more specific for this particular task, e.g. pronunciation of foreign words or sentence segmentation. We also report our progress in building an end-to-end system and analyze its performance in terms of objective and subjective measures.

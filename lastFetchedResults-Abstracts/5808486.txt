Taking multistage correlation process as objective, this article studies the construction and performance of studentised residual-based EWMA control charts. Residual is used to remove the effect of upstream stages on downstream stages in monitoring multistage cascade processes. In order to overcome the influence of dimension and detect small mean shift in the process, this article constructed studentised residual-based EWMA control charts. By simulations, the performances of several residual control charts are compared in term of average run length. The results show that studentised residual-based EWMA had good detection performance in monitoring the small shift of the mean.

Human perfection and happiness depends on thinking and reasoning, and rationalism is defined as invitation and encouragement to contemplation and deliberation and also avoidance of restriction from wisdom and thought. Many Islamophobians believe that Islam is incompatible with rationalism. The main question in this paper is that in Islam, accomplishing this in discussions of "principles of jurisprudence" which is the science of Inferring jurisprudence and one of its resources is wisdom, how much credit is allowed for rationalism? The purpose of this paper is to prove the existence of  rationalism in a high level in "principles of jurisprudence". Based on the definitions of rationalism, "principles of jurisprudence" has been one of the sciences that has been founded to remove the barriers of reasoning and explore the reality in Islam. To fulfill this objective, a descriptive and analytical research in this field has been done and fundamental issues related to this subject have been raised. Finally, we have concluded that not only is not "principles of jurisprudence" opposed to  rationalism, but it has also offered the solutions, rules and regulations for thinking. It takes rationalism away from methods that have not rational credit. It also extends the scope of wisdom and it considers wisdom as one of the resources of inference of jurisprudence.

A method of fuzzy data recall using polynomial bidirectional hetero-correlator is presented. This has a higher capacity for pattern pair storage than that of the conventional BAMs and fuzzy memories. A new energy function is defined. The polynomial bidirectional hetero-correlator (PBHC) takes advantage of fuzzy characteristics in evolution equations such that the signal-noise-ratio (SNR) is significantly increased. In this work, we prove the stability of fuzzy data recall using polynomial bidirectional hetero-correlator. The increase of SNR consequently enhances the capacity of the polynomial bidirectional hetero-correlator. The capacity of the fuzzy data recall using PBHC in the worst case is also estimated

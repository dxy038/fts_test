H.264/AVC is a widely used and very popular video compression format which is applied for compression and distribution of different multimedia contents. The main goal of the experiment presented in this paper is to compare possible differences in subjective assessment of full High Definition (HD) video sequences, encoded by H.264/AVC, when single and double stimulus methods are used. For this purpose, appropriate subjective test methods are chosen and applied. In order to compare the subjective scores with objective quality measures, we also provide an analysis of PSNR and SSIM metrics for the considered video sequences. Results show that the subjective assessments are in good agreement with objective ones.

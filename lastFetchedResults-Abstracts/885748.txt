The multidimensional assignment problem (MAP) is a combinatorial optimization problem arising in diverse applications such as computer vision and motion tracking. In the MAP, the objective is to match tuples of objects with minimum total cost. Randomized parallel algorithms are proposed to solve MAPs appearing in multi-sensor multi-target applications. A parallel construction heuristic is described, together with some variations, as well as a parallel local search heuristic. Experimental results using the proposed algorithms are discussed.

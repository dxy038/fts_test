Inter-Vehicular ad hoc Networking is a promising wireless communication technology for improving highway safety and information services. Therefore communication links among vehicles must be secured. The objective of this paper is to introduce a technique that provides secure highway safety messaging. All the Vehicles in IVAN regularly broadcast secure messages, to provide critical information to other nodes using secure technique. Finally each vehicle receives the secure message through secured link which contains the vehicles dynamic information such as position, speed, direction, acceleration, time. Based on the status of the vehicles dynamic information received by vehicle, the Inter vehicular distance are calculated and collision between vehicles are avoided by broadcasting secure warning messages before colliding vehicle, if the distance is less. For this Secure-Pre warning Collision Avoidance Algorithm (S-PWCA) is proposed. Simulations result shows that, the proposed technique is viable solution for secure Inter vehicle Communication Network and provides secure communication for broadcasting messages. Simulation results give Low delay, high throughput performance and high reliability for secure message.

The objective in this study was to determine whether exposure to pure silver increases the rate of re-epithelialization across a partial thickness wound. A meshed skin graft, placed on an excised burn wound was used as a healing model. Methods: The rate of meshed skin graft epithelial closure on an exposed burn using a moist healing environment was shown. A moistened silver delivery system (Acticoat) was compared with a standard xeroform and eight ply gauze dressing continually moistened with a 0.01% neomycin and polymyxin solution (NP). Twenty burn patients with deep burns of over 15% of TBS were excised and grafted with 2:1 meshed grafts. One graft area was treated with the antibiotic solution and another with the silver delivery. The meshed graft was performed within 3 days of injury. Results: No infections were noted and quantitative swab cultures gave less than 102 bacteria in all cases at wound closure. At day 7, re-epithelialization was complete with silver and 55% closed with NP solution. Wound closure was complete in the NP solution group at day 10. Silver increased re-epithelialization rate by over 40%, a significant increase. Graft take was over 95% in both groups. Conclusion: Silver released in a moist wound surface environment significantly increases the rate of re-epithelialization compared to a standard antibiotic solution.

This paper proposes an algorithm for seeking the shortest path between two nodes in cityÂ´s road net according to the characteristics of the net. The algorithm takes advantage of the theories of bidirectional search, projection, minimum angle and binary tree. According to the algorithm analysis , the algorithm can reduce seeking space and raise seeking speed greatly, and its time complexity can not exceed 0(N), while N is the number of road network nodes. The application results show that the algorithm has good practicability.

The paper proposed a new method for mid-long term load combined forecasting based on the fuzzy optimal theory. The proposed model considering various kinds of error information overcomes the shortcoming of single model as well as the traditional combined model whose objective is to improve just one error index. Through the case study, we prove that the prediction accuracy can be improved obviously and the model is a new and effective method for mid-long term electric load forecasting.

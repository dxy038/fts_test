The recent international inter-laboratory study conducted by IEEE TC34, SC2, WG2 to develop the IEEE 1528.3 standard for computational compliance assessment of cell phone exposure is presented. Thirteen laboratories participated in this project with the goal to model and evaluate exposure from CAD based cell phone models using the Specific Anthropomorphic Mannequin (SAM) and exposure configurations developed for IEEE Std 1528-2003. The main objective was to test the feasibility of the CAD based computational SAR evaluation using the CAD models of cell phones, and to determine the practicality of the protocol which specifies the steps and procedures to be included in the IEEE 1528.3 standard. The available results at time of conference will be presented and discussed.

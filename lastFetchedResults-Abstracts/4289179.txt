The key objective of this paper is to introduce interactive visualization principles which support the change process within companies regarding production structure and control topics. Therefore, the Laboratory for Machine Tools and Production Engineering (WZL) has developed several web-based solutions. Input data can be uploaded via a defined interface. Within the different kinds of analysis, the user can select the level of detail manually. The tools are divided into two groups: tools for structural visualization and tools for monitoring logistical targets. The core idea of these tools is to balance the need of structuring and control functions induced by external factors with the skills of the organization and control system.

In spite of the significance of social equity in determining appropriate fee levels for activities such as camping in public nature-tourism resources, there has been little understanding of the mechanisms that (a) influence the debate over scale and (b) the conditions that are used in fee determination. The main objective of this study is to investigate the decision making process that predicts social equity judgments and price acceptability of user fees for activities such as camping in protected areas (including parks) and outcome the variables. In this study of Wasatch-Cache National Forest in northeastern Utah using conjoint analysis the results indicated that the extent of public input was the most prominent predictor of social equity judgment at p &lt; 0.01. The second highest part-worth coefficient was obtained in support of low user fees (a hypothetical scale of $3.00 vs. $8.00). The magnitude of the part-worth coefficients for price acceptability showed that the highest part-worth coefficient was a fee level of $3.00. The next highest part-worth coefficient was in support of revenue being used to maintain the quality of the site. It was also found that that “extensive public input” was an important predictor of social equity.

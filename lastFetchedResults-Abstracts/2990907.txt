Rough set theory is a new mathematical tool to deal with vagueness and uncertainty. It has been used in machine learning, knowledge discovery, decision support systems and pattern recognition. Traditionally, the algorithm to obtain the deduction of decision rule in rough sets theory always take into account the number of decision rules more than their cost. In this paper, we introduce how to reconcile the conflict of the simplicity and the cost of rules by using multiple objective decision-making (MOD), and the efficiency and effectiveness of rough set can be improved

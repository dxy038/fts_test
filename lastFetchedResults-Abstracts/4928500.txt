We have demonstrated a bidirectional PON for the transmission of 2.5-Gbps WDM channels and &gt;70 digital broadcast video signals. This network could be implemented cost-effectively using a single strand of fiber for bidirectional transmission, LEDs for upstream channels, and one receiver for the detection of both the video and baseband signals (5622 Mbps). In addition, the capacity of the proposed network could be upgraded easily by changing the RF filter or using an additional WDM filter and a receiver.

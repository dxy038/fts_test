Background: Dental age determination has been considered for malocclusion treatment planning by Orthodontists and Pediatric Dentists.
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the correlation of dental age estimated by Demirjian and Moorrees methods with chronological age in the orthodontic patients.
Methods: In this analytical study, 419 panoramic images of 6-15 years old orthodontic patients referred to School of Dentistry in Qazvin were assessed in 2013. Dental age was estimated by Moorrees et al. (1963) and Demirjian et al. (1973) methods through the calcification stages of the left mandibular teeth with the exception of the third molar. Data were analyzed using paired T-test and Pearson’s correlation coefficient.  
Findings: Of 419 patients, 190 (45%) were male and 229 (55%) were female. The mean age was 11.26±2.47. Although there were positive significant correlations between the methods in all study subjects, the Moorrees dental age was significantly different from the chronological age in all age groups. The Demirjian dental age was significantly different from chronological age in the 6-year old age group and 7, 12 and 15-year old males. There were significant differences between the Moorrees and Demirjian dental age in all age groups. 
Conclusion: With regards to the results, it seems that the Moorrees method is not appropriate for Iranian population while the Demirjian method can be acceptable for estimation of dental age based on chronological age. Due to the overestimation found in the Demirjian method, exclusive tables must be prepared for Iranian population.

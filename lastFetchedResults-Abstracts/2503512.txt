Abstract 
Introduction: Anemia is one of the most common problems during pregnancy, whose maternal and fetal complications have been reported in many studies, most of which do not show any correlations and some at times were in contrast.
Objective: The present study aims to compare post-delivery maternal and fetal complications among anemic and non –anemic women who have been admitted to Al-Zahra hospital for delivery.
Materials and Methods: This study was conducted through a case-control analysis among 422 pregnant women who delivered their babies in the third trimester of their pregnancy. 211 cases of anemic women with HB < 11 considering maternal complication and placenta abruption, preterm labor, and fetal complications were compared with (211) non-anemic pregnant women. The data were collected and analyzed by SPSS application (version19). Independent t-test and Chi-square test were used to analyze the data.
Results: The mean age was 28.80±6.68 yrs for anemic women and 28. 33+5.71yrs for the non-anemic. There was a significant difference between various levels of BMI among anemic and non-anemic women who had delivered a baby (p=0.029) but no significant statistical difference between the means of the two groups was observed (p=0.13). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of parity (P=0.55), pre-eclampsia(P=0.79), placenta abruption(P=0.72), preterm labor(P=0.25), neonatal Apgar score (P=0.44)، IUFD (P=0.12), IUGR(P=0.57),neonatal meconium excretion(P=0.23). The mean, the standard deviation, and the median of ferreting among anemic women  were 44.68 ± 29.04 and 40, respectively and the mean and the standard deviation of TSH were 1.53±2. 16and its median was 2.
Conclusion: In this study, a significant association between maternal anemia and pregnancy and fetal complications was observed. The results could be due to the removal and treatment of people with hereditary anemia. Therefore, further studies considering different types of anemia are suggested.

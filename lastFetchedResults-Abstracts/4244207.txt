The objective of this research is to optimize the designing parameters of the parallel manipulator with large orientation workspace at the boundary position of the constant orientation workspace (COW). The method uses a simple genetic algorithm (SGA) while considering three different kinematic performance indices: COW and the global conditioning index (GCI) to evaluate the mechanismÂ´s dexterity for translational motion of an end-effector, and orientation workspace of two angle of Euler angles to obtain the large rotation angle of an end-effector at the boundary position of COW. Total fifteen cases divided according to the combination of the circle radius of COW and rotation angle of orientation workspace are studied, and an optimized model is proposed as a best model by relative comparison of them on the basis of the pre-existing model

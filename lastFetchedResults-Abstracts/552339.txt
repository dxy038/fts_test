Background and Objective:Labor is a painful process and one of the midwives duties is trying to reduce the intensity of labor pain, in which reduction of duration of clinical stages of labor has always been considered. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of hyoscine suppository on labor pain and process of labor. Subjects and Methods:This double-blind clinical trial was down on 130 nulliparous pregnant women who referred to Ahvaz Sina hospital for parturition. A hyoscine suppository was given to case group and a placebo suppository was given to control group at beginning of active phase of labor, rectally. Then the labor pain mean, cervical dilatation and effacement progress, active phase and second stage duration and delivery type were recorded. The data were analyzed using T,Chi square and Fisher tests in 0.05 significant level in SPSS Version 15.0.

Results:There were significant differences between mean of cervical dilatation and effacement 1 and 2 h after intervention in both groups(P<0.0001). The active phase and second stage duration in case group were less than control group significantly(P=0.007). Caesarean section rate in the case group was less than control group, but the difference was not significant(P=0.07). Tabor pain intensity had not significant difference in both groups. There were no differences in fetal heart rate, maternal pulse rate and blood pressure and neonatal APGAR score between both groups. Conclusion:lt seems that hyoscine suppository can be used to accelerate the process of labor and reduce duration of labor pain, effectively, but does not reduce labor pain.

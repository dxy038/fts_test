Objective: The risk for cognitive decline and for developing Alzheimerâ€™s disease increases with age.
The aetiology is assumed to be of multi-factorial origin, and treatment opportunities are lacking. despite the
multi-factorial origin, many intervention studies focused on single factors to influence cognitive health with
inconsistent findings. in this view, more and more intervention studies aim to intervene on multiple factors
simultaneously to affect or slow down cognitive decline. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of
these multidomain intervention trials. Methods: We conducted a non-systematic literature search in Medline,
Scopus, cochrane Library, and clinical trials databases up to october 2011 to review multidomain interventions
that investigated effects of combined lifestyle-related factors on cognitive decline and the progression of
dementia. Results: interest in multidomain interventions increased over the past years. We identified six
completed and published trials and eight ongoing or not yet published studies that investigated effects on
cognitive outcomes. First completed trials yielded promising results for the combination of exercise and mental
training and diet and behavioural weight management. results of ongoing multidomain trials are awaited.
Conclusions: Some evidence suggests that strategies which target multiple factors simultaneously may prove
more effective than those focusing on a single mechanism or domain. Larger high-quality randomized controlled
trials are required to systematically investigate the cognitive effect of programs comprising physical and mental
activity as well as nutritional aspects.

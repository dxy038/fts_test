The objective of this tutorial is to provide practical information and resources to help organizations prepare for, plan, execute, and follow-through a major technical review such as a System Requirements Review (SRR), Preliminary Design Review (PDR), or Critical Design Review (CDR) in a System of Systems (SoS) environment. Participants will be led through the steps to ensure the needs of all stakeholders are met in these types of reviews.

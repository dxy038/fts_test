Nowadays, Energy, Water and Environmental issues are the intersection of all human’s requisites which have been being investigated by researchers in all over of the world. In this regard, gradient of water salinity concentrations attracted considerations as a clean energy source. The purpose of this study is to investigate power generation using salt concentration gradient by Reverse Electro-Dialysis (RED) methods and achieve the optimized operational conditions. For this purpose the main operational parameter, i.e. flow rate (at 4 levels, 10,20,30 and 40 mL/min ), temperature (at 4 levels, 5,15,25 and 35 °C) and concentration gradient (at 4 levels, 30,90,150 and 210 gr/L) using 10 RED cells. Taguchi method was used to design the experiments. The degree of influence of each of evaluated parameters on the objective function, the maximum generated power per membrane surface area, was determined by statistical analysis. According to results the gradient of concentrations was the most effective parameter (81%) and the temperature and flow rate had the minimum effect (respectively 15% and 3%).
According to the analysis of signal to noise (S / N) best operational conditions of system is 210gr/L for the gradient of concentrations, 40mL/min for flow rate, and 35 °C for temperature. At this condition 0.6 watts per square meter were obtained for power.

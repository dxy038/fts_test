Timing performance and routability are two main issues of global routing. In this paper, we adopt a shadow price mechanism to incorporate the two issues into one unified objective function. The shadow price of a net is the sum of its congestion price and timing price. Based on the new formulation, this paper presents the UTACO algorithm for standard cell (SC) global routing. The experimental results show that UTACO is efficient for both timing and congestion optimization.

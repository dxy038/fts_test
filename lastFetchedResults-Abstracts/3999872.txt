One objective of the following analysis is to show that in full-wave self-saturating magnetic amplifiers with finite-control circuit impedance, both the dynamic and d-c hysteresis loops should be considered. Another objective is to present the theory of operation in such a manner that a physical picture of the magnetic amplifier operation can be obtained. To aid in this, a particular mode of operation of a demonstration amplifier is studied by a step by step procedure. Finally, equations predicting the amplifiers performance are developed.

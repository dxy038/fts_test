Aqueous ionic solutions lubricate the chemical machinery of the environment and life. Understanding the impact of ions on the properties of aqueous solutions and how these modified properties influence chemical and conformational dynamics remains an important and elusive objective of physical chemistry research. Here we discuss recent advances in our understanding that have been derived from ultrafast vibrational spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations.

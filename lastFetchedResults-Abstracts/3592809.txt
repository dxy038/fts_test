Our previous studies demonstrated the ultrasound-induced skin optical clearing enhancement with topical application of optical clearing agents on <i>in</i> <i>vitro</i> porcine skin and <i>in</i> <i>vivo</i> human skin. The objective of this study was to develop more effective methods by simultaneously using two kinds of skin permeation enhancers. The effect of ultrasound (SP) in combination with a chemical enhancer, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), on skin optical clearing was investigated. Light transmittance and imaging depth of <i>in</i> <i>vitro</i> porcine skin were measured with spectroscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Three treatments were performed: 1) 60% glycerol (60% Gly); 2) 60% glycerol +15-min SP (Gly/SP); and 3) 60% glycerol + 1% SLS + 15-min SP (Gly/SLS/SP). We find that Gly/SLS/SP exhibits a most significant effect in increasing total transmittance and OCT imaging depth. Total transmittance increases by a factor of 1.9 (1276-nm light) to 3.4 (470-nm light) after 60 min. In addition, the effect after 30 min of Gly/SLS/SP exposure is almost the same as that after 60 min of Gly/SP exposure. Simultaneously, Gly/SLS/SP results in a 56% increase in OCT 1/<i>e</i> light penetration depth after 60 min, much better than 60% glycerol and Gly/SP.

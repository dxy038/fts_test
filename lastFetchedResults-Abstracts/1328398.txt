This paper concerns a general damage model for most aerospace materials implemented in a FEM code in order to obtain a tool for a damage tolerance design. The approach adopted is basically an energy criterion. The generation and growth of mesocracks is the unique dissipative mechanism considered. Although much work has already been carried out in this field, the simplicity of the present theory can be an important step in aerospace structural design. The objective is to model the non-linear behaviour due to damage of titanum and multidirectional composite plies in order to determine the response and strength of these structures under service loads. Experimental tests were performed. Both biaxial and uniaxial extensometers were used. The aim of the experimental investigation was to plot the quasi-static response of the specimens. Little visible damage was detected in all but the cross-ply laminate prior to failure.

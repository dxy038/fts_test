Introduction & Objective: Helicobacter pylori are among the important pathogens responsible for chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. The present study aimed to comparatively evaluate PCR and RUT methods for detection  of H. Pylori and determination of the prevalence of the cagA- positive Helicobacter pylori strains in Shahrekord.
Materials & Methods: This is a molecular epidemiology study conducted in 1385 on biopsy samples collected from 120 patients with dyspeptic symptoms who were referred to endoscopy department of Hajar hospital of Shahrekord. In order to detect H. pylori, RUT method was used at first and then DNA was directly extracted from biopsy specimens. PCR-amplification was preformed for the ureC and then for cagA gene.
Results: The H. pylori infection was found in 74 (61.66%) of the patient by RUT method. In parallel, ureC PCR detected H. pylori in 103 (85.83%) of patients. All RUT-positive patients were found to be ureC-PCR positive, too. The cagA-positive H. pylori strains were found in 83.5 percent of isolated strains.
Conclusion: These findings indicate that ureC PCR is more sensitive than RUT for diagnosis of H. pylori infection. In addition, the high prevalence of the CagA-positive H. pylori strains is present in Shahrekord.

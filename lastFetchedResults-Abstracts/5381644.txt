In this paper, we propose a cross layer optimization framework for multi-hop routing and resource allocation design in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based wireless mesh network. The network under consideration is assumed to consist of fixed mesh routers (or base station routers) inter-connected using OFDMA wireless links with some of the mesh routers functioning as gateways to a wired network. The objective of our cross-layer formulation is to allow joint determination of power control, frequency-selective OFDMA scheduling and multi-hop routing in order to maximize the minimum throughput that can be supported to all mesh routers. Results of our investigations under typical cellular deployment, propagation and channel model assumptions show that this approach achieves significant mesh throughput improvements primarily due to the following: (a) frequency selective scheduling with OFDMA which provides improved tone diversity thus allowing more efficient bandwidth utilization relative to single carrier methods; and (b) multi-hop routing which provides improved path diversity relative to single hop transmissions.

This paper presents a new voice objective measurement method of VoIP (voice over IP). Although the subjective evaluation by human MOS (mean opinion score) is the best evaluation, many testees must participate in the voice experiments and expensive measuring instruments and environments, such as a special acoustic room are needed. In order to measure the voice quality easily, the new objective measurement method is presented and studied using experiments.

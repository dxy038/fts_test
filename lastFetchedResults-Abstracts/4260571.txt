Summary form only given. The primary objective for distribution system operation has always been to provide acceptable voltage for all customers under all loading conditions while maintaining safe conditions for the field workforce and the general public and protecting distribution system assets from unnecessary damage due to overloading and fault conditions. While these continue to be the primary motivations for distribution system management, there is growing interest in improved efficiency and reliability on the distribution system, the objectives being reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved customer satisfaction. To accomplish these expanded operating objectives, electric distribution utilities are deploying new advanced technologies, such as volt-VAR optimization and optimal network reconfiguration, that will &#8220;squeeze&#8221; more capacity out of existing assets and rapidly restore service following an outage without compromising the traditional primary operating objectives. This proposed paper will summarize these new application functions, explain how they work, identify benefit these functions supply, and discuss the practical realities (issues and challenges, potential pitfalls, etc) that may be encountered when implementing these new application functions. The results will enable utility companies who are contemplating advanced applications to make informed decisions about these applications.

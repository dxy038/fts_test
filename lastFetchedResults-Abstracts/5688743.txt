Although textual interfaces for browsing scientific papers have several drawbacks, they are still the most used in digital libraries. Several visual approaches have been proposed in recent years in order to provide the user with a deeper insight of the search context and to allow him/her to quickly gather a collection of documents judged as useful for his/her research. This paper presents CyBiS, a novel 3D analytical interface for a Bibliographic Visualization Tool with the objective of improving scientific paper search. The design choices are justified on the basis of previous experiences described in literature and its effectiveness is shown through the description of an example session.

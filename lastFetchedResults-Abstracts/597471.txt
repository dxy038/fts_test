Human resources are significant strategic levers and sources of sustained competitive advantage. The aim of this study is to identify the main factors of commitment to human resource development of the Iranian Social Security Organization's Hospitals. To achieve this objective, the main variables were recognized and a questionnaire was designed. Iranian Social Security Organization's Hospitals (as the greatest public non-governmental health institution in Iran) were chosen as a sample among all Iranian healthcare centers (n=96). Content validity and construct validity were assured with expert judgment and the reliability of the questionnaire was determined using Cronbach's alpha and Pearson correlation (1st and 2nd time). Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.819, while Pearson correlation was 0.951 (p<0.001). The questionnaire was filled out by the research community. After the sample size was proven to be sufficient, exploratory and confirmatory factors were analyzed. The findings of the present research showed that after conducting the factor analysis of the component "commitment", 3 factors were extracted. The factors were "organization development", "management commitment" and "employment system". The calculated fitness indices proved the desirability and appropriateness of the factors and their structural relations. It may be concluded that these factors have substantial roles in the performance of commitment and are considered to be the main factors while performing management commitment to human resource development approach in these organizations.

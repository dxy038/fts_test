A method to automatically design a fuzzy logic autotuner (FLA) for PID regulators is described. The autotuner evaluates a fuzzy logic rule base obtained by application of simulated annealing (SA) optimization procedures to a set of chosen initial controllers for a system. Both autotuner and the SA procedures optimize an objective function defined by a set of system performance criteria. The autotuner is evaluated by tuning different initial controllers. A discussion of the merits and potential problems of using the design-by-example approach is included

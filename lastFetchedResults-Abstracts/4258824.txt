This paper presents a text localization approach for binarized printed document images. Emphasis is given to the feature extraction and feature selection stages. In the former, several document structure elements and spatial features, likely to convey useful information, are extracted. In the latter, evolutionary multi-objective feature selection is employed to identify combinations of features with simultaneous good performance in terms of text localization sensitivity and specificity. The selected features are applied to a range of classifiers. Performance results over document image sets from known databases are presented, employing the classifiers with or without feature selection. The results suggest that the hybrid techniques, which utilize the classifiers in combination with the customized pre-processing, feature extraction and feature selection stages, exhibit promising performance on a range of document images.

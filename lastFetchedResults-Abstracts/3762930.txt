The objective was to provide the visual communication technology to support high levels of interactivity and engagement, but the videoconferencing equipment typically deployed for these events is limited in terms of group interaction. Given the limitation of traditional tools, the virtual classroom program needed a solution driven by a one-step, record-and-publish model that could complement the synchronous communication offered by videoconferencing. This article presents an overview of the broadband virtual camera (BVCam) system, which enables one-step videoconference recording by using idle desktop computers on an IP network.

The objective of this study is to identify the key technology with analysis of the cost boundary of future photovoltaics (PV) technologies using life-cycle costing. We estimate the amount cost of photovoltaic system in Japan. It considers material flows over the whole production process starting from silica extraction to the final panel assembling. The comparison of current scenario to the expected future PV technologies focusing on the equipments in each production processes results in factory scale boundaries.

Utilization of low-enthalpy geothermal energy in Japan, especially with the application of
geothermal heat pumps, is far behind other industrial countries. In 1998, a feasibility study
was made of utilizing Japanâ€™s low-enthalpy geothermal resources. Since 2001 the Geo-Heat
Promotion Association of Japan (GeoHPJ) began its activities with the objective of installing
140,000 heat pump systems in private houses by the target year of 2010. The Geothermal
Research Society of Japan has also launched new activities in this sector. Research groups in
universities and other national institutes have started geoscientific research on the utilization
of low-enthalpy resources and private, academic and governmental sectors have consequently
begun promoting geothermal heat pump utilization.

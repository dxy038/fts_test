Crim prevention is not the primary objective of sport and physical activiy, but it migh be an extremely positive byproduct. This paper examines a variety of sporting activities that appear to have had a beneficial effect in helping young people street away from trouble.lt examines wilderness programs,programs in which youth participate and learn skills , and programs in which the sense of belonging reduces vandalism and develops other pro-social behaviours. Of particular interest are sports carnivals in Aboriginal communities. When the carnivals (organised and run by Aborigines for Aborigines) are held, they act as catalysts for social and traditional cohesion. Harmful behaviours such as petrol sniffing , heavy drinkig , and violence are prohibited for the duration of the carnival, and the prohibitions hold in the short term. At another level, elite sporting clubs can reach out into their communities The example in this paper is the (British)Liverpool Football Club , which has had successes in quit smoking programs,coaching, truancy reduction , and even reducing the number of hoex calls to the local fire bridge.

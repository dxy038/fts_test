Irrigation performance assessments are required for hydrological planning and as a first step to improve water management. The objective of this work was to assess seasonal on-farm irrigation performance in the Ebro basin of Spain (0.8 million ha of irrigated land). The study was designed to address the differences between crops and irrigation systems using irrigation district data. Information was only available in districts located in large irrigation projects, accounting for 58% of the irrigated area in the basin. A total of 1617 records of plot water application (covering 10,475 ha) were obtained in the basin. Average net irrigation requirements (IRn) ranged from 2683 m3 ha−1 in regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) vineyards to 9517 m3 ha−1 in rice. Average irrigation water application ranged from 1491 m3 ha−1 in vineyards to 11,404 m3 ha−1 in rice. The annual relative irrigation supply index (ARIS) showed an overall average of 1.08. Variability in ARIS was large, with an overall standard deviation of 0.40. Crop ARIS ranged between 0.46 and 1.30. Regarding irrigation systems, surface, solid-set sprinkler and drip irrigated plots presented average ARIS values of 1.41, 1.16 and 0.65, respectively. Technical and economic water productivities were determined for the main crops and irrigation systems in the Aragón region. Rice and sunflower showed the lowest productivities. Under the local technological and economic constraints, farmers use water cautiously and obtain reasonable (yet very variable) productivities.

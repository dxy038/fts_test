Objective: Dehydroepiandroesteron (DHEA) is a neurosteroid with potential effect on neurogenesis
, neuronal survival and proliferation of neural progenitor cells. However there is no
direct evidence for its biological effect during the differentiation of stem cell-derived neurons.
The p19 line of embryonal carcinoma cells develops into neurons , astroglia and fibroblasts
after exposure to retinoic acid (RA). This study was initiated to assess the effect of DHEA on
neural cells derived from p19 embryonal carcinoma stem cells.
Materials and Methods: P19 cells were suspended in dulbec co's modified eagle 's medium
(DMED) contain ing fetal bovine serum (FBS) in bacterial-grade petri dishes in the presen ce
of RA, DHEA and RA+DHEA for 6 days . Then cells were trypsinized for dispersion and replaced
in poly L- lysine (10fJg/ml) coated tissue culture dishes without RA and DHEA for 4
days. The expression of neural markers Map-2, Tau, beta-tubutin 111 - clone Juj (Tuj1), astrocyte
marker GFAP and the percent of neurotransmitters tyrosin hydroxylase , glutamate, serotonin
and actyl cholin transferase were evaluated by flowcytometry, immunocytochemistry
and RT-PCR analysis.
Results: Flowcytometry analysis showed that about 63 ± 3% of the cells express neuronal
marker Tuj1 and about 5 ± 1% of the cells express tyrosine hydro xylase neurotransmitters
in RA treated groups . However when RA and DHEA were added to the culture medium , Tuj1
expression increased to about 74 ± 1% and tyrosine hydroxylase expression increased to
23 ± 2%.
Conclusion: Results showed that DHEA accompanied RA increased the number of TUJ1 and
dopaminerqic neurons that were derived from p19 embryonal carcinoma stem cells .

Food security in Iran has been a major objective of rural and, agricultural policies after the revolution. This paper investigates the relationship between agricultural development policies and food security through documentary and secondary data analysis. It is actually seeking out that to what extent agricultural policies succeeded to boost up the country's food security both at macro and micro levels. The study showed that, however the state started notable initiatives within the framework of agricultural development policies and these policies have been particularly effective in raising a considerable part of stable agricultural products in the recent years, and the country could reach self-sufficiency in wheat in 2O04 through implementing 'Wheat Axial Project', but it is to be seen whether country is able to bring about a sustainable access to food for all strata of it's population. In other words, while the agricultural policies could considerably raise the country's food security at the national level, they were not able to bring about suitable circumstances of access to food at the household level, mainly because of the pre-existing sustainable inequalities in society with respect to income, wealth etc.

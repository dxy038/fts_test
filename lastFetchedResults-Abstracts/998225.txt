An optimisation strategy based on desirability functions together with experimental design has been used to optimise a chromatographic method applied to the separation and quantification of l-proline and seven organic acids in vinegar samples. Chromatographic problems often force to reach a compromise between different experimental variables in order to achieve the best chromatographic separation. The importance of the use of multi-objective optimisation methods lies in the ability to cope with this kind of problems. The quality of the multicriteria optimisation method was tested through the validation of the analytical parameters of the final chromatographic method developed. The versatility of this methodology allows to use it in other chromatographic applications resulting in a suitable adaptive procedure to solve new analytical problems. Furthermore, the determination of l-proline and organic acids in vinegar is useful for several industrial goals such as the correct monitoring of fermentation, for the study of nutrient needs at all times during the twofold fermentation process and for the detection of possible adulterations in the final product.

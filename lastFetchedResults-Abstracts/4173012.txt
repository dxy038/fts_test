This paper describes an algorithm for still image compression called B-tree triangular coding (BTTC). The coding scheme is based on the recursive decomposition of the image domain into right-angled triangles arranged in a binary tree. The method is attractive because of its fast encoding, O(n log n), and decoding, &#920;(n), where n is the number of pixels, and because it is easy to implement and to parallelize. Experimental studies indicate that BTTC produces images of satisfactory quality from a subjective and objective point of view, One advantage of BTTC over JPEG is its shorter execution time

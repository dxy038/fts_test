Successful and economical operation of small rural industries (e.g. grain, dairy, irrigation, pig, poultry, beef feedlots, etc.) is a fundamental objective of society. However, when the performance and life expectancy of industrial electronic and electrical equipment is significantly affected by power supply anomalies caused by polluting loads at an industrial site and by utility normal operational activities, the economic benefits of this technology are quickly eradicated. This work presents the results of a detailed power supply quality survey of 23 small rural industries sponsored by the Canadian Electrical Association and provides a knowledge base on rural power quality and the possible origins of power supply anomalies. The major power quality problems experienced at the various industrial sites are summarized. The results of the survey provide a basis for mitigating actions by the electric utilities and their rural industrial customers to design and operate their electrical systems to minimize the effects of power supply anomalies

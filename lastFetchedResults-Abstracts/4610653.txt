This paper describes a SoSE environment designed to facilitate the problem-solving process of complex situations. Complex situations can be seen as the behavior of a system of systems that needs to be transformed to a desirable state. This is addressed by exploring the impact and implications of systems analysis and design within a social/group setting where many stakeholders with issues, concerns and independent perspectives develop solutions sets. To achieve this objective, the environment was designed to facilitate, in a social setting; (1) assessment of the complexity of the situation, (2) structure of possible frameworks from which the situation can be dealt with and (3) Take the situation to a desirable state.

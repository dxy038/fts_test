This paper will present a medical network in Latin America. This network will provide in rural and underserved areas an appropriate health care from distance. The medical applications will vary from gynaecology, paediatrics, cardiology to typical infectious diseases for the region such as malaria and tuberculosis. The examinations will involve ultrasound examination, electrocardiogram and blood imaging when applicable. Our medical tele-consulting tool will be used for that purpose. The medical network aims to connect isolated areas in Amazon over European satellite technology providing broadband communication and quality of services (QoS) for real-time data transmission and video/audio conference.

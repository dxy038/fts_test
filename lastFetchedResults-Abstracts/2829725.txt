The main objective of the 2nd IEEE International Conference on Cyber???Physical Systems, Networks, and Applications (CPSNA 2014), is to explore innovative, exciting, and fresh research ideas for Cyber???Physical Systems (CPS), which are next???generation embedded systems with closely coordinated computational and physical components. Emerging applications of CPS include transportation, healthcare, energy, manufacturing, entertainment, consumer electronics, and environmental monitoring, all of which will be essential pieces of our social infrastructure. CPS fundamentally require a multidisciplinary research initiative, as their relevant technologies appear in diverse areas of Science and Engineering. CPSNA aims to bring together researchers from all over the world, and particularly from Asia, to foster and promote this multidisciplinary effort. We received a total of 23 submissions. The papers come from 10 countries and regions including China, Germany, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Spain, Sweden and Taiwan. Each submission was reviewed by at least three peer reviewers. Overall, the best 9 regular papers (39% acceptance rate), and 4 short papers, were selected. The technical program also includes two invited keynote speakers, and 3 invited papers from excellent researchers in the world.

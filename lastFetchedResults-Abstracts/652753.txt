Study objective: This research was implemented to assess the effect of air pollution on anti-asthmatic, bronchodilator, and cough and cold preparation sales in the city of Rouen (France) based on the Upper Normandy Regional Union of Health Insurance Offices database and the Air Quality Monitoring Network database. Design: An ecological time-series analysis was performed for a period of 2 years (July 1998–June 2000). Generalized additive model yields to relative risks and 95% confidence interval (CI) estimates were also carried out. Main results: The 10-day cumulative effect of a 10-μg/m3 black smoke increase was significantly associated with a 6.2% (95% CI, 2.4–10.1%) increase in the sales of anti-asthmatics and bronchodilators and to a 9.2% (95% CI, 5.9–12.6%) increase in the sales of cough and cold preparation for children aged under 15 years. The cumulative effect of a 10-μg/m3 increase in SO2 was associated with an 11.8% (95% CI, 6.7–17.1%) increase in cough and cold preparation sales for children aged under 15 years. The cumulative effect of 10-μg/m3 increase in NO2 was associated with an 13.6% (95% CI, 8–18.3%) increase in cough and cold preparation sales for children under 15 years of age. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that an increase in drugs sales was directly related to air pollutant concentration increases in the city of Rouen (France).

Rate control algorithm is of great importance to video coding. Many existing schemes are based on the quadratic rate control scheme. The proposed method introduces a novel rate control algorithm with adaptive rounding offset, aiming at achieving bit-rate optimization and adaptation of the content of the video sequences. The rounding offset is chosen adaptively based on the minimum blocksÂ´ discontinuities at the boundaries simply. The experimental results show that compared with a dead-zone adjustment which is H.264/AVC compliant, the proposed method can achieve considerable improvement on both objective peak signal noise ratio (PSNR) and subjective visual quality.

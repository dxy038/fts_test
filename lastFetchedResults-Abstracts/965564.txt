Background and Objective: Widespread use of co-trimoxazole in urinary tract infection treatments and its incorrect use has led to the emergence of co-trimoxazole   resistant E. coli strains. The aim of this study was to evaluate sul2 gene among E.coli isolates of patients admitted to the clinical centers of Khoy city.
Materials and Methods: Three hundred urine samples were collected from clinical centers of Khoy city. Among them, 100 E.coli isolates were confirmed by standard biochemical tests. Furthermore, the antibiotic susceptibility tests to 10 antibiotics were performed by the-disk-agar diffusion (DAD) method. Also, MIC and MBC were evaluated for co-trimoxazole by microdilution broth method. Finally, PCR was done in order to find sul2 gene in resistant isolates.
Results: Of 100 isolates, 71(71%) were resistant to co-trimoxazole out of which 57(80%) had sul2 gene. This gene was recognized in sulfonamides-resistant isolates which did not create any zone of inhibition. Also, the isolates with sul2 gene were found to be simultaneously resistant to ampicillin, nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. In co-trimoxazole-resistant isolates, MIC and MBC for Co-trimoxazole were calculated 16 and 32?g/ml. 
Conclusion: This study was the first of its kind in Iran with the main objective of manifesting the presence of sul2 gene in E.coli. The results of the present study indicate that antibiotic-resistance percentage in Khoy city reaches to 71%.  In such a situation, it is inevitable to see  resistance to all common antibiotics currently prescribed to patients at clinical centers which will, in turn, result in treatment failures.

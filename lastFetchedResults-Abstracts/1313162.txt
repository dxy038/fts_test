Persimmon tree (Diospyros kaki L.f.) is a deciduous fruit tree included in the so-called group of minor fruit tree species. Worldwide, it is not widely grown but, nowadays, Kaki culture is of some importance in the south-east of Spain because of the high fruit commercial value. Currently, neither it is known about Kaki trees water needs, nor crop responses to the irrigation regime. The objective of the present research was to assess the feasibility of using maximum diurnal trunk shrinkage (MDS) as a plant water stress indicator for Kaki trees. During two drought cycles, in trees under either full or deficit irrigation, the MDS obtained by means of LVDT sensors was compared with a reference indicator of fruit trees water status, the midday stem water potential (Ψstem). In addition, stomatal conductance and fruit diameter variations were also followed. As water restrictions began, there was an immediate increase in MDS, in correspondence with a decrease in Ψstem. Pooling data from both drought cycles and irrigation regimes, MDS and Ψstem were linearly correlated (r2 = 0.77***). The magnitude of differences between well watered and deficit irrigated trees was much larger in the case of MDS than for Ψstem. However, the tree-to-tree variability of the MDS readings was three times higher than for Ψstem; average coefficient of variation of 14% and 38% for Ψstem and MDS, respectively. Overall, results reported indicated that MDS is a sensitive indicator of Kaki water status and it can be further used as an irrigation scheduling indicator for optimum irrigation management of this crop. However, the large MDS tree-to-tree variability should be taken into account when selecting the number of trees to monitor within an orchard.

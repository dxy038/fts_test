Loading containership optimization mostly contributes to its turnover time and saving scare resources in terminal. A systemic fuzzy model was discussed, which includes loading container sequence determination, yard-crane allocation and container vehicle assignation. The model simulates fuzzy aspects of equipment handling and insures quay-crane usage at given possibility. Its objective is to minimize the sum of handling cost defined. An improved genetic algorithm was proposed. Numerical experiments show that the model is competent for practical simulation and the algorithm gains stable and preferable optimization result

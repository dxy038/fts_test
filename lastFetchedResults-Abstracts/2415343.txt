Infection of Helicobacter pylori exists all around the world. This bacterium has an IV type secretion system. The main objective of this study was to investigate the existence and abundance of cagA gene in biopsy and serum samples by applying the PCR technique and assay of Triglyceride and cholesterol level in sera. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between the presence of cagA genome and cardiac risk markers in infected patients with H. pylori. 100 serum samples of patients with above IgG titer against Helicobacter pylori were examined with PCR to investigate the existence of cagA gene. Moreover triglyceride and cholesterol titers and blood pressure were measured.  Eighteen samples out of 100 positive serumic samples from patients with helicobacter pylori had a positive result for the existence of cagA gene. Twelve samples (66Ùª) out of eighteen serumic samples had triglyceride and cholesterol titer greater than the normal levels. From 18 specimens detected in sera, about 12 people had cardiac disorders and 10 patients had high blood pressure. Since secretion system of type IV is capable of secreting both genome and the protein of this bacterium into the cell, we decided to investigate the existence of cagA gene in sera. This bacterium was unable to induce septicemia and bacteriemia; the possibility is that the gene integrated with protein cagA to blood, was protected from degradation which increases the risk of antibody production against these factors and elevates the risk of heart disease. For this reason, for the first time in the world, we studied the presence of cagA genome in serum samples.

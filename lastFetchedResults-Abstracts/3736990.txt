LD transceivers for a TCM (time-compression multiplexing) scheme are promising for bidirectional transmission and economical optical subscriber networks. This paper describes LD switching characteristics when cycling between transmitter and receiver states. An LD equivalent circuit model is discussed based on detailed observations of the LD discharge properties during switching operations. It Is confirmed that the LD current-blocking layers significantly affect switching characteristics. In addition, a &#8220;reverse-bias method&#8221; for high-speed switching is proposed

Presented in the paper will be a brief introduction to methods of solving pipeline networks and the corresponding electrical analogies. Numerically generated data from a pipeline example will support the argument that two-cycle trapping is created by the nonlinearity in the pipeline network model in the transition fluid flow regime. Second the results will demonstrate that averaging between iteration cycles greatly facilitates the objective of reaching a convergent solution. Lastly, data generated from the one dimensional Feigenbaum model which replicate effects similar to the N-dimensional pipeline model will also be presented

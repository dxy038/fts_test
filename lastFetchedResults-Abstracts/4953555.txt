The rectifier and inverter are used in vector control of induction motor. The most shortcomings are that exist a big capacitor and energy pass only from power sources to load. This paper details a novel matrix converter-indirect matrix converter. It is used in vector controlling research of induction motor and displaced for conventional inverter to supply power for induction motor. Because switches are bidirectional in the rectifier, it can realize bidirectional pass of the energy and decrease pollution of harmonic wave. Meanwhile bidirectional switches can act in zero current. Four step commutations donÂ´t be needed so that it decreases complexity of control process. In addition, indirect matrix converter which compared with direct matrix converter has the same advantages but it is simpler in controlling strategy. Main circuit topology and control strategy are introduced in this paper. Lastly, simulation result is given with MATLAB.

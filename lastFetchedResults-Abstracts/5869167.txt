To analyze the steady state equivalent circuit model of an induction motor to establish the equation that justify the use of a constant V/f speed control of open loop and closed loop control. The main objective is to maintain the speed at fixed reference. To investigate the control schemes for controlling induction machine, particularly the scalar control and vector control method and to evaluate their performance under variable input/output conditions. The merits and limits are reviewed based on a survey of the related paper.

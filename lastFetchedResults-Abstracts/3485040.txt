Developing nonlinear adaptive and robust controllers for a two-link flexible robot arm is the main objective of this research. The dynamic state feedback controller is used to achieve robust regulation of the rigid modes as well as suppression of elastic vibrations. However, the control of highly nonlinear multi-link flexible arms is subject to uncertainties caused by backlash, payload changes and external disturbances. Therefore adaptive and robust control of multi-link flexible arms is a challenging problem. The internal model approach is adaptively tuned up for unknown disturbances, parallel with a robust stabiliser. The stabiliser part of the controller is optimised with a new evolutionary algorithm

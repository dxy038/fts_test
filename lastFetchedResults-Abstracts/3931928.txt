Impairment of the olfactory sensibility can be an indicator of neurode generative disorders, such as Alzheimer´s disease and Parkinson´s disease. The problem lies in obtaining an objective quantitative analysis of olfactory response. For this task, we will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a device that will provide a selective and controlled stimulation of the olfactory system. The novel issues of our design are synchronization between the acquisition and the olfactory task, and automated control of experimental parameters, odorants sequences, and frequency. We present a review of the basic fMRI experimental design of event-related stimulus paradigms versus block design experiments, and their use in olfactory experiments. Finally, we present the preliminary results obtained on a real 3-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner.

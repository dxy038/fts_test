Objective: Approximately 66-80%of graduate students experience statistics anxiety and some researchers
propose that many students identify statistics courses as the most anxiety-inducing courses in their academic
curriculums. As such, it is likely that statistics anxiety is, in part, responsible for many students delaying
enrollment in these courses for as long as possible. This paper proposes a canonical model by treating academic
procrastination (AP), learning strategies (LS) as predictor variables and statistics anxiety (SA) as explained
variables.
Methods: A questionnaire survey was used for data collection and 246-college female student participated in
this study. To examine the mutually independent relations between procrastination, learning strategies and
statistics anxiety variables, a canonical correlation analysis was computed.
Results: Findings show that two canonical functions were statistically significant. The set of variables
(metacognitive self-regulation, source management, preparing homework, preparing for test and preparing term
papers) helped predict changes of statistics anxiety with respect to fearful behavior, Attitude towards math and
class, Performance, but not Anxiety.
Conclusion: These findings could be used in educational and psychological interventions in the context of
statistics anxiety reduction.
Declaration of interest: None.

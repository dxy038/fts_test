This paper presents an Improved Evolutionary Programming (IEP) algorithm for the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) with steady-state voltage stability consideration. The objective function is formulated as a trade-off between an economic concern, i.e. fuel cost and a system security issue, i.e. voltage stability margin. The indicator L is adopted to estimate the steady-state voltage stability margin in this paper. The proposed IEP algorithm borrows an idea of crossover techniques from Real-Coded Genetic Algorithm (RCGA) to enhance the offspring generation process. The IEEE 30-bus system is used as the test system. Three types of cost curves are considered to verify that the proposed algorithm works well with both convex and non-convex objective functions. The results of the proposed method are compared with those of the EP algorithm, which solely relies on the mutation process for offspring generation. Moreover, a series of experiments are conducted to properly tune the main IEP parameters.

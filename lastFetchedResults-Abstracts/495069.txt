Objective: Nasal packing is a common procedure that is used for control of nasal bleeding. On the other hand, nasal obstruction can predispose to abnormal breathing patterns during sleep which often results in hypoxemia. One of the serious complications of nasal packing is arterial O2 de-saturation which is a major risk factor in elderly patients with cardiopulmonary disorders. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of postoperatively applied nasal packing on arterial oxygen saturation during sleep among patients requiring nasal package for various indications. 
Subjects and Method: This study included 68 patients (49 male, 19 female; mean age 29 years, range 19 to 74 years) who required nasal packs for various indications. O2 saturation levels was measured before insertion of nasal packing and postoperatively on the first night after surgery using Pulse oxymetry and the finding were compared statistically.
Results: No significant differences were found between before and after nasal packing levels in 59 patients but in 9 patients, with previous underlying cardiopulmonaty disorder, O2 saturation level was significantly decreased after nasal packing.
Conclusion: Nasal packing can cause significant reduction of O2 saturation in elderly patients especially in those with cardiopulmonary .disorders. It seems nasal packing has no significantly effect on arterial O2 saturation levels in young healthy patients.

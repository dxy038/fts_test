This paper presents a Dubins model based strategy to determine the optimal path of a miniature air vehicle (MAV), constrained by a bounded turning rate, that would enable it to fly along a given straight line, starting from an arbitrary initial position and orientation. The method is then extended to meet the same objective in the presence of wind which has a magnitude comparable to the speed of the MAV. We use a modification of the DubinsÂ´ path method to obtain the complete optimal solution to this problem in all its generality.

This paper proposes the design and control of single phase Power Electronic Transformer (PET). This PET has two stages; the input stage consists of a matrix converter and the output stage has another matrix converter which are connected by a high frequency transformer. It has bidirectional power flow controllability. It can convert high/low voltage into low/high voltage at any frequency. Power factor correction can also be achieved in this transformer. The proposed system uses only two stages, so that the number of switches used is considerably decreased. The converter is simulated using Multisim 13.0 package. Average current controller is used to improve the input power factor and to reduce the source current Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) below 5%. Closed loop control is simulated with the help of LabVIEW 14.0 and found that the Total Harmonic Distortion is well below the acceptable limits. The power factor near to unity is also achieved.

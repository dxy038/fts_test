The main objective of this paper is to present a general three-dimensional boundary element methodology for solving transient dynamic elastoplastic problems. The elastostatic fundamental solution is used in writing the integral representation and this creates in addition to the surface integrals, volume integrals due to inertia and inelasticity. Thus, an interior discretization in addition to the usual surface discretization is necessary. Isoparametric linear quadrilateral elements are used for the surface discretization and isoparametric linear hexahedra for the interior discretization. Advanced numerical integration techniques for singular and nearly singular integrals are employed. Houbolt's step-by-step numerical time integration algorithm is used to provide the dynamic response. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the method and demonstrate its accuracy.

This contribution presents an integrated constraint programming (CP) model to tackle the problems of tool allocation, machine loading, part routing, and scheduling in a flexible manufacturing system (FMS). The formulation, which is able to take into account a variety of constraints found in industrial environments, as well as several objective functions, has been successfully applied to the solution of various case studies of different sizes. Though some of the problem instances have bigger sizes than the examples reported to date in literature, very good-quality solutions were reached in quite reasonable CPU times. This good computational performance is due to two essential characteristics of the proposed model. The most significant one is the use of two sets of two-index variables to capture manufacturing activities instead of having just one set of four indexes. Thus, dimensionality is greatly reduced. The other relevant feature is the fact that the model relies on an indirect representation of tool needs by means of tool types, thus avoiding the consideration of tool copies.

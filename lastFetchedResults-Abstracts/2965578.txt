The main objective of this study was to assess the advantages of Direct Current Recovery Voltage Measurements over more conventional techniques for condition monitoring of oil impregnated paper insulated power and instrument transformers. This paper focuses attention on the advantages and precautions that must be observed when applying this technique in a realistic environment. The significance of capacitively graded high voltage insulation and the influence of environmental factors such as humidity and wind on the repeatability of recovery voltage measurements are also discussed

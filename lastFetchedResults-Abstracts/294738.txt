Two companies provide custom-made pressure garments to clients with burn scars at Westmead Hospital. This prospective study was completed in order to make objective decisions about which garments were most appropriate and cost effective to provide to clients. Issues such as cost, durability, fit and client preferences were investigated. Data were collected from 43 clients; at the time of initial fitting, at a follow-up appointment 4â€“6 weeks later, and at the time one of the garments required replacement. One Second Skin and one Jobst garment were provided to each client and the garments were compared using therapists' evaluation and clients' perspectives on a number of variables. Second Skin garments had significantly more favourable results on the variables of time for delivery, fit at follow-up, garment design, quality of fabric and seams, overall satisfaction and garment preference for ongoing wear. On all other variables there was no significant difference between the garments. Second Skin provided the most optimal and appropriate option for pressure garments in the management of burn sears for our clients.

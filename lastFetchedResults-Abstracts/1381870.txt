The objective of this work is to develop an analytical homogenization method to estimate the effective mechanical properties of fluid-filled porous media with periodic microstructure. The method is based on the equivalent inclusion concept of homogenization applied earlier for solid–solid mixture. It is assumed that porous media are described by the poroelastic constitutive law developed by Biot where porosity is a material parameter. By solving the governing equations of poroelasticity in Fourier transformed domain, the relation between periodic strain and eigenstrain in porous media is established. This relation is subsequently used in an average consistency condition involving both solid and fluid phase stresses and strains. The geometry of the porous microstructure is captured in the g-integral. This homogenization method can also be applied to estimate the equivalent properties of solid–fluid mixture where a pure solid and fluid can be modeled by assuming very low and high porosity, respectively. Several examples are considered to establish this new method by comparing with other existing analytical and numerical methods of homogenization. As an application, poroelastic properties of cortical bone fibril are estimated and compared with previously computed values.

Uneven temperature across the width of steel strips during rolling generates flatness defects due to differences in the contraction of the longitudinal fibers that make up a strip. In this work, a compensation process to modify the objective flatness using information about the temperature differences is designed. Compensation for uneven temperature is accomplished in two successive phases: a real time calculation of the temperature profile which best describes the temperature differences, and the modification of the objective flatness to take the temperature profile into account. To calculate the temperature profile, an adaptive moving-average filter is proposed. This information is used to modify the objective flatness carrying out the temperature compensation

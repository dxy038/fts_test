Background and objective: Infectious diarrhea diseases are a great problem throughout the world and are responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries.

Material and Methods: 808 stool specimens collected from patients with acute diarrhea during the May 2004 to May 2005 in Tehran and diarrheagenic enteropathogens were identified by their virulence genes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fecal samples from patients with acute diarrhea were cultured and identified according to standard methods.

Results: Among 808 specimens, 369(45.6%) isolated and categorized as enteropathogenic bacteria. The most frequent isolated enteric pathogens from acute diarrhea were Shigella spp. 155(45.6%) and diarrheagenic E.coli 143(38.8%). Salmonella spp. 51(13.8%) and Campylobacter spp. 20(5.4%) recovered in the lower rate compare to others. Predominant isolated diarrheagenic E.coli were STEC strains 64(44.7%) followed by ETEC 47(32.9%). Shigella flexneri isolates were commonest among Shigella strains 69(44.5%). Multiple pathogens were recovered in 18(4.8%) of isolated enteropathogens that were predominantly associated to STEC and EAEC strains.

Conclusion: The current study showed that Shigella spp. are the predominant enteropathogens causing acute diarrhea in Tehran, Iran. In addition, diarrheagenic E. coli can be as a pathogenic species with remarkable versatility in its ability to cause disease in human's accurate knowledge on the etiology and the prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases as well as routine diagnosis for diarrheagenic enteropathogens would be useful to design of preventive strategies and control of infectious diarrhoeal diseases.

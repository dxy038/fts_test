The objective of this study is the development of generalized two-dimensional finite-difference model (FDM) for the calculation of conductor temperatures and ampacities of a cable-system with separation between the cables ranging from direct contact to a finite distance. The heat-sources or sinks which are the conductors are represented in the model as a two-dimensional finite-difference thermal resistance mesh, which is solved by iteration using the digital computer. The effects on conductor temperature due to skin effect, eddy currents, and associated losses have also been included in the analysis for completeness

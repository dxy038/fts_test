This paper describes a new control laboratory device, named ball on beam on roller. The control objective is to govern the position of a ball on the beam, the latter freely resting on the driven roller. The angular attitude of the beam is varied by shifting the lateral position of the beam, through control of the rollerÂ´s angular acceleration. The system is under-actuated and has complex dynamics.

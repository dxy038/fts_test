Distributed generators like fuel cell, Micro Turbine and etc are going to be placed near the end user. Such distributed generators (DGs) are increased under effect of various policies like distribution loss reduction, increase system reliability and creating more facilities for distribution networks if they are allocated appropriately in the distribution system. The purpose of this paper is DG allocation in network, considering multi objective function and Time varying load over the year. Objective function enhances benefits of system which are loss reduction and system reliability improvement and reduction of energy buying from transmission line along the planning period. For achieving these purposes dynamic programming is applied as an optimization tool, leading to worthy results in DG allocation. The proposed methodology has been successfully applied to a sample system.

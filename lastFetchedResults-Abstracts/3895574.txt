The switching waveforms and losses of a GaN gate injection transistor (GIT) bidirectional switch, a type of four-terminal device, were analyzed for the first time using an equivalent circuit model. By applying a three-terminal model to the equivalent circuit model of the GIT bidirectional switch and by using the waveforms of the chopper circuit, the parameters were derived with high accuracy. Furthermore, gate resistance dependence was added to the input capacitance component connected to the gate terminal in order to contain the influence of the gate structure of the GIT. It was confirmed that the calculated switching waveforms and losses agree well with those of the experimental values with over 90% accuracy, even in cases where circuit conditions for circuit voltage, load current, and gate resistance were varied.

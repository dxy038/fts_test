<p><strong>Objective: </strong>The aim of this study was to compare creativity in children with and without attention deficit hyperactivity ‎disorder.<br /><strong>Method:</strong> This was an analytic and descriptive study. Participants were 33 children aged 7-12 years selected from a ‎child and adolescent psychiatric clinic at Imam Hossein hospital (Tehran, Iran), who were diagnosed with ‎ADHD by a child and adolescent psychiatrist. They met the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for ADHD and had ‎no comorbidity according to K-SADS (Kiddi-Scadule for Affective disorders and Schizophrenia). They ‎were requested not to take any medication. They took the Figural TTCT (Torrance Test of Creativity ‎Thinking) and Raven Intelligence test after using medication. Thirty-three age and sex-matched children ‎selected from the regional schools were recruited for the control group. They did not have any ‎psychiatric disorders according to K-SADS. The Figural TTCT and Raven Intelligence test were conducted ‎for the controls as well. ‎<br /><strong>Results:</strong> No statistically significant difference was found in the intelligence score and the mean±SD of the total ‎score of creativity between children with ADHD (125.2 ± 42.6) and the control group (130.6 ± 47.5) (P ‎value = 0.49). Children with ADHD had worse function in fluency and flexibility items and were not ‎different in originality and elaboration items.‎<strong><br />Conclusion</strong>: The creativity of children with ADHD is not different from that of the control group.‎</p>

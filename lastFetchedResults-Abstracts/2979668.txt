A succinctest design of a mixed voltage bidirectional buffer in the literature is proposed for interface applications. By employing a floating N-well circuit technique, two series PMOS transistors are used as an active pull-up driver. Such a structure provides a simple circuit that requires only a single terminal pad, a single power supply, and is free of DC leakage current. Mixed voltage interface applications such as 3.3 V/5 V, 2.5 V/3.3 V and 5 V/12 V are demonstrated

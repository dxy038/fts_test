The use of a voltage source converter high voltage DC (VSC-HVDC) transmission system in parallel with an AC submarine cable to connect a large offshore wind farm to the grid is discussed. The main objective of such connection is to address the reliability issues of the point-to-point VSC-HVDC transmission scheme in the event of AC and DC faults. Control system design is described in detail and the performance of this arrangement is explored under different fault conditions. The study was conducted in Simulink.

Objective: In recent years, studies have focused on the telomerase for cancer treatment by repressing telomerase in cancerous cells or prevent cell aging by activating it in the aged cells. Thus, in these studies natural and synthetic agents have been used to repress or activate telomerase. In this research, we investigated the effects of human growth hormone (hGH) on aging via evaluation of telomerase activity.

Materials and Methods: Primary human foreskin fibroblast cells were isolated, cultured and treated with different concentrations of hGH. BrdU and MTT cell proliferation assays and cells number counting. Cell aging was assayed by the senescence sensitive galactosidase staining method. Telomerase activity was measured with a telomerase PCR ELISA kit. Data were analyzed with SPSS software (one-way ANOVA and univariate ANOVA).

Results: Our results indicated that cells treated with a lower concentration (0.1, 1 ng/ml) of hGH had more green color cells (aged cells). Furthermore, cell proliferation increased with increasing hGH concentrations (10 to 100 ng/ml) which was significant in comparison with untreated control cells. TRAP assay results indicated that telomerase activity increased with increasing hGH concentration, but there was no significant difference. Additionally, more rapid cell growth and telomerase activity was noted in the absence of H202 when compared with the presence of H202, which was significantly different. Conclusion: Although increasing cell proliferation along with increasing hGH concentration was confirmed by all cell proliferation assays, only the cell counting test was statistically significant. Thus, it is inconclusive that hGH (up to 100 ng/ml) has an anti-aging effect. Also, because there was no significant difference in the telomerase activity results (in spite of increasing progress along with increasing hGH concentration) we can not certainly conclude that hGH (up to 100 ng/ml) impacts telomerase activity.

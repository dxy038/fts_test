Recently, biped robotics becomes an interesting topic for many control researchers. But it is easy to fall down. It is difficult to control a biped robot for stably walking. So, the generation of the optimal walking trajectory is a important question for a biped robot to keep walking stably. This paper is proposed for generating the walking trajectories resulted in best performance of the biped robot using multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, although we know only mechanical information for a biped robot. We formulate a trajectory generation problem as a multi-objective optimal problem. We obtain all Pareto-optimal solutions on the feasible solution region for the walking trajectory generation of a biped robot. Moreover these solutions are confirmed through simulations of a real biped robot frame.

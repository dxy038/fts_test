The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of metal mobilizing agents, ethelynediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and salicylic acid (SA), on the accumulation and translocation of lead (Pb) and nickel (Ni) by fenugreek (<em>Trigonellafoenum-graecum</em><a title="Carolus Linnaeus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolus_Linnaeus">L<em>.</em></a>) plants in contaminated soil. EDTA and SA were amended at 100 mM and 1.0 mM respectively. Pb and Ni content were estimated using ICP-OES. Plant samples were prepared for scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis to investigate metals distribution in different tissues (root, stem and leaf) of plant. The results showed that EDTA increased Pb and Ni uptake as compared to SA. SEM analysis revealed that in the presence of EDTA, the deposition of Pb particles was predominantly in vascular tissues of the stem and leaf. <br /><div id="__if72ru4sdfsdfrkjahiuyi_once" style="display: none;"> </div><div id="__if72ru4sdfsdfruh7fewui_once" style="display: none;"> </div><div id="__hggasdgjhsagd_once" style="display: none;"> </div>

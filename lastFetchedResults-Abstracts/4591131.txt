Customs clearance consists of a set of key processes in container supply chain. It is an important issue how can we evaluate and choose the optimal process chain to finish the clearance. In this study, the processes of customs clearance are modeled by graph. Then, a multi-objective optimization model is proposed. The case from Shanghai port is studied to reveal a real application, and the Pareto set and the effectiveness of the solution are discussed.

The objective of this paper is to investigate the effects of changing age
distribution on national savings in Iran. We examine this topic within the
framework of the life-cycle hypothesis (LCH) based on Ando-Modigliani
theory. So, the empirical savings function takes account of changes in the
age distribution of the population.
This study applies cointegration technique to annual time series data over
the period 1966 - 2004. More specifically, an autoregressive distributed lag
(ARDL) model is employed to estimate savings function. Moreover, an error
correction model (ECM) of national savings behavior is also specified and
estimated in order to reveal the short run dynamic adjustments of savings
towards its long run equilibrium.
We find evidence for a significant relationship between population age
Structure and national savings in Iran. In particular, the young (age 15 - 24
years) and elderly (55 years and older) population groups have negative
impact on national savings, while the working age population (age 25 -54
years) has positive impact on national savings. However, population between
35 and 44 years of age has relatively higher impact on national savings
compared with other population groups. Overall, the results suggest that the
demographic structure is an important determinant of national savings in
Iran.

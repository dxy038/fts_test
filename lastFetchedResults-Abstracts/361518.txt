Study objective: We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of myoglobin determination for the early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods:  Consecutive patients with chest pain were included in the study. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess optimal timing of blood sampling and cutoff values. Results:  A total of 309 patients were included, of whom 162 patients had a diagnosis of AMI. ROC analysis revealed that the diagnostic accuracy of myoglobin concentration as indicated by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) increased significantly from 3 (0.89±0.026) and 4 hours (0.93±0.019) to 5 hours after onset of symptoms (0.96±0.014; P  =.0040 and .035, respectively). At 5 hours (the earliest time point with maximal AUC), sensitivity was 87% and specificity was 97% using a myoglobin cutoff value of 90 μg/L. With a myoglobin cutoff value of 50 μg/L, sensitivity was 95% (95% confidence interval 90% to 98%), but specificity was 86% (95% confidence interval 80% to 93%). Conclusion:  Myoglobin has maximal diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of AMI at 5 hours after the onset of symptoms, using a cutoff value of 50 μg/L. In combination with the measurement of other biochemical markers, myoglobin determination could be particularly useful for triage of patients with AMI at an early stage.

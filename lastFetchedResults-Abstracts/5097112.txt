The objective was to create a flow phantom as a testing apparatus for high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) research. This flow phantom mimicked muscle tissue in its acoustic attenuation, speed of sound, and density. Agar was used as the gelling agent. Gels produced using only agar and water did not adequately mimic muscle tissues. Scattering and attenuating particles had to be added to the gel to improve the properties. The particles had a diameter in 10-100 mum range to facilitate ultrasound scattering. These particles also needed to have a significantly higher molecular weight than the water. Sawdust, graphite, egg whites, multivitamins, calcium, magnesium and potassium were all tried as additive materials. Along with a tissue mimic the flow phantom includes a blood mimic, artery mimic, peristaltic pump and a dampening column to modify the pressure wave produced by the pump.

The increment of power demand can cause a rapid reduction in voltage profile that can disrupt system stability leading to potential failure on the entire system as the system has to work under a stressed condition. Thus, the Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) are integrated in power system to control the power flow in specific lines and improve the security of transmission line. This paper proposes a static voltage stability index (SVSI) for placement of Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC) and used Evolutionary Programming (EP) techniques for optimal sizing of TCSC used for system under contingencies. The objective of the study is to minimize the total real power losses, and at the same time monitoring the voltage profile along with the installation cost. Critical contingency cases have been used to decide optimal sizing for the placement of TCSC. The TCSC devices are installed in the system in order to enhance the system security; performed on the IEEE 30-bus RTS for several loading conditions. The simulations results are compared with those obtained from the Artificial Immune System (AIS) technique in the attempt to highlight its merit.

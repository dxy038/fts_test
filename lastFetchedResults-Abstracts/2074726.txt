Fava beans (Vicia faba L.) are a popular food in many countries. However, there is a lack of information about the phenolic composition of some important edible varieties. Polyphenols in fava beans are located in several parts of the plant (e.g. leaves, roots and seeds) but their occurrence in immature seeds is most important for human nutrition. The objective of this work was to study the phenolic composition of the major groups of polyphenols in 10 varieties of immature fava beans. Total phenolics ranged from 817 to 1337 mg gallic-acid equivalent per kilogram and condensed tannin content ranged from 309 to 958 mg (+)-catechin equivalent per kilogram. Different procyanidins, prodelphinidins, flavonols and flavones were identified using high performance liquid chromatography. Mean levels of total proanthocyanidins were 2233 mg/kg while the sum of flavonols and flavones was 252 mg/kg. The results from this study revealed clear differences in the phenolic composition among different varieties of immature V. faba L. seeds and demonstrates that there is ample phenotypic variability for future selections studies for traits such as nutritional value, taste, and ease of production.

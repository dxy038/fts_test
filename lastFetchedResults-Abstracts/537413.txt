Objective

Malnutrition is commonly considered as an important risk factor that can produce a negative influence on the prognosis of patients with chronic neurological diseases. We aimed to evaluate the nutritional status of patients admitted to the neurology ward of Mofid children's hospital via subjective and objective methods.

Materials & Methods

61 children (2-6 years of age) who were consecutively hospitalized at the neurology ward between January and March 2008 underwent objective (weight, height, mid upper arm circumference- MUAC- and triceps skinfold thickness- TSF) and subjective nutritional assessment.

Results

The result showed that 42.6%, 37.7% and 25.9% of patients were consecutively wasted, underweight and stunted. The z- Scores for TSF and MUAC were below -1 in 32.7% and 41.8% of the patients,  consecutively. According to subjective Assessments (SGNA), 52.7% were malnourished. The prevalence of malnutrition was not significantly different between sex or diagnosis groups.

Conclusion

malnutrition is of high prevalence in patients with neurologic diseases. Regular assessment and timely nutritional support may improve the situation.

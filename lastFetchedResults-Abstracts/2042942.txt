The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of key extraction parameters of extraction time (5–25 min), acid concentration (0–0.06 M HCl) and ultrasound amplitude (22.8–114 μm) on yields of bioactive compounds (total phenolics, fucose and uronic acid) from Ascophyllum nodosum. Response surface methodology was employed to optimize the extraction variables for bioactive compounds’ yield. A second order polynomial model was fitted well to the extraction experimental data with (R2 &gt; 0.79). Extraction yields of 143.12 mg GAE/gdb, 87.06 mg/gdb and 128.54 mg/gdb were obtained for total phenolics, fucose and uronic acid respectively at optimized extraction conditions of extraction time (25 min), acid concentration (0.03 M HCl) and ultrasonic amplitude (114 μm). Mass spectroscopy analysis of extracts show that ultrasound enhances the extraction of high molecular weight phenolic compounds from A. nodosum. This study demonstrates that ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) can be employed to enhance extraction of bioactive compounds from seaweed.

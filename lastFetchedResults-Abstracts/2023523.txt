Understanding the dynamics of soil C is key to managing soil organic matter to enhance soil quality and ecosystem functioning, and reduce trace gas emissions from soils. Our objective was to determine the source and turnover of C pools in some agricultural soils in eastern Canada. Soils from five field experiments under continuous maize cropping for 4â€“37 yr were sampled, and the organic C content and stable C isotope (13C) composition of whole soil and water soluble and microbial biomass fractions determined. The 13C results showed a clear distinction between the water soluble organic C and microbial biomass C, with the water soluble organic C more like the whole soil and the microbial biomass more like the maize residues. A simple linear model was used to explore the relationship among the soil organic constituents and evaluate the turnover of these carbon pools. Even though the water soluble organic C had a higher turnover rate than the microbial biomass C, the proportion of C4-derived C in the biomass was about 2.5 times greater than that in water soluble organic C. Apparently the large amount of native soil C, the small amount of water soluble organic C, and its equilibrium with the native soil C, cause humus to dominate the isotopic composition of water soluble organic C even though the water soluble C is very active. Our results suggest that the quantity, as well as the turnover rate, of soil organic matter constituents that are in equilibrium influence the isotopic composition of such constituents.

Prior to the construction or validation of objective video quality metrics, ground-truth data must be collected by means of a subjective video database. This database consists of (impaired) video sequences and corresponding subjective quality ratings. However, creating this subjective database is a time-consuming and expensive task. There is an ongoing effort towards publishing such subjective video databases into the public domain. This facilitates the development of new objective quality metrics. In this paper, we present a new subjective video database consisting of impaired High Definition H.264/AVC encoded video sequences and associated quality ratings gathered from a subjective experiment. This database can be used freely to determine impairment visibility or estimate overall quality of a video in the case of lost slices due to network impairments.

Obesity is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) and CV mortality. Bariatric surgery has been shown to resolve or improve CVD risk factors, to varying degrees. The objective of this systematic review was to determine the impact of bariatric surgery on CV risk factors and mortality. A systematic review of the published research was performed to evaluate evidence regarding CV outcomes in morbidly obese bariatric patients. Two major databases (PubMed and the Cochrane Library) were searched. The review included all original reports reporting outcomes after bariatric surgery, published in English, from January 1950 to July 2010. In total, 637 studies were identified from the initial screen. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 52 studies involving 16,867 patients were included (mean age 42 years, 78% women). The baseline prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia was 49%, 28%, and 46%, respectively. Mean follow-up was 34 months (range 3 to 155), and the average excess weight loss was 52% (range 16% to 87%). Most studies reported significant decreases postoperatively in the prevalence of CV risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Mean systolic pressure reduced from to 139 to 124 mm Hg and diastolic pressure from 87 to 77 mm Hg. C-reactive protein decreased, endothelial function improved, and a 40% relative risk reduction for 10-year coronary heart disease risk was observed, as determined by the Framingham risk score. In conclusion, this review highlights the benefits of bariatric surgery in reducing or eliminating risk factors for CVD. It provides further evidence to support surgical treatment of obesity to achieve CVD risk reduction.

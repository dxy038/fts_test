The fatty acid composition of sperm affects the fertilization rate. The objective was to investigate the effects of dietary fish oil
(as a source of n-3 fatty acids) on semen quality and sperm fatty acid composition in sheep. Eight Zandi fat-tailed rams were
randomly allocated into two groups and fed either a control diet or a diet supplemented with fish oil. Both diets were isocaloric
and isonitrogenous and were fed for 13 weeks, starting in the middle of the breeding season. Semen samples were collected
weekly and their characteristics evaluated by standard methods, whereas samples collected at the start and end of the study
were assessed (gas chromatography) for sperm lipid composition. Mean (6s.e.m.) sperm concentrations (4.3310961.33108
v. 3.9310961.33108 sperm/ml and percentages of motile (77.2563.34 v. 60.863.34) and progressively motile sperm
(74.1361.69 v. 62.6961.69) were significantly higher in the fish oil group than control. Dietary fish oil increased the proportion
of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 n-3) in sperm fatty acid composition. We concluded that feeding fish oil as a source of
n-3 fatty acids attenuated seasonal declines in semen quality in rams, perhaps through increased DHA in sperm.

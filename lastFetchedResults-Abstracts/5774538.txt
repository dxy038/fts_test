The paper presents a domain hybrid subsampling-interpolation (DHSI) technique, which can adaptively change subsampling and interpolation modes according to the intrapixel correlation of domains in an image. The analysis both in theory and experiments show that in the reconstructed image, all details such as one-pixel wide lines will be completely recovered while using DHSI and it is the optimal subsampling-interpolation method when assessing using subjective and objective fidelity criteria

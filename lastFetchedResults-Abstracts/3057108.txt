Active vibration control is an important problem in structures. One of the ways to tackle this problem is to make the structure smart, adaptive and self-controlling. The objective of active vibration control is to reduce the vibration of a system by automatic modification of the systemÂ´s structural response. This work features the modeling and design of a robust decentralized controller for a smart flexible system using fast output sampling feedback control technique when there is a failure of a system component (say, an actuator) to function. In this proposed control law, the control inputs to each actuator of the multimodel is a function of the output of that corresponding sensor only and the gain matrix has all off-diagonal terms zero. The designed robust controller provides satisfactory stabilization of the multimodel smart structure system.

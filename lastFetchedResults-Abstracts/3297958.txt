Restoration of images has become a major stream in the digital image processing. Restoring blurred images for effective information retrieval and feature extraction has been focused by researchers worldwide. The Simulink model of an iterative algorithm has been presented in this paper. Restoration has been achieved iterative filtering approach followed by a contrast enhancement module. The images are blurred using mean blurring function with BSNR of 100. The performances are estimated using objective function and PSNR. The obtained value of the PSNR is about 6.25.

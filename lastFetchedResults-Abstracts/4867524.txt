To avoid the defects of traditional mathematical approach evaluating on urban passenger transportation system, and the subjective interference to determine the index weight. A new fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, combining with the improved analytic hierarchy process (IAHP) to determine the index weight, is introduced in this paper. This method can make up for the original defects, also avoid one-sidedness of single factor decision making and the peopleÂ´s subjective cognition. A case study indicates that the new method is simple and results are objective and reasonable.

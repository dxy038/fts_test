Background and objective: Satureja is belongs to Lamiaceae family. About 14 species have been reported in Iran. The aim of this study was to determine antimicrobial effect of the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of Satureja bachtiarica (different concentrations) on Listeria monocytogenes PTCC 1297، Bacillus cereus PTCC 1154،Enterobacter aerogenes PTCC 1221، Enterococcus faecalis PTCC 1237 & Salmonella typhi PTCC 1609 ” in vitro”.
Material & methods: In this study, antimicrobial effect of the extracts evaluated by two methods, “Collins method” (spreading of the extract on medium surface) and “disk agar diffusion method”. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) for both species determined by using a dilution method.
Results: The results showed that in "disk agar diffusion test ", ethanolic extract had inhibition effect on Listeria monocytogenes ،Bacillus cereus and Enterococcus faecalis. The result shows that MIC of Satureja bachtiarica leaves of the aqueous and ethanolic extracts for Enterobacter aerogenes was 64 and 32 mg/ml respectively. The MBC aqueous and ethanolic extracts of Satureja bachtiarica leaves for Enterobacter aerogenes was 128 and 64 mg/ml respectively. 
Conclusions: The ethanolic extract of Satureja bachtiarica leaves “in vitro” have a significant antimicrobial effect on gram-negative bacteria  Salmonella typhi  and Enterobacter aerogenes and the gram-positive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes، Bacillus cereus and Enterococcus faecalis. Enterobacter aerogenes was resistant to most of the aqueous and ethanolic Satureja bachtiarica extracts.

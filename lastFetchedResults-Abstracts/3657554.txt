This paper addresses the flow allocation problem in multi-hop wireless networks. We define and formulate a new interference model, referred to as the Node-based Interference Model, to better capture the behavior of medium access control protocols and the physical layer interference issues. Based on this model, we formulate the problem as a cross-layer network utility maximization problem that considers the coordination of the transport, MAC and physical layers, and avoid the maximum clique or independent set enumeration approach as adopted in most of the existing work. The objective of the problem is to maximize the aggregate network throughput while maintaining the fairness among flows. We then propose a gradient-based flow allocation algorithm by using the duality approach, and analyze the rate of convergence to the optimum for the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can rapidly converge to the optimum, and can also rapidly adapt to the changes in network topology and routing paths in different flow scenarios.

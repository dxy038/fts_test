Objective: Studies have identified high prevalence of depression among people living with HIV/AIDS, but
only few studies have looked into this association in this environment. The objectives were to determine the
prevalence of major depressive disorder, associated socio-demographic and psychosocial variables in people
living with HIV/AIDS attending an out-patient clinic at the Olabisi Onabanjo Teaching Hospital (OOUTH),
Sagamu, Nigeria.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out on one-hundred and thirty subjects living with HIV/AIDS
attending out-patient clinic at the OOUTH, Sagamu. They were assessed with a socio-demographic questionnaire
designed by the researchers, and they also had a clinical interview with the depression module of the Structured
Clinical Interview Schedule for Axis 1 DSM-IV disorders (SCID). The diagnosis was made according to the
DSM- IV criteria and severity assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for depression.
Results: The prevalence of depression was 23.1% and was higher than figures reported in the general
population studies in Nigeria. Of this proportion 46.7%, 50%, 3.3% were mildly, moderately and severely
depressed. Majority (40%) were within the 30-39 years range. Women accounted for 69.2% of the study
population and 46.9% of the subjects were either divorced/separated or widowed. Depression was significantly
associated with being female and having suicidal thoughts or attempt. There was no association between marital
status, disclosure of status and duration of HIV diagnosis.
Conclusion: The prevalence of depression is high among people living with HIV/AIDS in Nigeria. An
appropriate mental health intervention programme would be necessary as part of national programme for people
living with HIV/AIDS to reduce the negative impact of depression on them.

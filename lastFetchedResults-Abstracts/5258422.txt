The notion of poly-alphabetic radar, which gave improved performance through coincidence detection, is analyzed. It is argued that what was central to poly-alphabetic signal design was a poly-semanticism, which was achieved through poly-alphabetism. But, the former can be achieved even within a single alphabet. This is illustrated and the attendant signal design problem is solved. The design is completed in two steps: the first one using a restricted Hamming scan algorithm for interspersed sequences and the second one using a complete Hamming scan, using an appropriate joint-objective function.

This paper presents lightweight optimum design of electromagnet in magnetic levitation system. This paper deals with the possibility of using the response surface methodology (RSM) and characteristic function methodology for optimization of an electromagnet model with a higher number of the design variables. An optimum design process is introduced to design an electromagnet to reduce its weight and to improve normal force of initially designed electromagnet with many design variables. The magnetostatic analysis of electromagnet is performed by using ANSYS. This paper procedure is validated by the comparison between experimental and calculation result. The most effective design variables were extracted by Pareto chart and ANOM. The most desired set is determined and the influence of each design variables on the objective function can be obtained. Therefore, when this proposed approach is applied, it can efficiency raise the precision of the optimization and reduce the number of experiments in the optimization design.

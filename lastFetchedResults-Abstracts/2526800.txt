For good management in rangeland, information of Chemical composite is essential which is influenced by various factors. The main objective of this research was investigation on effects of species and phenological stages on values of chemical composite of five rangeland species. Species were three grasses (Bromus persicus and Dactylis glomerata, Poa alpine), two forbs (Thymus vulgari, Onobrychis cornota). Samples were collected from highland rangelands of Ramiyan. They were dried, grained and analyzed in Laboratory. The results showed that chemical composite values including crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF), dry matter digestibility (DMD) and metabolizable energy (ME) were significantly differed among phenological stages (P<0.01). For all species CP, DMD, and Me decreased and ADF increased with plant growth development. Considering chemical composite values among five species, Onobrychis cornota had highest chemical composite. Among species, Onobrychis cornuta the maximum amount of crude protein (24.3), metabolizable energy (10.1) and dry matter digestibility (69.0) and, Dactylis glomerata has a minimum crude protein (13.2), energy metabolism (9.7) and dry matter digestibility (62.4), respectively.

During the last few years, as energy saving and emission control have become important issues with extensive concerns, economic benefits could no longer be the only purpose considered in long-term generation scheduling. This work presents a multi-objective linear model with the optimization of all the objectives including electricity purchasing cost, fuel consumption and pollutant emission taken into account in yearly generation scheduling. Since the objectives are conflicting to each other, game theory is applied to obtain a compromised solution satisfying all the objectives under a two person-zero sum game viewpoint. An actual power system is employed to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach. Conversion between these objectives could be calculated and the reasonability of results obtained by game method is discussed in this paper.

This paper investigates the implementation of both linear model predictive control (LMPC) and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to a full bridge dc/dc converter under starting, overload, and load step change conditions. The control objective is to regulate the output voltage without violating the peak current constraint. The integrated perturbation analysis and sequential quadratic programming method is employed to solve the nonlinearly constrained optimal control problems with 300 &#956; s sampling time. The experimental results reveal that both the LMPC and NMPC schemes can successfully achieve voltage regulation and peak current protection. The experimental results are reported and several observations, seemingly counterintuitive, are analyzed to offer insight into the use of MPC for these challenging applications.

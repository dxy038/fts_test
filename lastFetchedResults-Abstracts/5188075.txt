When wireless sensor network used in complex indoor environment, great propagation loss will be caused and difficult to optimize routing adaptively when environment changed. Based on these problems, we presented a protocol-Indoor Energy load-balanced Routing (IEBR). IEBR formulate the routing setup process as the typical multiple attribute decision making process, use objective and subjective weight method and mean square deviation method to adjust the weight coefficient. Nodes can choose an optimal node to relay the data by comprehensive consideration of the weight coefficient, the propagation loss and the energy of its neighbor nodes. Simulation results show that the IEBR make weight coefficient adaptive dynamically, lead to an appropriate allocation of the data. When used in indoor environment, sensor network could obtain a much more even energy distribution, accordingly the lifetime of the sensor network will be prolonged.

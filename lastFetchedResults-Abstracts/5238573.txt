We describe the analysis of a discrete event simulation model of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV disease, parameterized to describe the dual epidemics in Harare, Zimbabwe. The HIV epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly severe and has led to a significant rise in TB cases. We use the model to evaluate new strategies for improved detection of TB cases in a high HIV prevalence setting. The structure of the model and its validation will be discussed, but the paper will focus on the analysis of the model output.

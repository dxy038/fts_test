The paper analyses and discusses domestic energy consumption patterns in the city of Jeddah characterized by its hot and humid climate and its geographical location in a global region renowned for its high energy consumption and carbon emission rates. The selected case studies involve three typical houses and three typical flats with the objective of analysing their average domestic energy consumption based on (a) monthly electricity bills, (b) user behaviour captured through interviews with the selected propertiesâ€™ occupants, and (c) detailed energy modelling and simulation using IES-VE software. Resulting high energy consumption patterns are then discussed focussing on building design (form and fabric) and user behaviour. Based on the identified design weaknesses, regionally replicable energy retrofitting solutions (including, shading devices, domestic renewable energy sources, and efficient glazing) are explored and simulated in IES-VE suggesting an energy consumption reduction in a range from 21% to 37%. Regionally replicable recommendations are then proposed.

The objective is to control a web transport system with winder and unwinder for elastic material. A physical modeling of this plant is made based on the general laws of physics. For this type of control problem, it is extremely important to prevent the occurrence of web break or fold by decoupling the web tension and the web velocity. Due to the wide-range variation of the radius and inertia of the rollers the system dynamics change considerably during the winding/unwinding process. Different strategies for web tension control and linear transport velocity control are presented. First, an H<sub>&#8734;</sub> robust control strategy which reduces the coupling between tension and velocity, is compared to the decentralized control strategy with proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers commonly used in the industry. Second, an H<sub>&#8734;</sub> robust control strategy with varying gains is shown to render the control more robust to the radius variations. Then, a linear parameter varying (LPV) control strategy with smooth scheduling of controllers is synthesized for different operating points and compared to the previous methods. Finally, this LPV control and the H<sub>&#8734;</sub> robust control strategy with varying gains are combined to give the best results on an experimental setup, for the rejection of the disturbances introduced by velocity variations and for the robustness to radius and inertia changes

In the circumstances that evidences are highly or full conflict, D-S evidence combination method may lose effectiveness, for this reason some improved methods of evidence combination are given in succession. Some scholars think, different evidence source is under different circumstance, so the importance of each evidence source is different. In the conditions that evidences are highly or full conflict, it is necessary to give weight to every evidence source, then conflict probability can only just be assigned. In this paper, we construct an evaluating standard with basic proposition and its rough combined probability value, to calculate the weight coefficient of every evidence source, based on that, conflict probability is assigned, combination of evidences is built. In this method, subjective information from decision-makers is used, and objective information from evidences is also used, only little artificial job is needed. This method can be achieved on computer easily, and satisfying consequence can be obtained.

Their ability to convert mechanical and chemical information from inside and outside the cell rests on the function of the complex signaling network. Here, the integrin signaling network is constructed and visualized, in which 156 components are linked by 690 interactions with an average node degree of 8.66, cluster coefficient of 0.24 and path length of 2.6. Several functional modules are involved in switching on or off many of the molecular interactions within the network, consequently affecting cell adhesion, migration and cytoskeletal organization. Screening and examination of the adhesome network motifs reveals a relatively small number of key motifs, dominated by 3-nodes (three-component complexes). The results will be of potentials for specific targeting, which are desirable in cell, disease diagnosis and therapy, and drug discovery.

The provision of data services in 3G systems requires spectral efficiency solutions to increase the capacity of the radio access network as well as support for high data rates. In this context, the 3GPP introduces a new feature in the release 5 specifications denominated high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA). The HSDPA concept appears as an umbrella of features to improve both user and system performance. The concept includes a reduction of the transmission time interval (TTI) to 2 ms, an adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) scheme, and a fast physical layer hybrid ARQ mechanism. In this paper the objective is to analyze the HSDPA performance for streaming, interactive, and background services. Relevant characteristics such as the QoS demands of the different traffic classes, the throughput and delay characteristics has been analyzed and compared with shared channel. We also propose a new packet-scheduling scheme for HSDPA transmission, which improves the overall performance and fairness among the packet users.

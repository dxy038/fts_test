The objective of this work is to examine the rheological properties of hydrogel comosites containing carbon nanobrushes. The composite, which is electrically conductive, is comprised of carbon nanobrushes embedded in a biocompatible poloxamer gel. This work assesses the ability of such composite gels to act as a matrix for tissue engineering, specifically for connective tissue. In such a model, chondrocytes would be seeded within the hydrogel matrix and then injected into the body. This work analyzes the rheological differences between hydrogels of different concentrations. The work also demonstrates that carbon nanobrushes can be dispersed within poloxamer gels. Previously it has been shown that fibroblasts and myocytes can proliferate within homogenously dispersed carbon nanobrush-containing poloxamer gels. Future work will examine the effects of design parameters including carbon nanobrush content and matrix structure on wound healing, chondrocyte proliferation within the hydrogel composites, and mechanical properties of the gels. This work has relevance for tissue engineering and tissue regeneration in clinical medicine.

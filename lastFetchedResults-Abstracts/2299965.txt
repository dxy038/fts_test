The objective of this report is to describe the multidisciplinary management of a cervical resorptive defect using periodontal surgery, endodontic treatment, mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and composite resin filling. The resorptive defect was obturated using MTA following the reflection of a mucoperiosteal flap and conventional root canal treatment was completed. The cervical extension of the MTA-filled cavity, which was evident following the suturing of the flap, was reduced and filled with a composite filling material. No complaints were noted by the patient and at the 18-month follow-up the prognosis was favorable. By appropriate multidisciplinary management, root resorptions may be treated successfully. MTA may serve as a good option in such situations owing to its multi-beneficial properties.

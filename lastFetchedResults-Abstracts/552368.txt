Introduction: One of the probable causes of enuresis is an obstruction in upper airway and especially adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Adenotonsillectomy may be an effective treatment in some cases. This study carried out with patients suffering from adenotonsillar hypertrophy.

Objective: To determine the incidence of enuresis and the effects of surgery on it.

Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 100 children aged 3-12 years with Adenotonsilar hypertrophy in 5-Azar Hospital who were candidates for Adenotonislectomy. They were examined by an otolaryngologist and, if needed, by a urologist. UA and UC were done for all of them, and data were recorded in a questionnaire. The results were evaluated 1 and 3 months post surgery, and finally the collected data were analyzed by SPSS software. Results: The present study was conducted on 100 children consisting of 49 males and 51 females, aged between 3-12 years (mean 7.68). The prevalence of enuresis was found to be 9%, and its rate among the males was twice that of the females.

One month after surgery, complete improvement in 22-2% and partial improvement in 33-3% of the cases were observed. The general improvement after 3 months was 54.3%.

Conclusion: Taking into account the correlations between adenotonsilar hypertrophy, enuresis and improved enuresis following surgery, the relative improvement of enuresis can serve as an indication for surgery in patients with adenotonsilar hypertrophy.

In this paper, course timetabling problem was referred as the research object, the objective function converted by many constraints and soft constraint condition was analyzed. Established the mathematical model, proposed discrete particle swarm algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm that combined to settle course timetabling problem, which ensured that the particles escaped from the local minimum, guaranteed that the curriculum be more close to the ideal, the experimental results showed that the better results can be obtained by the method.

Hydrofluidization is a method of chilling and freezing of foods that uses a circulating system that pumps the refrigerating liquid upwards through orifices and/or nozzles into a refrigerating vessel, thereby creating submerged agitating jets and increasing heat transfer to foods during freezing. The objective of this work was to develop a model to estimate the fluid flow and heat and mass transfer in a hydrofluidization system. A study case of modeling and validating the heat transfer to a single stationary copper sphere of 20-mm diameter impinged by a single round jet of liquid was carried out using computational fluid dynamics. The simulations were performed using parameters such as: velocity of the liquid at the orifice exit (2.36–7.07 m s−1), temperature of the liquid refrigerant (−5 to −15 °C) and distance between the orifice and the stagnation point of the sphere (1 and 5 cm). In general, the errors of the model were in the order of magnitude of the uncertainty of the experimental data of Nusselt number averaged over the sphere surface. Also, the simulated heat transfer and flow field parameters were comparable with those obtained in literature for similar systems.

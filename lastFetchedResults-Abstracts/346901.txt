Objective: The EEG spectral content of all-night sleep recordings obtained in 7 healthy young subjects, aged 18–20 years, including frequencies up to 45 Hz, was studied in order to detect eventual changes in the high-frequency range similar to those reported by magnetic field recording during REM sleep at 40 Hz.
Methods: For this purpose, power spectra were calculated with a fast Fourier transform and the power of the bands ranging 0.75–4.50 Hz (Delta), 4.75–7.75 (Theta), 8.00–12.25 (Alpha), 12.50–15.00 (Sigma), 15.25–24.75 (Beta), 25.00–34.75 (Gamma1), and 35.00–44.75 (Gamma 2) was calculated for-the whole period of analysis (7 h). Also two additional time series: the ratio between Beta and Gamma2, and between Gamma1 and Gamma2 were calculated (Beta and Gamma ratios).
Results: Beta and Gamma1 showed small changes with a tendency to increase during REM sleep; Gamma2, on the contrary, showed small changes with a tendency to decrease during REM sleep. Beta and Gamma ratio peaks were clearly correlated with the occurrence of REM sleep. The small changes shown by Beta, Gamma1 and Gamma2 were not statistically significant; on the contrary, Beta ratio and Gamma ratio showed the most important statistical significance values being highest during REM sleep and lowest during slow-wave sleep. Finally, the calculation of the linear correlation coefficient and of the cross-correlation between the different bands showed a clear reciprocity between Delta and Beta and Gamma ratios.
Conclusions: Our study shows a new method for the analysis of high frequencies (up to 45 Hz) in the scalp-recorded sleep EEG which allowed us to better define, as compared to previous studies on the same topic, the changes in power characteristically associated with REM sleep and correlated with the REM/non-REM ultradian rhythm, and to propose it as a tool for future studies.

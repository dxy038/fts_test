OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of routine preoperative type-and-screen testing before vaginal hysterectomy. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of all vaginal hysterectomies performed at Hutzel Hospital between 1988 and 1994 with an emphasis on those that required blood transfusion was done. All vaginal hysterectomies completed at Hutzel Hospital were included in this 6-year time period for all noncancerous indications, including fibroid uterus, endometriosis, menorrhagia, uterine prolapse, pelvic pain, cervical dysplasia, and adenomyosis. RESULTS: Among 1063 patients who underwent vaginal hysterectomy, 26 needed a blood transfusion at the time of hospitalization. Medical records of the patients who needed blood transfusions were reviewed to determine the urgency and indication. Ten of the transfusions were given preoperatively because of anemia, 7 were given intraoperatively, and 9 were given postoperatively. The seven intraoperative transfusions were given because of the physician's perception of excessive blood loss; however, none of the patients received an emergency transfusion with extreme urgency. That is, the need for the intraoperative transfusion was not immediate. All patients who received a transfusion could have waited for 20 to 30 minutes for proper type and crossmatching and subsequent transfusion. CONCLUSION: In the absence of preoperative indications, routine preoperative type-and-screen testing of blood before vaginal hysterectomy is not cost-effective, does not enhance patient care, and should be eliminated.

In this paper the implementation of a simple yet high performance digital current mode controller that achieves high power factor operation for three phase boost rectifier is described. The indicated objective is achieved without input voltage sensing and without transformation of the control variables into rotating reference frame. The controller uses the concept of resistance emulation for shaping of input current like input voltage in digital implementation. Two decoupled fixed frequency current mode controllers calculate the switching instants for equivalent single phase boost rectifiers. A combined switching strategy is developed in the form of space vectors to simultaneously satisfy the timing requirements of both the current mode controllers in a switching period. Conventional phase locked loop (PLL) is not required as converter switching is self-synchronized with the input voltage. Analytical formula is derived to obtain the steady state stability condition of the converter. A linear, low frequency, small signal model of the three phase boost rectifier is developed and verified by measurement of the voltage control transfer function. In implementation Texas InstrumentsÂ´s DSP TMS320F240F is used as the digital controller. The algorithm is tested on a 10-kW, 700-V dc, three phase boost rectifier.

The objective in this study was to find out the effect of average groundwater depth on the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of bald cypress(Taxodium distichum) at the margin of Lapoo marshlands, in a northern province of Iran. The exprimental design was a randomized complete block one with four treatments and four replications, conducted within twelve years. Differences between the average residual saplings (92, 65, 21, 8 Percent ) and various degrees of average quality of saplings (best, suitable, weak, unsuitable) in relationship to treatments (average depth of ground water) were significant. Differences between the average of the diameter of collar (192.5, 134.8, 34.7, 19.2cm), diameter at breast height (88.9, 61.4, 12.4, 7.2cm) and height of saplings(490.4, 353.4, 118.1, 91.5cm) in relationship with treatments (average depth of ground water) were significant. Comparison between the means of quantitative characteristics as well as various quality degrees (best, suitable, weak and not suitable) of bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) indicated, best place for planting is in those localities in which the average depth of groundwater is 62 centimeters (minimun +23 cm, maximum - 149.12cm). The other treatments namely average groundwater depth of 85, 97 and 124cm were not suitable for planting Taxodium distichum.

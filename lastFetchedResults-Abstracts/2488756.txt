Objective: Critical macromolecules such as DNA maybe damaged by free radicals that
are generated from the interaction of ionizing radiation with biological systems. Melatonin
and vitamin C have been shown to be direct free radical scavengers. The aim of this study
was to investigate the in vivo/in vitro radioprotective effects of melatonin and vitamin C
separately and combined against genotoxicity induced by 6 MV x-ray irradiation in human
cultured blood lymphocytes.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, fifteen volunteers were divided into
three groups of melatonin, vitamin C and melatonin plus vitamin C treatment. Peripheral
blood samples were collected from each group before, and 1, 2 and 3 hours after melatonin
and vitamin C administration (separately and combined). The blood samples were
then irradiated with 200 cGy of 6 MV x-ray. In order to characterize chromosomal aberrations,
the lymphocyte samples were cultured with mitogenic stimulus on cytokinesisblocked
binucleated cells.
Results: The samples collected 1hour after melatonin and vitamin C (separately and
combined) ingestion exhibited a significant decrease in the incidence of micronuclei compared
with their control group (P < 0.05). The maximum synergic protection and reduction
in frequency of micronuclei (57%) was observed 1 hour after vitamin C and melatonin
administration combined.
Conclusion: We conclude that simultaneous administration of melatonin and vitamin C
as radioprotector substances before irradiation may reduce genotoxicity caused by x-ray
irradiation.

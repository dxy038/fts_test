Reliability Redundancy Allocation Problem (RRAP) is a major problem in engineering design practices. RRAP includes two major concerns that are specifying the redundancy level and the reliability of each component. The purpose of this approach is to increase reliability level of system by considering related constraints. In this article a multi-objective RRAP comprising of reliability and cost as objective functions is studied. In this study, the discount rate for cost of the components is taken into account. Reliability level of each component is regarded as a triangular fuzzy number as well, and a fuzzy multi-objective optimization problem is developed to handle this issue. Then, the expected value concept is used to convert developed model to a crisp model. Finally, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is applied to solve the crisp model.

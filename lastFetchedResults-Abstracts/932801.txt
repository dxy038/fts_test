Proteinâ€“carbohydrate interactions affect the functional properties in foods where proteins are the major ingredients, such as meat and fish processed products. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of pectin gum with different degree of methoxylation and calcium chloride on the mechanical properties of surimi gels. Surimi from silver carp was supplemented with pectin gum at 1% (w/w). Four high methoxyl pectins and two low methoxyl pectins were evaluated. Calcium chloride was added at 0.2%. Changes on shear stress, shear strain at failure, texture profile analysis and water holding capacity were evaluated. LM35, an amidated low methoxyl pectin, improved shear stress, hardness, and water holding capacity, while the four high methoxyl pectin and the no amidated low methoxyl pectin did not improved the mechanical properties of surimi gels as compared with the control.

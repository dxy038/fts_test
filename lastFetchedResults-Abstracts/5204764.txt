This paper is proposing a quality of experience (QoE) model for mobile multimedia (streaming) services. Both subjective and objective artifacts, relevant for the user´s perception about the quality and usability of the service, are considered. The MOS statistical tests were carried out according to the double-stimulus impairment scale (DSIS) method on relevant 3GPP format test material. The model´s prediction capacity is also evaluated in order to enable operators to fix performance targets in terms of human perception

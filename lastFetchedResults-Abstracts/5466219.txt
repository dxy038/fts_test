For an uncertain decision process, how to combine the subjective preference of decision maker with objective information is a very significant issue. This paper introduces the measure of decision-maker´s optimism to describe the situation of the interval number in uncertain multiple attribute decision-making. Based on the method of determining interval entropy weight, the optimization model which can reflect the measure of decision maker´s optimism and make full advantage of existing objective information is developed. Then a new method of decision in interval entropy weight is given on the basis of the subjective preference of decision-maker and objective information. Finally, the example of risk decision for the development of the aerospace project is presented to show the feasibility and effectiveness of this method.

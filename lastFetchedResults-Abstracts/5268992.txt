Emailing has been and it is still continue to be the most common way for many people to share information using texts and/or with attachments. More popular alternatives nowadays are using the Instant Messengers (IM) and online community networks which convey presence information and provide higher degree of interactions with richer multimedia experience. However, these existing systems involve human intervention onto updating the status information, e.g. the presence status message is manually entered and remains unchanged until the next manual update. A more sophisticated presence system would be those which can determine a userÂ´s status automatically, with the objective to enable more interactions including indirect contents sharing. In this paper, we present the prototype implementation of a presence-based multimedia session sharing system. This proposed system helps users to publish their session dynamically, and enable their buddies/contacts to join the same session as to consume the contents. We envisaged that the proposed system would help service providers to advertise and promote their contents at lower cost with a viral effect.

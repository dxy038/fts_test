Training simulators enhance learning by integrating the theoretical abstraction of textbooks with the tactile nature of the lab. The primary objective of training simulators is education. They motivate, help with visualization, and provide hands-on practice and experience. This paper explores the use of training simulators for process control education. Discussed are the methods used and experiences gained in developing Control Station, a training simulator used in the curriculum of hundreds of academic institutions worldwide.

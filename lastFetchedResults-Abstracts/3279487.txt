Planning is an important reasoning capability for the Semantic Web (SW), however, it is currently not fully integrated into existing SW standards. We present a novel query language to represent objective functions and constraints through combinations of conjunctive queries which are written in terms of roles and concepts of a Description Logic (DL). Furthermore, we consider a compiler that instantiates satisfiability modulo theories problems from such a query and which responds the final solution as DL role assertions. We outline our approach on a NP-hard production planning problem that requires computation of the optimal assignment of tasks to stations based on different numerical and logical restrictions.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the safety and tolerance of levonorgestrel contraceptive implants (Norplant, Wyeth-Ayerst, Philadelphia) when inserted immediately post partum, to document the effects on weight and blood pressure, and to determine the side effects.
STUDY DESIGN: After vaginal delivery, 250 women were randomized to receive Norplant within 48 hours of delivery (study group) or at the 4- to 6-week postpartum visit (control group). Baseline measurements were recorded and compared with those obtained at the 4- to 6-week follow-up visit. A diary was maintained by patients who recorded bleeding and side effects. Statistical analysis was performed with t test and Ï‡2 analysis.
RESULTS: There were no episodes of acute postpartum hemorrhage or clinically significant bleeding. Compared with the control group, the immediate group reported significantly more bleeding days (p< 0.01). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the hemoglobin values obtained at 4 to 6 weeks post partum. The immediate insertion group reported significantly more headaches (p< 0.01) and acne (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Norplant is well tolerated and should be available for interested patients immediately post partum.

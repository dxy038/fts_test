The article analyzes the empty container reposition (ECR) issue with uncertain conditions which commonly encountered in realistic situation, and establishes an opportunity restriction ECR model based on the random demand of the inland reposition system. Also it discusses the resolution of the ECR model in which the objective function contains random parameters, and consequently provides two-Phase Stochastic Simulation GA to calculate the reposition model. Meanwhile with the sample analysis and comparison with ECR under a certain condition, it is proved that the model is feasible and also in accordance with realistic situation, by which a new idea is offered to investigate the topic of random inland ECR.

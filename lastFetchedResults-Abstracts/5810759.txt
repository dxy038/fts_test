Land cover analysis plays an important role in many environmental applications nowadays. The objective of this study is to assess the capability of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) scene for land cover mapping over Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam (NAD) province, Indonesia. Standard supervised classification techniques were used in this study namely maximum likelihood, minimum distance-to-mean and parallelepiped (with Maximum Likelihood Tie Resolution). Geomatica 9.1 image processing software was used to analyse the data. The accuracy of each classification map was assessed using the reference data set consisted of a large number of samples collected for each category. The results from this multispectral classification analysis of this study area indicated that urban features could be clearly identified. In this study, Kappa statistic and overall accuracy were calculated and compared for the three supervised classification techniques. Geometric correction was performed to the digital image using the nearest neighborhood method with second order polynomial. This produced a geocoded image. This preliminary study has produced a promising result.

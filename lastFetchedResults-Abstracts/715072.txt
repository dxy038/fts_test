ABSTRACT: To response some problems in soil engineering it requires a detailed knowledge of the mechanical properties of soils that is probably among the most complex materials to be studied from this point of view. This paper examines the hydro-mechanical behavior of soil for mines according to different data. The present paper tries to present a reasonably comprehensive account of the relations governing the response of soils to applied forces. The main objective of this paper is to characterize the tailings deposit at mines in terms of its hydro geotechnical properties and present their vertical and horizontal distribution. In this study, relationship between each parameter has also been identified. According to the data collected from different mines, the investigation has been done from various levels. These evaluations includes:, particle density termination, Proctor compaction, permeability and grain size analysis. According to result, the horizontal hydraulic conductivity has been found to have a good correlation to fine fraction and void ratio.

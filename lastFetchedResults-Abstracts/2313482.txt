Background and objective: CIE color standard system has been extensively used to determine
various physic-chemical characteristics of porous media such as soil. Objective of this study is to
evaluate the relationship of C/N ratio and organic matter percentage with parameters of CIELAB color
standard system during composting production process.
Material and methods: In this study, changes on parameters of CIELAB color standard alongside
with organic matter percentages and values of C/N ratio were measured for 90 days during urban solid
wastes materialsâ€™ composting process in Arad-Kouh factory in Tehran.
Results: The results showed that there are significant relationships of L* with organic matter
(r=0.942, ?=0.01) and ratio of C/N (r=0.915, ?=0.01) from one hand and parameter of a*/b* with
organic matter (r=-0.876, ?=0.01) and ratio of C/N (r=-0.893, ?=0.01) from other hand.
Conclusion: Statistical interpretation of the obtained results approved that instead of common
analytical methods for quality evaluation of composted materials; parameters of L* and a*/b* are
easy, inexpensive and quick to estimate ratio of C/N and organic matter percentage of composted
urban solid wastes materials reliably

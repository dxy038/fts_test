Objective. To investigate lumbopelvic kinematics when moving into a slouch.

Design. A biomechanical model was developed. Load tests in vitro verified the model.

Background. The precise mechanism causing disc herniation and back sprain is still debated. Most biomechanical studies have focused on lifting in a stooped posture. Previous studies address instability situations due to Euler buckling of the spine under axial load. However, no studies address lumbosacral, iliolumbar and sacroiliac kinematics in slouching, i.e. flexing the spine in situations with negligible compressive spinal load.

Methods. Modeling started with the click-clack movement, i.e. the transition from lumbar lordosis to lumbar kyphosis by the combination of backward rotation of the pelvis and ventral flexion of the spine. The flexed spine was compared with a crowbar which uses the iliolumbar ligaments as fulcrum and pivot. To analyse the click-clack movement in sitting, unembalmed erect human trunks were moved from a forward position to a backward position, recording angular changes between L5, sacrum and ilium.

Results. When moving the trunk stepwise backward with support at shoulder level, L5 showed forward rotation with respect to the sacrum, but rotation of the sacrum with respect to the iliac bones was reversed (i.e. counternutation). L5 showed displacement in ventral direction with respect to the ilium. Measurements were in agreement with prediction from the crowbar model of the spine.

Conclusions. Backward rotation of the pelvis combined with flexion of the spine, i.e. slouching, results in backward rotation of the sacrum with respect to the ilium, dorsal widening of the intervertebral disc L5â€“S1 and strain on the iliolumbar ligaments when protection from back muscles against lumbar flexion is absent. Lumbar backrest support almost eliminates lumbosacral and sacroiliac movement.

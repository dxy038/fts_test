The authors present a new algorithm for fast block motion estimation in video coding applications. In this new algorithm, general characteristics of the block motion field are explored and related to the block motion vector statistics in the search window. As such, they present a way to design the optimal checking point pattern based on minimizing an objective function that is defined to be an average distance measure and such a pattern can be made adaptive to the motion statistics. Then, they suggest a regular checking point pattern which can be regarded as a sub-optimal solution. Simulation results show that motion estimation with the suggested pattern is both fast and robust

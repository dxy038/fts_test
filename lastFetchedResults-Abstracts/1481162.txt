The objective was to investigate the effect of ageing time (1 day vs. 8 days postmortem) and sire breed used in the crossbreed (Duroc sired vs. Landrace sired pigs) on blooming ability and colour stability of pork M. longissimus dorsi (LD). The colour was measured during blooming (0, 10, 30, 60, 90 min and 24 h after cutting) and during subsequent display (1, 2, 3 and 6 days) at 3 Â°C. The contents of deoxymyoglobin (Mb), oxymyoglobin (MbO2) and metmyoglobin (MetMb) were calculated. Ageing improved the blooming of LD from both crossbreeds with increased content of MbO2 and decreased content of Mb, resulting in increased lightness, redness and yellowness. Ageing had smaller effect on colour stability with slightly lower MetMb in aged meat. Crossbreed affected both blooming and colour stability. LD from Landrace-sired pigs bloomed more than LD from Duroc-sired pigs, but more MetMb was formed during subsequent storage, although at a low level in both crossbreeds. The present data show superior colour characteristics of fresh pork aged for 8 days.

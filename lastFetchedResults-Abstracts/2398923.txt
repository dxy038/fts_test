Objective
luate the mouth-motion step-stress fatigue behavior of two porcelain–zirconia all-ceramic crown systems.
s
erage dimensions of a mandibular first molar crown were imported into CAD software; a tooth preparation was modeled by reducing proximal walls by 1.5 mm and occlusal surface by 2.0 mm. The CAD-based tooth preparation was made by rapid prototyping and used as a master die to fabricate all-ceramic crowns with 1.0 mm porcelain veneered on 0.5 mm Y-TZP cores (LAVA veneer + LAVA frame, 3M/ESPE, and Vita veneer + CERCON frame, Dentsply). Crowns were cemented on aged (60 days in water) composite (Z100, 3M/ESPE) reproductions of the die. Three crowns from the LAVA group were subjected to single cycle load to failure for stress profile design; remainder subjected to step-stress mouth-motion fatigue (three step-stress profiles). All mechanical testing was performed by sliding a WC indenter of 6.25 mm diameter 0.7 mm lingually down the mesio-distal cusp. Master Weibull curves and reliability for missions of 50,000 cycles at 200 N load were calculated (Alta Pro 7, Reliasoft).
s
 load to failure showed fractures through the zirconia core. Reliability for a 200 N × 50K cycle mission was not significantly different between systems. In fatigue, failure occurred by formation of large chips within the veneer originating from the contact area without core exposure.
sions
nd CERCON ceramic systems present similar fatigue behavior; fatigue loading of both systems reproduces clinically observed failure modes.

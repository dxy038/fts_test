A series of large-ringed calix[6,7,8]arene analogues have been synthesised and their affect against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vivo established. In general, when p-phenylcalixarenes and tert-butylcalixarenes were not functionalised at the lower rim, low biological activities were observed. However on going from partially to fully lower rim pegylated calixarenes the anti-mycobacterial properties improved. The addition of cyanopropoxy groups at the lower rim gave rise to low activities, whereas the addition of acetate moieties interestingly had pro-TB effects. Two upper rim sulfonated calixarenes showed promising properties. In the course of this work, a high yielding procedure to synthesise p-phenylcalix[7]arene was also established.

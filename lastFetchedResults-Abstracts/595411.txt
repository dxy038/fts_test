Objective: To evaluate the outcome of anatomical subunit approximation in unilateral cleft lip of different severity. Material and Methods: Seventy four consecutive patients with cleft lip were seen in the outpatient department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar and Plastic Surgery unit at Said Anwar Medical Centre, Peshawar, from 1" June 2007 to 31" December 2008. The severity was assessed and all of them were operated using David Fisher's anatomical subunit approximation technique. Postoperatively the vertical height of the lip was compared on the cleft and non cleft side along with symmetry of Cupid's bow and philtral column, the alignment of white roll, quality of the cutaneous lip scar, vermilion fullness and vermilion notching. The nose was evaluated by noting the nasal tip symmetry; alar rim level; alar base height and width; and nostril sill size, both pre and post operatively. Results: Seventy two patients showed adequate vertical height and good nostril size, alar base height. Two patients showed 1.0 mm discrepancy of the vertical height as compared to the non cleft side. These belonged to the severe complete cleft lip category. Conclusion: This technique has shown good results in achieving vertical height and nostril size symmetry especially in incomplete and mild to moderate severity of complete cleft lip.

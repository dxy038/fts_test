Objective: The aim of the study is to investigate and compare multiple talents of the sighted and blind male students in Tehran’s guidance schools.
 Method: This study is a survey. The statistical population of this study includes all the sighted students and blind students of Tehran’s Guidance schools. Stratified sampling for the sighted and available sampling for the blind has been used in this study (60 blind and 60 sighted students) .Gardner multiple talents questionnaire has been applied. The obtained data was analyzed and compared using the independent t-test between two groups.
 Results: The results show that no statistically significant differences exist between the two groups regarding their talents (p > %5).
Conclusion and recommendations: The blind, though lacking visual ability, are able to compensate for the deficit through other senses. It is highly recommended that the blind’s capabilities be identified and taken into account in education.

Mobile network based on MIPv6 has been considered as an active approach to support the network mobility (NEMO). In this paper, we present a new local authentication scheme for mobile network fast hand off, which is base on the MIP/AAA Basic Model. In the scheme, the proposed authentication cost function is used to decide whether to perform the local authentication or home authentication. The AAAFÂ´s (AAA server in foreign network) ability of authenticating the mobile user is realized by the authentication information shift, the authentication ability authorization and establishing the new dynamic security association. The fast and secure handoff is performed by establishing a new bidirectional tunnel between the new access router (NAR) and the old access router (OAR). The dynamic security association between mobile router (MR) and AAAF can effectively enhance the security performance of mobile network realizing local authentication and handoff process. The simulation experiments results show that the proposed fast handoff scheme can improve the network performance greatly

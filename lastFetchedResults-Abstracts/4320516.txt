The objective of this paper is to develop physics-based methodologies for board-level reliability modeling. These methodologies include guidelines on how individual package models should be created. These guidelines allow for individual package models to be easily integrated for creating a board-level model. The methodologies also include optimization of mesh densities and material properties to address different modes of failure. These optimizations are controlled through parameterization of FEM models. Using the methodologies developed, computer tools have been created to decrease the time needed to perform a detailed numerical analysis. These tools allow the user to quickly create, run and interpret the board-level reliability model.

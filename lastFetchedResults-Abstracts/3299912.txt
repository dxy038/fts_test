This paper aims to develop an Open Verification Methodology (OVM) environment to support testing of memory protocol standards and verify their operation using coverage driven verification (CDV) and constrained random testing (CRT). The objective is to achieve most of the verification plan goals with less time and effort and to create reusable verification environment components. We demonstrate the robustness of this approach using LPDDR3 memory protocol as a case study.

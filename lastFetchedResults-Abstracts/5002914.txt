We study a motion coordination problem where the objective is to steer group agents to move as a rigid body. We treat it as a joint orientation and formation control problem. We propose desired velocity and design decentralized feedback laws for each agent such that the rigid formation is guaranteed. Our design only employs relative information with respect to neighboring agents, and thus, can be implemented in a decentralized fashion.

Raw material cost is one of the major contributors to the overall cost in rough mill operations. The challenge is to choose raw materials that can fulfil a given order in a reasonable time. However, the objective of minimizing raw material cost conflicts with the objective of minimizing the processing time. This study investigates the use of a local search mechanism to find the best jag sequence for a given order. Simulation is used to evaluate the performance of each jag sequence candidate with respect to the objective function. Since the proposed method is intended for real-time production, beam search is utilized. Numerical results for a sample order list show 22% cost reduction.

In this paper, bidirectional operation of the resonant voltage divider (RVD) is presented. As generally recognized, the RVD is used to transfer energy from the high voltage to the low voltage to feed the point of load (POL) or the voltage-regulated module (VRM). As for the bidirectional operation of the RVD, it can reversely transfer the energy to the DC bus, so as to effectively to suppress the voltage overshoot as the download transient response occurs. In the paper, the basic principles of bidirectional operation of the RVD are discussed, along with some experimental results to verify the feasibility of the control topology.

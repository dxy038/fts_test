Knowledge of the health of power transformers is important to prevent high costs caused by failures and to maintain the quality of the service. On-line monitoring and diagnosis seem to be the right way to reach this objective. In this paper a set of experiences related to the installation of vibration and temperature sensors inside a test transformer are described. Different types of sensors have been tested, and some of them discarded because of induced electromagnetic noise. Some of the main results and conclusions are shown in this paper. These experiences are included in a more general project called TRAFES, whose main objective is the continuous monitoring and diagnosis of large power transformers

The main objective of risk management is to reduce factors that will give negative influence to project. However, it is difficult to specify the risk of actualizing beforehand. In this paper, we first analyze real cases of software development projects that adopted risk management but failed, and identify the root causes. Next, we propose a permanent monitoring agency that predicts future risks generation using quantitative data captured by earned value management technique. The proposal of this paper was applied an actual software development organization and ensured effectiveness.

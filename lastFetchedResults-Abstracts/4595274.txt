This paper presents the development of a highspeed bidirectional current source module which allows the simulation of inductive loads. Due to its full four-quadrant operation capability, the module is able to simulate realistic current waveforms of AC motors. The applications for hardware- in-the-loop testing of e-motor controllers are discussed, as well as the technical realization.

Joint source/channel decoders that use the residual redundancy in the source are investigated for differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) picture transmission over a binary symmetric channel. Markov sequence decoders employing the Viterbi algorithm that use first-order source statistics are reviewed, and generalized for decoders that use second-order source statistics. To make optimal use of the source correlation in both horizontal and vertical directions, it is necessary to generalize the conventional Viterbi decoding algorithm for a one higher-dimensional trellis. The paths through the trellis become two-dimensional "sheets", thus, the technique is coined "sheet decoding". By objective [reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)] and subjective measure, it is found that the sheet decoders outperform the Markov sequence decoders that use a first-order Markov model, and outperform two other known decoders (modified maximum a posteriori probability and maximal SNR) that use a second-order Markov model. Moreover, it is found that the use of a simple rate-2/3 block code in conjunction with Markov model-aided decoding (MMAD) offers significant performance improvement for a 2-bit DPCM system. For the example Lenna image, it is observed that the rate-2/3 block code is superior to a rate-2/3 convolutional code for channel-error rates higher than 0.035. The block code is easily incorporated into any of the MMAD DPCM systems and results in a 2-bit MMAD DPCM system that significantly outperforms the noncoded 3-bit MMAD DPCM systems for channel-error rates higher than 0.04.

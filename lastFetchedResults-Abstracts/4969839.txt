The objective of this work is to demonstrate a newly developed power HFET operable with low and unity supply voltage with a ohmic metal self-alignment FET process and an asymmetric double-hetero epitaxial structure. We have introduced a new self-alignment process to reduce parasitic resistances for low voltage operated power FETs, where the distance between the drain and the source has been minimized and consequently a knee voltage V/sub k/ in the I-V characteristics has been reduced. This newly developed FET was named OMEGA (ohmic metal self-aligned gate) FET. The results obtained indicate the new FET is highly suited for unity power applications and consequently contribute to minimize the battery cell and the size of microwave mobile communication handsets.

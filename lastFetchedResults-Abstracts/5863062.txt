The modeling and rendering of real material properties highly rely on precise data acquisition. However, it is fairly hard to gather and model the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), which indicates the properties of real material properties. This report presents the gathering data by BRDF on the basis of linear-light source reflector. By optimizing the table of linear-light source reflector, it can more precisely recover the correlation parameter of Ward model in order to be beneficial for real material properties modeling, and construct the spatial varying BRDF (SVBRDF). The results of experiment demonstrate that BRDF data gathering method is simple, highly active, as well as keeps results accurate and precise.

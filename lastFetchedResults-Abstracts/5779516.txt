A fuzzy backstepping controller design for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is presented in this paper. In order to gain good dynamics and robustness, the parameters of nonlinear controller based on backstepping technique is adjusted by fuzzy logic control, and the fuzzy logic control is optimized by adaptive weighted particle swarm optimization (PSO). The adaptive weighted PSO is efficient for multi-objective and multi-dimensional problem. The proposed optimal controller is verified by simulation, and the results show that the controller has robust and good dynamic response.

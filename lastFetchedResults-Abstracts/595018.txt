Objective: To determine hypoxaemic episodes of those patients who underwent upper abdominal surgery (UAS).Material and Methods: Hundred postoperative adult patients were observed during their stay in the recovery room. They were continuously monitored for peripheral arterial oxygen saturation (Sp02) by pulse oxymeter (bpm-200). The alarms were preset at Sp02 <90%. These patients also received supplemental 02 therapy (40%) by fixed performance (Hudson's) mask. All these patients had Sp02 >97% before transfer to the recovery room. The number and frequency of un-noticed hypoxaemic events were noted.Results: This study revealed that the overall incidence of hypo-xaemia in these patients was 42%. On arrival in the recovery room 28% patients had Sp02 <90%. About 106 hypoxaemic episodes occurred during their stay in the recovery room. 10% had up to one episode and 32% had >1 episodes 4% of the patients were discharged with Sp02 <90%. Statistical analysis reveal that UAS with subjective factors such as obesity and smoking had more hypoxaemic incidences (P<0.05).Conclusion: Our Study concludes that hypoxaemic events are common following upper abdominal surgery even in patients otherwise considered healthy. Hence continuous pulse oximetry should be employed routinely during recovery, as it remains undetected without its use.

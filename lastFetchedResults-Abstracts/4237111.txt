Virtual view synthesis has been considered as a crucial technique in three-dimensional television (3DTV) display, where depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) is a key technology. In order to improve the virtual image quality, a method without preprocessing the depth image is proposed. During the synthesis, the hole-flag map is fully utilized. A Horizontal, Vertical and Diagonal Extrapolation (HVDE) using depth information algorithm is also proposed for filling the tiny cracks. After blending, main virtual view image is obtained. Then the image generated by filtering the depth image is regarded as assistant image to fill small holes in the main image. Experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain better performance in both subjective quality and objective evaluation.

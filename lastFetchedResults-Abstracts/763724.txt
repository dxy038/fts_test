Background and Objective:  Episiotomy is common perineal trauma in primiparous vaginal birth. Complications after episiotomy include inflammation, edema, dehiscence and perineal pain. Calendula has wound healing effects but there is little information about its application on episiotomy. Thus we aimed to study the effect of Calendula ointment on wound healing of episiotomy.
the purpose of this study was to elevate the effectiveness of Calendula ointment on wound healing of episiotomy among primiparous women admitted in Lolagar hospital of Tehran, 2010.
Material & Methods: the study was carried out using a randomized control trial method; the population included primiparous who had the inclusion criteria of the study. The setting of the study Conducted on 74 primiparous women referred to Lolagar hospital in Tehran which were selected with random allocation method. The case group consisted of 37 women that consumed Calendula ointment and control group consisted of 37 women that consumed hospitalâ€™s routine care (Povidon Iodine). The data collection instruments were questionnaire and REEDA Scale (redness, Edema, Ecchmosis, Discharge and Approximation). Questionnaire was demographic, postpartum and neonatal items of primiparous mothers. Perineal wound healing was evaluated using REEDA Scale within 4 hours and 5 days after intervention. Data were analyzed by spss 16 softe ware and presented with chi-square and t-test  .
Result: Our findings showed that The REEDA score was significantly lower in the experimental group (Calendula ointment) 5 days after episiotomy (p=0.001).
Conclusion: Considering the result of this study, it seems that Calendula ointment can be used in episiotomy wound care instead of Povidon Iodine solution because this compound has anti- inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that were more effective than Povidon Iodine in wound pain relief. This method suggested as a safe and effective method with minimal side effects.

Quality function deployment is a well-known customer-oriented design procedure for translating the voice of customers into a final production. This is a way that higher customer satisfaction is achieved while the other goals of company may also be met. This method, at the first stage, attempts to determine the best fulfillment levels of design requirements which are emanated by customer needs. In real-world applications, product design processes are performed in an uncertain and imprecise environment, more than one objective should be considered to identify the target levels of design requirements, and the values of design requirements are often discrete. Regarding these issues, a fuzzy mixed-integer linear goal programming model with a flexible goal hierarchy is proposed to achieve the optimized compromise solution from a given number of design requirement alternatives .To determine relative importance of customer needs, as an important input data, we apply the well-known fuzzy AHP method. Inspired by a numerical problem, the efficiency of our proposed approach is demonstrated by several experiments. Notably, the approach can easily and efficiently be matched with QFD problems.

By knowledge, Seyyed Hossein Nasr, has meant the ordinary experimental knowledge in West which has been conducted through western thought. In his view, it is better for experimental knowledge to be produced by the means of traditionalist approach. To criticize western thought in general and modernism in specific, it is helpful to acquire the foundations of perennial wisdom and replace it with modernity. New science has been the origins of various crises such as environmental ones. Traditional knowledge was based on metaphysical origins and has been deeply differed from philosophical presumptions of new science. New science in west not only made a decline in the religious and philosophical understanding of nature, but also caused traditional knowledge to be vanished. Metaphysics and perennial wisdom presumed an ideal position for new science. Divine knowledge is a light of divine eternal command which keeps its relation with spiritual world, not the soul itself. Perennial wisdom is a crucial basis for divine knowledge. Revelation considered being the main source of divine knowledge. Through this article, it is believed that the final objective of traditional knowledge has to be taken as the transcendental perspective of tradition, that is, "reflection of the eternal beloved appearance".

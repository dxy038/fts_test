In this information age, data has become one of the most important resources to organizations. The effective and efficient management of large quantities of data is a common problem found in many industries. An effective Management Information System (MIS) supplies accurate, relevant and timely information to the manager of an organization. Decision making is an important requirement in every organization, where in different types of information obtained from different functional area of management like finance, marketing, production, personal, planning and control etc. This paper discusses the acceptance and usage of Management Information System in 50 organizations consisting of 30 small scale and 20 medium to large scale organizations. The study is exclusively based on the primary data collected through a sample survey. Main emphasis was laid to understand MIS usage and problems which hinder its use. To achieve the objective of the study, the data was collected through a structured and pretested questionnaire. The analysis reveals that only 5 out of 30 small scale organizations and as many as 16 out of 20 medium to large scale organizations are found making use of MIS for supporting decision making process. To find out the possible reasons for inadequate MIS usage in organization, the respondents were requested to provide a feedback on various factors which could be possible causes for non-use of MIS in their respective organizations. In order to increase the usage of MIS in small scale organizations, there is a need to build up computer culture by properly disseminating information about potential computer applications and the benefits thereof. Such information dissemination is required to be made through various seminars/conferences/training programs etc. This in turn, increases the usage of MIS in organizations.

Background: Echinophora platyloba DC (Apiaceae) is one of the two endemic species of Echinophora genus in Iran. It has many folkloric uses and several biological activities but there is no information about its phytoconstituents.
Objective: In this work some of the secondary metabolites were isolated, purified and identified from n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from the aerial parts and root of this plant for the first time.
Methods: Resulting extracts were subjected to column chromatography using EtOAc/n-hexane as eluent. Further purifications were carried out using preparative TLC and recrystallization techniques. Characterization of compounds were established using spectroscopic data (1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, MS and FT-IR), and by comparing with the literature.
Results: Stigmasterol, Sitosterol, Stigmasterol-B-D-glycoside and Saccharose were purified from these extracts and their chemical structures were characterized.
Conclusion: Several phytosterols were isolated from various extracts of aerial parts and great amount of saccharose was purified from the sweet root of the plant.

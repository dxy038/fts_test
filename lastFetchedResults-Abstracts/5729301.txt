This paper describes an improved timing synchronization algorithm for the distributed MIMO-OFDM systems with the CAZAC sequence. This algorithm uses a training sequence which is based on the CAZAC sequence and makes the frame timing objective function with sharper property and thus has good effects on the time delay estimation scheme for different antenna. The simulation results for the distributed MIMO-OFDM systems shows that the improved algorithm has higher accuracy than one of the conventional algorithm.

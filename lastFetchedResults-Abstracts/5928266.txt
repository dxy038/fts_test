The objective of this study is to utilize studentsÂ´ data to forecast their future grades, and to identify the students who would benefit from educational counseling. To achieve these purposes, we propose a Bayesian network model as a forecasting method. A Bayesian network is a graphical model that presents the dependence relationship among some variables in a graph structure. By calculating the probability value using the model, it is possible to make forecasts. Moreover, in this study, to facilitate the construction of a Bayesian network model, data mining is introduced.

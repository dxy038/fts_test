This paper presents an objective evaluation method of color image coding quality integrating human eye visual characteristics. It uses the factors such as image pixels, region construction and edges which influences color images coding quality as evaluation parameters, and uses the concise algorithms to establish a syncretized evaluation model. The characteristics of this method are that it is simpler algorithm and capable to maintain duration of the traditional objective evaluation method and human cognitive habits for color image coding quality. The evaluation results are closer to human true feelings for color image coding quality. And they chime in with those of the subjective evaluation method.

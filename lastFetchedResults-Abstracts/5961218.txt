In this article the effect of motor starting on the voltages and currents in weak grids is analyzed. The objective is to find the size of the largest motor that can be started from the grid in an acceptable way, called the hosting capacity for motor starting. An overview of the different types of weak grids is given. Important are the measures that can be taken to improve the grid operation and increase the hosting capacity

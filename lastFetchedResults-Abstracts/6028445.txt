In both the HEVC draft and in H.264/AVC, in-loop filters are employed to improve the subjective and the objective quality of compressed video sequences. These filters use spatial information from a single frame only. Temporal Trajectory Filtering (TTF) constitutes an alternative approach which performs filtering in the temporal domain instead. In this work, a combination of the TTF with a quadtree partitioning algorithm for applying different filter parameters to different image regions is proposed and investigated. Experiments were conducted in the environment of the HEVC test model HM 3.0. Bit rate reductions of up to 9% for the low delay high efficiency setting of HEVC are reported.

A tutorial about OpenRTM-aist is planned as a full-day tutorial of SICE2011. This full-day tutorial will consist of a series of talks covering several topics concerning RT-Middleware, OpenRTM-aist and development of robot software using these technologies. RT-Middleware is a framework design for distributed intelligent systems. The core concept of RT-Middleware is the RT-Component, a software component that conforms to a known interface style for interaction with the framework. OMG issued the &#8220;Robot Technology Component Specifcation&#8221; in April 2008, and it is available in public on the OMG website. The objective of the tutorial is to provide you (robotics researchers and robotics professionals) with information about OpenRTM-aist robot software development, and to hold discussions about the Robot Technology (RT) Middleware software framework for robotics and the similar and preceding activities around the world. OpenRTM-aist is available at http://www.openrtm.org/. Since this tutorial includes hands on practice, the number of participants is limited to 30 people. The participants need to bring their own PC.

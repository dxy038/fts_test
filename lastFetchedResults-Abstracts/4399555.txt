A dynamic decision model for microgrids optimal control having as objective function the minimization of the operating costs is proposed and mathematically formalized in this paper. The model is part of an overall decision support system that optimizes microgrids planning and management at different temporal scales, namely long term planning, day ahead and intra-day. Here, the model formalization for two possible approaches (single bus-bar model, and DC load flow simplified representation) is presented. Such approaches are compared in terms of run-time and cost reduction with specific reference to the case study of the University of Genova Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM).

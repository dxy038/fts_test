In recent days, the numbers of services deployed on the cloud are growing at a dramatic pace. At the same time, a cloud can host very large number of services with the similar functionality, provided by different providers. Moreover, many applications may use the same service to perform a specific type of task. Therefore, it is essential to select appropriate cloud service as per the applications requirements from a large pool of available services. Thus, selection of services for cloud based software applications is a challenging task and demand high level of research attention. From the computational perspective, the service selection mechanism is required to be optimum enough in order to increase the overall performance of the cloud. In this paper, a novel service selection mechanism has been proposed which is based on the "quality of service" (QoS) parameters of the cloud services. Beside the multi-objective optimization, the proposed algorithm is capable to explore multiple cloud services based on user specified QoS values.

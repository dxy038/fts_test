The objective of the present study is to develop a robust high-throughput assembly process of light emitting diode arrays for wide area general lighting. Topics to be covered in this paper include the conceptual design, the flexible printed circuit substrate, flip chip assembly, yellow phosphor coating, and encapsulation. All these are integrated into one reel-to-reel assembly process. A prototype with the proposed process has been developed. A sample strip of packaged LED array has been produced as well to validate the developed assembly process.

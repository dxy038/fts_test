A trend towards the usage of distributed approaches in industrial automation can be observed during the last decade. The IEC 61499 standard was especially developed for such distributed applications in Industrial Process Measurement and Control Systems (IPMCS). Moreover, Industrial Ethernet becoming more and more popular and replacing step-by-step conventional field bus technology in IPMCS. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to describe the integration of Ethernet POWER-LINK (EPL) accessing decentralized I/Os via IEC 61499 control applications using open source software.

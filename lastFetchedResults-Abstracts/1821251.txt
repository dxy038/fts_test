Objective
dical anion of oxygen (O−) is extremely oxidative and shows high reactivity. In this study, the antibacterial activity of water super-oxidised water containing high concentration of O− (O−-water) was tested against cultured planktonic cells of cariogenic bacteria, periodontopathic bacteria and Candida albicans.
s
er was prepared using the AOE-750 (Oxy Japan Corporation, Japan) and its antibacterial activity against pure culture of Streptococcus sobrinus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum and C. albicans evaluated. Each oral microorganism (104 to 108 CFU/ml) was exposed to three concentrations of O−-water at room temperature or 37 °C for 15 s to 24 h.
s
re to O−-water resulted in a bactericidal effect against all cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria tested. No significant fungicidal effect was observed on C. albicans, however.
sion
sults demonstrate that O−-water exerts an antibacterial effect on cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria.

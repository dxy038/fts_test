The affinity of a series of 2′, 3′- and 5-modified thymidine analogues for Mycobacterium tuberculosis thymidine monophosphate kinase (TMPKmt) was evaluated. The affinities of several non-phosphorylated analogues are in the same order of magnitude as those of their phosphorylated congeners. In view of drug delivery problems associated with phosphorylated compounds, these ‘free’ nucleosides seem more promising leads in the search of TMPKmt inhibitors as novel anti-tuberculosis agents.

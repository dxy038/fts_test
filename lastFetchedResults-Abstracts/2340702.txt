Background and Objective: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder with debilitating symptoms. Available treatments for PD mainly include its symptomatic relief with no prevention of its progression. Due to the iron-chelating and antioxidant effect of phytic acid (PA), this study was conducted to assess its protective effect in 6-hydroxydopamine-induced model of PD in rat. 
Materials and Methods: Unilateral intrastriatal 6-OHDA-lesioned rats were daily pretreated with PA p.o. at a dose of 100 mg/kg for three days till 1 h pre-surgery. Apomorphine-induced rotations were counted at 1st week post-surgery.
Results: A significant contralateral rotational behavior was observed in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats (p < 0.0005) and PA pretreatment significantly reduced it (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: These findings imply that pre-lesion PA treatment could attenuate motor asymmetry in experimental model of PD and this may be of benefit in lessening motor derangements in afflicted patients.

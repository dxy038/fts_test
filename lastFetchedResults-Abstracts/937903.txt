The main purpose of this work was to prepare a Portuguese sampling strategy, according to the existing
Portuguese recommendations, for the soil sampling exercise at Dornach in the framework of the CEEM soil project
of the SMT Programme of the EU. Within this project, the results obtained from the Dornach study were compared
with the results obtained by other European participants and also with the reference sampling. The objective of this
comparison was to validate the method used and to evaluate possible factors of uncertainty that may arise from the
application of our national guideline as well as possible advantages. Another objective, also important, was to provide
information regarding the need for a harmonised procedure within the European Union related to soil sampling and
sample preparation of soils. The results obtained were consistent with the results obtained by other participants,
however, in the Portuguese recommendations there is a general lack of specific information that may complicate its
application to polluted scenarios. In fact, those guidelines are valuable to detect the average contamination of the
soil, but they are not useful to identify hot spots or the edge influence in a contaminated land. As a conclusion, the
results obtained by the CEEM soil project helped to evaluate the Portuguese sampling plan. This may provide a basis
for further standardisation of soil sampling for specific purposes, e.g. contaminated land, and to establish a technical
support for criteria used in the accreditation of laboratories for soil sampling

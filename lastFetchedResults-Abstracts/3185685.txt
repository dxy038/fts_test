This paper deals with the design of coupling/decoupling circuits for application of the powerline communications (PLC) technology to spacecraft power buses. Particularly, the objective of this work is to investigate possible advantages deriving from connecting the PLC modems in series with the powerline (PL) instead of resorting to a parallel connection scheme. To this end, the channel frequency response and signal-to-noise ratio of the resulting PLC link are obtained by SPICE simulation in the frequency interval 1-20 MHz. Suitable design rules, aimed at optimizing transmission performance and warranting satisfactory immunity of the PLC link to the conducted noise affecting the PL, are derived and discussed.

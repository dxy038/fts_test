This paper focuses on a new robust control design of static var compensator (SVC) for voltage control in an isolated wind-diesel hybrid power system. The proposed method is based on the H<sub>infin</sub> loop shaping technique and genetic algorithm (GA). The structure of the controller is a proportional integral (PI) controller with single input. In the design, system uncertainties are modeled by a normalized coprime factorization. The performance and robust stability conditions of the designed system satisfying the H<sub>infin</sub> loop shaping are formulated as the objective function in the optimization problem. The GA is applied to solve an optimization problem and to achieve control parameters. Simulation studies show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

Images encoded at low-bit rate may suffer from blocking artifacts, which can dramatically degrade the visual quality. In this paper, a novel approach to image deblocking is presented. Based on the analysis of image coding process and the property of natural images, an objective function and a set of constraint functions are proposed, and image deblocking is formulated as a convex optimization problem which can be easily solved using numerical methods. The feasibility of the convex optimization problem is utilized to detect the true object edges and avoid blurring. Experimental results demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

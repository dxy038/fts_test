ABSTRACT: Considering the fact that knowledge is the only reliable source of continual competition and the role it plays in institutions as pabulum, one has understood that the success behind every prominent organization is not necessarily due to the financial background, but is also to the extent of expertise and experiences of the staff members. To pursue shedding the light, organizations need to strategize their knowledge. To reach this objective, some background knowledge is required. Inevitably, the need to exploit knowledge based strategies would be next to impossible if not followed by drawing frameworks and owning an erudite team. The initial examinations are reminiscent of the fact that monitoring and regulatory firms lack a disciplined guideline to reach this dexterity. Consequently, this article tries to investigate the frameworks in monitoring and regulatory institutions to act within the scheduling strategies on leading basic knowledge.To reach this objective, a questionnaire has been provided in which the status of the company in five areas including culture, information technology, internal processes, human recourses and management is considered.  Data gathered using the proposition of central limit and comparative social median testing using a fixed rate is analyzed and ranked by Freedman testing.The findings of the research indicate that the monitoring and regulatory organizations have not yet yielded any suitable position in any of the five topics including culture, information technology, internal processes, human recourses and management and that the basic channels to utilize strategic knowledge based management is farfetched.

This paper is organized in two folds (1) the traditional transmission network expansion planning (TNEP) problem and (2) impact of CO<sub>2</sub> emission is considered respectively. In present scenario to meet the load demand, various types of generation sources are incorporate in the power system. This leads to CO<sub>2</sub> emission more or less. In order to take care of that dc power flow model based TNEP considering emission constraint is presented. Gbest Artificial Bee Colony (GABC) optimization algorithm is implemented to solve this problem. In order to prove the competitiveness of the GABC TNEP is solved for different generation patterns and results are compared with the other published results. The aim of the traditional TNEP to minimize transmission line investment cost only. But in the proposed model the objective is to minimize both investment cost and CO<sub>2</sub> emission simultaneously. The proposed method it is tested on IEEE 24-bus.

The objective of the present study was to compare three low risk sub-maximal protocols to predict cardiovascular fitness ratio (CVFR) and to develop new predictor equations in sedentary men aged between 30 and 60. For this purpose, 150 sedentary men (with mean±SD age=45.1±10.15 years, height=172.3±7.62 cm, body weight=70.86±11.27 Kg and BMI=23.86±3.15 Kg/m2 respectively) were selected voluntarily and participated in this research. To predict CVFR values, the subjects performed three low risk sub-maximal exercise tests: the 3-minute Balk and two standard CVfitness tests (A and B tests). The values obtained from 3 selected exercise tests were compared with the 5-minute Balk protocol (criterion protocol). Methodological differences of the protocols were analyzed by Bland-Altman (1986) method. Multiple linear regressions were used to develop new CVFR predictor equations. The results implied that in 95% of the agreement domain, there was no considerable agreement between 3 selected protocols and criterion protocol (P<0.05), whereas the 3-minute Balk test with high overestimation (mean±SD difference=7.6±4.16, P<0.05) and the two standard CVfitness tests (A and B tests) with high underestimation (mean±SD difference= -12.59±4.9 and -10.64±4.2 respectively) estimated subjects' relative CV fitness in comparison with the criterion protocol. This study demonstrated that although three selected protocol norms were commonly utilized to estimate CVFR in sedentary men, the new equations may present more ideal CVFR estimation in the subgroup. Obviously, it is necessary to conduct further studies.

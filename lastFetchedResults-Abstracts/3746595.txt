Wireless multicasting is becoming increasingly important for efficient distribution of streaming media and location-aware services to mobile and hand-held devices, network management, and software updates over cellular (UMTS-LTE) and indoor/outdoor wireless networks (e.g., 802.11/16). Multicast beamforming was recently proposed as a means of exploiting the broadcast nature of the wireless medium to boost spectral efficiency and meet Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Infeasibility is a key issue in this context, due to power or mutual interference limitations. We therefore consider the joint multicast beamforming and admission control problem for one or more co-channel multicast groups, with the objective of maximizing the number of subscribers served and minimizing the power required to serve them. The problem is NP-hard even for an isolated multicast group and no admission control; but drawing upon our earlier work for the multiuser SDMA downlink, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that yields good solutions at affordable worst-case complexity. For the special case of an isolated multicast, Lozano proposed a particularly simple adaptive algorithm for implementation in UMTS-LTE. We identify strengths and drawbacks of LozanoÂ´s algorithm, and propose two simple but worthwhile improvements. All algorithms are carefully tested on publicly available indoor/outdoor measured channel data.

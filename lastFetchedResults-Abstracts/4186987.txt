In this paper, we address the problem of 3D model transmission over error-prone channels using multiple description coding (MDC). The objective of MDC is to encode a source into multiple bitstreams, called descriptions, supporting multiple quality levels of decoding. Compared to layered coding techniques, each description can be decoded independently to approximate the model. In the proposed approach, the mesh geometry is compressed using multiresolution geometry compression. Then multiple descriptions are obtained by applying multiple description scalar quantization (MDSQ) to the obtained wavelet coefficients. Experimental results show that, the proposed approach achieves competitive compression performance compared with existing multiple description methods.

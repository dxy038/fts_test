Error concealment (EC) is an important post processing technique to deal with the packet loss during the transmission of compressed video stream. This paper aims to address the problem of recovering the missing block in the decoded video stream from the perspective of compressed sensing. The missing block is assumed to be sparsely represented by a dictionary of prototype signal atoms. The atoms are generated by the motion-compensated blocks with a range of motion displacements from the temporally previously reconstructed frame. To avoid inefficient exploration for the prior of sparsity due to the potential coherency among atoms, the regularized least square is incorporated into the compressed sensing reconstruction for the recovery of the missing block. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed EC method in terms of objective (PSNR) and subjective quality compared to the existing methods.

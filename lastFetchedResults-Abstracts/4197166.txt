A zero-voltage switch (ZVS), coupled-inductor, multiple-output dual SEPIC power converter is constructed with the objective of low output ripple and noise. The output voltage and current relations for the ZVS dual SEPIC with multiple outputs are derived, and a design procedure is given. A simple conceptual model is developed of the coupled inductors and power transformers on a common core, and the effect of using quasiresonant switching on the zero-ripple condition is examined. A 36 V to 5 and 15 V experimental prototype is constructed, and total ripple and noise voltages of less than 3 mV peak are observed on both outputs

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) systems can acquire both spectral and spatial information of ground surface simultaneously and have been used in a variety of applications such as object detection, material identification, land cover classification, etc. Through simulation of a HSI process, it is in favor of finding key contributors to optimize system performance and sensor design. Although it is difficult to be expressed accurately, a hyperspectral image simulator could be built on the premise of some simplifications. In this paper, a complex scenario that includes a woodland area with low shrubbery and a woodland area surrounded by high building walls is simulated. The simulated scene model is built, in which a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is introduced and reflectance functions for ground materials are represented using a combination of canopy BRDF and a subpixel fraction model. To improve our previous work, we introduce in the model the secondary illumination based on geometric analysis methods to simulate the effects of reflected solar radiance from other buildings, which improves atmospheric modeling on the basis of nonhomogeneous and non-Lambertian surface. Experiments and analysis show that reasonable results could be achieved.

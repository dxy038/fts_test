Objective
To determine how artificial nutrition support is used in hospitals inthe United Kingdom and to determine whether there have been any alterations in practice when compared to similar studies in 1988 (1) and 1991 (2).
Design
A 94-question survey about artificial nutrition support (ANS) was sent to all districtdietitians registered with the British Dietetic Association on 1 January 1994. Information was collected additionally from pharmacists, nutrition nurses and clinicians.
Results
66.6% of questionnaires distributed were returned with analysable information. Ofthe respondents, 37.3% had access to nutrition support teams, compared with 27% in 1988. The documentation of usage of nutrition support was poor, only 33% of respondents being able to accurately quantify administration of enteral nutrition (EN), and 53% parenteral nutrition (PN).
Conclusions
Despite increasing awareness about the role of artificial nutrition support, and the value of nutrition support teams there has only been a modest increase in the provision and monitoring of NSTs in the last 3 years. This has important implications when considering audit of such practices.

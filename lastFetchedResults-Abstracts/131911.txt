This complication is uncomfortable for patients and it is one of causes of delayed discharge in outpatients. Therefore, reducing this complication is useful for both patients and medical health centers.
Objective: In this study, we wanted to evaluate the effect of topical Clobetazol cream on sore throat after tracheal extubation.
Materials and Methods: In a double- blind reandomized clinical trial, 88 patients in ASA class I or II and age over 18 years were selected as condidates for elective surgery other than head and neck surgery.
They were randomly divided into two groups. Each group had 44 patients. In one group, Clobetazol cream was applied on tracheal tubes before intubation. In another group, Vitamin A cream was used for this purpose.
2,12 and 24 hours after extubation according to questionaires, the patients were asked about sore throat. Data were processed by SPSS sofware and then analyzed with X2 test. (p<0.05 was considered significant).
Results: Incidence of sore throat after tracheal extubation in clobetazol group was 24.5% and in Vitamin A group 63.6% (P<0.005)
Conclusion: According to results of this study, we concluded that applying Clobetazol cream on tracheal tube before tracheal intubation is highly effective in reducing sore throat after extubation .

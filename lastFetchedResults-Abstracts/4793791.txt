The rapid growth experienced by wireless mesh networks (WMN) has made them a very attractive choice for the transmission of multimedia information. This has led to the mobilization of research and development efforts to improve the communication of multimedia contents over WMN. One of the most important aspects of communications over WMN is the performance evaluation under a specific application, using different routing protocols. This paper presents an experiment design aimed at establishing a methodology for an objective performance evaluation of a WMN using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The goal of the experiment is to compare the performance of two routing protocols (AODV and OLSR) in the transmission of MPEG4 video, using the PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) as response variable.

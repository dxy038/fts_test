In order to generate the optimization of resource configuration of machinery group intelligent, machinery resource should be optimized dynamically. An Immune Algorithm is presented to solve the problem of dynamic resource configuration. Minimizing makespan is made as objective function, in which operation sequence, machinery resources and delivery time constraints are taken into consideration To demonstrate the efficiency of the Immune Algorithm, a numerical experiment is put forward. The results show that the algorithm could realize the optimization of resource configuration of machinery group. The result of dynamic resource configuration is used to achieve optimal construction process plan of each job Simultaneously.

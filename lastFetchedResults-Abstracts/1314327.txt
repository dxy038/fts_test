The main objective of this paper is determination of principal relationships influencing the distribution of moisture content in a soil profile under an emitter in point irrigation. Research was carried out by conducting field experiments. They determined geometry of wetted soil volume in a soil profile under point irrigation. Infiltration of water from a single emitter and the resulting spatial distribution is a typical feature of localized irrigation technology. The field experiments using different emitter discharges and various periods of irrigation on haplic Luvisol (ha LV) (ALFISOLS Udalfs) on loess were conducted in a soil profile 1 m deep.

Admissible duration of irrigation in relation to discharge rates has been calculated and illustrated in a graph. Incorrect irrigation practices can cause serious environmental damage. A method for determining the width and depth of the wetted soil volume under the point irrigation was developed. This method is rapid and simple, and it gives consistent results.

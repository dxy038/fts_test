The search for existing or past life in the Universe is one of the most important objectives of NASAÂ´s mission. In support of this objective, an ultrasonic/sonic mechanism is currently being developed at JPL to allow probing and sampling of rocks and to use the mechanism as a sensor platform for in-situ planetary analysis. The technology is based on the novel Ultrasonic/Sonic Driller/Corer (USDC), which requires low axial force, thereby overcoming one of the major limitations of planetary sampling using conventional drills in low gravity environments. The USDC was demonstrated to: 1) drill ice and various rocks including granite, diorite, basalt and limestone, 2) not require bit sharpening, 3) operate at low and high temperatures, and 4) operate at low average power using duty cycling.. The capabilities that are being investigated include probing the ground to select sampling sites, collecting various forms of samples, and hosting sensors for measuring various properties. A series of modifications of the USDC basic configuration were implemented including an ultrasonic abrasion tool (URAT), Ultrasonic Gopher for deep drilling, and the Lab-on-a-drill. These modifications will be described in this paper.

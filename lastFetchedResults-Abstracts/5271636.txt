In the reverse logistics network on remanufacturing, the quantity and quality of recycled products and requirement of the "new" remanufactured products are uncertain. The single product, multiple-period and closed-loop network location model is founded in this paper. It is constructed by recycling centers, disassembling centers, remanufacturing factory and distributing centers. Its objective is to minimize the total cost. Based on the theory of uncertain planning and simulation on logistics, facility location planning for reverse logistics network under uncertain environment on remanufacturing is proposed through the facility location model with an expected value programming model (EVM) with stochastic parameters. The model is evaluated by RaLC, a logistics simulation software. In the end, the effectiveness and adaptation is demonstrated by a case.

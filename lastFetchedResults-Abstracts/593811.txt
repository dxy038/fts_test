Abstract
This study was carried out in order to determine the relationship between biodiversity and richness of understory vegetation and chemiophysical soil factors and topography in Quercus iberica Stev. forest site of Asalem, Guilan. First, parcels No. 4, 7, 9 and 10 that had more abundance of Quercus iberica than other parcels in Lomer district No.8 were selected as objective parcels. Since the Quercus iberica population was limited, 30 sampling plots (50×50 m) were randomly taken. In order to record the herbaceous species, the Whitaker’s nested sampling plot method was applied, which resulted in 64 m2 of the minimum plot area. In addition, topographical factors were estimated in each plot. In order to survey herbaceous species, cover percentage for each herbaceous species were recorded in each plot that defined with Domin criterion. The result of Spearman correlation showed that Simpson and Shannon-Wiener indices had negative correlation with gravel, elevation, Bulk density and slope percentage and had positive correlation with organic matter and organic carbon, total nitrogen. Mehinick’s richness index showed negative correlation with gravel and Bulk density, but unlike Margalef index had not correlation with elevation

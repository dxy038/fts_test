With 90nm and below, the objective of high yields cannot be achieved without defect reduction. Since embedded memories have a higher defect density (twice that of logic), embedded memory test and repair solutions are becoming more critical than ever. This session of invited speakers will shed light on various aspects of the solution from design, manufacturing and yield perspective.

The main theme of this paper is to present the design and implementation of a digital-controlled bidirectional converter for scooter applications. The contribution of this paper is to explore the details of digital controller design and implementation. Moreover, as compared to previous research results which provide constant voltage mode only, for the presented digital-controlled converter the battery can be charged by either regenerative load or fuel cell in constant current mode to reduce the charging current ripple and thereby prolonging the battery life. Experimental results derived from a 500 W, 24V/45V system are presented to confirm the design and implementation. These results show the converter efficiency is greater than 90%.

The objective of this study was to investigate differences in the expression of estrogen receptor-α (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR) and the proliferative indexes (Ki-67), in the uterus and oviduct of sheep with estrus synchronized either by prostaglandin analogues (Group PA, n = 27) or by treatment with progestagens (Group P, n = 29) on days 4 and 7 (day 0 = estrus), when the embryos were collected. Immunohistochemical methods were used to quantify ERα, PR and Ki-67 in six superficial and deep compartments in the uterus and oviduct. The expression of ERα was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) lower in progestagen treated ewes than in prostaglandin analogues treated group in the luminal epithelium, superficial glands and superficial stroma in the uterus on day 4. The expression of PR was significantly lower in progesterone treated ewes than in the PA Group in the superficial gland (P &lt; 0.05) in both days studied. The lowest expression of PR was observed in the luminal caruncular epithelium and superficial glands in both treatments, obtaining the lowest levels on day 4 (P &lt; 0.05). There were significant differences between days 4 and 7 in the Ki-67 immunostaining in the luminal epithelium (P &lt; 0.01) and superficial glands (P &lt; 0.05). A higher cell proliferation was observed in the uterine epithelium (P &lt; 0.05) on day 4 in the animals treated with progestagens. Results indicate that sheep with synchronization of estrus with progestagens showed a reduction of ERα and PR protein expression in most of oviductal and uterine cells.

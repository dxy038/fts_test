The objective of this study was to determine correlation between structural anatomy and surface coil spin-echo MR imaging of the rat kidney and the effect of hydration state on MR signal intensities of the cortex and medulla. Twelve rats were studied in a pilot study with a 3-inch surface coil in a 1.5 T magnet under five different states of hydration. Serum and urine osmolality measurements were obtained immediately prior to each scan. Signal intensity measurements were made from both T1- and T2-weighted images of the cortex and medulla of both kidneys in each state of hydration. Gross and histological anatomy of the rat kidneys was correlated with the MR images. Four distinct layers were detected in vivo on MRI images of the rat kidney; these correlated with the histological layers. T1-weighted cortico-medullary differentiation was most pronounced at 48 h dehydration; T2 cortico-medullary differentiation was greatest at 72 h of dehydration. We concluded that different parts of the mammalian nephron can be identified by MR imaging and that cortico-medullary differentiation is affected by the hydration state of the animal.

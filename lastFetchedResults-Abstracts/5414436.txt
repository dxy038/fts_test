In this paper, a novel approach based on time reversal pre-distortion technique is proposed to compensate the dispersion of a log-periodic dipole array (LPDA) antenna. The main objective is to achieve high fidelity output pulse in the main direction of the antenna. The fidelity factor of the antenna is investigated in other radiation directions using the proposed method. This eliminates the drawbacks of the methods proposed for dispersion compensation in previous works.

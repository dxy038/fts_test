Major research challenges for acoustic research applied to oil industry have their origins associated to practical logic to fill the gap derived from the lack of measurements of geological bodies in spatial scales between seismic and sonar data. Sonar data have contributed much to understanding the seafloor and its geological surface. Furthermore, the seismic also has contributed greatly to the understanding of features correlated to the reflection coefficients between water and seabed. Despite all the advances in these two ends of the scale for acoustic research, integration and efficient and effective reconciliation of these data are still not widely quoted in such industry. This paper describes topics from a workflow to describe a treatment for seismic samples which increases their resolution and their association with geological features derived from sonar interferometry. Treatment is based on sonar data converted in two-way seismic time, surfaces adjustment and enhancement of seismic resolution. Different sets of seismic surveys on the Brazilian continental margin (south-southeast) were gathered, first used in a regional integrated into a common technical objective in this geographic area. ItÂ´s shown a practical example in the Campos Basin, applied in geomorphologies of modern continental slope and plateau, using 2D seismic profiles and a digital model of the seabed layer based on sonar data.

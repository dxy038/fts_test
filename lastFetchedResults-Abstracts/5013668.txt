Power systems interconnections have many advantages not only inside a country but also for expanding international electricity trades. It is shown that grid interconnection may provide low cost, low-risk hedging opportunities against domestic uncertainty about growth in supply of and/or demand for power. This paper presents an optimization framework for (a) profit maximization in the short-run trading and (b) cost minimization in the long-run trading in power exchanges of Iran with Turkey. It is an application of a regional electricity market model to obtain an optimal power trade level between Iran and Turkey for the present as well as a 30-years sight. For both optimization models, the required objective function, parameters, variables and constraints are described. Results derived from running short-run model show that the export capacity of Iran is about 1000 MW, yielding a total profit of 161 MS for one year. In addition, results derived from running long-run model show that, there will be greater potential for power export of Iran to Turkey which can grow 12% a year.

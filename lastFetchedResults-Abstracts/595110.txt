Objective: to find out the outcome after variceal bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis and COPD.Material and Methods: This retrospective study was conducted in Gastroenterology Unit, HMC Peshawar & Saidu Group of Teaching Hospitals Swat, from June 1998 to December 2002.The study group comprised cirrhotic & COPD patients treated with endoscopic sclerotherapy for esophageal bleeding.Results: Twenty-seven patients, 22 men and 5 women, with a mean (SD) age of 47.4 (4.2) years (range 34-53 years), were studied. Out of 27 patients, bleeding was successfully controlled in 25 patients (92.59%), whereas 02 (07.40%) died within 48 hours, despite the therapy. Seven (25.92%) patients developed complications, including encephalopathy (n=5) and renal failure (n=2).Conclusion: We conclude that occurrence of variceal bleeding is associated with high morbidity and the frequent development of life-threatening complications in patients with liver cirrhosis and COPD. Hepatic encephalopathy, rebleeding, renal failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma are the main risk factors.

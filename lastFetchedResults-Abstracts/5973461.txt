In this article we present an application of the multiobjective ant colony system (MACS) algorithm to the uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs) route planning problem based on Voronoi diagram. First, we construct the objective functions: minimize the route length and danger exposure. Then the MACS algorithm concept is introduced and modified to accommodate the route planning situation. The computational results show the efficiency of this method.

This paper deals with networking and knowledge base design to support researchers from various fields. The project is been implemented as a working prototype for investigating an integrated model for environmental research, which concentrates on the application spatial, and temporal analysis techniques to large-scale ecological data sets and includes satellite imagery and ground-based sensor data. The primary objective of the paper is to present the current state of the art for capturing and displaying live location information of a moving target in a wildlife environment as well as environmental parameters from static monitoring stations

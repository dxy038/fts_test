In this paper, we propose a method used to improve the performance of the digital watermarking based on the modification in the blue channel of the image pixels. The main objective is to reduce the error prediction caused by the high different values of neighbor pixels. In the proposed method, the edge detection technique takes place in order to find out the high different values of neighbor pixels, so that on the embedding side, the watermark bits are embedded into the blue component of the image pixels ignoring the edges and neighbor of 3 &#215; 3 pixel positions. The same process is also applied on the extraction side. The experimental results show the improved performance in terms of average NC, compared with the previous methods. The improved robustness of the proposed method against various common imaging processing based attacks e.g. additive Gaussian noise, JPEG compression standard and image cropping at various strengths is also presented and compared.

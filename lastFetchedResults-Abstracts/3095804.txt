Economic dispatch is of help to improve the economy and security of power systems operation. In view of power purchase costs reduction and active power losses reduction are two important economic targets of Hainan power grid company at the present stage, a mathematical model of optimal power purchase planning (OPPP) is therefore presented in this paper, whose objective is to minimize the total power purchase costs and the active power losses costs of the whole networks in a day, with satisfying all sorts of physical, technical and secure constraints. After decoupled to a static optimization model, the OPPP problem is solved by use of a modified Genetic algorithm, namely, Cataclysmic Genetic Algorithm. The application result shows that the proposed model is valid and the algorithm is effective. It has great significance for the economic dispatch of Hainan power grid company.

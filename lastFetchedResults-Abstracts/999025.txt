Sensitive detection of pesticides is of utmost importance in environment and food analysis. Immunological methods are widely used to detect pesticides in agricultural and environmental samples wherein antibodies are employed against the target molecules. Accurate diagnosis depends on the affinity and specificity of the antibody preparation used, and high affinity antibodies are essential for the detection of very small amounts of pesticides. Enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) coupled with flow injection analysis (FIA) technique provides a very high sensitivity with high throughput of analyses. Automation of this analysis scheme ensures precise detection with high accuracy. The present development aims at providing a user-friendly system for achieving this objective. It employs a 8952 microcontroller for precise flow of reagents, samples, substrate and conjugates used for analysis to be passed through an immobilized antibody column at predetermined time. With the sequence and flow control of buffers used, it also provides the option for reuse of the immobilized antibody column. The system is flexible to accommodate multiple sequences up to a maximum of 99 steps. It is customizable for different flow ELISA applications. It can control up to eight solenoid valves (dc 24 V) and two peristaltic pumps and has one 12 bit analog channel for data acquisition. With the serial interface port, the system provides convenient means for data acquisition into the computer. The system has been successfully tested for immuno analysis of organophosphorous pesticide methyl parathion.

One of the many design and control issues of Automated Guided Vehicles System (AGVS) is the AGV fleet size. This paper presents a new solution method to determining the number of vehicles in the AGVS based on Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS). The approach relies on two procedures-estimate and simulation. With estimate procedure, the mathematic method will be used to estimate the AGV fleet size. In the next procedure, the estimate value will be used in the simulation model of AGVS for further study. The reliable number of vehicles can be reached after two procedures. The objective of this paper is to increase the efficiency and accuracy of the process in determining the AGV fleet size.

In this research, a simulation-optimization model is developed for minimizing flood damage downstream of multi-reservoir systems by using operation of spillway gates in absence of any flood forecast. The operation policy is based on a multi-stage method (MSM) used to control floods of various magnitudes in reservoirs with gated spillways. It is assumed that the system has no flood forecast and thus shapes and sizes of the inflow hydrographs are not previously known. In this method, the rate of flow released in each stage level is decided according to the current reservoir water level and determined in such a way that flood damage risk for downstream areas is minimized while the damâ€™s safety is maintained. For this purpose, an optimization algorithm is introduced in which the expected annual flood damage downstream of the river system is the objective function and the spillway discharges in stage levels of spillways gates are the decision variables. A continuous genetic algorithm is utilized to solve this problem. As a case study, the Dez river system including multi-reservoir of Dez and Bakhtiyari is analyzed. Finally the current research result is compared with another research. Results obtained from the proposed model indicate dramatic decrease in the expected annual flood damage. Comparison of the results with other studies shows that the proposed model has a better ability in flood control and minimizing the damage costs.

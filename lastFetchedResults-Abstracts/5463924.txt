A novel image reconstruction algorithm for Electrical Capacitance Tomography(ECT) is presented. According to the characteristic of the inverse problems of ECT the minimum norm solution is improved on the basis of analyzing the algorithm, and the stabilization of the numerical solution is proved via singular value decomposition principle. At the base of that, a new objective function is established, during of solving the function regularization technique is employed to ensure the stabilization of numerical solution. Numerical experiments indicate that the algorithm is effective, as for the considered reconstruction objects in the paper, the quality of the reconstructed image using the improved algorithm is better than the projected Land Weber iteration (PLI) algorithm.

The objective of this study is to investigate the biocompatibility of poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx) with bone marrow stromal cells in vitro. The adsorption of fibronectin on the material was studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. After bone marrow stromal cells were seeded and cultured on PHBHHx, their proliferation was investigated by MTT. Differentiation of the cells was assessed by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity and by histochemical assay. The wettability and thermal property of PHBHHx films were also studied by contact angle goniometer, thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry, respectively. The results show that bone marrow stromal cells can attach, proliferate and differentiate into osteoblasts on PHBHHx films. These results suggest that PHBHHx has good affinity with bone marrow stromal cells and may have potential applications in bone tissue engineering.

As the percentage of seniors continues to rise in many populations around the world, the already challenging burden of valvular heart disease will become even greater. Unfortunately, a significant proportion of patients with moderate-to-severe valve disease are refused or denied valve surgery based on age and/or accompanying comorbidities. Furthermore, because of advances in pediatric cardiology, the number of adult patients with congenital heart disease is on the rise and over time, these patients will likely require repeat high-risk surgical procedures. The aim of transcatheter valve therapies is to provide a minimally invasive treatment that is at least as effective as conventional valve surgery and is associated with less morbidity and mortality. The objective of this review was to provide an update on the clinical status, applicability, and limitations of transcatheter mitral and pulmonary valve therapies.

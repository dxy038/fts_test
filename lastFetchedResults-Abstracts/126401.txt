Introduction: Several studies have shown the effects of
muscular fatigue on proprioception and neuromuscular
control. However all available researches have studied just the
effect of local fatigue in ankle joint muscles on postural control, and no study have found about the effect of fatigue in proximal muscles of the lower extremity on postural control.
Objective: To compare changes in postural control parameters after
isokinetic fatigue of proximal and distal muscles of lower extremity. Materials and Methods: Subjects were Twenty healthy men (age: 226±2.4 years,height:173.7± 3.6 cm, weight: 63.3-7.9kg).
There were 4 test sessions, with a randomized order according to
site and plane of fatigue. During each session one of these muscle groups
were fatigued using a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer: ankle plantar / dorsi
flexors, ankle evertor / inventors, hip flexor / extensors and hip
abductor/adductors. The biodex stability system was used to perform dynamic
balance test before and after muscle fatigue in each session. Overall, anterior / posterior, and medial/lateral stability indices were recorded. The higher the stability indices, the lower the balancing skill.
Results: Analysis of pre-and post fatigue balance results of all sessions, demonstrated significant increase (P<0.05) in all stability indices. Repeated measures ANOVA performed on the rate of changes in stability indices during each session revealed that hip muscle fatigue caused much more increase in stability indices than ankle muscle fatigue (P<0.05).
Conclusion: Isokinetic fatigue of both ankle and hip muscles significantly decreases postural control ability in healthy young men. In addition, our findings suggest that the' hip joint musculature plays a more prominent role in postural control.

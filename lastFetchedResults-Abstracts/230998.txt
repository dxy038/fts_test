An optimization system to get control rod patterns (CRP) has been generated. This system is based on the tabu search technique (TS) and the control cell core heuristic rules. The system uses the 3-D simulator code CM-PRESTO and it has as objective function to get a specific axial power profile while satisfying the operational and safety thermal limits. The CRP design system is tested on a fixed fuel loading pattern (LP) to yield a feasible CRP that removes the thermal margin and satisfies the power constraints. Its performance in facilitating a power operation for two different axial power profiles is also demonstrated. Our CRP system is combined with a previous LP optimization system also based on the TS to solve the combined LP-CRP optimization problem. Effectiveness of the combined system is shown, by analyzing an actual BWR operating cycle. The results presented clearly indicate the successful implementation of the combined LP-CRP system and it demonstrates its optimization features.

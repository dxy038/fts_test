In future communication system, the demand for high capacity is a challenging problem for wireless services, especially for delivery of the ´last mile´. A potential solution is offered by the high altitude platforms (HAPs), which can utilize the best character and tradeoff of both satellite and terrestrial networks. Since the performance of the HAPs depends on the structure of network, how to deploy the nodes of airships for HAPs is increasingly important. In this paper, an optimal model of deployment of airships for HAPs is constructed and solved based on genetic algorithm. First, a heterogeneous system including terrestrial layer, HAP layer and GEO layer is given. Then, an optimal model with objective function of maximum entropy and minimum delay is established to optimize the deployment of airships for HAPs. Finally, a modified genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to optimize the objective function and get the optimal solution to the model. Simulation results show that the established objective function and the solution based on GA can reach the goal of on-demand deployment of airship for HAPs.

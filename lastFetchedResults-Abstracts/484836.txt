Background and Objective: According to previous studies shift work could desynchronize the natural
circadian rhythm of the body. Although some of the internal physiologic processes become active for
adaptation of the body with this desynchronization. One of these physiologic processes is endocrine system
and melatonin release. This hormone is one of the most important variants which represent the circadian
rhythm in human. Since the pattern of secretion of this hormone in first ours of morning and during the day
in Iranian workers in particular in shift workers is unknown, therefore we aimed to detennine the 24 hours
profile of melatonin in shift work and permanent day shift nurses.
Materials and Methods: This experimental study was carried out on forty four female nurses of the Shiraz
university hospital, during 2006-2008. Thirty four people in study group had a cyclic shift work and 10
persons in control group had permanent day shift work. The serum samples with 3 hours intervals during 24
hours were taken from each person. The plasma concentration of melatonin was measured by ELISA. Our
study was carried out under realistic conditions. The data were analyzed using one -way ANOVA.
Results: The age range was between 22 to 50 years with a mean work history of 5.5 years. The highest and
the lowest melatonin levels was found in shift work nurses at 04:00 pm (14.91 pg/mL) , and 04:00 am
(131.49 pg/mL). These values for permanent day work nurses in the same times was 1.02 pg/mL and 177.40
pg/mL respectively. There was a significant difference between circadian melatonin profile at different time
points (p= 0.000).
Conclusion: The results of this study revealed that night work induces a consistent change in melatonin
circadian profile with a progressive reduction at early morning (04:00 am) and awaking time (07 :00 am).
These changes will also disturb sleep cycle and level of consciousness during the night and activities during
the day.

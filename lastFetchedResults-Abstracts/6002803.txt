The influence of pilot error and aircraft failure on the safety of civil aircraft is investigated in this paper. Based on the human-machine system modeling technique, the modules in the pilot-aircraft system failure mode are built using objective-oriented technique, and the software system of civil aircraft safety evaluation is developed. A practical example of flight accident shows that the simulation result is consonant with the accident investigation result, and it is illustrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the software in evaluating the flight safety.

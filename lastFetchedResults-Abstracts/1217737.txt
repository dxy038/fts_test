Background and Objective: Family plays an undeniable role in the behavior and lifestyle of patients. Family-centered empowerment is a model that is currently used in order to improve life quality and change the lifestyle of patients. Since lifestyle is of great importance to hypertension, this study aimed to determine the effect of family-centered empowerment model on the lifestyle of patients with hypertension.
Materials and Method: This semi-experimental study was done on 67 patients who visited Qaen therapeutic sanitary centers in 2013. Having selected persons who met entry criteria to the study, the participants were randomly divided into a control group (n = 35) and an experimental group (n = 32). During 2.5 months and within 6 sessions, the experimental group went through a family-centered empowerment model with the four dimensions of perceived threat, self-efficacy, educational partnership, and evaluation; the control group received the usual care. The data were collected by a researcher-made questionnaire and analyzed using t test, independent t, Wilcoxon and Mann-Witney tests.  
Results: Mean lifestyle score was 106.71 before and 135.04 after the intervention in the experiment group. Paired t-test showed a statistical significant difference between the lifestyle overall score and lifestyle dimensions before and after the intervention (P  <  0.05). Furthermore, independent t-test showed a significant difference between the overall lifestyle score of the experiment and control groups after the intervention (P  <  0.001).
Conclusion: In general, performing family-centered empowerment model is effective on lifestyle change in patients with hypertension.

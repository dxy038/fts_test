The objective of this study is to construct an easy operational model to evaluate the performance of the reverse logistics management. To fulfill this mission, the main contributions were made as following: a) Defining the indicators of each factors related with performance of the RL management. CSFs (critical success factors) method was employed in this phase. b) Arranging the indicators into an indicator-tree by AHP (analytic hierarchy process) methods. c) Using the fuzzy evaluation method build up a fuzzy evaluation model to evaluate the performance of the RL management in a company. The model presented in this research showed an easy way to evaluate the performance of RL management in a company. This should be a better try in this field.

Objective
Adolescents tend to be at risk for unwanted pregnancies, so detecting their level of knowledge on emergency contraception and providing them information is important to prevent such pregnancies. Hence, in two faculties at Gazi University, this study aimed to detect freshman students' level and need of knowledge on emergency contraception and to evaluate their attitude towards emergency contraception.
Materials and Methods
The study was performed with freshman students of the Occupational Education Faculty and the Technical Education Faculty. A questionnaire including questions about demographic properties, obstetrical history, status of contraceptive use, level of knowledge and opinions on emergency contraception was administered to the students. Data was analyzed statistically with the computer program EPI Info 6.0.
Results
A total number of 385 adolescents were included in the studys; 157 of whom were males (40.8%) and 228 of whom were females (59.2%). To the question “is there any way to prevent a possible pregnancy after an unprotected sexual intercourse?”, 166 students replied “yes” (50.5%), 39 “no” (11.9%) and 124 “I do not know” (37.7%). Of 166 students replying “yes,” 114 (68.7%) listed a possible contraceptive method. The mostly cited method was “morning after pills” (n = 62; 54.4%), followed by curettage (n = 15; 13.2%). Among all students, 158 (49.8%) informed us that they were aware of the presence of “morning after pills” whereas 159 (50.2%) claimed they were not. Eighty-six male students (70.5%) and 115 female students (72%) emphasized that they would use emergency contraception upon necessity.
Conclusion
Half of the participants were familiar with various options to prevent pregnancy after an unprotected sexual intercourse episode, but they lacked specific knowledge about possible methods and ways to use them. Thus, it is essential that information about emergency contraception be included in adolescents' educational programs and that adolescents be provided with easily accessible medical services

The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the available literature on EMF transmitted by submarine cables and the effects, if any, on marine organisms to assess the possible implications for environmental permitting of submarine power cables, such as those required for offshore wind, wave, tidal and Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) projects. The potential for EMF effects on marine organisms frequently has been a controversial aspect of the environmental assessments for marine renewable energy projects. The intent of this paper is to summarize all of the available data on EMF effects on marine organisms and to provide a resource for future environmental assessments.

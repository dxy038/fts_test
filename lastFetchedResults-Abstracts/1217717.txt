Background and Objective: Hemodialysis is the most common renal replacement therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease. Although this method increases survival rate and life expectancy, but this patients face with many problems such as sleep disorder and restless legs syndrome. The present study was carried out to investigate the relationship betweenrestless legs syndrome and sleep quality among hemodialysis patients.
Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, 74 hemodialysis patients with sleep disorders (cases) were selected by convenience sampling method and matched with 74 hemodialysis patients without sleep disorders (control) in sex and age (Â± 5). Then, restless legs syndrome and its severity were compared in the both groups. The data collection instruments included demographic information questionnaire, four criteria for restless leg syndrome based on the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Data were analyzed by SPSS 16 independent t and chi-square tests.
Results: Totally, 37.8% of hemodialysis patients showed signs of restless legs syndrome. 54.1% of cases and 21.6% of control have restless legs syndrome. The restless legs syndrome incidence in case group was 4.26 fold higher in patients with than those have no sleep disorders (CI95% = 2.08-8.74, OR = 4.26).
Conclusion: Given to the relationship betweenrestless legs syndrome and sleep disturbance, restless legs syndrome screening in hemodialysis patients seems necessary.

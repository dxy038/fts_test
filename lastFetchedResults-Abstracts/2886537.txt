A new demosaicing approach has been introduced recently, which is based on conducting interpolation on the generated residual fields rather than on the color-component difference fields as commonly practiced in most demosaicing methods. In view of its attractive performance delivered by such residual interpolation (RI) strategy, a new RI-based demosaicing method is proposed in this paper that has shown much improved performance. The key success of our approach lies in that the RI process is iteratively deployed to all the three channels for generating a more accurately reconstructed G channel, from which the R channel and the B channel can be better reconstructed as well. Extensive simulations conducted on two commonly-used test datasets have clearly demonstrated that our algorithm is superior to the existing state-of-the-art demosaicing methods, both on objective performance evaluation and on subjective perceptual quality.

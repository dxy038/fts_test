This paper presents a simple and efficient approach for line parameter correction in State Estimation (SE). It is based on the sensitivity of the objective function with respect to line parameters, and the boundary value approach. The imprecise parameters are assumed to be known in a range. These concepts obviate the need for a rigorous optimization, for best parameter estimation. The method can be used for normal parameter errors (known in a small range), as well as bad parameters due to incorrect breaker status. Results for the IEEE 30 bus system have been obtained to ascertain the potential of the proposed method.

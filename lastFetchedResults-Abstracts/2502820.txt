Introduction & Objective: Cryptosporidiosis caused by Cryptosporidium, which is a protozoan parasite, has a worldwide distribution. The infection is through fecal-oral route, direct or indi-rect contact, food or water. The treatment of cryptosporidiosis is difficult and the anti-parasitic agents are not effective. The purpose of this study was encapsulation of nitazoxanide in solid lipid nano-particles (SLN) and investigation of its anti-Cryptosporidium effect and its comparison with free drug in the neonatal rat.     
Materials & Methods: Nitazoxanide was encapsulated by HPH method with 2 mg/Kg concentra-tion in SLN nanoparticles. The oocysts were collected from calves and purified by sucrose floatation. A total of 72 Wistar neonatal rats were categorized in 6 groups of 12 rats including four infected groups treated by free drug, encapsulated nano drug, colloidal carriers without drug (SLN) and olive oil; an infected control group and a healthy control group that received PBS. 5 Ã— 105 of oocyts inoculated orally into the sample groups. Finally, intestine of each rat was homogenized in PBS by rotor and the homogenized material was passed through a sieve. Then, floated oocysts in sucrose solution were counted by hemocytometer.
Results: Treatment by nitazoxanide significantly decreased the number of parasites in the treatment groups. This decrease at day 6 was more than day 3. Nano nitazoxanide had more effects on parasites than free drug. This difference at day 3 of treatment was not significant (p= 0.182) but at day 6 was statistically significant (P <  0.001).
Conclusion: Using nano-nitazoxanide could be a more effective way in the treatment of Cryp-tosporidium infections.

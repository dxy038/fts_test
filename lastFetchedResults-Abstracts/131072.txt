Background and Objectives: Encephalocele is one of the brain congenital abnormalities commonly associated with various birth defects and syndromes. Prenatal diagnosis of encephalocele and coincidental abnormalities, using ultrasonography (US) is valuable and important. This abnormality is diagnosed in the second trimester of pregnancy. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and etiology of encephalocele and coincidental abnormalities by prenatal US.
Materials and Methods: During a period often years 66,129 pregnant women, in their second trimester, were routinely examined using US in Fajr clinic of Tabriz. Presence or absence of any congenital abnormalities or other complications were recorded and followed up.
Results: In this study 28 cases of encephalocele were detected on US. The prevalence ofencephalocele was 4.2 per 10,000, the result being higher than expected. Of these 28 cases,10 (35.71Â°/o) fetuses had isolated malformation and 17 (64.28%) had coincidental abnormalities. In view of parents being wedded within the family relatives, 47.82% parents of these fetuses with encephalocele were found relatives and other 52.12% as non-relatives. The prevalence of encephalocele was significantly affected by relative marriages (p<0.05).
Conclusions: Prenatal ultrasonography is a proper method for early diagnosis of brain abnormalities. Relative marriages have a great role in prevalence of such abnormalities.

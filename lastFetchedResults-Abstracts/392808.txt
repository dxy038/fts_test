Objective
The present study has the aim to investigate the prevalence and the determinants of hearing loss among electro production workers.
Methods
Ninety-three electro production workers and 51 office workers underwent audiometric test. Information regarding, socio-demographics, present and past medical history of hearing problems, use of ototoxic drugs, hobbies, and smoking habit was obtained using a self administered questionnaire.
Results
The levels of noise at workplace have also been measured. Electro production workers were exposed to high levels of noise. Statistical analysis has shown that 44% of electro production workers had sensorineural hearing loss located mainly at 4000 Hz. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that occupational exposure to noise appears to be the strongest predictor (odds ratio, OR: 7.51) of NIHL followed by aging (OR: 5.34), and last by smoking (OR: 2.47).
Conclusion
Our findings indicate that electro production workers are occupationally exposed to high levels of noise, and present high rates of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). The observed hearing loss was located mainly at 4000 Hz. These findings underline the need for interventions to reduce the risk for the development of NIHL among electro production workers.

This paper describes a proposed dual rotor single stator brushless PMSM motor/generator system for the parallel HEV or the series HEV, capable to deliver independently torque at the two rotors, fed from a single PWM converter with dual frequency output by adequate vector control. The mathematical model of machine is an analytical model based on the equivalent magnetic circuit considering magnetic saturation. The objective function is a global cost function that could be balanced, between initial active material cost or their total weight and machine efficiency, by choosing adequate weighting factors. Design with MATLAB, quasi 3D FEM analysis and the optimal design via Hooke Jeeves method of this drive system is the core of the paper.

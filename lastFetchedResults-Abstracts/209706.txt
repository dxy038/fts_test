Introduction: The hydrophobic interaction is a major driving force behind many effects and phenomena in
biological systems many hydrophobicity scales have already been proposed and have been used to predict the
topography of proteins.
Objective: In the present work based on some theoretical considerations a new hydrophobic scale for the amino
acids is proposed.
Materials and Methods: From the empirically justified assumptions that hydrophobicity of the amino acid
residues as part of a polypeptide chain is dependent on the surface area and the electro negativity content of the
residues, an equation which relates the hydrophobicity to the surface area; and the number, and electro negativity
of oxygen and nitrogen of the residue is proposed. from this equation a new hyrophobicity scale for the amino
acids is obtained. Using this scale and a sliding window averaging method hrdrophobicity plots for the human
melatonin Mella receptor and prion protein (the eause of mad cow disease) are drawn; and the intrarnembrane
structure of melatonin mel., receptor and hydrophobic core ofthe second half ofthe prion protein are determined
and compared with those from literatures.
Results: the proposed hydrophobicity scale in this work is in good agreement with that of Engelmann and
coworkers. The intramembrane structure of melatonin Mella receptor and the structure of the hydrophobic core
of the prion protein predicted in this article are in good agreement with those proposed in the literatures.
Conelusion: the proposed hydrophobicity scale in this work is suitable for predicting the topography of the tran
membrane and globular proteins.

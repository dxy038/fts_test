The immune algorithm (IA) is proposed to derive the rephasing strategy arrangement of laterals and distribution transformers to enhance three-phase balancing of distribution systems. The multi-objective function is formulated by considering the unbalance of phasing currents, the customer service interruption cost (CIC) and labour cost to perform the optimal rephasing strategy. For each feasible rephasing strategy, the number of customers affected with total interruption load demand and outage duration time are used to calculate the impact of system reliability because of rephasing engineering works. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, a practical distribution feeder in Taipower with 271 customers is selected for computer simulation. By minimising the objective function subjected to the operation constraints, the rephasing strategy has been derived by selecting the laterals and distribution transformers for phasing adjustment. It is found that the neutral current of test feeder has been reduced to be less than the neutral overcurrent limit by executing the rephasing of laterals and distribution transformers.

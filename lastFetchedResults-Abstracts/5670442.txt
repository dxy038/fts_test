The CDIO engineering education model is the latest achievements of the international engineering education reform in recent years, and is gradually receiving attention from our country. It advocates conceiving design implementation operation, and will promote the development of educational technology and solve some problems such as Pendulum phenomenon, indistinct training objective, less prominent characteristic, low employment rate. This paper combine with the characteristics of independent college students, introduce CDIO engineering education model into the computer major talent training, explore the computer major training model and curriculum based on the CDIO system, the results provide reference ideas for CDIO education model applied to computer major, cultivate and enhance the studentsÂ´ engineering ability.

For dealing with the multi-objective optimization problems of parametric design for aircraft, a novel hybrid parallel multi-objective tabu search (HPMOTS) algorithm is used. First, a new multi-objective tabu search (MOTS) algorithm is proposed. Comparing with the traditional MOTS algorithm, this proposed algorithm adds some new methods such as the combination of MOTS algorithm and “Pareto solution”, the strategy of “searching from many directions” and the reservation of good solutions. Second, this article also proposes the improved parallel multi-objective tabu search (PMOTS) algorithm. Finally, a new hybrid algorithm—HPMOTS algorithm which combines the PMOTS algorithm with the non-dominated sorting-based multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA) is presented. The computing results of these algorithms are compared with each other and it is shown that the optimal result can be obtained by the HPMOTS algorithm and the computing result of the PMOTS algorithm is better than that of MOTS algorithm.

Objective
terior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays an important role in emotion, and studies in animals have shown changes in ACC structure with early life stress. The purpose of this study was to measure volume of the ACC in PTSD.

ic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure ACC volume in 8 subjects with abuse-related PTSD and 13 healthy subjects without PTSD. ACC volume included Brodmann's area [BA] 24 and 32.
s
ACC volume in PTSD patients was significantly smaller than in non-PTSD subjects.
sion
results are consistent with smaller ACC volume in PTSD.

In this paper, a novel systematic configuration procedure in choosing parameters is presented for the synthesis of linear anti-windup scheme by revising the original goal of the unified anti-windup framework. The anti-windup controller is derived from the parameters, which are characterized by the sufficient conditions for the stability and performance objective as to protect the system from adverse effects in present of saturation and recover the energy deficit after saturation. Moreover, the entire synthesis is cast as sub-optimization problems over linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and the effectiveness of the result is shown via simulation examples with comparison to other existing anti-windup schemes.

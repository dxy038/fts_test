Background and Objective: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are regarded as one of the most common infectious diseases. A remarkable percent of urinary tract infections are asymptomatic. In some cases of urinary tract infections, significant bacteriuria is not present. One the etiologic agents of culture negative genitourinary tract infections, which can be transmitted through intercourse. is Chlamydia trachomatis. On the basis of high incidence of negative results of urine culture (up to 60%) in patients suffering from UTI referring to Bou-Ali infectious hospital and taking into consideration the importance of genitourinary chlamydial infections, we decided to study prevalence of clamydia trachomatis in urine samples of patients with UTI referring to this hospital.
Methods and materials: This research was a descriptive study on the 320 patients referring to Bou-Ali infectious hospital in Zahedan which were choosen by non-randomized sampling. One early morning urine sample was taken from these patients. After centrifugation, sediment of samples was used as antigen for Chlamy-Check-I ELISA kits.
Results: Out of 320 urinary specimens, 95 specimens (29.69%) were positive and 225 specimen (70.31%) were negative for Chlamydia trachomatis. From 95 positive sample, 43 person(45.2%) were male and 52 person (54.73) were female. In both sexes the highest percent was related to 20-29 years old group.
Conclusion: in accordance with above reported prevalence rate and bearing in mind the consequences of inappropriate treatment of Chlamydial infections (PID, infertility, extra uterus pregnancy, epididiomitis) the importance of precise treatment of Chlamydial infection and necessity of providing laboratory facilities for accurate and rapid diagnosis of Chlamydial infections in the area with high incidence of culture negative urine specimens is recommended.

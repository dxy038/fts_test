
Background: The objective of this study was to identify the prognostic factors that influence
the outcome of ovarian stimulation with
intrauterine insemination
(IUI)
cycles in
couples
with different
infertility etiology.
   
Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was performed in data of 1348 IUI
cycles with ovarian stimulation by clomiphene citrate (CC) and/or gonadotropins in
632 women with five different infertility etiology subgroups at Akbarabbadi Hospital,
Tehran, Iran.  
Results: The pregnancy rate (PR)/ cycle was highest (19.9%) among couples with
unexplained infertility and lowest (10.6%) in couples with multiple factors infertility.

In cases of unexplained infertility, the best PRs were seen after CC plus gonadotropins
stimulation (26.3%) and with inseminated motile sperm count > 30×10

(21.9%), but the tendency didn’t reach statistical significant. In the ovarian factor

group, the best PRs were observed in women aged between 30 and 34 years
(20.8%), with 2-3 preovulatory follicles (37.8%) and infertility duration between
1and 3 years (20.8%), while only infertility duration (p=0.03) and number of preovulatory

follicles (p=0.01) were statistically significant. Multiple logistic regression

analysis determined that number of preovulatory follicles (p=0.02), duration
of infertility (p=0.015), age (p=0.019), infertility etiology (p=0.05) and stimulation
regimen (p=0.01) were significant independent factors in order to predict overall
clinical PR.  
Conclusion: The etiology of infertility is important to achieve remarkable IUI success.
It is worth mentioning that within different etiologies of infertility, the demographic and
cycles characteristics of couples did not show the same effect. Favorable variables for
treatment success are as follows: age  < 40, duration of infertility ?5 years and a cause of
infertility except of multiple factors.

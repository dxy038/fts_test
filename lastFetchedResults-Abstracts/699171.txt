The objective of this study was to explore the extent of mineralization, reduction in color and reduction of COD of gallic acid, tannin and lignin by ozonation and a combination of aerobic biodegradation and ozonation. Ozonation of pure aliquots (phase I experiments) resulted in the decline in TOC, COD, COD/TOC ratio, UV absorbance at 280 nm and color of the three model compounds investigated, with COD removals of greater than 80% and high removals (>90%) of UV absorbance at 280 nm and color observed in all cases at an ozone dose of 6 mg ozone/mg initial TOC or higher. Aerobic biodegradation of pure gallic acid, tannin and lignin aliquots resulted in COD decline of approximately 36–38%. Subsequent ozonation (phase II experiments) resulted in further decline in TOC, COD, COD/TOC ratio, and increase in UV absorbance at 280 nm and color removals. COD and TOC removals comparable to phase I experiments were obtained with 30–40% lower ozone absorption in phase II experiments. The biodegradation step was quite effective in removing specific UV absorbance at 280 nm, with up to 75% removal observed. Subsequent ozonation increased overall specific UV absorbance at 280 nm to greater than 90%.

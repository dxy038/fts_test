Background Many studies have described
associations between childhood psychiatric disorder
and characteristics of the child, and their family, school
and neighbourhood, but few studies have studied them
simultaneously. Also, most investigators have failed to
allow for the extent to which different exposures are correlated,
or for clustering at different levels of observation.
Our objective was to establish which correlates
were independently associated with psychiatric disorder.
Method Data on DSM-IV psychiatric diagnoses, as
well as child and family characteristics, were obtained
on 8772 English 5- to 15-year-olds included in a large
British prevalence survey of mental health. These data
were supplemented by independent measures of school
and neighbourhood disadvantage.We entered child and
family variables with the measures of school and neighbourhood
disadvantage into a logistic regression analysis
to establish which variables were independently associated
with child psychiatric disorder. Results No
variables were associated with all types of disorder.Poor
general health and life events were related to emotional
disorders,while conduct disorders were most closely associated
with family variables, and ADHD was only related
to child characteristics.Disadvantaged schools,deprived
neighbourhoods, low socioeconomic status,
parental unemployment, cohabiting, large family size,
and poverty were not independently associated with
disorder. Conclusions Individually assessed child and
family factors may be more influential than aggregate
measures of school and neighbourhood factors. Different
disorders have distinctive correlates. Many of the
best known “risk factors” are not independently related
to childhood psychiatric disorder, and are, therefore,
acting distally in the causal pathway or irrelevant.

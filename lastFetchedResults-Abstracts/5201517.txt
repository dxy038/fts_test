The paper presents the development of EthnoMuse: multimedia digital library of Slovenian folk music and dance culture. The main scope of the project concerns the digitization of production and post-production processes that relate to collecting, documenting and archiving of folk heritage and development of multimedia applications for various content types (folk song, music and dance) and formats (image, audio, video, notation, MIDI etc.). The main objective of this paper is to discuss the former, focusing on the conceptual design of a flexible data model the archive is based on. We also briefly describe the tools developed to support the workflow of researchers involved in collecting and archiving of folk music related contents.

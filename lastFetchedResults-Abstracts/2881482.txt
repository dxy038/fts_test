This paper proposes a multi-objective dispatch strategy, combining economic optimal operation and environment optimal operation, of hybrid power generation. We use power generation of Mae Hong Son (MHS), which is a remote mountain area of Thailand connected to 115 kV and 22 kV transmission line as a study model. The power system consists of one existing photovoltaic power plant (PV), two mini-hydro power plants, one diesel power plant. In this study, there are two new additional PV systems in the power generation. We formulate the economic optimal operation with energy cost and peak demand charge and investigate CO2 emission analysis of environmental dispatch. The multi-objective dispatch design in normal mode can be cast as a linear program. The simulation results show the optimal operation of each component for rainy and dry seasons. It can subsequently use to determine the size of battery and renewable to maintain the power system in other mode such as standalone mode in the future work.

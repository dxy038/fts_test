This paper compares the optimization technique such as Particle Swarm Optimization and Modified Particle Swarm Optimization, in a standard 3-Bus and 6-bus Power System. The objective function is to minimize the power losses such as Active Power and Reactive Power in order to reduce the voltage drop thereby improving the stability of the given power system. This paper also compares and shows the better optimization technique which is suited for reducing the power losses to maintain a stable power system.

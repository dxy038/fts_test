Two optimization studies on the design of a three degree of freedom translational parallel platform are conducted and the results are compared. The objective function of the first study maximizes total volume of the manipulator workspace without regard to the quality of the workspace. The second study optimizes the total volume of well conditioned workspace by maximizing a global condition index. The global condition index is a function of the condition number of the Jacobian matrix, providing a means of measuring the amplification error between the actuators and the end effector. Both objective functions involve an integration over the workspace of the manipulator. This integral is approximated using the Monte Carlo method

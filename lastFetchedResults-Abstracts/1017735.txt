Studies have shown that the length of hospital stay after surgery is an estimate of the success rate of surgery and that demographic, medical, psychological and electrophysiological factors are also important. Since the most common treatment for coronary artery disease (CAD) is coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate five theoretical models for predicting hospital length of stay after CABG surgery as an indicator of surgical success, including variables of demographic, psychological, electrophysiological and medical, in order to find a model which is the best fit of the data. To this end, 150 patients (30 females and 120 males) were selected non randomly based on patient accessibility from among patients referred to Tehran Heart Center of Shahid Rajaie Hospital who were candidates for CABG surgery. These patients then completed the 21 item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Stress Response Evaluation Device (SRE). Path analysis was conducted for the five models and it was shown that the second theoretical model including components of age, gender, high blood pressure, depression, anxiety and heart rate variability (HRV) was the best and most appropriate fit to the data. Therefore, this model can be used in clinical settings to identify patients for whom surgery may not be successful.

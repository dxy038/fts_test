Kuhrang region, compared with its neighboring areas in the north and east shows high seismic activity, whereas in the south and west lower activity can be observed. The main objective of this research aims at finding out the source of these different kinds of activities, as well as analysis of earthquake hazard level and disasters resulting from this in the future. In order to determine the seismic sources followed by structural investigations, seismotectonic maps of the area and activity of the faults were analyzed after determining the stress exerted upon the area. Ardal, Main Recent Fault, Kuhrang, Zardkuh Faults are the nearest faults to the Kuhrang. In accordance with this, two types of linear and area sources have been introduced for this region. Seismic potential of active faults and the maximum acceleration created due to the probabilistic movement has been calculated by the Deterministic method, as well as taking into account the two types of linear and area seismic sources.

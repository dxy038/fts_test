Knowledge management is an initiative which could determines the organization´s competitive edge. This initiative could be stipulated on internally generated information known as (records). The information embedded in records, when processed, will yield knowledge that could help organization to make timely and well-informed decision making. In light of this, students´ records are a form of strategic resource for education institutions to set strategy, improve performance and protect vital information securely. However, records management in education setting in Malaysia is yet to be based on framework which normally includes policy, technology and strategy. Currently, student records are managed using Students´ Information System (SIS) but without the presence of any framework which serve as a roadmap in implementing the endeavor. The objective of this study is to propose a framework for vocational colleges particularly in Melaka and Negeri Sembilan zones in managing the students´ records electronically. 9 Vocational Colleges were selected involving 117 lecturers and staffs as respondents. The samples were selected using cluster sampling technique. Meanwhile, the survey technique using questionnaires was used to collect data. The findings have shown that no students´ electronic records management framework is presence for the surveyed colleges. This is a worrying phenomenon whereby students´ records management initiative is carried out without proper framework in place.

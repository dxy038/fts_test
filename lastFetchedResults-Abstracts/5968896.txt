The EC has subsidized the C-rating project with the objective to define methods and criteria for testing, rating and specifying PV concentrator components and systems. The work aims to emphasize the differences between flat panels and concentrator systems. This paper reports the main differences to be considered when rating and measuring concentrators compared with flat panel systems, defines the specifications required by concentrators, and proposes a concentrator modeling. The objective of the modeling is to predict the concentrator performance and energy production for the given conditions of temperature, radiation and wind based on the measurements at the reference conditions. The model includes new concepts, such as the effect of non-uniformity of the light on the cell and the spectral dependence of the collector efficiency.

This study presents the development and implementation of an alternative Flickermeter based on a low cost embedded electronic system. The development of this new device is based on the original Flickermeter proposed by the IEC 61000-4-15, but with important modifications added. These modifications allow for direct quantification of light variation, in such a way, so as to eliminate the effect associated with the different lamp technologies available through the correct quantification of flicker severity. In order to achieve this objective blocks 1 and 3 of the original IEC Flickermeter were altered and block 2 was completely eliminated. The implementation of a low cost embedded electronic system represents the differential of the developed system in relation to equipment currently available on the market, which is based on solutions of a more elevated cost. The developed prototype was appropriately tested and thus provided encouraging results. In addition, the article also presents an analysis that refers to the susceptibility of lamps manufactured upon the same technologies to flicker, such as compact fluorescent and LED lamps, widely used nowadays for substituting traditional incandescent lamps.

Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a powerful technique providing meter-precision elevation maps and millimeter-precision surface displacement maps. Since 2007, the high-resolution SAR satellite TerraSAR-X allows monitoring of even single buildings from space using advanced monostatic repeat-pass stacking techniques. Furthermore, the launch of its twin satellite TanDEM-X in 2010 facilitates bistatic single-pass SAR interferometry. The main objective of this mission is the generation of a global digital elevation model. It also provides a configurable SAR platform for demonstrating new interferometric techniques and applications. However, in dense urban areas, standard TanDEM-X elevation models are inaccurate because ambiguities in radar layover areas cannot be solved. This letter describes the potential of joint monostatic and bistatic (motion-free and atmosphere-free) SAR interferometric stacking for an improved scene elevation and surface deformation estimation in complex urban areas. It involves exploiting distributed scatterers (DSs) using an advanced high-resolution small-baseline subset algorithm. Since most of the scatterers within a radar image can be classified as DSs, there is an increasing focus on an optimal processing of DSs for urban area monitoring. The fusion technique and an application test case are presented using a high-resolution spotlight mixed TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X data stack of Las Vegas, USA.

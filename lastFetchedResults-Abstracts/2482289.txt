Objective: There is evidence to show an increase in use of stimulant substances among university students. This
study is a qualitative assessment of the existing situation and the underlying reasons for stimulant use among the
students of Tehran University of Medical Sciences in 2006.
Methods: Three qualitative methods have been used: focus group discussions with 7 groups (60 individuals)
consisting of male and female students in the dormitories and in the university environment, in-depth interview with 20
drug user students, and interview with 20 key informants including counselors, managers and guards of dormitories,
staff of the office for Culture and Welfare Affairs of students and members of students' organizations. Purposeful or
opportunistic method was used for sampling.
Results: Ecstasy and methylphenidate (Ritalin) were mentioned as the stimulants used by the students. The main
declared reasons for ecstasy use were desire to have fun and excitement, desire to modernity, participation in parties,
curiosity and living without family. The high expense of ecstasy pills and the training provided by media were
mentioned as the main protective factors. Most respondents believed that use of methylphenidate was more prevalent
than ecstasy use. In contrary to the drugs used for fun and enjoyment, methylphenidate is used for increasing learning
abilities and academic achievement. Other pointed- out factors were ease of use and being stigma-free.
Conclusion Increasing risk perception via training, social alternatives to risky activities and parental training for
continuing care and advice in the college period are recommended.
Declaration of Interest: None.

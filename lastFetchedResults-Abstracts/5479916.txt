This proceedings contains 116 papers selected from presentations at the 2010 Symposium on Piezoelectricity, Acoustic Waves and device applications (SPAWDA10), which was successfully held during December 10&#8211;13, 2010 at Xiamen University, Xiamen, China. SPAWDA is an interdisciplinary, multi-field, and industry-focused technical forum with international flavor, which has been rapidly growing in recent years. Focusing on the analyses, design, and applications of piezoelectric devices, the objective of SPAWDA is to promote coordinated integration of theoretical research and product design, to accelerate the development of modern sensor technology, to advance the integrated circuits technology, and more importantly, to conceive novel piezoelectric acoustic wave devices with full-featured capabilities. Under the strong support of the Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (CSTAM), the Acoustical Society of China (ASC), and the IEEE UFFC Society, SPAWDA has been successfully held four times in Ningbo University (2004), Zhejiang University (2006), Nanjing University of Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics (2008), and Huazhong University of Science and Technology (2009).

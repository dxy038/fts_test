This paper presents HyBook, an ad-hoc tool which was designed and implemented with the objective of improving the workflow management, and to allow the possibility of automatically generating e-books regarding educational courses at the Instituto de Ciencias de la Educacio&#768;n (ICE) of the Universidad de Zaragoza (UZ). So far, when the ICE of the UZ wanted to start a new educational initiative, the usual elaboration process of the informative resources was performed manually. Now, by using our application the ICE will be able to centralize the information collection process, and automatically create the two leaflets that the ICE publishes each year in a more simply and conveniently way.

We study the implications for optimal monetary policy of introducing habit formation in
consumption into a general equilibrium model with sticky prices.Habit formation affects the
model’s endogenous dynamics through its effects on both aggregate demand and households’
supply of output.We show that the objective of monetary policy consistent with welfare
maximization includes output stabilization, as well as inflation and output gap stabilization.
We find that the variance of output increases under optimal policy, even though it acquires a
higher implicit weight in the welfare function.We also find that a simple interest rate rule
nearly achieves the welfare-optimal allocation, regardless of the degree of habit formation.In
this rule, the optimal responses to inflation and the lagged interest rate are both declining in
the size of the habit, although super-inertial policies remain optimal.

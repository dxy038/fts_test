This work aims at comparing the performance of two Multivariate Objective Response Detection (MORD) techniques in the frequency domain, the Multiple Coherence (MC) and the Multiple Component Synchrony Measure (MCSM), for tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) detection. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals during somatosensory stimulation were collected from forty adult volunteers using the 10-20 International System. The stimulation was carried out throughout current pulses (200 &#956;s width) applied to the right posterior tibial nerve (motor threshold intensity level) at the rate of 5 Hz. The response detection was based on rejecting the null hypothesis of response absence (M = 100 and M = 800 epochs and significance level &#945; = 0.05). The MORD techniques were applied to the pairs of derivations [Cz][Fz] and [C3][C4]. The MC outperforms the MCSM, regardless the pair of derivations or the number of epochs used for the estimates calculation. Hence, the MC should be used, if two derivations are available for SEP recording.

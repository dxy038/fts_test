This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the synchronization of Bidirectional Contactless Charging System (BCCS) of Electric Vehicles (EVs) batteries with Distribution Node (DN). The BCCS unit is having two separate converters unit, namely primary converter unit, which is known as charging point and secondary converter unit, which is connected with the EV battery. To demonstrate the bidirectional power flow between EVsÂ´ batteries and DN, a Charging Station (CS) has been developed which is connected to the DN. Multiple BCCS units are connected in the CS via ac bus for supporting/injecting the power during peak/off-peak hours. The bidirectional power flow depends on the total available/required energy of the CS and DN voltage. To regulate the power flow in either direction, fuzzy logic based control strategies have been developed for the primary and secondary side converter units. MATALB Simulink model of a CS, distribution substation of a city and multiple BCCS unit has been developed. This work also analysis the impacts on the DN when power flow from DN to BCCS unit without synchronization.

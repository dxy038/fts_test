Chaos searching has been introduced to particle swarm optimization (PSO). Thereby a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm for the design of the conventional pumping unit is put forward, which takes the minimum peak torque factor on the up stroke as the objective function. The improved PSO algorithm has both advantage of simplify for implement of original particle swarm optimization and advantage of fast convergence, easy to escape local minima for chaos optimization algorithm. The results of optimization show the proposed approach has not only better global search capability but fast convergence and high computation precision. With the improved algorithm, better design parameters for beam-pumping unit were obtained compare with parameters from particle swarm optimization or compound form method.

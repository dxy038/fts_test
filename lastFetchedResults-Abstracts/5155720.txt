Vascular stenting is the procedure of implanting a thin tube into the site of a narrow or blocked artery due to atherosclerosis. However, conventional metal-made stents cause significant injury to the vascular wall and endothelium, which functions as a protective biocompatible barrier between tissue and circulating blood, resulting in in-stent restenosis and then the development of late thrombosis. These problems can be avoided if formation of the endothelium, which is composed of aligned endothelial cells, is accelerated on metal stents. For this purpose, highly controllable nanostructured surface features on Ti (a popular vascular stent metal) were created to promote endothelialization and to control the direction of endothelial cell function. The objective of this in vitro study was to investigate endothelial cell function on highly controllable nanostructured surface features. In this manner, the present study provides much promise for the use of nanotechnology for improving metals for vascular stent applications.

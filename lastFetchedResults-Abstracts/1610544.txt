Biodiesel production from microalgae has recently increased on interest. The objective of this work is to explore the potential of biodiesel production from the microalgae Isochrysis galbana (T-ISO). For that reason, this microalgae was cultivated for biodiesel production. The culture system equipment consisted of two methacrylate ponds, 11 mm thick. The pond has a base of 1.40 × 0.40 m and a height of 0.4 m. The influence of initial concentration of inoculum, stirring and carbon dioxide supply on the growth of algae were analyzed. The obtained results indicate that stirring improves the algae growth rate. The other two factors have no significant effect on final cell density. Obtained biomass was used to produce oil by extraction to use for biodiesel synthesis by means of basic-catalyzed reaction. For transesterification, microalgae oil was mixed with methanol (12:1 methanol to oil molar ratio), and sodium hydroxide (1% g NaOH/g oil) for 3 h in a reactor at 62 °C. The best harvest shows a biomass concentration of 0.305 g/L with a FAME content of 12.5%.

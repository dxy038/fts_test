Abstract
Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and the most
common risk factors of motor developmental delay in infants.
Materials & Methods
Following ethical approval, a study was carried out on the prevalence and
risk factors of infants with motor developmental delay. The first stage was
conducted through a cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence of
motor developmental delay on 7500 infants and the second stage was an
analytic case - control survey to identify the most common risk factors on 140
infants, aged one month to three years with motor developmental delay. Data
was collected using a demographic questionnaire, the Parents Evaluation of
Developmental Status questionnaire, the Denver Developmental Screening Test
II, a neurological assessment form, and the movement and tone assessment
form.
Results
The prevalence of motor developmental delay in 7500 infants was 18.7/1000.
The most common risk factors in infants with motor developmental delay
were prematurity (25.6%), low birth weight (19.2%), neonatal seizures (7.5%),
hyaline membrane disease (6.7%), systemic infections of mothers during
pregnancy (5.9%), severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (5%) in sequence.
Motor developmental delay was significantly correlated with consanguinity of
parents (p=0.001), prematurity (p=0.046), abnormal head circumference at birth
(p=0.038), and low birth weight (p=0.026).
Conclusion
The prevalence of motor developmental delay appears to be high and further
studies should focus on different preventive strategies, controlling the most
common risk factors and emphasizing on early detection and treatment of high
risk infants

Significant throughput degradation of multihop path communication in wireless mesh network is one of the major problems in wireless communication. The main reason for the lack of bandwidth is channel interference, which is caused by contention for the shared channel between wireless nodes. The natural approach to overcome this problem is exploiting the availability of multiple channels multiple interfaces (MCMI) networks. However, it is costly and may not be practical to dedicate one interface per channel for every node. Thus in this paper, we study the MCMI network, where the number of interfaces that every node has is less than the number of available channels. Simple and distributed channel scheduling algorithms for communication in multiple channels multiple interfaces networks are discussed. The objective of the proposed algorithms is to minimize the channel interference that causes the throughput degradation in multihop networks. The proposed algorithms are evaluated with extensive simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms well exploited the availability of multiple channels multiple interfaces to overcome the throughput degradation problem.

Recently, the TV landscape is rapidly shifting from the traditional &#8220;laid-back&#8221; experience to a &#8220;lean-forward&#8221; multiscreen experience. In this paper, we propose MUTAS (MUltiscreen TV experience As a Service), a novel cloud-based service delivery model, in response to this trend. The design objective is to facilitate the development process of new multi-screen features, and improve user experiences by offering an all-in-one solution. The enabling technology is to encapsulate basic functions into a unified cloud platform, and expose divergent multi-screen services through a cloud clone per user. Based on MUTAS, we will use one system to demonstrate four different multi-screen experiences (i.e., synchronized social TV watching, video teleportation, social networking integration, and advertising re-distribution). This demo provides a reference to build cloud-based frameworks for flexible, extensible, and scalable multi-screen TV experience.

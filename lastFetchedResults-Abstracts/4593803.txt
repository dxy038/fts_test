To enable the huge saving of the kit-breakdown, we developed MaxIt v1.2 to generate an optimal capacity plan at the kit component level for the mid-range build plan in multi-factory environment. We describe the MILP (mixed integer linear programming) model and system architecture of MaxIt v1.2. We also conduct detailed sensitivity analysis on parameter setting and objective prioritizing. With the implementation in the Intel Shanghai and Manila sites, we have significantly improved data integrity and enabled a -US&#8805; cost savings.

This paper concentrates on the maximization of DVB-T coverage areas with a single frequency deployment. To achieve this objective, internal delays at the transmitters are jointly optimized so that self-interfered areas can be reduced as much as possible before having to deploy new centers. A technique based on the metaheuristic Simulated Annealing is proposed and validated. Results show that the strategy succeeds in its objective and constitutes a practical tool that helps to assess radio planning decisions.

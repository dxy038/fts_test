Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze biomarkers of oxidative stress in patients with wet age
related macular degeneration (AMD). Participants and Measurements: Case-control study that includes 163
patients with wet AMD (age group of 55–82 years with the mean age of 71 years and 170 age-matched healthy
controls in the age group of 55–78 years with the mean age of 71 years. The following parameters were
determined: reduced and oxidized Glutathione (GSH/GSSH), protein carbonyl groups, total antioxidant activity
in plasma and the activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes, such as, gluthatione peroxidase, gluthatione
reductase and superoxide dismutase. Results: We observed total antioxidant activity higher in control group (CG)
compared with patients with wet AMD (7.1 ± 1.2 μM Trolox vs 5.8 ± 1.1 μM Trolox). Values of superoxide
dismutase activity (SOD), gluthatione reductase (GR) and gluthatione peroxidase (GPx) are higher in control
group than in patients with wet AMD. According to the GSH/GSSH results, average values were higher in the
CG than in patients with wet AMD and data were not significantly different.. Values of protein carbonyl groups
were higher in patients with wet AMD than in CG and significant differences were found. Conclusions: The
finding of the present study suggests that the patients with wet AMD are an altered metabolic state of oxidationreduction
and that it is convenient to give therapeutic interventions with antioxidants. We have demonstrated that
systematic oxidative stress, measured by different biomarkers is closely associated with the wet AMD

This paper we propose a multi-objective optimization model to deal with the capacity planning in semiconductor manufacturing system, which is a typical multi-objective problem. Unlike traditional optimization methods, our model combines case-based reasoning with adaptive resonance theory and multi-objective genetic algorithm, in which some constraints such as maximizing profits, utilization of capacities, minimizing unmet demands etc are considered. An illustration shows how these techniques work effectively is also presented.

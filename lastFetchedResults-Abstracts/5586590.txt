Rapid prototyping (RP) is an automated manufacturing process that quickly builds physical models from CAD files of 3D prototypes. The main objective of this paper is to develop Web-based automated RP system, which provides consumers the convenience of distance manufacturing without having an expensive RP machine. We take the advantage of the Internet technology to combine product quotation interface and on-line remote monitoring system into a Web-based automated RP system. This e-business application framework of Web-based thermal extrusion RP system mainly included four parts. (1) Open .STL file using Open GL software technology, (2) product quotation system, (3) selection RP system, and (4) customers to joint an alliance. The customer can transfer .STL file via the Internet to the RP Web server. The Open GL software technology can be used to show the 3D models with different color on rotation direction. The product quotation system supplies an on-line automated cost estimation related to the option of materials, manufacturing time and RP machines before RP part being manufactured. In the RP selection system we can use some conditions (material, cost, and manufactured time) to select the RP machine. This Web-based RP selection system can help user select an appropriate RP system. After evaluating, the system shows the manufacturing time and cost. Then the RP part can be manufactured in our RP machine. During manufacturing, the customer can watch a live image of RP part via WEB, and monitor the RP machine to build up a physical part through CCD camera during the manufacturing process. If customers or companies want to joint an alliance, they can joint our RP selection system as a member of an association and upload their RP machine data (introduction and specification of the RP machine, and the manufactured parts) to the RP WEB server.

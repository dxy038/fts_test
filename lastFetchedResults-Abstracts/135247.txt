Introduction & Objective: In patients with chronic renal failure who need chronic hemodialysis, AV fistula is one of the most  proper ways of vascular access. The aim of this study was to  assess the patency and complications of AV fistulas in patients  with chronic hemodialysis.
Materials & Methods: In this descriptive study 82 patients with chronic renal failure, who underwent AV fistulas in a 5 year- period of time in Imam Khomeini Hospital Center were enrolled. Age,  gender, fistulas patency, complication rate and their relation with diabetes, hypertension and history of Shaldone were assessed. The collected data were analyzed by T and Chi-square test using SPSS soft ware.
Results: the age mean of patients was 46.9Â±18.8 years. 46  patients (%56.1) were male. The mean of age was significantly  higher in patients with complication compared to patients without  complication. History of shaldone and hypertension were  significantly higher in patients with bad fistula blood flow compared to patients with good fistula blood flow. History of shaldone,  diabetes and hypertension were significantly higher in patients with  complication compared to patients without complication. Female  patients were significantly prone to aneurysm than males. History of transplants rejection was significantly higher in patients with  aneurysm than in those without aneurysm. History of hypertension was significantly higher in patients with aneurysm and thrombosis  compared to those without aneurysm and thrombosis. History of  shaldone and Diabetes was significantly higher in patients with  thrombosis compared to those without thrombosis.
Conclusion: History of shaldone, Diabetes and Hypertension were  significantly higher in patients with complication and bad fistula blood flow.

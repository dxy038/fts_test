This paper is focused on the automatic recontextualization, and the conception and operationalization upgrade of learning scenarios in environment for human learning. On the one hand, the learnersÂ´ levels knowledge allow designers and teachers to discover: blocking situations and steps leading students to fail. On the other hand, they are used to calculate a new scenario from the set of scenarios describing the same pedagogical objective. For this purpose, the choice of a modelling language and its infrastructure is relevant. The study of different modelling languages allows us to find that the adaptation of learning is far than the sought outcomes. In this paper, our choice is particularly fixed on the LDL model in which we provide some extensions to promote the adaptation and regulation of learning.

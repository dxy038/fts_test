The Solar energy is used as a kind of high effective, clean, renewable energy source. PV Generation can convert the light into electricity by PV Cells. It is obvious that PV Generation is transiting from complementary energy to substitute energy now, and it will be used as a main energy in the future all over the world. PQ Decouple Control strategy is widely used recently. The strategy can individually control active power and reactive power. The more appropriate parameters used in the PV Controller, the higher stability of system and the more ideal dynamic response characteristics will be achieved. This paper introduces a method of combing nonlinear optimization with electromagnetic transient simulation. Transient simulation is used to evaluate the optimization objective function, an optimization algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization method is used as the engine for producing new candidate points. The ISE index is used to evaluate the dynamic responses, the object is to minimize the weighed sum of ISE, which is associated with different simulation states. The usefulness of the approach is demonstrated by a simulation in PSCAD.

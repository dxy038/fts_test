The objective of this work is to develop an efficient strategy for dynamic problems with multiple contacts. Our approach is based on the multiscale LATIN method with domain decomposition. This is a mixed method which deals simultaneously with the forces and velocities at the interfaces of the different subdomains. This strategy has already been applied successfully to a variety of static problems; here, it is extended to dynamics. First, we show how the multiscale strategy can be extended to dynamics. Then, we illustrate the capabilities of the method through a 3D academic example and the simulation of a heterogeneous material.

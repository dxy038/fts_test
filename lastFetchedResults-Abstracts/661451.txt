The National Institute of Standards and Technology has issued numerous environmental matrix standard reference materials (SRMs) for the measurement of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; however, only one SRM (diesel particulate material) was issued with certified and reference values for four nitrated-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAH). The objective of this study was to develop an improved analytical procedure to quantify 28 mononitro- and dinitro-PAHs, including numerous isomers, in air and diesel particulate SRMs. Two air particulate matrix SRMs, SRM 1649a Urban Dust and SRM 1648 Urban Particulate Matter, and fine particulate matter, collected from Baltimore MD for use as an “interim reference material” for the determination of organic contaminants, have been characterized for nitro-PAHs. Concentrations of nitro-PAHs in all three air particulate materials were at the ng/g level with the highest nitro-PAH concentration being 2-nitrofluoranthene (range between 246 and 340 ng/g). For the three diesel particulate-related SRMs, SRM 1650a Diesel Particulate Matter, SRM 1975 Diesel Particulate Extract, and SRM 2975 Diesel Particulate Matter (Industrial Fortlift), concentrations of nitro-PAHs were in the μg/g range, with 1-nitropyrene as the dominant nitro-PAH (range between 18 and 40 μg/g). Distinct nitro-PAH isomer patterns were present between the air and diesel particulate materials. These results will provide isomer identification and reference concentrations for a large number of nitro-PAHs in the existing diesel and air particulate SRMs.

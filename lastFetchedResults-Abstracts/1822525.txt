Objective
s study, we have evaluated the effects of stress on functional and proteomic changes in submandibular saliva of rats.

dult rats were divided in three groups: IMO (2 h/day of immobilization for 7 days), LL (constant light during 20 days), C (unstressed controls submitted to 14 h light–10 h dark cycle). Body weight, food intake and the dry weight of submandibular gland were recorded. Saliva samples, collected under anaesthesia following i.p. administration of isoproterenol and pilocarpine (5 mg/kg), were assayed for total proteins (TP), amylase activity and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis.
s
eight, food intake and the dry weight of submandibular gland of IMO rats were lower than those of C and LL groups. The salivary volumes secreted in IMO and LL rats, were significantly higher than in controls. The TP output (μg protein/μg saliva/mg of dry tissue) and amylase activity output (AU/μg of saliva/mg of dry tissue) in IMO were significantly higher than in C and LL animals. The electrophoretic pattern of saliva proteins of LL rats, revealed the absence of a protein band of approximately 25 kDa. This band was composed by the common salivary protein-1 and a prolactin-induced protein as identified by peptide mass fingerprinting.
sions
ences in body weight and food intake between IMO and LL might be attributed to the sort and intensity of stressors stimuli. The changes in the volume of secreted saliva could be a compensatory mechanism in response to stressors. The increase of total protein in IMO rats and the absence of 25 kDa proteins in LL, would suggest that the submandibular glands respond to the sympathetic nervous system stimuli induced by the stress with an increase of activity of the sympathetic nerves in IMO and a reduction in LL rats.

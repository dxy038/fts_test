Given the importance and criticality of instrument validation in IS research, the objective of this study is to provide a systematic assessment of IS construct validity via a multitrait multimethod (MTMM). In doing so, this paper uses structurally different methods -- neurophysiological and self-reported scales - to measure three commonly used IS constructs: engagement, arousal and cognitive load. The study´s results generally support MTMM expectations and shed light on the complexity of detecting the nature of mono-method bias. More specifically, the study´s results show that primitive perceptual IS constructs such as arousal are unlikely to suffer from mono-method bias, whereas more complex perceptual constructs such as engagement or cognitive load have higher within method correlations. There are two alternative explanations for the within method correlations: a) a method bias, or b) a combination between trait and method.

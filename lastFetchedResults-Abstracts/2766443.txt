In a recent paper (IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun., vol.8, no.9, 2009), Yi and Kim presented an optimum power allocation scheme for bidirectional cooperative networks employing opportunistic source selection (OSS) protocol. However, the optimum power allocation expressions in [1] are proved to be incorrect. We present correct optimum power allocation expressions, which are validated by the simulation results.

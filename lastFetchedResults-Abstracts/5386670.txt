Selection of green production strategy is critical but difficult due to the fact that it affects not only enterprisesÂ´ green benefit, but also their economic performance. The problem is essentially multi-objective and involves dynamic and uncertain conditions. We proposed a simulation-based approach to improve the analysis and facilitate the decision-making. Simulation models were developed to represent production flow and decision logic under real world conditions. A multi-objective genetic algorithm, combined with improving heuristics, was developed to search for Pareto optimal solutions. The two modules are integrated to work in evolutionary cycles to achieve the optimization. Experiments were designed and carried out to verify and validate proposed concepts.

The paper briefly uncovers techniques used for a design of compact planar antennas in order to achieve wideband and multi-band capability. The main topic is aimed to the multi-objective optimization using genetic algorithms. Quarter-wavelength planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) using slot and shorted parasitic patches is chosen to cover GSM900, GSM1800 and ISM2400 bands. The antenna was developed in an electromagnetic simulation and optimization package IE3D by Zeland Software. Global multi-objective optimization is provided by the cooperation between MATLAB and IE 3D. Binary genetic algorithm and composite objective function are used to tune this antenna. Impedance match and direction of maximum gain are desired parameters to improve.

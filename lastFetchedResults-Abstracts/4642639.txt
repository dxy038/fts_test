During the past few decades, unalloyed titanium has been extensively used as a material of dental implant-supported restorations but it cause gingival discoloration and unnatural appearance of the surrounding soft tissue. Currently, yttrium oxide partially-stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP) is a ceramic of special interest because of its superior mechanical properties. This study was carried out with four one piece zirconium implants embedded on a standard acrylic resin mandibular edentulous model, the abutment of zirconium implant was classified into two designs and then laboratory test was applied with proposed biting force (sensor (BS) and a bidirectional transmit-receive module. Our study concluded that the use of one piece Zirconium implant with box or parallel shape abutment head in implant supported over-denture without a need of cement, screws or plastics or metal housing for attachment in other types of implant had a superior results and easier maintenance and repair of the prosthesis if any complications occur.

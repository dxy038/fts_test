Objective: The study was undertaken to assess attitudes and behavior of newer obstetricians/gynecologists in depression care. Study Design: One thousand randomly selected physicians in their final year of training or recent practice received a survey about depression: training; related attitudes, responsibility, confidence; and self-reported care for the last depressed patient. Results: Of those eligible, 437 (64%) returned the survey. Current residents reported more didactic mental health training, but practice patterns were similar to recent graduates. Overall, 94% felt responsible for recognition, whereas about half indicated asking about substance abuse, sexual abuse, or physical abuse, 37% expressed confidence in their ability to treat with medications, and 22% felt confident in their ability to manage depression overall. Conclusion: Residents are receiving more didactic mental health training, yet changes in training are not yet reflected in reported practice patterns or confidence. The use of antidepressant medications and assessment of contributing conditions such as abuse deserve more emphasis in training. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;189:267-73.)

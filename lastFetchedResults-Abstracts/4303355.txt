This paper introduces the single sided matrix converter as a novel variant of the conventional bidirectional form. It may be used to apply both positive and negative voltages to a load, from a multiphase sinusoidal supply, but can only supply unidirectional current. This greatly simplifies the problem of safe commutation encountered with the conventional matrix converter. Potential applications of this new converter are considered, with simulation results provided for driving a switched reluctance motor. Analysis of the supply currents highlights the problem with ´pulsed power´ motors when no energy storage clement is employed. The advantage is a reduction in size of the power converter.

Objective: To ascertain caregivers's knowledge, attitude and practice regarding malaria and treatment of children in rural and urban communities in Enugu, Nigeria.

design: This was a cross-sectional study, and caregivers were selected by convenience sampling.

: In total, 224 and 184 respondents were interviewed in paediatric outpatient clinics in rural and urban areas, respectively, using structured questionnaires.

s: Most respondents in rural and urban areas has heard of malaria (99% urban, 74% rural; P≤0.05). Both groups were unaware of the particular susceptibility of children and pregnant women to the disease, and respondents preferred to use self-medication (urban 79%, rural 20%). The rural and urban caregivers were quite familiar with and used antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine (urban 23%, rural 15%) and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (urban 50%, rural 6%), although in inappropriate dosages. They were also aware of preventive measures against malaria such as insecticide-treated nets (urban 32%, rural 56%), but there was low usage in both communities (7 and 2%, respectively).

sions: Both rural and urban communities were aware of malaria as a disease, but practices were grossly inadequate. The provision of affordable healthcare facilities and the use of health education to change knowledge, attitude and practice will help meet the target goals of the ‘Roll Back Malaria’ campaign in the area.


Objective: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is an autoimmune and multifactorial disorder.
Subsequent analysis on human leukocyte antigen ( HLA) region shows that HLA-DRB1 and
-DQB1 genes have the strongest association with T1D. In this study, for the first time, we
investigated the influence of gender on the HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 association with type 1
diabetes mellitus in Iranian patients in order to determine gender dependent HLA heterogeneity
in Iranian T1D
patients.
Materials and Methods: In this case control study, the HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 typing
were performed on 105 Iranian T1D patients and 100 healthy controls. The data were
evaluated by using Fisher exact test.
Results: Our results indicate that DRB1*04:01, DQB1*03:02 alleles and DRB1*04:01DQB1*03:02

haplotype were significantly more frequent in male T1D patients than females.
Also, DRB1*03:01,
DRB1*15:01,
DQB1*06:01
alleles, DQB1*03:01/05:01
genotype,

DRB1*03:01-DQB1*02:01
and
DRB1*15:01-DQB1*06:01

haplotypes were significantly
higher in female T1D group than males. Furthermore, our results showed that DRB1*04:01
and DQB1*03:02 alleles were significantly more frequent in male T1D patients 1-5 years
old at onset than females with similar condition. The DRB1*03:01 allele and DRB1*03:01DQB1*02:01
haplotype
were
significantly
higher
in
female
T1D
patients
6-10
years
old
at
onset
than males with
similar condition.
The
DRB1*15:01
allele
and
DRB1*15:01-DQB1*06:01

haplotype
were
significantly
more
frequent
in
female
T1D
patients
16-20
years
old
at
onset

than
males with similar condition. 
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that gender has a significant influence on the distribution
of HLA-DR
and -DQ
alleles,
genotypes
and
haplotypes.
Also,
distribution of
the HLADRB1
and -DQB1
alleles, genotypes
and haplotypes vary
based on the gender of
T1D

patients
in different
age at onset.

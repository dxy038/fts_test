The Ethernet network is more and more used to interconnect industrial devices. The objective of this paper is to study the performances of such a network to support real-time communications. For this, we first propose a general representation to model a switched Ethernet network by using a sequence of elementary components such as buffers, multiplexers, etc. Secondly, we aggregate the individual temporal properties of each component given in the Cruz survey to obtain a global formula enabling calculation of the maximum end-to-end delay for any industrial communication scenarios.

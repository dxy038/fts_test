Over a 5-year period, 75 patients with locally advanced breast cancer presenting to the Edinburgh Breast Unit were managed with a policy of infusional primary chemotherapy. For 65 patients, the regimens comprised infusional 5 fluorouracil with anthracycline and/or either cyclophosphamide or cisplatinum (AcF, CAF or ECF) whilst 10 older patients had CMF-inf. The overall activity and tolerability for the regimens was good with a 76% objective response rate including 15% clinical complete responses. Surgery was possible in 64% and pathological complete responses confirmed in 7 (9.3%). Median disease free survival (DFS) is 5.23 years. Factors predicting for DFS or Overall Survival (OS) were assessed in this small group and ER positive patients did better than ER negative although there was surprisingly no negative DFS or OS association with inflammatory disease or advancing age. We found a paradoxical interaction with use of post-chemotherapy tamoxifen which was significantly associated with poorer DFS and OS overall and in the ER negative subgroups.

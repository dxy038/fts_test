One main purpose of artificial psychology (AP) is to imitate human psychology with computer, and to provide some subjective evaluations for the objective things. This kind of research is still at the beginning. In this paper, we try to present a AP mathematics model which is applied to a computer system designed for fashion fitting. In the course of the model construction, we unite quantification theory with fuzzy theory and factor analysis so that a qualitative adjective can be transferred to a quantitative variable. In this case, a model of human psychology is developed. On that basis, we compile a friendly human-machine interface with Visual BASIC language and access database to build a computer system for human nature fashion fitting

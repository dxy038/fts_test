It is foreseen that the next generation of cellular network would integrate the relaying or multihop scheme. In a multihop cellular architecture, the users are not only able to communicate directly to the base station (BS) but can also use some relay stations to relay their data to the BS. In such architecture, it may happen that a relayed user handover to another relay station during its communication: this process is called the inter-relay handoff. The main objective of this paper is to study how frequent the inter-relay handoff occurs and its impact on the relaying system performance. For this, different algorithms to decide when a user should inter-relay handover are proposed and tested through a dynamic system level simulator. We compare the capacity gain for the different algorithm with the conventional cellular networks using the UMTS FDD mode. The result showed that with an appropriate inter-relay handoff scheme, the uplink capacity gain of 35% is readily achievable.

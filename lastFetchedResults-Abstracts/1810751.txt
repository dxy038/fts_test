Background
AT-6 antigen from Mycobacterium tuberculosis evokes a protective immune response in murine models and is widely recognized by tuberculosis patients (TB) and healthy household contacts (HHC). However, little is known about human immune response to this antigen in populations from areas of high endemicity. This study aimed to determine the capacity of T-cells from a group of TB patients and HHC for cell proliferation and production of cytokines type Th1 or Th2 (IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-γ) and to identify total IgG reactivity to the recombinant protein rESAT-6 and five overlapping synthetic peptides as well as to r38 kDa and two peptides.
s
s from nine TB patients and nine HHC were stimulated with rESAT-6 and five overlapping synthetic peptides, previously selected from a set of 21 peptides and each of 16 amino acids in length (P1, P4, P6, P8, and P20). Similar experiments were carried out with r38 kDa and two peptides of 20 amino acids in length (38G and 38K). Cytokines in supernatants and total IgG from serum were determined by ELISA.
s
ation index (SI) was highest in HHC to rESAT-6 and peptides P1, P8, and P20. Differences in response to 38 kDa and 38G peptide between TB patients and HHC were not demonstrated. Cytokines from T-cell cultures were tested with a resulting SI = 3.0. IFN-γ was produced predominantly in HHC to rESAT-6, P8, and P20, while in TB patients production of IL-10 was detected in relation to r38 kDa. IL-4 was detected in minimal amounts in both groups. IgG from TB patients was predominantly recognized in connection with rESAT-6 and the P4 peptide, with an important response against r38 kDa detected in HHC.
sions
 recognition by HHC could indicate that these responses represent possible early-stage infections.

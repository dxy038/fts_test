Since Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning for multimedia traffic in integrated Wireless and Mobile Networks is becoming increasingly important objective, in this paper we are introducing a novel concept of adaptive QoS cross-layer framework. The Adaptive QoS framework is proven via novel simulation results in integrated environment with UMTS and IEEE 802.11 networks. The aim of our novel framework is presenting new module that shall provide the best QoS and lower cost for a given service using one or more wireless technologies in a given time. The analysis of simulation results has shown superior performances with high level of QoS provisioning in a variety of network conditions. The performance of Adaptive QoS algorithm is evaluated using ns-miracle augmented with our dual-mode Mobile Equipments (MEs) and with enhanced statistical analysis.

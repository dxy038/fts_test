Among the many-objective optimization problems, there exists a kind of problem with redundant objectives, it is possible to design effective algorithms by removing the redundant objectives and keeping the non-redundant objectives so that the original problem becomes the one with much fewer objectives. In this paper, a new non-redundant objective set generation algorithm is proposed. To do so, first, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based decomposition is adopted to generate a small number of representative non-dominated solutions widely distributed on the Pareto front. Then, the conflicting objective pairs are identified through these non-dominated solutions, and the non-redundant objective set is determined by these pairs. Finally, the experiments are conducted on a set of benchmark test problems and the results indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

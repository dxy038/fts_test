A wide-range input-output bidirectional dc-dc power converter suitable for power rating of several kilowatts is introduced in this paper. This converter provides a high frequency operation with zero voltage switching (ZVS) for all the switches, with no auxiliary circuitry or increased component stresses. The transformer leakage inductance is used as the resonant inductor. The proposed control algorithm includes a combination of variable frequency control and pulse width modulation methods. The control provides the minimum current for any active power level, with no compromise in zero voltage switching, through precise selection of the control variables of frequency, phase shift and duty cycle. The experimental results verify the feasibility and performance of the proposed topology.

The objective of this study was to investigate factors associated with surface iridescence in fresh beef. Eight muscles were evaluated for occurrence of surface iridescence: Biceps femoris (BF), Gluteus medius (GM), Longissimus lumborum (LD), Psoas major (PM), Rectus femoris (RF), Semimembranosus (SM), Semitendinosus (ST), and Tensor fasciae latae (TF). Incidence of surface iridescence was 91% for ST, 34% for SM, 27% for LD, 20% for GM, 12% for RF, 9% for BF, 8% for TF, and 6% for PM (P&lt;0.05). Factors associated with surface iridescence in the ST were further examined because iridescence was observed to a much higher degree in the ST as compared with other muscles evaluated. Greater ST surface iridescence was associated with larger ribeye areas, more youthful lean maturity scores, higher L∗, a∗ and b∗ colorimeter values, lower ultimate pH values, and faster cooking (P&lt;0.05).

The design and experimental characterisation of a short-stroke, bidirectional linear actuator capable of operating in ambient temperatures up to 800&#176;C is presented. The merits of various candidate actuator topologies and soft magnetic materials are discussed. The design and analysis of a bidirectional actuator with a nominal force rating of 300 N and a stroke of &#177;0.5 mm is described, embracing electromagnetic, thermal and mechanical aspects. Extensive experimental measurements on a prototype actuator are presented and compared with finite-element predicted performance over the full operating temperature range of the actuator

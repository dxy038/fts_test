The failure of the engineering curricula to satisfy the national and the global market´s demands has dominated the thinking of different levels of authorities in Egypt. The education system has been designed to produce ´good employees´ rather than ´good entrepreneurs´. The educators at Shoubra Faculty of Engineering, SFE, realized the drop in the capabilities of the students regarding business aspects and cross platforms. SFE arranged two 3- full day programs addressed to last year students (year 4) in all engineering departments. The objective of the program was to prepare students to possess entrepreneurial skills in order to plan, run a small business and serve the community, thus complementing the academic education. This paper presents the program and its evaluation. It also proposes an alternative in implementing cross-disciplinary courses for engineering education based on restructuring the curricula.

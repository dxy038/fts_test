As a new form of software, the technique and standard of web services are grown to perfection day by day. However, application of web services is restricted by complex factors such as lack of user interface and effective QoS guarantee. As a result, it hasnÂ´t been used widely, which makes it necessary to provide an excellent platform to share web services resource the common people. Furthermore, since many available web services provide overlapping or identical function, considering different Quality of Service (QoS), an effective evaluation algorithm is urgently needed to screen out the desirable one. This paper describes implementation of a service-oriented portal platform. It aims at making the public able to set up a personalized portal page, which is composed of a set of web services application. And all the services are published in the form of portlet. Furthermore, our platform is supported by an autonomously developed service coordination bus. It is equipped with an effective and objective QoS evaluation model based on Bayesian network, and enables system to coordinate the dynamical execution of services.

This paper presents a distributed energy storage device (DESD) based on a novel isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter with 650V GaN transistors. The device integrates a low-voltage (13.2V) Li-ion battery pack, an embedded bidirectional DC-DC converter and wireless communication system. The three parts are packaged together, thus it can be directly connected to high-voltage (380V) DC grid, enabling a modular approach for battery energy storage systems. Two 650V enhancement mode GaN transistors are used at the high voltage side. Compared with Si device, three improvements can be achieved in the application: expanding the operation range to light load, reducing switching loss and EMI, increasing the total efficiency of charging and discharging operation. The power stage design as well as a loss analysis of GaN is based on a steady state analysis and PSpice simulation. A 400V to 12V DC, 1kW converter for 1kWh DESD prototype is designed, fabricated, and tested. Experimental results verify the validity of the proposed DESD and the performance improved by using GaN transistors.

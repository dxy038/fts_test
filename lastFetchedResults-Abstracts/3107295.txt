The main objective of this paper is to present and evaluate a method to detect moving targets in Ultra Wideband (UWB) low frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Moving target detection at low radar frequencies is associated with long integration time and has to handle azimuth focusing for reliable detection. The examined method tests different hypotheses on relative speeds in the area of interest. The optimum step size between the hypotheses is found from a point target approximation. Experimental results show that the ability to detect moving targets increases significantly. In this study, the improvement of the Signal-to-Clutter Noise Ratio (SCNR) is up to approximately 20dB using a single antenna. The focusing method allows initial estimates in speed of moving targets. The SAR data, which is used in our experiments, was collected by the airborne UWB low frequency CARABAS-II system.

We are developing a course on technology and the political process to be offered jointly by the political science and computer science programs at Western Carolina University. The course objective is to understand how the political process has changed as a result of the Internet, the ubiquity of personal computers, and the advent of high performance computing. Students will gain an understanding of how computing technology is applied in a variety of political and government arenas. Course content will include class discussions, collaborative learning approaches, service-learning opportunities, and a research project. We believe that every college graduate should have a practical understanding of both technology and politics and that combining these two areas into a single course effectively introduces undergraduates to both disciplines.

The impact of voltage harmonics on a power system can be minimized by using active filters to inject distortion-canceling currents. However, a network objective function must be specified before the optimum filter injection currents can be determined. The authors illustrate the application of a distortion-minimizing procedure with each of the following four network correction strategies, total harmonic voltage distortion, telephone influence factor, motor load-loss function, and single-bus sine wave correction. It is also pointed out that, as with any active device, care must be taken when sitting and controlling an APLC (active power line conditioner) to ensure maximum improvement in network distortion. If a network approach is not used, a poorly located APLC could have an overall negative impact

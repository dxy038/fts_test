Jajarm bauxite mine is the greatest bauxite deposit in Iran. A determined reserve of bauxite in this deposit is about 160 million tones. This mine is located on 16 Km of Northeast Jajarm city, in Khorasan-e-Shomali Province of Iran. The stability problems in 66 meters height of dolomite wall cause to starting slope stability on this wall. After practical classifications and using limit equilibrium software, circular slide failure is determined. In this paper, we find the critical circular sliding surface, by using genetic algorithm. The objective function for genetic algorithm is simplified bishop method. Results show that instantaneous failure is happened, if serious modification of slope doesn't apply.

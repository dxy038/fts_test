The paper is written mainly based on developing a robust and reliable robotic arm and to develop a program to help the robot to improve system performance where a high degree of environment uncertainty exists such as avoiding obstacles along its moving path during milling of bone. An intelligent logic iteration model (fuzzy logic) is deployed onto a standard industrial robot with six-degree-of-freedom serial kinematics for milling of the bone in orthopaedic surgery. The objective is to enhance the surgeonÂ´s precision movements and dexterity. The system was tested in a series of experiments that measured its ability to track the desired path on an in vitro setup. The reliability and robustness of the method were also evidently shown from the experimental results. This development of this milling robotic system shows that the proposed algorithm (fuzzy) could be implemented for bone milling purposes to improve its accuracy

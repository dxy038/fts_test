This paper presents a CAD framework that allows exploration of high-level designs within a multi-objective framework. The designs are manipulated with high-level transformations in a sequence determined by an external stochastic process. The effectiveness of the framework is evaluated with DSP systems, illustrating the ability for pointing the designer to a set of designs with good power-area tradeoffs

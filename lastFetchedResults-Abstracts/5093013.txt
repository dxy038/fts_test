An immediate need exists for a portable diagnostic device for the assessment of cortical function, and diagnosis of mTBI. This paper presents initial results using a vibrotactile acuity test for the objective and quantitative diagnosis of acute mTBI suspects. mTBI is hypothesized to involve derangement or damage to the underlying cortical network. In particular, fundamental building blocks of the cortex are changed in such a way as to limit the functional connectivity within and between cortical columns. Our approach is based on sensory illusions that are configured as a test of neural connectivity. Pilot clinical test data showed differences between a small healthy normal group and a concussion group using a sports concussion model.

This paper explores snow bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) properties over some snow covered regions using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) surface reflectance products. In the visible and near infrared (NIR) region, MODIS and MISR surface bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) over snow are accumulated to extract snow BRDF properties. Five surface BRDF models are concerned to simulate snow surface reflectance shape. All the models capture the distribution of snow BRFs with limit of accuracy. The simulated BRFs from several models have similar distribution trend and different details. The BRDF properties discussed can be used as background in the snow BRDF retrieval from spaceborne measurements.

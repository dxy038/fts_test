Since trickle irrigation system efficiency depends on the physical and hydraulic
characteristics of the drippers and specially water application uniformity, therefore
evaluation of drippers as the most important section of a trickle irrigation system will
be very important to have an efficient irrigation system. The objective of present
study was to measure discharge rates of three different kinds of emitters (including
Siplast, Inline168 and Katif8) at four different pressure levels of 50, 100, 150 and
200 kPa to assess the hydraulic performances, calculating the coefficient of
manufacturing variation, water distribution uniformity of emitters and emitter
discharge exponent, in order to establish the emitter´s flow rate sensitivity to pressure
and comparing the results to the manufactures´ specifications. Based on results,
Katif8 was classified as pressure compensating and inline168 and Siplast were
classified as non-compensating pressure as expected. All three emitters distributed
water uniformly at all operating pressures. Results indicated that designing trickle
irrigation specially relationship between discharge and pressure should be based on
reliable test data, not on manufacturer´s supplied data.

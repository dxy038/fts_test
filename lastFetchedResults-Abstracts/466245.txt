Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the perioperative morbidity associated with abdominal myomectomy with that of hysterectomy. Study Design: This was a retrospective cohort study of 394 women at an academic medical center. Main outcome measured was perioperative morbidity, with the following secondary outcomes: febrile morbidity, hemorrhage, unintended major surgical procedures, life-threatening events, and rehospitalization. Results: Morbidity was associated with myomectomy and hysterectomy in 39% and 40% of cases, respectively. The crude odds ratio for morbidity of myomectomy with respect to hysterectomy was 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.63-1.40). Women who underwent myomectomy were significantly younger, weighed less, and had a smaller preoperative uterine size. In a multivariable analysis that accounted for these differences the odds ratio increased to 1.46 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-2.77) but still was not statistically elevated. The study had >90% power to detect a clinically relevant 15% absolute difference in overall morbidity between the 2 groups. Conclusion: No clinically significant difference in perioperative morbidity between myomectomy and hysterectomy was detected. Myomectomy should be considered a safe alternative to hysterectomy.

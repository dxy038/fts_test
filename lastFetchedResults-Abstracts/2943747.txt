It is well known that students of electrical engineering tend to avoid technical electives involving electromagnetics, due to the inherent analytical content of these courses. In an effort to combine theory and numerical modeling involving analysis and design, an Instructional Enhancement Grant was obtained from the University of Nevada Reno. The objective of this grant was to develop a series of computational exercises in antenna analysis and design which could be used in conjunction with the senior level electromagnetics technical elective as well as with a graduate level course in antenna theory and design. These exercises have been successfully developed and are being used with both these courses. They are assigned to the students at appropriate times during the semester when the theory underlying the topic of a particular computational exercise is being discussed in class. This gives the student an immediate opportunity to compare theory with the results of numerical modeling. The exercises utilize existing antenna analysis and design software for personal computers to which students have easy access either at home or at the university. They are asked to write a written report on each exercise. Student evaluations from these courses indicate that these computational exercises give them a better perspective on an otherwise abstract subject. This paper discusses the exercises and how they are implemented in the two classes

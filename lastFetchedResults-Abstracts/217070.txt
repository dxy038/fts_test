PURPOSE: To investigate the correlation between retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness determined by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual field (VF) parameters in patients with optic atrophy. METHODS: This study was performed on 35 eyes of 28 patients with optic atrophy. RNFL thickness was measured by OCT (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and automated perimetry was performed using the Humphrey Field Analyzer (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The correlation between RNFL thickness and VF parameters was evaluated. RESULTS: Mean global RNFL thickness was 44.9±27.5 µm which was significantly correlated with mean deviation score on automated perimetry (r=0.493, P=0.003); however, no significant correlation was observed between visual field pattern standard deviation and the corresponding quadrantic RNFL thickness. In a similar manner, no significant association was found between visual acuity and RNLF thickness. CONCLUSION: Mean global RNFL thickness as determined by OCT seems to be correlated with VF defect depth as represented by the mean deviation score on Humphrey VF testing. OCT may be used as an objective diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with optic atrophy.

A multi-channel audio and video signal transmission system constructed by using optical fiber cables as signal transmission media is described. With this system up to four audio signal and up to four video signal channels can be used with a bidirectional operation-aid voice channel. The PFM (pulse frequency modulation) scheme was used to modulate the audio and video signals. The SNR of the video signal was above 55 dB. The differential gain and differential phase were under 3% and 3&#176;, respectively. The SNR of the audio signal was 65 dB and the distortion factor was under 0.3%. The practical use of this system at a surgical center is described

Since the implementation of the national health insurance (NHI) program, the Taiwanese health care industry has become increasingly competitive. The objective of this paper is to study the flow of endoscope examinations in order to improve service quality. Waiting times could be reduced through a more efficient utilization of available equipment. This study proposes a model to analyze the relationship between the availability of equipment and the waiting time for examinees. The model is implemented using empirical data from a health examination center in Taiwan. The proposed model can also be applied to more generalized cases.

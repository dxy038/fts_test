In intermittent rivers, characterised by a specific hydrological behaviour, sediment–water column interactions may influence water quality during low flows. The main objective of this work was to assess the extent of anthropogenic pollution (organotins, faecal indicator bacteria and nutrients) in the river sediment of an intermittent river and its impact on the downstream water bodies: The Vène River, main tributary of the Thau lagoon. We first investigated anthropogenic pollution from water and sediment samples collected in situ along the river course (1.5 km); then, during laboratory experiments, we assessed the survival of faecal bacteria and quantified the degradation rates of organotins on the same sediments.

sults indicate the presence of anthropogenic pollution all along the study reach. The waste water treatment plant effluent is a direct pollution input source for anthropogenic pollution. The sediment data points to an urban drainage ditch as a secondary point pollution source while the organotins data highlights the presence of other diffuse sources, specific to this substance. The results of the laboratory experiments show that both faecal bacteria and organotins may persist in the river sediments for up to two months in summer and even longer in winter. This indicates that sediments may, under favourable conditions, become important pollutant stores which may later be released and transported to the Thau lagoon during floods.

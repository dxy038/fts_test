This article gives an overview of power generation with gas turbine and combined heat and power (CHP) systems. It also presents the European Union strategy for developing gas turbines and CHP systems. Ways to improve the performance of the several types of gas turbine cycle will be a major objective in the coming years. The targets are combined cycle efficiencies above 60% industrial gas turbine system efficiencies of at least 50% and small gas turbines efficiencies above 35% and designs for the use of fuels with less than 25% heating value of that of natural gas. The main CHP targets are the reduction of the overall costs and the development of above 40 kW biomass-fired systems.

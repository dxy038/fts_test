The extent of effectiveness of real-time communication within BIM environment is somehow restrained due to the limited sense of immersion into virtual environments. The objective of this paper highlights the need for a structured methodology of fully integrating Augmented Reality (AR) technology in BIM. Based on the generic review of BIM in construction, this paper forms the rationales for the onsite information system for construction site activities, and then formulates the methods of configuring BIM + AR prototypes. It is demonstrated that, extended to the site via the “hand” of AR, the BIM solution can address more real problems, such as low productivity in retrieving information, tendency of committing error in assembly, and low efficiency of communication and problem solving.

To study the multi-objective optimization, the concept of related step length is proposed firstly. Based on integral global optimization theory, a hierarchical sequence deviation integral algorithm is given and its optimality condition is proved in this work. Algorithm is implemented by a properly designed Monte-carlo simulation. Numerical tests are given to show the feasibility of the method.

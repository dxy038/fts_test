This work comprises an extension of a backward adaptive quantizer which is employed together with a robust lattice predictor in an ADPCM coding scheme. Predictors of the ADPCM audio coding schemes are often considered as the part most sensitive to transmission errors. Nevertheless, a single transmission error causes a short destabilization of the adaptive quantizer at the decoder side. Therefore, this destabilization boosts the deviation of the prediction filter at the decoder from the encoder side. Desired damping of the quantizer shortens synchronization periods. However, damping leads to degradation of the quantizer´s adaptation properties and consequently to a decrease in audio quality. We show that the transmission of the quantizer´s envelope to the decoder in short intervals and in combination with envelope error detector reduces the impairment of the reconstructed audio signal in noisy transmissions. An objective audio quality evaluation confirms significant quality improvement at BER higher than 10<sup>-4</sup> and no quality degradation if an ideal channel is employed.

Human neutrophils differ from other cells by containing high amount of IκBα in the nucleus, and this increased nuclear IκBα accumulation is associated with the inhibition of NFκB activity and increased apoptosis. However, the mechanisms regulating NFκB activation and IκBα degradation in human neutrophils are little understood. The objective of this study was to provide a further insight into the mechanisms regulating NFκB activity and IκBα degradation in human neutrophils. We show that okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, induces sustained activation of NFκB and degradation of the nuclear IκBα, and increases interleukin-8 expression in the neutrophils. Furthermore, inhibitors of protein kinase C-δ (PKCδ) and IκB kinase (IKK) inhibit the OA-induced activation of NFκB. Collectively, our results indicate that in human neutrophils, the sustained activation of NFκB is regulated by a continuous phosphorylation and degradation of the nuclear IκBα.

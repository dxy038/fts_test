This paper reports the results of an experimental study that investigated the feasibility of using fine and coarse recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) with slag or fly ash to produce Controlled Low-Strength Materials (CLSM). The main objective was to produce CLSM using only recycled and by-product materials without the need to add Portland cement. In addition to the hydraulic activity of slag and high-calcium fly ash (HCFA), their pozzolanic reaction was activated by the alkalis and calcium hydroxide present in the residual paste of the RCA. Preliminary tests showed mixtures with slag to have 7-day compressive strengths 70% higher than mixtures with fly ash.

Two types of CLSM with slag were investigated in further detail: one with fine and the other with fine/coarse RCA. The results showed that the developed CLSMs are suitable for a wide range of applications particularly those requiring structural support and fast hardening.

Automatic Web service Composition (AWSC) is still a big challenge in service oriented architecture (SOA), since there is no platform where is possible to implement and test algorithms for AWSC. This paper presents the Automatic Web service composition Architecture (AWSCA), an architecture in which is possible to implement and run the algorithms for AWSC in an environment proposed for a fair comparison. To reach this objective is proposed a prototype that is able to deploy and execute Automated Composite Web services. This prototype consists of a tool which receives as input a graph with the description of the composite Web service flow, performs and controls the execution and interaction between the services. This approach makes possible to evaluate the performance and to compare the algorithms for AWSC in order to identify which one is a better choice for certain scenarios.

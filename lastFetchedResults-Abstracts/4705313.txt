The EIT reconstruction problem can be solved as an optimization problem where the divergence between a simulated impedance domain and the observed one is minimized. This optimization problem can be solved by a combination of Simulated Annealing (SA) for optimization and Finite Element Method (FEM) for simulation of the impedance domain. This combination has usually a very high computational cost, since SA requires an elevated number of objective function evaluations and those, obtained through FEM, are often expansive enough to make the whole process inviable. In here it is presented a new approach for EIT image reconstructions using SA and partial evaluations of objective functions based on overdetermined linear systems. This new reconstruction approach is evaluated with experimental data and compared with previous approaches.

Introduction: Hemodialysis is the most common replacement therapy for patients with ESRD in Iran. By
effective and adequate Hemodialysis can improve life quality and reduced complications of renal failure,
inadequate dialysis may lead to some irreversible consequences of uremia. Urea reducation ratio and !5!.- are
v
methods for assessing of dialysis adequacy. Regular assessing of dialysis adequacy is necessary in a
hemodialysis center is necessary but this procedure is not performed regularly in some centers.
Objective: evaluation of hemodialysis adequacy on patients undergoing Hemodialysis in Rasht.
Materials and Methods: This is a eross sectional deseriptive study. The number of cases were 139, who were
selected base on their age, sex, time of dialysis onset. duration of each session and frequency of dialysis in week.
They were tested twice, first; before starting the dialysis for BUN, Cr, Alb, Ca. P and Hb, then after ending, for
BUN, Cr. The!'!.- was calculated by Daugirdas [[ formula. Data were analyzed with SPPS VerlO statistical
v
software and statistieal test including Z21 t-test and logistic regression.
Results: In this study, the mean age of patients was 54.9± 14.7 and 58/3% of patients were male. 69.8% of
cases were being dialyzed 3 times a weak and mean duration ofeach session was 3.78±0.35.hr.
73.9% of patients had.!'!..!- ratio greater than 1.2 and also 72.7% had URR greater than 65%.Dialysis in adequacy
v
had significant relation- ship to hypoalbuminemia (p<O.OOI)
Conclusion: Dialysis adequacy was lower in eomparison with US studies but it is better than published papers in
lran, for example Kashan and Hamedan, next studies is necessary to improve dialysis adequacy and have better
achievement.

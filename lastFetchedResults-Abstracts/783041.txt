Objective Despite the high rate of migration
from low- and middle-income countries to high-income
countries, there is still a lack of comprehensive studies
of gender-specific differences in psychological distress
in a diverse group of immigrants.We compared psychological
distress between male and female immigrants
from low- and middle-income countries living in Oslo,
and identified factors associated with distress for men
and women,separately.Method A cross-sectional survey
with self-administered questionnaires was conducted
among 1536 immigrants from low- and middle-income
countries living in Oslo. The Hopkins Symptom Checklist
(HSCL-10) was used to measure psychological distress.
Data on their sociodemographic characteristics,
negative and traumatic life events, and social integration
and possible discrimination in the Norwegian society
were also collected.Results One-fourth of the study population
was found to be psychologically distressed,with
almost equal levels among men and women. Lack of
salaried job and recent negative life events were independently
associated with psychological distress for
both genders. Furthermore, experience of denial of job
and past traumatic experiences were other associated
negative factors among men, while visits made by Norwegians
appeared as a protective factor against distress
among men. Older age, Middle East background, living
without a partner, and experiencing denial of housing
were other associated negative factors among women.
Conclusion Our findings show that, except for adverse
living conditions, there are gender differences with regard
to factors associated with psychological distress
among immigrants living in Oslo.Such gender issues are
relevant for assisting immigrants in the integration
process as well as for future research in migration and
health.

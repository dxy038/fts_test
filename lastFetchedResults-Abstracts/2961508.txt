This paper describes a model which creates linguistic expressions about some objects drawn in a picture. Fuzzy sets are employed in the inference part to deal with fuzziness inherent in linguistic expressions. The model infers the subjective matter on the object, e.g., the relation between objects, from the objective picture information, e.g., the spatial distance. Some simulation results show that this model can create the appropriate linguistic expressions about images and the effectiveness of this model is confirmed

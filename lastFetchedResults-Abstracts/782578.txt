The objective of the present study was to determine the chemical composition as well as
the physicochemical and sensory properties of meat (M. longissimus dorsi) from roe deer
(Capreolus capreolus L.) does (n = 26) and bucks (n = 16) hunter-harvested in the forests of
north-eastern Poland. It was found that meat from female roe deer, in comparison with
meat from male roe deer, had higher (P ≤ 0.01) content of dry matter, total protein and fat.
The water extracts of meat from does also contained more (P ≤ 0.01) total nitrogen and
non-protein nitrogen. An analysis of the fatty acid profile revealed that the muscles of male
roe deer had higher (P ≤ 0.01) concentrations of the following fatty acids: C14:0, C15:0,
C18:0, C20:0, C18:2 and C18:3, and higher (P ≤ 0.01) total content of polyunsaturated fatty
acids, while the muscles of female roe deer had higher (P ≤ 0.01) levels of C17:1 and C18:1
and higher (P ≤ 0.01) total content of monounsaturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Meat
from does was also characterized by higher (P ≤ 0.01) drip loss and, as shown by a sensory
evaluation, higher (P ≤ 0.01) juiciness. No significant differences were found between males
and females with respect to the average scores for meat tenderness, but meat from bucks
was characterized by a higher (P ≤ 0.05) value of shear force.

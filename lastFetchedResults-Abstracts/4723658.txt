Ultrasound provides a promising non-invasive, safe, objective means of monitoring and quantifying bone healing. In this paper, the relationship between the ultrasound image intensity and the acoustic impedance was exploited to develop a quantitative measure towards assessment and monitoring of the bone healing process. Information theoretic criterion (KLD) was used to quantify the degree of bone healing using the intensity histogram of the callus region obtained from B-Mode ultrasound. Results from a pilot experimental study, show that the proposed method is capable of accurately quantifying the degree of bone healing.

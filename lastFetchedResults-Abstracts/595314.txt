Objective: To enlist the frequency of indications and complications of flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy in a tertiary care hospital. Material and Methods: A total of 100 patients admitted to Chest and medical units of Lady Reading hospital Peshawar who needed bronchoscopy were selected irrespective of their age, sex, occupation. All patients in whom bronchoscopy was indicated were included in the study. After detailed clinical history with thorough physical examination and relevant investigations, Bronchoscopy was performed with Olympus fibreoptic bronchoscope. Relevant data were recorded for analysis. Results: Out of 100 patients, 64 (64%) were male, and 36 (36%) were female. Majority of patients (55%) were above 50 years of age. In 60% patients, there was radiographic abnormality on chest X-ray and C.T scan. In 25 (25%), the indication was unexplained hemoptysis and 2 (2%) patients had hoarseness. Another 13 (13%) patients were bronchoscoped to see Acid Fast Bacilli in bronchial wash. These patients were suspected to have Tuberculosis but sputum smears were reported negative on repeated examinations. Complications which occurred in these patients included Pneumothorax (1%), hemorrhage (1%), hypoxemia (4%), Atrial tachycardia (3%), bronchospasm (2%), and post-bronchoscopy fever (2%). These complications were managed accordingly and all patients recovered without any serious consequences. Conclusions: Most of the indications for Bronchoscopy in this hospital are diagnostic rather than therapeutic. Most common indications include radiographic abnormalities, hemoptysis, hoarseness and for isolation of ABF.

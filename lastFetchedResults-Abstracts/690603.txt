Numerous studies have shown that the efficacy of ultraviolet (UV) disinfection can be hindered by the presence of particles that can shield microorganisms. The main objective of this study was to determine to what extent natural particulate matter can shield indigenous spores of aerobic spore-forming bacteria (ASFB) from UV rays. The extent of the protective shielding was assessed by comparing the inactivation rates in three water fractions (untreated, dispersed and filtered on an 8 μm membrane) using a collimated beam apparatus with a low-pressure lamp emitting at 254 nm. Levels of inactivation were then related to the distribution and abundance of particles as measured by microflow imaging. Disinfection assays were completed on two source waters of different quality and particle content. A protocol was developed to break down particles and disperse aggregates (addition of 100 mg/L of Zwittergent 3–12 and blending at 8000 rpm for 4 min). Particle size distribution (PSD) analysis confirmed a statistically significant decrease in the number of particles for diameter ranges above 5 μm following the dispersion protocol and 8 μm filtration. The fluence required to reach 1-log inactivation of ASFB spores was independent of particle concentration, while that required to reach 2-log inactivation or more was correlated with the concentration of particles larger than 8 μm (R2>0.61). Results suggest that natural particulate matter can protect indigenous organisms from UV radiation in waters with elevated particle content, while source water with low particle counts may not be subject to this interference.

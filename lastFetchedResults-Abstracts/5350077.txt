We present a review on human visual system (HVS) based digital video quality metrics. Particularly, three objective video quality metrics are discussed and analyzed in detail because they represent the state-of-the-art of HVS based quality metric research and have been proposed to and verified by VQEG (Video Quality Expert Group) as the candidates of a possible ITU standard. The purpose of the paper is to provide an up-to-date knowledge of the HVS modeling, how the characteristics of the HVS have been incorporated into quality metrics, and the implementation issues of the metrics as well as the directions of future research

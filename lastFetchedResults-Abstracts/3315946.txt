The research purpose of this paper is hoping to quickly select the evidence center, which satisfies the object conclusion, from many uncertain observational evidences, effective position and rapid inference. So in the process of the first sampling, it is needed to establish the sample center. This paper establishes 4 collections of records, by using the threshold algorithm based on competition to reason and refine layer by layer, excluding the uncertainty disturbances, and find the optimal link existed in optimal state. The optimal link determines the selection center of evidence reasoning object, provides the core of evidence for subsequent optimization and achieves the objective of rapid position and accurate inference.

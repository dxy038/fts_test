The TLM (Transmission Line Matrix) method, in time domain, is extended to account for the presence of dispersive and anisotropic media in electromagnetic structures or devices. The model is thoroughly constructed by using MaxwellÂ´s equations that make it a unified general TLM formulation. Preliminary results are compared with a commercial simulator in the case of dielectric dispersive and anisotropic media and saturated ferrites, hence, validating the model. The objective is to insert a generalized permeability tensor model in the new TLM algorithm to allow the simulation of ferrite-based microwave structures such as non-reciprocal devices: circulators, isolators, phase-shifters, etc.

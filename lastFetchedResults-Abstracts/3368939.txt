The European Josephson arbitrary waveform synthesizer (JAWS) project addresses the lack of instrumentation and knowledge for accurate and traceable measurement and generation of alternating (AC) voltage with arbitrary waveforms. The objective is to develop a standard based on a JAWS, a precise instrument that links the generated voltage to the Josephson effect, which in turn relates voltage to fundamental constants and frequency. The standard aims at synthesized voltages up to 10 mV, frequencies up to 10 kHz and uncertainty smaller than 100 &#956;V/V as a first step. This paper reports on the progress in developing the key components for JAWS.

The objective of this research is to reveal the mechanisms associated with the initial formation of peoplepsilas trust in mobile banking and intention to use the service. And this research fills a research gap by focusing on online to mobile trust transfer process and the effects of previous satisfaction, which has received almost no attention. For this, we attempt to understand the effect of three antecedent factors (structural assurance, compatibility and relative advantage) on shaping a customerpsilas initial trust in mobile banking and usage intention. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of customerspsila previous satisfaction and online banking trust on the initial trust in mobile banking and its antecedents. The study tests hypotheses by using a sample of 313 college studies that have used online banking before. Results show that online trust positively influence initial trust in mobile banking and customerspsila perceived structural assurance of mobile banking. And customerspsila previous satisfactions with online banking have positive effects on initial trust, perceived relative advantages and perceived compatibility, just as proposed. Thus, online-to-mobile trust transfer process and the effects of customerspsila previous satisfaction should be considered when designing multichannel strategies and attracting customers to use mobile banking.

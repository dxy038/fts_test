In order to monitor aircraft engine performance, there is a need for a sensor which can accurately measure temperature from -50&#176;C to 600&#176;C in an aircraft environment. The objective of the development and testing of this prototype sensor system was to determine the feasibility of operating an optical sensor in such a hostile environment. In this work a photonic sensor was utilized to monitor the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) of an OV-10D aircraft engine. The sensor has successfully flown over 50 hours and proven to be immune to source fluctuations, surface deterioration of the optical element (located inside the sensor head), and able to withstand and operate in normal flight conditions as well as sustained severe flight conditions with forces exceeding 4 gÂ´s. Potential commercial uses for this sensor include monitoring temperature for aeropropulsion system control, military vehicle and naval engine control, conventional and nuclear power plant monitoring, and industrial plant monitoring

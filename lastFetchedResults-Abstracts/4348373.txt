This paper presents an approach based upon state feedback to coordinate distributed energy resources (DER) across unbalanced phases of a power distribution system. The objective is to control the resources such that characteristics are balanced among phases making a more desirable load from the perspective of the transmission system. Example results are provided for a distribution system with inverter-connected generation. Active power setpoints are taken as the control variables for distributed generation (DG) independently connected to the three phases. State feedback control based upon linearization of a differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model is used to control (balance) demand on the three phases. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

A new strategy for monitoring and establishing water quality criteria has been devised and employed that allows for the objective discrimination of water quality conditions. It is based on statistical relationships, as found in the environment, and can be used to accept or reject environmental conditions created by manmade influences. This criteria and methodology has been successfully employed in Hawaii and American Samoa and is currently used in the private sector. A new application of this strategy is proposed for monitoring coastline construction.

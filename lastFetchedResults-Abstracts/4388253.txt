This paper presents an original method to realize digital loop control for a radio communication V/UHF (Very/Ultra High Frequency) transmitter. The objective is to propose a SDR (Software Defined Radio) solution with a correction of the PA (Power Amplifier) nonlinearities. The proposed architecture is full digital solution except the up-converter for specific reasons. The used numeric core is a Virtex6 FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). The down-converter and loop filters are integrated in the digital part. Measurements show improvement of 5% of the EVM (Error Vector Magnitude) and more than 20 dB for the ACPR (Adjacent Channel Power Ratio) compared to the open loop. The overall delay system is about 1.4 &#956;s and the loop gain is 20.4 dB.

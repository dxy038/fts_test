The objective of this paper is to establish general guidelines on the considerations and needs in the development of effective restoration plans for electric utilities serving large metropolitan areas. Power system performance requirements to enhance system reliability and adequacy concerns are proposed to minimize the time it takes to bring a power system into a viable post-restorative operating state. Issues such as use of system resources and network topology, equipment unavailability, electric stiffness of supply points, self-excitation assessment in areas of the system exhibiting large charging currents, and the development of a restoration plan that minimizes disruption and loss of assets in an emergency operating state are addressed.

This paper describes the results of an ongoing study on artificial dielectric lenses supported by the European Space Agency. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility and potential for space applications of planar non-homogeneous lens antennas, considering the electrical, mechanical/thermal and materials/manufacturing aspects involved.

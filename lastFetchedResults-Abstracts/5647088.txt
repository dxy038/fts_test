The specific objective of this paper is to develop direct digital control strategies for an ammonia reactor using quadratic regulator theory and compare the performance of the resultant control system with that under conventional PID regulators. The controller design studies are based on a ninth order state-space model obtained from the exact nonlinear distributed model using linearization and lumping approximations. The evaluation of these controllers with reference to their disturbance rejection capabilities and transient response characteristics, is carried out using hybrid computer simulation.

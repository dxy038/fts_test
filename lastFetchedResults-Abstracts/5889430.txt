The challenge of integrating renewable energies in medium voltage grids has been the subject of a number of researches and various discussions. The rationale behind this is to establish rules giving to customers the right to debit their excess energy in the network, especially, those with high potential of solar power production. However, the use of biomass energy in the national distribution network has been established successfully in a medium voltage feeder in the Oujda region in Morocco. Another one will see the light in the Fez region in the same country. In this study, we will develop an active management algorithm to predict the need in terms of the power to generate by a transformer HV/MV for a medium voltage feeder. This feeder will contain a biomass source, a photovoltaic installation and a storage system. This will allow us to manage the bidirectional energy flow without influencing the save behavior of the grid. Likewise, help us define the new peak of the feeder and economize or delay future investments.

We find a low-complicity and accurate model to solve the problem of optimizing MAC-layer transmission of real-time video over wireless local area networks (WLANs) using cross-layer techniques. The objective in this problem is to obtain the optimal MAC retry limit in order to minimize the total packet loss rate. First, the accuracy of Fluid and M/M/1/K analytical models is examined. Then we derive a closed-form expression for service time in WLAN MAC transmission, and will use this in mathematical formulation of our optimization problem based on M/G/1 model. Subsequently we introduce an approximate and simple formula for MAC-layer service time, which leads to the M/M/1 model. Compared with M/G/1, we particularly show that our M/M/1-based model provides a low-complexity and yet quite accurate means for analyzing MAC transmission process in WLAN. Using our M/M/1 model-based analysis, we derive closed-form formulas for the packet overflow drop rate and optimum retry-limit. These closed-form expressions can be effectively invoked for analyzing adaptive retry-limit algorithms. Simulation results (network simulator-2) will verify the accuracy of our analytical models.

This paper presents a GA for service restoration in electric power distribution systems. The aim of the service restoration is an emergency control in distribution system to restore out-of service areas as soon as possible when a fault or overload occurs in distribution system. The service restoration problem is formulated as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. This paper develops GA for the service restoration problem with a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on service restoration for KoreaÂ´s Kangdong distribution automation system. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method for solving the problem

Groundwater monitoring began in 1985 at two geothermal facilities in the Steamboat Hills
area, Nevada. Wells representing non-thermal, thermal, and mixed waters are evaluated by
assessing temporal variations in B and Cl concentrations, water levels, and temperature. The
objective is to assess the hydrologic and geochemical connection between the fractured bedrock
geothermal reservoir and the alluvial aquifer. Results suggest that fault-controlled
groundwater flow between the geothermal system and the alluvial aquifer is the dominant
hydrologic process. Temporal trends suggest that the thermal water component in the alluvial
aquifer has increased in most areas but decreased in at least one area.#2002 CNR. Published

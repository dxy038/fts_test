Purpose
The objective of this study was to differentiate the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging appearance of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) from that of malignant PNSTs.
Materials and methods
Twenty-six patients who underwent MR imaging and had a histologic diagnosis of benign (schwannoma, n=16; neurofibroma, n=1) or malignant (n=9) PNST were retrospectively reviewed. The size, location, shape, margin, and signal intensities of the tumors on precontrast and gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging were analyzed. In each patient, the presence or absence of split fat, target, and fascicular signs was determined.
Results
The mean size of the benign PNSTs (3.4 cm, S.D.=2.5 cm) was significantly smaller than that of the malignant tumors (8.2 cm, S.D.=3.1 cm) (P<.001). Seventeen (65.4%) of the 26 tumors were spindle shaped or ovoid (12 benign and 5 malignant tumors). Contiguity with specific nerves was identified in 15 (88.2%) of the 17 benign PNSTs but in none of the malignant tumors (P<.05). Well-defined margins were noted in all 17 benign PNSTs but in only 3 (33.3%) of the 9 malignant tumors (P<.001). Five (55.6%) of the 9 malignant PNSTs but none of the benign tumors showed signal intensity change in adjacent soft tissue (P<.05). There was no significant difference in signal intensity between the benign and malignant tumors on T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and contrast-enhanced MR images. The split fat and target signs were present more frequently in the benign PNSTs than in the malignant PNSTs (P<.05).Conclusions: Benign and malignant PNSTs are often spindle shaped. Recognition of contiguity with adjacent nerves, a well-defined margin, and the presence of the split fat sign may suggest benignity. Imaging features suggestive of malignancy can be a larger size and an infiltrative margin.

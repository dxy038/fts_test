In this paper, we consider the extension of the capabilities of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVÂ´s) to operate in pairs, thus representing each pair of sonars as a bistatic sonar. We utilize principles from the emerging MIMO radar theory, considering both the sonar transmitter and the sonar receiver as systems of closely spaced antennas that transmit/receive multiple linearly independent waveforms. Our objective is to formulate a covariance matrix that allows independent direction of arrival (DOA), direction of departure (DOD), and target strength estimation with reduced complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

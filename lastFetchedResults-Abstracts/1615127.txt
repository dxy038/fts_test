The main objective of this work is to study the effect of rotating magnetic field (RMF) on the dissolution process of NaCl-cylindrical sample. The experimental investigations are provided for the explanation of the influence on the dissolution process of a solid body to surrounding its dilute solution in the experimental set-up with the RMF generator. The analysis indicated the strong influence of the localization NaCl-cylindrical sample on the enhancement of mass transfer process. The mass transfer process under the action of RMF is described by means of the dimensionless equation with the local magnetic Taylor number.

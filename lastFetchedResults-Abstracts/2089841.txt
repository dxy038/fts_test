It has been demonstrated that a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM technique gives an image resolving atomic columns. Due to the diffusion of this technique and an improvement of its resolution, a practical procedure for image simulation becomes important for a quantitative interpretation of the HAADF image. In this report a new practical scheme for a STEM image simulation is developed based on the FFT multislice algorithm. Here, a HAADF intensity due to thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) is calculated from the absorptive potential corresponding to high-angle TDS and the wave function equivalent to the propagating probe within the sample. Contrary to the commonly used Bloch wave method, a coherent bright-field intensity and a coherent HAADF intensity are also obtained straightforwardly. The HAADF image contrast calculated for GaAs is not simply proportional to Z2 as expected from the Rutherford scattering at high-angle, and the As/Ga contrast ratio depends on the specimen thickness. This suggests that the generation of the HAADF signal is appreciably affected by the coherent dynamical scattering. The developed procedure here will have a definitive advantage over the Bloch wave approach for simulating the HAADF images expected from a defect and interface or amorphous materials, and also the HAADF image obtained by using a Cs-corrected microscope. This is because the former requires a huge super cell, while the latter needs a large objective aperture including a large number of incident beam directions.

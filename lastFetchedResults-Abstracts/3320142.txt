Machine Translation pertains to translation of one natural language to other by using automated computing. The main objective is to fill the language gap between two different languages speaking people, communities or countries. In India, we have multiple and hugely diverse languages and scripts, hence scope and need of language translation is immense. In this paper, we focus on the current scenario of research in machine translation in India. We have reviewed various important Machine Translation Systems (MTS) and presented preliminary comparison of the core methodology as used by them.

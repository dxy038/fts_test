ICT have provided new paths for relationships across tourism distribution channels, leading to increases in competitiveness and efficiency in the sector, and improved business performance. Since there are no validated models in the tourism literature covering this, our objective with this research is to confirm a positive relationship between the growing use of ICT by tourism intermediaries and their business performance. To this end, a structural equations model (RE–BP Model) is estimated, using data from a survey of tourism intermediaries conducted in Spain. The estimation confirms two latent variables, one for the relationship enhancement brought about by ICT in the sector, and the other for business performance. We find a cause–effect association between the two variables, and our conclusion is that tourism intermediaries should intensify their relationships with those suppliers and tour operators whose strategies allow for improved effectiveness throughout the value chain.

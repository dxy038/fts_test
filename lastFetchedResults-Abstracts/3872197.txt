An onboard charger is responsible for charging the battery pack in a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). In this paper, a 3.3-kW two-stage battery charger design is presented for a PHEV application. The objective of the design is to achieve high efficiency, which is critical to minimize the charger size, charging time, and the amount and cost of electricity drawn from the utility. The operation of the charger power converter configuration is provided in addition to a detailed design procedure. The mechanical packaging design and key experimental results are provided to verify the suitability of the proposed charger power architecture.

Fuzzy systems have demonstrated their ability to solve different kinds of problems in various application domains. Currently, there is an increasing interest to augment fuzzy systems with learning and adaptation capabilities. Two of the most successful approaches to hybridise fuzzy systems with learning and adaptation methods have been made in the realm of soft computing. Neural fuzzy systems and genetic fuzzy systems hybridise the approximate reasoning method of fuzzy systems with the learning capabilities of neural networks and evolutionary algorithms. The objective of this paper is to provide an account of genetic fuzzy systems, with special attention to genetic fuzzy rule-based systems. After a brief introduction to models and applications of genetic fuzzy systems, the field is overviewed, new trends are identified, a critical evaluation of genetic fuzzy systems for fuzzy knowledge extraction is elaborated, and open questions that remain to be addressed in the future are raised. The paper also includes some of the key references required to quickly access implementation details of genetic fuzzy systems.

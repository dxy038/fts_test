Interoperability is the most important objective of IEC 61850. Model design and realization are critical steps to implement IEC 61850 and achieve interoperability. Based on analysis of interoperability support, a universal design method of IED model is given, and problems of bay level IED model realization are analyzed. Bay level IED is embedded system, and its information models are usually realized in the form of data structures. Several existing data structures are analyzed with the view point of interoperability. And a new data structure named as ASCI-FC-data structure is designed. Unlike other data structure, it includes FCs (functional constraints), and shows the true hierarchical structure of information model at the same time, which makes it better to support interoperability. Then data store structure making use of binary chain list is given with examples to prove the advantages of it in object locating and traversing. A method of FC filtering for ASCI-FC-data structure stored in binary chain list is also given to show the advantages of this data structure.

We study and compare TDMA, CDMA and ALOHA as well as hybrid TDMA/CDMA, ALOHA/CDMA and ALOHA/TDMA as possible candidates for the MAC protocol of the return channel in a cellular interactive TV architecture. A comparative analysis of the access characteristics between the previously mentioned MAC methods is provided on the basis of the number of users and the traffic rate involved. The nature of the multiple access techniques examined, especially for the hybrid ones, does not allow for making objective performance comparisons but rather simple and approximate ones. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are reviewed and implementation guidelines are provided for the most feasible solutions

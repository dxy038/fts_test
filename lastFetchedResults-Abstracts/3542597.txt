This electron-lens system, working in an inverse principle of multicavity-klystron operation at centimeter wavelengths, exhibits diverging lens properties. It can, therefore, be very advantageously used in tandem with the conventional electron lenses of a high-resolution electron microscope in order to correct the spherical abberation of the objective lens (particularly), which is inherently a converging lens. It would, then, be possible to substantially improve the present limitation in the resolving powers of the electron microscopes.

The objective of this research was to examine the effects of Garcinia mangostana pericarp extract on
spermatogenesis and sperm quality of mice which has been exposed by 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME). This research
used 24 male mice, which were divided into four groups: one control and three treatments with various dose of
extract. The control were exposed by 200 mg/kg/day 2-ME for five days and 0,05% carboxy methyl cellulose
for 35 days. The treatments were exposed by 200 mg/kg/day 2-ME for 5 days and various dose of extract (25,
50, and 100 mg/kg, respectively) for 35 days. The results indicated 25 and 50 mg/kg extracts could increased the
number of spermatogenic cells (spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and oval spermatid) and sperm quality (motility
and morphology) after 2-ME exposure. The sperm viability was increased after 25 mg/kg extract and decreased
when dose was added, but malondialdehyde (MDA) level was decreasing on 50 mg/kg. In 100 mg/kg dose
affects reduction on all parameters, except MDA level was increased. So, G. mangostana pericarp extract (low
dose) intake improved the spermatogenesis and sperm quality, but high dose may lower the spermatogenesis and
sperm quality of mice which have been exposed by 2-ME.

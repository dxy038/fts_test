An application of guardian maps to design a robust proportional integral (PI) controller is presented. The PI is used to control a given first order system with known nominal parameters. The guardian maps identify in the s-plane the regions where the application is stable. The objective is to select the controllerÂ´s parameters so that the closed loop poles are confined to a predetermined region in the s-plane. This region is built to ensure desired performance such as rise time, overshoot, or response time, i.e. it ensures robust performance.

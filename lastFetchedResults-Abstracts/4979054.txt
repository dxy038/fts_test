In recent years there has been great interest in the study of nonlinear lumped element transmission lines for applications in high power RF generation. Normally, the LC nonlinear line is studied using only one nonlinear element, a variable capacitor (i.e. with capacitance dependence on the voltage applied) or a saturated inductor. In particular, the objective of this paper is to focus on the prospects for applications in RF generation of a special line, called as hybrid line and less investigated up to date, in which both nonlinear elements L and C are used at the same time.

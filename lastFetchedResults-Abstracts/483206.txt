Background: Considering the pain as one of the most significant reasons for patients avoiding orthodontic treatments, the topic of pain control appears to be of prime importance for both clinicians and patients.
Objective: This study was aimed at determining the efficacy of commonly used non-steroidal antiÂ­inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in controlling pain following orthodontic procedures. Methods: This was a double-blind clinical trial performed on a total of 75 patients, randomly divided into 5 groups following the placement of their initial arch wires. The members of each group received one of the 5 different treatments (Ibuprofen 400 mg, Naproxen 250 mg, Mefenamic acid 250 mg, Aspirin 325mg, and starch as placebo). After receiving 2 doses of drugs (one hour before and six hours after bonding) the patients indicated the severity of their pain on a 100mm horizontal line (VAS) during mastication, biting, fitting on anterior and posterior teeth in different specified times. Statistical analyses were carried out based on ANOVA and t-test. Findings: The pain increased soon after the placement of the arch wire and reached its peak in 24 hours. In all cases, the least pain was reported following the administration of Ibuprofen and the most after taking placebo.
Conclusion: Although all NSAIDs were more or less effective in controlling pain, ibuprofen was found to be relatively of higher efficacy in decreasing the pain.

The sparseness and decorrelation properties of
the discrete wavelet transform have been exploited to develop
powerful denoising methods. However, most of these methods have
free parameters which have to be adjusted or estimated. In this
paper, we propose a wavelet-based denoising technique without
any free parameters; it is, in this sense, a “universal” method. Our
approach uses empirical Bayes estimation based on a Jeffreys’
noninformative prior; it is a step toward objective Bayesian
wavelet-based denoising. The result is a remarkably simple fixed
nonlinear shrinkage/thresholding rule which performs better than
other more computationally demanding methods.

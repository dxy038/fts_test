The objective of this study was to clarify the relationship between the frequency of infiltrating cells expressing the glucocorticoid receptors (GR) α and β in biopsied colonic mucosa and the glucocorticoid (GC) responsiveness of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. Active UC patients (n = 38) were divided into GC-sensitive and GC-resistant groups. GRβ+ cells were significantly higher in the GC-resistant group than in the GC-sensitive and control groups. GRα mRNA was expressed in all UC patients, while GRβ mRNA was expressed in only 1 patient in the GC-sensitive group (n = 6) and 7 patients in the GC-resistant group (n = 8). Double-positive cells for GRβ and CD4 or CD19 were frequently observed. The Foxp3+ cell count was significantly higher in the GC-sensitive group than in the GC-resistant group, but double Foxp3+GRβ+ cells were not observed. These results indicated that the sensitivity of GC therapy could probably be predicted by immunostaining biopsy specimens for GRβ and Foxp3.

This paper describes a procedure for deriving norm-bounded output-multiplicative uncertainty descriptions for a multi-input
multi-output system by matching the output of an uncertainty model to the outputs of a set of known models. It is assumed that the
set of models has been obtained through system identification. The objective is to determine the least conservative uncertainty
description such that all known experimental data can be reconstructed by the uncertainty model. Both unstructured and diagonal
uncertainty are considered as well as various structures of the uncertainty weight matrix. For the case with no a priori information,
it is shown that a nonconservative uncertainty description can be obtained by minimizing the magnitude of the determinant of the
uncertainty weight matrix subject to the output-matching condition. The procedure is illustrated by estimation of uncertainty
weights and design of  -optimal controllers for a distillation column.

The objective of this study is to evaluate some of the physical and mechanical properties of plywood manufactured from compressed veneer of birch (Betula pubescens) and alder (Alnus glutinosa) using a cold rolling process. Surface roughness, tensile strength parallel and perpendicular-to-grain orientation of veneer sheets before and after compression process were tested. Shear strength, bending strength, and compression strength of the plywood samples made from both compressed and non-compressed veneers were also determined. Based on the results of the study, overall mechanical properties of veneer and plywood improved as compression degree veneer increased from 5% to 15%. This also resulted in less adhesive consumption up to 20% as well as enhanced surface characteristics of veneer samples by 40%. Plywood samples required lower pressure ranging from 25% to 30% for those manufactured from regular veneer. It appears that veneer compression process can be considered as an alternative method to improve both physical and mechanical properties of experimental plywood panels which can be used for building applications.

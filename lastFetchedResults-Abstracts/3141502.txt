The use of polarization-sensitive antennas in an array system has shown to significantly improve the array´s overall performance. In this paper, our objective is to investigate the impact of vector sensor´s positioning on the array´s ultimate detection capability. The work presented is derived based on the use of differential geometry to analyze the geometric properties of four-parameter diversely polarized manifold, where it is shown that the array´s detection can be expressed in terms of the manifold´s intrinsic parameter. Using this detection threshold as a performance criterion, the sensitivity analysis framework is proposed to examine the significance of antenna positioning, where the overall array sensitivity is provided to measure the performance of different array configurations. In addition, within the same array, the significance of individual antennas that contributes to the overall performance is also discussed.

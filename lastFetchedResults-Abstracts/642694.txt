Objective
We previously found that aging was characterized by a decreased sensitivity of muscle protein synthesis to leucine and that a free leucine-supplemented diet corrected this defect in old rats and elderly humans. The present experiment was undertaken to evaluate the efficiency of selected leucine-rich proteins to stimulate postprandial muscle protein synthesis in old rats to optimize nutritional protein support in the elderly.
Methods

Sixty rats (22 mo old) received an experimental meal for the first hour of feeding and a standard diet for the rest of the day for 30 d. Experimental meals contained milk proteins that differed in leucine content: β-lactoglobulin (14.5% leucine), Prolacta (13.4%), α-lactalbumin (10.9%), and casein (10%). As a control, a fifth group was added that received herring flour protein (7.3% leucine). Muscle protein synthesis was determined in vivo in the postprandial state at the end of the 30-d nutritional period using the flooding dose method (1-13C phenylalanine).
Results

Leucine intake and plasma leucine concentrations were significantly increased in rats fed meals containing the leucine-rich proteins (i.e., β-lactoglobulin and Prolacta). As previously observed with free leucine-supplemented meals, postprandial muscle protein synthesis was significantly improved in rats fed the meals containing the leucine-rich proteins. Interestingly, the beneficial effect was maintained after the 30-d supplementation.
Conclusion

The results indicated that leucine-rich proteins were efficient in improving muscle protein synthesis in old rats. Thus, nutritional supplements containing such proteins may be efficient in preventing sarcopenia in the elderly and would represent a safe and optimized nutritional strategy. However, further experiments are necessary to determine the duration of such nutritional support to obtain a significant protein gain in muscle.

The establishment of a unified distribution network system model is the basis of smart distribution network research. Based on the topological analysis of the distribution network description model established in accordance with the Common Information Model (CIM), this paper proposes a general topology basic contraction function by analyzing connection model and node characteristics. Taking distribution network branch line contraction as an example, this paper makes a detailed description of the network analysis process using operation basic contraction function. In practical applications, for different scenarios and functional requirements, appropriate objective function should be chosen to determine the reasonable contraction principle, thus promoting the use of the basic contraction function for network simplification.

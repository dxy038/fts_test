Recent years have seen increased interest in green technologies such as photovoltaic (PV) electricity and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Such technologies, however, have been found to be detrimental to distribution networks. This paper introduces a novel distribution system architecture that can better accommodate the expected growth in PV electricity and PHEVs. In the proposed architecture, the distribution system becomes a bilayer system composed of the traditional ac layer that serves existing system loads, plus an embedded dc layer that interfaces with PV arrays and PHEVs. A bidirectional converter interconnects the two layers and controls the power flows between them. This paper presents the key design and operational aspects of the proposed architecture, with consideration of different uncertainties inherent in the system. To this end, a probabilistic benchmark has been developed for modeling these uncertainties and for use with the sizing and scheduling of different system components. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations confirmed the technical and economic merit of the proposed design methodology.

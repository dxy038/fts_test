The objective of this article is to present a theoretical approach of evolutionary interfaces object-oriented modeling. It is proposed to apply it to a wildland fire spread model that is multidisciplinary by essence. Our aim is to propose a decision support system to effectively and rapidly take into account complexity and uncertainties related to the factors influencing the fire spread.

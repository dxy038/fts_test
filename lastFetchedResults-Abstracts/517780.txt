Abstract
Background
Brucella mellitensis, the most invasive strain of brucella, is the predominant Strain of genus brucella in Iran. It causes variety of hematological abnormalities some of which are frequent and causes difficulties in diagnosis.
Objective
To find hematological abnormalities of brucellosis in hospitalized patients in an endemic area.
Materials and Methods
A retrospective review of patients' medical records who were admitted to four university and general hospitals during 8 years was done. Age, sex, clinical findings, laboratory tests including CBC, platelet count, Erythrocytic Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-Reactive Protein, wright test were assessed. Confirmation of brucellosis was made by wright agglutination test at a titer; ?1/160. Data were analyzed by Spss16 and Pvalue  < 0.05 was taken as significant for differences.
Results
Out of 238patients diagnosed as brucellosis, hematologic evaluation had been performed for 208patients.Anemia was detected in (55/119)46%of male and (35/89) 39.3% of female patients (Pvaule0.383). Leukopenia (WBC  <  4300/mm3) was present in (18/208) 8.5%, thrombocytopenia (Platelet  <  150.000/ mm3) in (24/200) 12% and pancytopenia in (3/200) 1.5%of patients.
Conclusion
Brucellosis should be considered in differential diagnosis of any patient with disturbances of hematologic findings in endemic areas.

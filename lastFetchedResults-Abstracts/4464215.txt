In automatic assembly, the feeding of different components of a product is often performed by automatic vibratory and centrifugal feeders. Their design remains largely empirical, especially for their associated orienting systems (OSs). A case-oriented approach for computer-aided design of the OS is proposed. The objective of the proposed approach is not only to realize the computer-aided design of the OS, but also to attempt to introduce the CBR (case-based reasoning) approach in the ESs (expert systems) in this field. In order to apply CBR, the orienting process is modeled. A prototype is tested and validated for possible future industrial applications

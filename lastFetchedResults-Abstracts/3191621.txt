Bidirectional or two way power flow based centrality measure has been implemented in bulk and smart power transmission systems. Proposed model can identify critical nodes from the system whose removal would affect the system severely. A combination of two models has been adopted to capture the power flow scenario of smart grid. Impacts of removal of critical nodes have been analyzed in terms of increase in path length, connectivity loss and load loss. Rank similarity analysis has been carried out to check the numerical stability of rank of the critical nodes found from proposed method based on complex network theory.

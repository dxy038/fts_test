The aim of this paper is to propose a fuzzy multiobjective optimization technique based on evolutionary computation for voltage/reactive power control, on the case of distribution systems. Multiobjective optimization, also named Pareto optimization, extends optimization theory by permitting multiple objectives to be &#8220;optimized&#8221; simultaneously. It has been used in economics and management science for years and has gradually crept into engineering applications. Process optimization is best viewed as a Pareto optimal process seeking a consensus in which many objectives are balanced, so that the improvement of any single objective will result in a negative impact on at least one other objective

This work aims to evaluate the performance of a solar domestic hot water (SDHW) system including a latent storage material. The
originality of our approach consists to place a composite made of compressed expanded natural graphite (CENG) and phase change
material (PCM) directly inside a flat plate solar collector in order to replace the traditional copper-based solar absorber. According
to this target, the study is composed of two steps: the composites preparation and characterization; and the analysis of the system to
achieve optimal integration of the material in the process.
The present paper is focused on the selection of the most promising composite to implement in the solar collector. In order to reach
this objective, several composites based on CENG and various storage materials (paraffin, stearic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate and
pentaglycerin) have been elaborated and characterized. The synthesis of all these measurements allowed us to select three composites
whose characteristics match their integration into a solar thermal collector.

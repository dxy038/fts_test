Humanitarian Assistance means the provision of commodities and materials for humanitarian purposes typically in response to humanitarian crises including natural and man made disasters such as armed conflicts. The primary objective of H.A is to protect lives of victims- reduce their suffering and maintain human dignity.
Whenever there is a disaster and affected state is unable or unwilling to provide aid to victims within its own territory -there is an important question whether other states have a duty to provide h.a. to victims even without its consent. this is strongly related to rights of victims to receive h.a. ascertaining whether victims of natural or man made disasters have right to receive h.a.is problematic .To address this increasingly significant problem this paper has argued that morally and legally victims have right to receive but states are not legally under an obligation to provide h.a.to victims of natural disasters and armed conflicts. On the other hand, under international humanitarian law states are committed to accept h.a.in armed conflicts.

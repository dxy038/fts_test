In this paper we propose a novel reconfigurable access network architecture which enables the bidirectional transmission of 1.25 - 2.5 Gbit/s. Optical network units (ONUs) are equipped with a reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) and remote nodes (RNs) are based on microring resonators - both contribute to network transparency and flexibility. We also propose ONU upgrade to serve 10 Gbit/s per end-user. Next to the theoretical description and transmission simulations some principle measurement results are presented which show the feasibility of the concept.

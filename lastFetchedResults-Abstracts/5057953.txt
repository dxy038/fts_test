There are several pathological conditions that modify the gait pattern in the infant population, in order to evaluate this pattern it is necessary to compare it to parameters studied in ldquonormalrdquo individuals, clinically healthy. For this reason, it results necessary to count with normal parameters specific for this kind of population. However, the studies that are in the literature about the pediatric gait development do not provide enough information to perform evaluations where comparisons with healthy individuals are necessary. The objective of this study was to obtain a data base of the spatio-temporal gait parameters of pediatric healthy Mexican subjects, providing new information about this kind of gait, thus this information can subsequently be included in different motion analysis softwares. With this purpose, a descriptive study analyzed the gait of 120 children (61 boys and 59 girls) between the ages of 6 and 13, analyzing how the age affects the spatio-temporal gait parameters. Significant differences were noted with the age in the great majority of the spatio-temporal gait parameters. In addition, significant differences were found from those reported in the literature for normal adult gait.

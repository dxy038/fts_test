Summary form only given. The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region founded the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute Company Limited (ASTRI) in 2001 to capture the promises of technological advances for Hong Kong through world-class applied research. In September 2004, ASTRI completed its five-year strategic plan with an objective to become Greater China´s most customer-focused applied research institution by continuously producing a substantial volume of world-competitive intellectual properties, and transfer them cost-effectively to the burgeoning local technology industries of Hong Kong, Pearl River Delta and the rest of China, and in so doing, position Hong Kong as a vital driving force for technology in the region. The plan calls for ASTRI to utilize Hong Kong´s unique comparative advantage as the only first-world economy in all of China to build a distinctive human resource edge in technology, and execute a totally customer-focused approach toward R&amp;D that would produce substantial industrial impact in a predictable manner year in and year out. As a research institution, ASTRI´s R&amp;D activities focus on four closely interrelated technological domains - IC design, wireless communications, enterprise and consumer electronics and next generation material and packaging technologies. By engaging in the pursuit of customer-focused excellence in these highly innovation- and knowledge-intensive fields, we will strive not only to execute our organization´s impact-driven missions but also to provide the challenging working environment for our employees to accelerate their personal development and advance their careers in and beyond ASTRI. At ASTRI, we believe organizational achievement and individual growth are inseparable, and it is the execution of this belief that will ultimately determine the outcome of our plans.

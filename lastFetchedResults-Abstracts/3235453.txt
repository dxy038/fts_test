3D Multi-View Video (MVV) coded bit-streams that are transmitted over error prone channels can suffer from error propagation in the space, time and view domains. To improve the quality of reconstructed 3D MVV, we propose optimized Error Concealment (EC) algorithms to conceal the erroneous blocks of intra-coded and inter-coded frames. Our proposed algorithms adapt to the motion characteristics of the 3D MVV and to the error patterns. We propose three adaptive EC algorithms for intra-frames, which are Adaptive Time Domain Error Concealment (ATDEC), Adaptive Space Domain Error Concealment (ASDEC) and a hybrid Adaptive Space-Time Domain Error Concealment (ASTDEC). We also propose three adaptive EC algorithms for inter-frames, which are Adaptive Inter-View Domain Error Concealment (AIVDEC), Adaptive Time Domain Error Concealment (ATDEC) and joint Adaptive Time and Inter-View Domain Error Concealment (ATIVDEC). Our simulation results show that the proposed optimized EC algorithms can significantly improve the objective and subjective 3D MVV quality transmitted over error prone channels.

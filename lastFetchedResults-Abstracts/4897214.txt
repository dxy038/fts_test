Alongside with on-going further WCDMA development, work on evolved universal terrestrial radio access network (EUTRAN), also known as long term evolution (LTE), has been initiated in 3GPP. The objective of EUTRAN is to develop a framework for the evolution of the 3GPP radio-access technology towards wider bandwidth, lower latency and packet-optimized radio-access technology with peak data rate capability up to 100 Mbps. For the uplink direction, single carrier-FDMA (SC-FDMA) has been chosen as the multiple access technology. This paper introduces the uplink technology, the current state of progress in 3GPP as well as expected schedule for actual specification availability and describes a couple of key features, channel dependent frequency domain scheduling and multi-user MIMO in more detail. System performance results for channel dependent frequency domain scheduling are presented as well

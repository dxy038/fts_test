The aim of this paper is to propose a class of parallel frequency-PWM control for quasiresonant converters (QRC), known as habituating control. The motivation of this control relies on the necessity of operating at both minimum energy losses and minimum size conditions (high-frequency), which cannot be satisfied by frequency modulation or PWM alone. This controller has the advantage of being robust against control saturation and the performance can be chosen by modifying a objective function. Furthermore, the proposed strategy is designed to provide robust stabilization in spite of model uncertainty and its performance is verified through an experimental application in a boost type QRC.

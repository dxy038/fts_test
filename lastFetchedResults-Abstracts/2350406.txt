In the past several years, research work has been carried out on a number of different ores containing platinum group elements (PGE), with the objective of developing alternative reagent schemes that would improve PGM recovery and concentrate grade in the operating plants.

 been demonstrated that the floatability of PGE-bearing minerals largely depends on the type of deposit and how the deposit was formed. The uniqueness of PGE deposits and their formation dictates the development of the treatment process and, in particular, the reagent schemes for different ore types.

s study, a number of different new reagents, including collectors, depressants and modifiers, were identified as highly effective for the treatment of different ores containing PGE minerals. Results from bench scale research work using new reagents are presented in this paper. The type of ores and the effect on flotation are discussed in detail.

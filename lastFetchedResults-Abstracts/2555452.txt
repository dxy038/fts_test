The present research proposes and optimizes the performance of a novel solar-driven combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) Kalina system for two seasons—winter and summer—based on exergy, exergo-economic, and exergo-environmental concepts applying a Non-dominated Sort Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) technique. Three criteria, i.e. daily exergy efficiency, total product cost rate, and total product environmental impact rate associated with the exergy of the system for each season are considered simultaneously for multi-objective optimization. The outcomes reveal that increments in turbine inlet pressure and mass flow rate of the vapour generator lower the environmental impact of system products as well as the total product cost rate in both seasons. The optimum value of daily exergy efficiency, total product environmental impact rate, and total product cost rate indicate improvements by 2.56%, 15.7%, and 15.3% respectively in summer and 36.34%, 7.39%, and 4.93% respectively in winter, relative to the base point.

An architecture for a number of personal computers (PCs) connected in a hierarchical organization is presented. The objective of the architecture is to provide access to a global database for data sharing. The hardware of the proposed architecture, which includes memory mappings, bus arbiter logic, and PC connections, is described. The architecture is functionally compared with conventional single-bus architectures. The performances are compared in terms of throughput

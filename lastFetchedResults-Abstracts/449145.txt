Obervational cae erie.
Method
New videokeratography oftware for TM-2N (topographic modeling ytem; TOMEY Corporation, Nagoya, Japan) wa developed that can automatically capture conecutive corneal urface image every econd for 10 econd. Forty-eight adult volunteer (80 eye) were recruited for thi tudy, and all ubject were examined with the new ytem. Corneal topograph were analyzed for tear breakup time (TM-BUT) and the ratio of breakup area to entire color-code area (TM-BUA) wa calculated. Routine method for tear film breakup time evaluation uing lit-lamp microcope and fluorecence taining (LE-BUT) were performed for comparion purpoe. Regreive correlation of TM-BUT or TM-BUA with LE-BUT were analyzed. Baed on LE reult, ubject were eparated into two group with normal and hort BUT, repectively. TM-BUT and TM-BUA were compared with LE-BUT data with regard to the enitivity and pecificity of evaluation of dry eye ymptom.
Reult
Topographic modeling ytem–tear breakup time (TM–BUT) had a poitive correlation with LE-BUT (R = 0.7219, P < .0001), wherea TM-BUA howed a negative correlation (R = 0.6317, P < .0001). Among 34 eye with normal LE-BUT, 11 eye (32.35%) diplayed abnormal TM-BUT, 9 (81.82%) of which were aociated with dry eye ymptom. The enitivitie of TM-BUT and TM-BUA were 97.5% and 95%, repectively, ignificantly higher than that of LE-BUT (75%), with P = .008 and 0.01, repectively. Topographic modeling ytem–BUT and TM-BUA diplayed a imilar rate of pecificity in comparion with LE-BUT.
Concluion
Thi new videokeratography ytem i a noninvaive and objective method with increaed enitivity for tear film tability analyi.

High-order, bidirectional, DC-20-GHz switch networks are discussed. Single-chip 1&#215;2, 1&#215;4, and 2&#215;2 switch MMICs have been demonstrated. Multiple chips have been used to demonstrate 4&#215;4 and 1&#215;16 switches. The switches all use a combination of series and shunt passive FET switching elements. The 1&#215;4 switch is made of a single stage of switching elements, rather than the usual two stages of 1&#215;2 switches. The 2&#215;2 switch is comprised of two stages of 1&#215;2 switches. The multiple-chip 4&#215;4 switch is made of four stages of 1&#215;2 switches (using the 2&#215;2 switch MMICs). Two stages of 1&#215;4 switches are used to make the 1&#215;16 switch

Coal-fired power plants are the main source of global electricity. As environmental regulations tighten, there is need to improve the design, operation and control of existing or new built coal-fired power plants. Modelling and simulation is identified as an economic, safe and reliable approach to reach this objective. In this study, a detailed dynamic model of a 500 MWe coal-fired subcritical power plant was developed using gPROMS based on first principles. Model validations were performed against actual plant measurements and the relative error was less than 5%. The model is able to predict plant performance reasonably from 70% load level to full load. Our analysis showed that implementing load changes through ramping introduces less process disturbances than step change. The model can be useful for providing operator training and for process troubleshooting among others.

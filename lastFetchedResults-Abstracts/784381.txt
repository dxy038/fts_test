Objective: Loss of appetite and body mass are common in older adults and are associated with
negative consequences. Research indicates that these processes likely involve increases in serum brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Animal and human models demonstrate that BDNF may serve a regulatory function
in food intake, but no study has addressed the possibility that BDNF may be involved in appetite reduction and
loss of body mass in older adults. Design and Participants: 34 older adults without significant neurological or
psychiatric history underwent fasting blood draw and measurement of body composition. Appetite and eating
behavior were assessed by questionnaire and related to serum BDNF levels. Results: Partial correlations showed
serum BDNF levels were inversely related to appetite (r = -.38, p = .02). No significant correlations emerged
between serum BDNF and age, diet, or body composition. Conclusions: The current study extends past work and
shows that BDNF is associated with appetite in healthy older adults. Further work is needed to clarify
mechanisms for these findings, particularly prospective studies

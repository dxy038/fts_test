Water scarcity is a widespread problem in arid and semi arid regions. In this condition, evaluating crop response to water stress and estimation of ET production function (ETPF) is essential. The objective of this study was to investigate the dynamic interrelations of yield, evapotranspiration and water use efficiency of potato (Solanum Tuberosom L.) under trickle irrigation condition. This study was conducted in Dehgolan region of Kurdistan province in spring season of 1388. The experiment was arranged based on completely randomized block with 3 replication of water supply (60%, 80%, 100%, 120% of crop water requierment). In this study, evapotranspiration values and total yield of treatments were measured. To reveal the interrelations of yield, evapotranspiration and water use efficiency, two types of water production function including: Linear and Quadratic were used. The results showed that when the ETPF is linear, the EI will be numerically equal to the yield response factor (Ky), when ET reaches maximum ET (ETm). When ETPF was quadratic, the ET needed to maximize WUE is less than the ET for maximum yield (Ym). The results were also revealed that maximum yield was achieved at 345 mm of evapotranspiration and maximum water use efficiency (26.6 kg/m3) was achieved at 222 mm of evapotranspiration where 55.4 percent was less than the maximum evapotranspiration (ETm). However, the maximum yield was only 27.7 percent more than the yield in maximum water use efficiency.  The interrelation of Y, ET and WUE are demonstrated that if water supply is limiting, seeking maximum water use efficiency may be desirable.

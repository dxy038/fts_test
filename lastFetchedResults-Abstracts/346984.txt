Objective: To elucidate the generator sources of high-frequency oscillations of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), we recorded somatosensory evoked high-frequency oscillations directly from the human cerebral cortex.
Subjects and methods: Seven patients, 6 with intractable partial epilepsy and one with a brain tumor, were studied. With chronically implanted subdural electrodes, we recorded SEPs to median nerve stimulation in all patients, and also recorded SEPs to lip and posterior tibial nerve stimulation in one. High-frequency oscillations were recorded using a restricted bandpass filter (500â€“2000 Hz).
Results: For the median nerve oscillations, all oscillation potentials were maximum at the electrodes closest to the primary hand sensorimotor area. Most oscillations were distributed similar to or more diffusely than P20/N20. Some later oscillations after the peak of P20 or N20 were present in a very restricted cortical area similar to P25. We investigated the phase change of each oscillation potential around the central sulcus. One-third of the oscillations showed phase reversal around the central sulcus, while later oscillations elicited in a restricted cortical area did not. High-frequency oscillations to posterior tibial nerve and lip stimulation were also maximum in the sensorimotor areas. Most of the lip oscillations showed phase reversal around the central sulcus, but most of the posterior tibial nerve oscillations did not.
Conclusion: High-frequency oscillations are generated near the primary sensorimotor area. There are at least two different generator mechanisms for the median nerve high-frequency oscillations. We suspect that most oscillations are derived from the terminal segments of thalamocortical radiations or from the primary sensorimotor cortex close to the generator of P20/N20, and some later oscillations from the superficial cortex close to the generator of P25.

High temperature air combustion (HiTAC) is a promising combustion technology with the advantage of energy conservation and pollutant reduction. The main objective of the present research focuses on the control strategy of regenerative furnaces. The control strategy was based on a model where alternatively operation of burners is considered. According to the concept of HiTAC, air-to-fuel ratio and the switching time were settled as the key parameters in the control system. The basic concept of operating sequences of changeover valves was provided. It was shown that this method can be applied for the design of regenerative furnace control system.

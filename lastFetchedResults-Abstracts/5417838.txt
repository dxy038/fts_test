In this paper, we propose a current-mode multiple input maximum circuit with bi-directional operation, using 7n+10 transistors for n inputs. Owing to the single-stage architecture, the proposed circuit has the merits of high speed, high accuracy, and no accumulated errors. This circuit has been fabricated in 0.6 &#956;m CMOS technology, and the experimental result has verified the bidirectional maximum function of this circuit

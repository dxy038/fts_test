A synchronous optimization of power system and controller parameter could substantially improve the fuel economy and emission performance of HEV (hybrid electric vehicle). As a typical multi-objective optimization, this type of optimization problem involves a couple of mutually conflicting objectives of optimization and non-linear constraints. In this paper, the Pareto optimal solution set of this optimization problem is sought by adopting econiche genetic algorithm on a specimen vehicle. The result turns out that several groups of Pareto optimal solutions could be obtained in this way, while the fuel economy and emission performance could be remarkably enhanced with vehicleÂ´s given performance being guaranteed.

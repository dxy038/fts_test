This paper presents an analysis of homeostatic controller, which controls the motion of a hybrid-driven underwater glider. The homeostatic controller is inspired from a biological process known as homeostasis, which maintains a stable state in the face of massively dynamics conditions. Within a biological context, organism homeostasis is an emergent property of the interactions between nervous, endocrine and immune system. Artificially these three systems are presented as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Artificial Endocrine System (AES) and Artificial Immune System (AIS). The ANN is designed as the controller backbone, the AES is designed as the weight tuner, and the AIS is designed as the optimizer of the control system. The design objective is to obtain better control performance of the motion control system which includes the disturbance from the water currents. We have simulated the algorithm by using MatlabTM, and the results demonstrated that the homeostatic controller reduced the cost function of the control system and produced better control performance than the neuroendocrine controller.

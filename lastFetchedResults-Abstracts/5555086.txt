Cloud computing had enabled many companies to drive efficient and better utilization of computational resources, this by ensuring better empowerment of objectives and user policies over these resources. Various security aspects such as privacy, accountability, authentication, auditing, role-based access control and others, depict several desired policies that need to be available in cloud-based applications for two main reasons: (i) to promote secured cloud usability (ii) and to protect users information/application. This paper presents Secured Objective-Driven programming model created automatically at runtime by PAA Cloud Engine along with the XACML security annotation representation. The later provides a secured separated abstraction layer for the cloud users sits on top of the programming model.

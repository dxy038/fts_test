A three-phase rectifier with high frequency isolation and four-quadrant operation is described and analyzed in this paper. The selected topology consists of a bidirectional three-phase to one-phase cycloconverter, based on the matrix converter topology, a high frequency transformer and a bidirectional active rectifier. Main features of this power converter are the ability to regenerate energy back to the utility, unity power factor at the mains and reduction of volume and weight thanks to the high-frequency isolation. An all-digital control based on a field-programmed-gate-array (FPGA) and a digital-signal-processor (DSP) was used to implement space vector modulation (SVM) and output current regulation, respectively. Experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed converter.

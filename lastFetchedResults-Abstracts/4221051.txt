This paper presents the behavioral models of sigma-delta modulators and transient noise sources, using the standard language VHDL-AMS. The models are implemented in the time domain and their generic parameters are related to spectral characteristics. The objective of this work is to simulate noise effects in discrete time circuits and systems (like switched capacitors systems) at the behavioral level in order to minimize the simulation runtime required to evaluate and quantify the systems performance.

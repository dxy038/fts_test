Grammar-based immune programming is proposed here as a tool to assist the search for a general solution to a functional equation. A external archive is incorporated to the algorithm in order to store good solutions found during the search. By inspecting such particular solutions the user is able to generalize and construct a general solution to the functional equation considered. The main objective here is to provide the user with a large diverse set of particular solutions to the problem at hand. Preliminary computational experiments are performed where some functional equations from the literature are tackled.

Background: Previous studies indicated that classic symptom of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are probably different between young and old patients.
Objective: To investigate the symptom predictors of ACS and comparison of those in young and old patients.
Method: This research was a cross-sectional descriptive study on 570 patients hospitalized in coronary care unit during one year in Semnan Fatemiah hospital. Using a checklist including demographic profiles, history, and symptoms, the data were collected, sorted and further analyzed statically.
Findings: Diaphoresis and Pain (presence, distribution pattern and the type) were more common in young patients rather than old ones (P<0.05). Statistical analyses revealed that the pain, diaphoresis, nausea and vomiting were more prevalent in acute myocardial infarction compared with unstable angina (P<0.05).
Conclusion: Typical symptoms of ACS in young patients showed a higher predictive value comparing to those in old patients.

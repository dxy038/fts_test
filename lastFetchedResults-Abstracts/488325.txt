Background and Objective: Esophageal cancer is the 6th common cancer in Iran. Affected patients have a relatively short lifetime, as this cancer is usually diagnosed in advanced stages. This study was conducted to estimate survival and factors related to it in patients with esophageal cancer.
Materials and Methods: All patients definitely diagnosed as esophageal cancer, registered in Fars Cancer Registry Center, were investigated. Required information was gathered from cancer registry forms and other resources. 1- to 5-year survival rates were estimated using life-table method. Wilcoxon test was used to compare survival rates between subgroups. All data were analyzed by SPSS software. Results: Of 161 cases, 61.5% were male. Mean age of patients was 64.6±13.10 years and 57.6±11.9 years in male and female, respectively. Overall survival rates at 1- to 5-years after diagnosis were: 58, 33, 18, 15 and 9 percent, respectively. Factors such as age at time of diagnosis, Presence of metastasis, histologic grade, type of first treatment, occupation in males, ethnicity and number of household showed to have a significant effect on prognosis.
Conclusion: According to this study and similar studies carried out, screening and early detection of patients (in lower ages, and lower stages) is emphasized.

This article discusses the method to calculate an objective measure of picture distortions. When the normalized mean score for a reference sequence is smaller than 1.0, the conventional method is inapplicable in calculating impairment units (hereinafter referred to as imps). We propose a new method to calculate imps in sensation domain along with a verification of its validity. The imps obtained in such a way make it possible to compare the results with a large different distribution of scores directly, for example the results obtained from the DSCQS method with those from the SSQS method.

Wireless sensor networks (WSN) is a rising technology that promises to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. Being limited in processing power, memory space, communication range and energy resources as well as unlikely prone to human intervention, WSN communications put extra challenges on the routing task. In addition, the wide variety of sensor applications often requires that multiple conflicting objectives be satisfied in the routing task. We propose a framework for routing in WSN that is adaptive, constraint-based, multi-objective and which is also solely dependant on localized knowledge.

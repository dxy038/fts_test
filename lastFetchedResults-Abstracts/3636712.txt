In this letter, we present a new configuration with laser illumination to measure the temperature of visible light-emitting diode (LED) chips using nematic liquid crystals. This method is applied to measuring the junction temperature of multiquantum well (MQW) LEDs in InGaN-GaN-sapphire structure. A color filter is inserted in the optical path to attenuate the overwhelming LED light. A high-power laser beam is used as the sensing light to enhance the contrast of the thermal image on LED chips. This technique is nondestructive and can be performed in real-time during device operation. One objective is to investigate the effect of the junction temperature on the electrical and optical performance of the LED devices. For the LEDs measured, the conversion efficiency decreases by 67% when the junction temperature rises from 22&#176;C to 107&#176;C. The new measurement configuration is a valuable tool to study the thermal performance of GaN-based LED devices and subsequently to investigate the degradation on electrical and optical performance due to junction temperature increase.

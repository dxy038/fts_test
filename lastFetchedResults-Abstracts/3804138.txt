The objective of this study is to explore the physiological sources of covariation between multiple narrow-band EEG spectral amplitudes with an aim toward parsimonious modeling of the observed intercorrelations. Specifically, a factor-analytic model describing the intercorrelations among 25 spectral amplitudes, at 1-Hz increments from 1 to 25 Hz, is presented. This method is applied to the EEGs obtained from a group of five subjects controlled for age, sex, state of consciousness, and recording dipole. The subjects were studied in waking and sleeping states in order to examine how this model would represent such physiological changes.

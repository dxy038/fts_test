Objective (s): Childhood obesity and sedentary lifestyle are one of the most serious public health challenges. Physical activity and exercise are an important way to prevent obesity and its consequences. The purpose of this study was to evaluate factors affecting physical activity in female high school students.
Methods: The Pender’s health promotion model served as the framework for this cross-sectional study, which included a total of 500 female high school students in Kashan, Iran. The data were collected through interviews. The interviewers were conducted based on health promotion model (self efficacy, perceived affect, perceived barriers, perceived social support, self-esteem). The data were explored using path analysis. 
Results: All constructs of the health promotion model except perceived barriers were significantly related to the girls’ physical activity. Self-esteem (B=0. 46, p < 0/001) had the highest correlation with the girls’ physical activity. All constructs of the health promotion model accounted for 52% of variance for physical activity.
Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrated that the health promotion model predicted variance in physical activity among students. Theory-based interventions focusing on self-esteem and self-efficacy should be implemented to improve physical activity among female students.

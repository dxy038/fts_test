In this paper we present a fast lattice Boltzmann fluid solver that has been performance
optimized and tailored for the Cell Broadband Engine Architecture. Many design decisions
were motivated by the long range objective to simulate blood flow in human blood vessels,
especially in aneurysms, but have proven to be much more generally applicable. After
explaining implementation details and how they were influenced by the target platform,
the performance and memory requirements of this prototype solver are evaluated.

Given a set I = {i | i = 1, 2, . . . , n} of current n items (for example, n green peppers) with their weights w<sub>i</sub> and priorities r<sub>i</sub>, a lexicographic bi-criteria combinatorial food packing problem asks to find a subset I´ (&#8838; I) so that the total weight &#931;<sub>i&#8712;I´</sub> w<sub>i</sub> is no less than a specified target bound b for each package, and it is minimized as the primary objective, and further the total priority &#931;<sub>i&#8712;I´</sub> r<sub>i</sub> is maximized as the second objective. The problem has been known to be NP-hard, while it can be solved exactly in O(nb) time if all the input data are assumed to be integral. For a given real &#949; &gt; 0, an O(n<sup>2</sup>/&#949;) time heuristic algorithm with a data rounding technique has been designed and the heuristic total weight has been shown to be at most (2+&#949;) times the optimal total weight. In this paper, a modification of the data rounding heuristic is proposed, and it is shown that the proposed modification delivers a heuristic solution such that the total weight is at most (1 + &#949;) times the optimum.

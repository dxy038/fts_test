In allusion to the abuse of the asymmetry and retard of information and the abuse that was difficult to realize the real time coordination and regulation consisted in the process of logistics, this paper brings forward the solution that adopts RFID and GPS as the instrument of information collection, RFID middleware and GIS as the instrument of information fusion and expression, GPRS as the instrument of communications. The storage module, module attached to the van, the command center, the electronic commerce platform and the mobile intelligent terminal make up of the IT infrastructure of third party logistics. The information integration platform introduces the service-oriented architecture based on Web services, fuses the information of RFID, sensors, GPS, the logistics database and the credit database, gains the veracious describe of in-transit visibility, supervises the process of logistics through the visualization of logistics, and builds up the enterprise intelligence utilizing the multi-objective optimization evolution algorithm. All improves the ability of information system and upgrade the competitiveness of third party logistics.

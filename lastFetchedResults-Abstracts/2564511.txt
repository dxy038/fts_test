with the competition in market demand and customers' requirements fluctuations, companies have to supply productions in accordance with demand and supply time and less cost in order to be able to maintain their competitive advantages. To achieve these goals, producers must simultaneously design supply chain in the early stages of new product design. To do this according to the BOM, the structure of supply chain is designed and in every node of the chain network, suppliers, the level of safety stock as well as the place of inventory accumulation are  determined so that the total cost and also the provision time of the final product interacting with each other minimized.
In this article, the mathematical model for new product supply chain design and selection of appropriate material checklist and also the suitable suppliers in every node of network, according to the considered criteria, have been developed that is perfectly proportional with critical conditions. This is a multi-objective model that consists of 4 objective functions. The first objective is minimization of end product cost. The second minimizes supply and inventory holding cost. Third objective minimized likely to lack of materials by choosing multiple suppliers in each node of the chain. In the last objective it plans buying of materials in uniform time intervals and so that the suppliers can recognize us as a reliable purchaser. Then, the proposed model has been implemented in actual conditions and analyses are presented base on it and to improve conditions, suggestions are presented. The results show that unlike literature, the efficient supply chain that the minimization of cost in that is the goal, is not always suitable for functional products and there is some other parameters should be considered in critical situations like that suppliers confidence, minimization of likely to lack of materials and minimization of supply costs.

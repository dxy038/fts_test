A two-stage methodology integrating analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods for analyzing and assessing the productive efficiency in construction industry was proposed. This paper discussed the productive efficiency of the construction industry in Shanghai using the statistic data in Shanghai from 1997 to 2007. The results indicate that the index selection process based on AHP is more objective and the integrated AHP-DEA methodology is suitable and reliable for productive efficiency assessing in construction industry. Meanwhile, the proposed assessing index will be valuable references for similar regions in Mainland China.

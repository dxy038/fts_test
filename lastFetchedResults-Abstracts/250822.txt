In this paper, energy dissipation and residual stress developments are numerically studied in threedimensional
closed deformation paths. Different objective stress rates coded in a finite element program
are compared.
In order to update the stresses, implicit integration algorithm based on mid-point rule for corotational
and non-corotational objective rates is used. Several corotational objective rates such as Jaumann,
Green–Naghdi, Eulerian and Lagrangian triad-based rates and non-corotational rates such as Truesdell
and Cotter–Rivlin rates are considered.
It is shown in this work that in some cases also a non-integrable model may exhibit no dissipation
energy at the end of a closed deformation path.
This study underlines some results previously obtained by other researchers, i.e. among all considered
stress rates the logarithmic rate manifests the best result in respect of elasticity requirements. Copyright

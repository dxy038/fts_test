Background and objective: accumulating evidence suggests that serum lipids are associated with
cognitive decline and dementias. however, majority of the existing information concerns only serum total
cholesterol (TC) and data at the level of lipoprotein fractions and subclasses is limited. The aim of this study was
to explore the levels and trends of main cholesterol and triglyceride measures and eight lipoprotein subclasses
during normal aging and the development of mild cognitive impairment by following a group of elderly for six
years. Design: longitudinal. Setting: City of kuopio, Finland. Participants: 45 elderly individuals of which 20
developed mild cognitive impairment (MCi) during the follow-up. Measurements: On each visit participants
underwent an extensive neuropsychological and clinical assessment. lipoprotein levels were measured via 1h
nMr from native serum samples. Results: Serum cholesterol and many primarily cholesterol-associated
lipoprotein measures clearly decreased in MCi while the trends were increasing for those elderly people who
maintained normal cognition. Conclusion: These findings suggest that a decreasing trend in serum cholesterol
measures in elderly individuals may suffice as an indication for more detailed inspection for potential signs of
cognitive decline.

Interactive broadcast terminal system was designed for bidirectional interactive television service based on the MPEG-2/4 standards and ATSC broadcast specification. In order to implement user interactivity, MPEG-4 contents are carried by MPEG-2 PES or private section. Additional information combined as XML format is transmitted by DSM-CC data carousel while ATSC-PSIP is used to transfer the EPG information. IP is used to handle the bi-directional user interaction data through return channel

This paper presents a systematic design procedure for a robust damping controller based on the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach employing a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) device. The design procedure takes advantage of the multi-objective features of LMI based design techniques. The procedure is applied to enhance the damping of inter-area oscillations in a two-area four-machine test system

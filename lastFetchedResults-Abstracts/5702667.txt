In this paper, we propose a technique for multiregion autofocusing. The objective is to make the objects of interest at the different distance locations well focused while maintaining the shallow depth of field. Based on the image sharpness analysis of interested regions, we determine the cameraÂ´s best lens position and largest aperture size such that the depth of field encompasses all objects selected by the user. Thus, in addition to emphasize the objects of interest in photography, our method can also reduce the exposure for image stabilization. Experiments with real scene images are presented.

Research on new types of broadband logarithmically periodic antenna structures is reported. The antennas have pattern and impedance characteristics which are essentially independent of frequency over theoretically unlimited bandwidths. Bandwidths of ten to one are readily achieved in practice. Structures are described which provide linearly polarized omnidirectional, bidirectional and unidirectional patterns as well as circularly polarized bidirectional and unidirectional patterns.

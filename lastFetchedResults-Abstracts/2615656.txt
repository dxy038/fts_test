In Kerman province, especially the Rafsanjan area, pistachio is the major crop which
has a very high economic vague. Naturally, soils in the area influence pistachio
production, but very little study has been done in this regard. The objective of this study was to investigate soil formation and soil physical and chemical characteristics on
a toposequence. Anar district 75 km north-west of Rafsanjan was chosen and
preliminary studies were performed on maps, aerial photographs and satellite images.
Overall, 9 profiles were excavated on a pediment to playa transect. The profiles were
studied and distinguish horizons were separated and soil samples were prapered and
analysised for cations, anions, EC, pH, gypsum, lime, textures and gravel. Resultd show
that on the toposequence, gypsic horizon is formed on gravelly and coarse texture soils
and also on the playa surface. Natric horizon was found in soils on the playa surface.
Leptic Haplogypsids, Typic Torrifluvents and Gypsic Haplosalids are found on
pediment, plain and playa surfaces respectively. Carbonates, Clay, Silt, EC and SAR
increased toward the playa, as gypsum, Sand and gravel content decreases.

The main objective of this paper is to investigate contention processing schemes that improve the performance of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks with control channels while avoiding electronic bottle-neck. For this purpose, we propose two novel contention processing schemes: local collision blocking (LCB) and local collision blocking-contention resolution (LCB-CR) schemes. We also consider two other schemes: pure contention and contention resolution unit-only (CRU-only) schemes as the lower and the upper performance bounds, respectively. Applying these four schemes to the delayed-ALOHA access protocol, we compare their throughputs and show that the proposed schemes are effective in achieving significant performance improvement with moderate system complexity

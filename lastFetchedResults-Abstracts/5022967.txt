A hierarchical voltage control system is being implemented in Italy and Spain with the objective of minimising the active power transmission losses and improving the security of the system and the quality of the voltage supply. The quantification of these benefits is the objective of a European Thermie project. A complete benchmarking methodology has been developed to measure the performance of a complex hierarchical control system. In this paper the methodology is applied to the case of the performance assessment of the hierarchical voltage control system of a power transmission network. A simple case study based on a small network is used as an example. The same procedure used on the small example will be applied to the full Spanish and Italian network

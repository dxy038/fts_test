Fusarium Head Blight (FHB), caused by a blend of Fusarium species, is a destructive fungal disease of wheat and other small grain cereals. FHB has become an important issue in food and feed industry. Moreover, the majority of FHB pathogens have the ability to synthesize a range of mycotoxins. Although several physical and chemical control measures can be taken to control these fungi in the field, research is needed to provide new techniques for control during storage and transport of cereals. Mounting evidence shows that electrolyzed oxidizing water (EOW) has antimicrobial activity and might be a useful alternative for conventional control measures. The objective of the present work, was to investigate the influence of EOW on outgrowth and germination of Fusarium spp. and deoxynivalenol (DON) production. Both an in vitro and in vivo approach were pursued. In a first approach, a screening of the main FHB causing species was conducted. Secondly, the effect of EOW on Fusarium graminearum and the effect on DON biosynthesis was investigated using a trichothecene knockout mutant. These experiments showed an increase in DON levels upon sub lethal amendments of EOW to F. graminearum spores. In addition, the reactive oxygen species H2O2 was shown to govern this induction.
Finally, the work was validated on a laboratory scale via an in vivo assay using wheat grains in which the Fusarium outgrowth was measured. The present work demonstrates that EOW has potential to control Fusarium spp. in wheat grains during transport and storage although sub lethal concentrations can result in increased DON biosynthesis.

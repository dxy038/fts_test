Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine if abnormal multiple marker screens (MMS) are associated with adverse perinatal outcomes in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) pregnancies.
Study design
This was a case control study of IUGR pregnancies (birth weight <10th percentile for gestational age [GA]) delivered in our unit over 6 years. Cases were compared with controls for the association between abnormal MMS and adverse perinatal outcomes (APO).
Results
Of the 261 IUGR pregnancies, 39 (16%) had at least 1 APO. An elevated HCG was significantly associated with an APO (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1–6.4). A low uE3 was also associated with an APO (OR 5.5, 95% CI 2.2–14). The association between an elevated AFP and APO was not statistically significant (OR 1.6, 95% CI, 0.6–4.6).
Conclusion
An elevated HCG and low uE3 were associated with APO in cases of IUGR. This information could be useful in identifying a subset of IUGR cases deserving closer surveillance.

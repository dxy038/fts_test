Along with the increasing problems of cybercrime, digital forensics-related issues have become more and more important and serious. Digital forensics often involves the preservation, identification, extraction, documentation and interpretation of digital data. The construction of a forensics laboratory should include the objective of establishment, organization, responsibility, accreditation procedure, personnel qualification, training, equipment, forensics procedure, document management, and so on. Another objective of constructing a forensics laboratory is to provide a trustworthy analysis report for each judicial investigation; however, there is no common criteria for a digital forensics laboratory so far. We present the seven stage lifecycle model of the forensics process, that has to be consistent, as well as in compliance with international standards. We also give suggestions and a model for establishing and standardizing a digital forensics laboratory. We hope our efforts can enhance the quality and accuracy of digital forensics, to solve criminal cases and protect human rights.

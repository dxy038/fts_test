This paper presents a novel approach to robustness analysis in multi-objective optimization problems. The concept of degree of robustness in incorporated into the evolutionary algorithm, being operationalized in the computation of the fitness value assigned to solutions. Non-dominated solutions are classified according to their degree of robustness. The information on the degree of robustness of solutions is provided to support the decision maker in the selection of a robust compromise solution.

Introduction & objective: High risk-Human papilloma viruses have been considered as important causative agents for cervical cancer. Therefore, their accurate detection is essential for management of the disease. This study was planned to type the four most prevalent high risk-HPVs in archival tissues with cancerous lesions from northwestern population of Iran.

Materials & methods: Seventy-five formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens were tested in respect of four high risk-HPV DNAs (types 16, 18, 31 and 33) by using two type-specific PCRs.

Results: In total, 46 (62%) out of 74 amplifiable samples were positive for HPV DNA. The most prevalent oncogenic HPV was type 16 (64.5%) followed by types 31(22.6%), 18 (11.3%) and 33 (1.6%). Multiple HPV infections were present in 15 (20%) of the studied samples.

Conclusion: The presence of certain multiple infected samples along with rather different circulating HPV types in the studied population will help us to plan more efficient screening and vaccination programs in future.

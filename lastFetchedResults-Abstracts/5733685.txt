In this paper, Parallel system of DC-DC Converter applied to DC distribution system for building Applications. Power supply device of DC distribution needs a large power system that is requires Efficiency and reliability of the power conversion systems. If A single converter supplies power to the all load connected to DC grid, Temperature rise, reduction in life of system and capacity expansion is limited. In power supply device which require high power system such as DC distribution for building applications, stability and response characteristic of DC gird voltage are critical in DC distribution system. For improving limited switching frequency in using the DC/DC converter, this paper present parallel operation method of bidirectional DC/DC converter. In this paper, ripple reduction and improved transient response was verified by simulation and experiment.

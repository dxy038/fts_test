This paper presents a control strategy for a three phase four-wire shunt active filter. The shunt active filter is a custom-power device capable to compensate, in real time, harmonics and unbalances in an electrical system. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the performance of instantaneous real active and reactive power (p-q) control strategy for extracting reference currents of shunt active filters under balanced, un-balanced and balanced non-sinusoidal conditions with PI controller in MATLAB/Simulink environment and also with Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS Hardware). Extensive simulations are carried out with PI controller for p-q control strategy under different main voltages. The 3-ph 4-wire SHAF system is also implemented on RTDS Hardware to further verify its effectiveness. The detailed simulation and RTDS Hardware results are included.

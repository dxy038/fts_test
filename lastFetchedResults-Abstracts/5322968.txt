We describe an upgrade scenario from current passive optical networks (PON) to wavelength routed fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) networks. The theoretical and experimental study of a bidirectional access network topology based on cascaded arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG) is presented. By combining a 16times16 AWG in the exchange point and multiple 1times16 AWGs in the distribution points, N<sup>2</sup> users can be addressed when N wavelengths are transmitted. 16 ITU wavelengths have been multiplexed at the exchange point and successfully transmitted at 2.5 Gb/s data rates for simultaneous bidirectional transmission. Bit error rate measurements have shown error free transmission is achievable for both directions and minimal crosstalk between the channels can be noticed in the retrieved eye diagrams

The objective of the current paper is using DEFORM-3D software to develop a 3-D Lagrangian incremental finite element method (FEM) simulation of friction stir processing (FSP). The developed simulation allows prediction of the defect types, temperature distribution, effective plastic strain, and especially material flow in the weld zone. Three-dimensional results of the material flow patterns in the center, advancing and retreating sides were extracted using the point tracking. The results reveal that the main part of the material flow occurs near the top surface and at the advancing side (AS). Material near the top surface was stretched to the advancing side resulting in a non-symmetrical shape of the stir zone (SZ). Furthermore, macrostructure and temperature rise were experimentally acquired to evaluate the accuracy of the developed simulation. The comparison shows that the stir zone shape, defect types, powder agglomeration, and temperature rise, which were predicted by simulation, are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental results.

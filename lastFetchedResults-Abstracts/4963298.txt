Summary form only given. Active control of a train pantograph, and in particular of the pressure between the pantograph and the overhead wiring, is studied. The objective is to control the contact force of a simply constructed T-type pantograph in a way that is robust against various disturbances. We quantify parametric uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics, then set up the robust performance problem for structured uncertainties, and design a controller via /spl mu/-synthesis.

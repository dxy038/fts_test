In this paper, we propose a single objective optimization evolutionary algorithm (EA) based on Covariance Matrix Learning and Searching Preference (CMLSP) and design a switching method which is used to combine CMLSP and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMAES). Then we investigate the performance of the switch method on a set of 30 noiseless optimization problems designed for the special session on real-parameter optimization of CEC 2014. The basic idea of the proposed CMLSP is that it is more likely to find a better individual around a good individual. That is to say, the better an individual is, the more resources should be invested to search the region around the individual. To achieve it, we discard the traditional crossover and mutation and design a novel method based on the covariance matrix leaning to generate high quality solutions. The best individual found so far is used as the mean of a Gaussian distribution and the covariance of the best &#955; individuals in the population are used as the evaluation of its covariance matrix and we sample the next generation individual from the Gaussian distribution other than using crossover and mutation. In the process of generating new individuals, the best individual is changed if ever a better one is found. This search strategy emphasizes the region around the best individual so that a faster convergence can be achieved. The use of switch method is to make best use of the proposed CMLSP and existing CMAES. At last, we report the results.

Objective: To investigate loss of control over eating in a sample of obese youngsters seeking treatment.

Method: Obese youngsters (aged 10â€“16) were categorized into those having experienced loss of control (LC) and those who had not (NoLC) using the child version of the Eating Disorder Examination. Furthermore, the LC group was subdivided into an objective binge eating (OBE) and a subjective binge eating (SBE) group. The groups were compared on psychological measures.

Results: LC subjects (17.9%) showed more concern about eating, weight and shape. They also reported more emotional and external eating behaviors and more depression. Youngsters who report SBE show resemblances to both NoLC and OBE subjects.

Discussion: LC subjects are characterized by more eating-related psychopathology and higher levels of depression. Especially obese youngsters with OBE turned out to be a pathological group.

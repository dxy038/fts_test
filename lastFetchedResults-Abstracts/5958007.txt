This paper presents analysis of electricity generation using stand-alone hybrid renewable energy resources for typical household in remote area situated in the eastern Indonesia. In the previous study, the optimum sizing problem is solved with PV/battery/wind-hybrid system without any generator addition. In this study, gasoline generator is added as a non-renewable resource option for 3 hybrid system alternatives, for which systemÂ´s reliability and economic, and energy storage requirement is analyzed. The main objective is to determine the optimum size to meet the daily energy requirement based on available technology options. The analysis results show that PV/battery/wind-hybrid system is the most economically feasible with the cost of energy US$ 0.817/kWh, and system reliability remains unaffected in the absence of generator.

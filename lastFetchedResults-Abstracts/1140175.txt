The objective of the study was to compare the quality of cakes during baking in microwave, infrared (IR) and IR-microwave combination ovens. Quality parameters evaluated were weight loss, specific volume, firmness and colour of cakes. As control, conventionally baked cakes were used. Cakes baked in a microwave oven had the lowest quality. It was possible to achieve surface colour formation in cakes by IR and IR-microwave combination baking. IR-microwave combination baking reduced weight loss and firmness while it increased the volume of microwave baked breads. Halogen lamp-microwave combination oven produced cakes having similar firmness and colour values with conventionally baked ones. The best conditions for baking of cakes in IR-microwave combination oven was 5 min at 70% halogen lamp and at 50% microwave power levels. When an IR-microwave combination oven was used at this condition conventional baking time of cakes was reduced by about 75%.

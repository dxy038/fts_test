A multidisciplinary workshop, Bridging the Digital Divide for Work and Play, was held November 3-4, 2001, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The meeting attempted to identify the critical areas where research and development are needed to increase literacy in both developed and developing countries, while bridging the digital divide more generally. The paper, containing an account of the discussions at the workshop, addresses another objective of the workshop, i.e., the wide dissemination of its ideas. An important conclusion of the deliberations was that new inventions in hardware, systems, and software were not the key issues. Instead, designers need to rethink their specifications away from fastest, smallest, and leading edge as prime considerations. Trade-offs that emphasize worldwide access, affordability, stability, and simplicity of use can make a significant contribution towards bridging the digital divide. Although not specifically addressed in our conclusions, it is important to recognize the motivations for learning to use new tools and technology. These are different by age group, with children and seniors wanting to "play", while working adults learn best when it has a positive impact on their work.

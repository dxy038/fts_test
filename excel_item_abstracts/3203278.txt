This paper addresses the problem of stabilizing a class of nonlinear systems with time delay using a fuzzy impulsive controller. The class of nonlinear systems with time delay considered is described by a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. We develop a systematic technique based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method to obtain delay-dependent fuzzy impulsive controller which guarantees the fuzzy impulsive control system with delay to be exponentially stable. Two simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy impulsive controller.

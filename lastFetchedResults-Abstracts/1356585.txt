The objective of the European 6th framework project EUROTRANS is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of transmutation of high level nuclear waste using accelerator driven systems. Within this objective the design of a European experimental ADS should demonstrate the technical feasibilities to transmute a sizeable amount of waste and to operate an ADS safely. This ADS will be a subcritical reactor system having liquid lead–bismuth eutectic as coolant. The liquid lead–bismuth eutectic is also intended to serve as target material for the spallation reaction which forms a crucial part to the subcritical reactor core. Since lead–bismuth eutectic is used as core coolant and spallation material, knowledge of its thermal hydraulic behaviour is essential. Within the DEMETRA domain of the EUROTRANS project, basic thermal hydraulic studies in order to support the design and safety analysis of XT-ADS components and the development of measurement techniques have been started.

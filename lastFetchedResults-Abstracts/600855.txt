Background: Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery )CABG) is one of the most common surgery procedures performed annually in worldwide. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence and risk factors of the early neurologic complications emerged after CABG surgery.
Materials and Methods: In a cross-sectional study we have investigated 160 consecutive patients undergoing CABG between July 2008 and April 2011 in cardiac surgery ward. Risk factors that evaluated in our analysis consist of hypertension (HTN), diabetes, age, sex, perioperative Myocardial Infarction (MI), postoperative atrial fibrillation, duration of aortic clamp, severity of carotid artery stenosis and addiction. Our dependent variables were delirium, CVA and seizure. The data were analyzed by SPSS-16 with Chi-square test and p < 0.05.
Results: In our analysis, of total 160 patients, 58 (36.2%) were female. Mean age of patients was 62.7±9.6 years. Of total patients, 71 (44.4%) were found to have HTN, 35.6% had diabetes, 18.8% had atrial fibrillation, 30.6% had a history of preoperative MI and 10.6% had addiction. Mean time of aorta clamp time was 78.5±8.9 min. The incidence rate of delirium after CABG was 12 out of 160 patients (7.5%) and for CVA were 2 (1.2%). There was not any seizure among our population. Of total patients, 7% of diabetic patients, 8.5% of patients with HTN, 16.7% with atrial fibrillation and 8.2% of patients with a history of preoperative MI affected with delirium after the CABG surgery. In our analysis, no significant correlation observed between delirium and these risk factors. In present study, duration of aortic clamp had a significant relation with CVA after CABG (p=0.0001). 
Conclusion: According to this analysis, duration of aorta clamp time is one of the most important risk factors of CVA after CABG.

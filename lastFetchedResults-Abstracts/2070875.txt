The present study was conducted in Lahaul-Valley of Himachal Pradesh in North western Himalayas with the objective to know the influence of different sites on cut flower and bulb production in different groups of lilium hybrids. During the study an intensive survey was conducted and data were collected on existing genotypes from four different sites located at different altitudes viz., Kuthvihal (10302 feet), Gondhla (10726 feet), Dalang (9781 feet) and Phura (9600 feet). The results showed that bulbs grown at Dalang site had shorter growing cycle than those grown at other two sites. Plant height and number of flowers per stem were comparable except for Asiatic hybrid ‘Navona’ at Dalang and Gondhla; Oriental hybrids ‘Rubato’, ‘Tiara’ and ‘Mother Choice’ showed a lower number of flowers per stem at Dalang. The three main hybrid groups behaved differently according to temperature conditions. Asiatic and Oriental hybrids were better adapted to cooler climates. Fresh weight of Asiatic hybrids ‘Navona’ and ‘Brunello’ were significantly higher at Dalang, Kuthvihal and Phura. In Oriental hybrids fresh weight and size of harvested bulbs were higher at Kuthvihal. Moreover, the results indicated that dry temperate regions of Himachal Pradesh are suitable for quality cut flower and bulb production of lilium.

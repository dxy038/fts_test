Digital halftoning quantizes a graylevel image to one
bit per pixel. Halftoning by error diffusion reduces local quantization
error by filtering the quantization error in a feedback loop.
In this paper, we linearize error diffusion algorithms by modeling
the quantizer as a linear gain plus additive noise. We confirm the
accuracy of the linear model in three independent ways. Using the
linear model, we quantify the two primary effects of error diffusion:
edge sharpening and noise shaping. For each effect, we develop
an objective measure of its impact on the subjective quality
of the halftone. Edge sharpening is proportional to the linear gain,
and we give a formula to estimate the gain from a given error filter.
In quantifying the noise, we modify the input image to compensate
for the sharpening distortion and apply a perceptually weighted
signal-to-noise ratio to the residual of the halftone and modified
input image.We compute the correlation between the residual and
the original image to show when the residual can be considered
signal independent.We also compute a tonality measure similar to
total harmonic distortion. We use the proposed measures for edge
sharpening, noise shaping, and tonality to evaluate the quality of
error diffusion algorithms.

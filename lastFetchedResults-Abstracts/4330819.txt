The IEEE 802.16 standard for wireless metropolitan area networks (WMAN) has been created to meet the need of wide-range broadband wireless access at low cost. The objective of this paper is to study how to exploit spectral reuse in an IEEE 802.16 mesh network through timeslot allocation, bandwidth adaptation, hierarchical scheduling, and routing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which formally quantifies spectral reuse in IEEE 802.16 mesh networks and which exploits spectral efficiency under an integrated framework. Simulation results show that the proposed spectral reuse scheduling and load-aware routing significantly enhance the network throughput performance in IEEE 802.16 mesh networks.

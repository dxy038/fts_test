ChinaÂ´s regional power grid trading institutions undertake the plan of implementation of various provisions of the inter provincial electricity trade promote and maintain the remaining places in the regional electricity transactions provincial power supply and demand balance tasks. There are two main problems existing regional grid electricity trading range between introspection. (1) the lack of objective function with respect to trading decisions, mistake the power supply and demand balance this constraint conditions as the target; (2) the lack of impact analysis and optimization prior trading scheme for uncertainties. This paper summarizes the current practices and policy requirements of the regional grid electricity transaction, take inter provincial electricity trade as decision variables, the province and the provincial or regional power balance between transmission constraints as constraint conditions, establish a regional power grid intrapersonal power transaction optimization decision model. Papers in the five typical scenarios of water runoff uncertainty and market demand uncertainty conducted a simulation analysis. The results show that: in an uncertain situation. The use of the model to optimize trading decisions can only guarantee the provinces after power balance in the region, but also makes the regional power grid optimization benefits than do the benefits.

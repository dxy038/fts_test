Summary from only given. We have developed a fiber-based reflected light confocal microscope that has a miniature objective for easier access to tissue and a hydraulic mechanism for positioning the objective and changing the image depth within tissue. Confocal images are produced by raster scanning the illumination spot over the proximal end of the fiber bundle and synchronizing the operations of the scanners and the frame grabber.

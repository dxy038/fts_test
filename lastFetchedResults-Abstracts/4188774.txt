Results obtained by two high-order signal processing methods applied to ultrawideband (UWB) radar data in the UHF band are described. The UWB radar data were collected in a specially designed bistatic test range. Four types of UWB signals were used to test a metal (reference) plate, five different commercially available radar absorbing material samples with metal backing, and five natural material (clutter) samples. The objective was to assess the potential of the authorsÂ´ UWB signal modalities and associated signal processing techniques in extracting reliable and distinct characterizations of different target materials. Pseudorandom UWB radar waveforms were used, and the collected data were analyzed using two high-order spectral processing (HOSP) methods: bispectral analysis and Kernel analysis. The radar problem was cast in a black-box system identification context, allowing the interpretation of the obtained results as a system/target identifiers and the use of the HOSP techniques in this context. The preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this radar technology and processing methodology and provide intriguing possibilities in utilizing this approach for target/material characterizations

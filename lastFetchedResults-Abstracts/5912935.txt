In the existing research on discrete cosine transform (DCT) based Just Noticeable Distortion (JND) methods, most only consider the luminance effect, and the color influence is considered less completely. So these JND models have not positive effects on color image. In this paper, a DCT based JND model for color image is proposed, which incorporates the color contrast sensitivity function, the frequency property of DCT coefficient, the luminance adaptation effect and the contrast masking effect. Experimental results show that the proposed model is consistent with the human visual system. Compared with other JND models, the proposed model can tolerate more objective distortion while having the same subjective perceptual quality.

The authors propose a method to make a mobile robot push a box from one plane to another. They first define the circumferential conditions and derive the equations of motion for a robot and pushed object. The validity of the proposed dynamic equations has been proved by experiments. The goal-seeking strategy is adopted for the robotÂ´s motor control. The objective of control is to direct a pushed object toward the goal. Based on the automatic control theory, a control law for this system was derived. To speed up the computing process, all the variables are divided into intervals, and the control law is converted into the form of a decision table. Many experiments have been done which proved the feasibility of the proposals

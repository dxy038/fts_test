PWM plus phase-shift (PPS) control technique is a technique combining PWM control technique and phase-shift control technique. PPS control bidirectional DC-DC converters have two regulating parameters, that is duty cycle D and phase-shift angles Phi. The paper proposed a new technique based on state-space averaging technique for modeling PWM plus phase-shift (PPS) controlled active clamping boost to full bridge bi-directional dc-dc converters, and derives the dynamic model of an active clamping boost to full bridge bi-directional dc-dc converter. The modeling technique is verified by both simulation and experiment

A study regarding the performance comparison of three different types of long distance fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors based on bidirectional Raman and erbium-doped fiber (EDF) amplification has been carried out to determine the most power-efficient and accurate configuration. The results of our experimentation showed that the sensor system with the EDF located prior to the Raman amplification section provided the best performance in regards to its pump power efficiency, electrical signal-to-noise ratio, and measurement accuracy.

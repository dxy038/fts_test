One approach to image segmentation defines a function of image partitions whose maxima correspond to perceptually salient segments. We extend previous approaches following this framework by requiring that our image model sharply decreases in its power to organize the image as a segment’s boundary is perturbed from its true position. Instead of making segment boundaries prefer image edges, we add a term to the objective function that seeks a sharp change in fitness with respect to the entire contour’s position, generalizing from edge detection’s search for sharp changes in local image brightness. We also introduce a prior on the shape of a salient contour that expresses the observed multi-scale distribution of contour curvature for physical contours. We show that our new term correlates strongly with salient structure. We apply our method to real images and verify that the new term improves performance. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art approaches validate our method’s advantages.

An attempt was made to obtain from two subjective and one objective intelligibility measures additional information concerning the type of deterioration the speech signal was subjected to. For this method a data reduction of the original phoneme scores and phoneme confusions was applied. This procedure was also performed for an objective (intelligibility related) physical measure, the STI. Promising results on the classification of speech transmission systems were obtained, especially with the objective method. The method based on subjective measures may also be of interest for the classification of hearing disorders.

Objective Offspring of depressed parents
are at increased risk for depressive and other
disorders. We recently found that when depressed
mothers reached full remission over 3 months of
treatment, a significant improvement in the children’s
disorders occurred. Since only a third of the
mothers remitted, factors related to maternal
remission rates, and thereby child outcomes, were
important. This report examined the relationship of
the presence of a father in the household to maternal
depression remission and child outcomes. Method
Maternal depression was measured using the 17-item
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD17);
social functioning was assessed using the Social
Adjustment Scale-Self Report (SAS-SR). Children
(age 7–17) were assessed independently, blind to
maternal outcome, using the Schedule for Affective
Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children
(K-SADS-PL) and the Child Global Assessment
Scale (C-GAS). Results Single mothers (n = 50), as
compared to those in two-parent households
(n = 61), were more likely to discontinue treatment
(31% vs. 16%, P = 0.04), and less likely to remit if
they remained in treatment (20% vs. 43%,
P = 0.013). These differences remained significant
after adjusting for socioeconomic status and potential
confounders, but were partially explained by the
mother’s pre-treatment social functioning. The
reduction in child diagnoses following maternal
remission was greater in two-parent than in singleparent
households, although a formal test of interaction
between the odds ratios was not significant.
Conclusion Single depressed mothers are more likely
to drop out of treatment, and less likely to reach
remission if they stay in treatment. This high-risk
group requires vigorous treatment approaches

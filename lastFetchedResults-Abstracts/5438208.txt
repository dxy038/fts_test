This paper represents a summary of a study conducted for the US Environmental Protection AgencyÂ´s Common Sense Initiative, which analyzed the economic data associated with a number of Electronic Product Recovery and Recycling (EPR2) programs in the United States. The study gathered both cost and revenue data from five collection programs in order to calculate the net cost of operating the program. The objective was to determine if there are similarities in the economics of different collection models. While no trends in net cost for collection were determined, insight into the barriers and advantages of different collection models was gained

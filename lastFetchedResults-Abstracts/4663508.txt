In this paper we are interested in the implementation of the Yee finite-difference in time domain (FDTD) of a ground penetrating radar (GPR) model using an electromagnetic differentiated Gaussian pulse (EDGP) propagation by using the MATLAB code and taking into account the: stability criterion and the perfect matched layer (PML). The source emits an (EDGP) from a free space and hits a slab which is formed by a dispersive multilayer media. Our objective is to assess the modelling and the detection of buried objects when using the (GPR) and to see the frequency effect excitation source on the medium. It is clearly shown that with the increase of the frequency, the pulse attenuation increases too. Our code, which can be used to detect metal or plastic materials in a slab like concrete or soil (with every electrical conductivity and permittivity of each layer such as used in non destructive techniques in civilian engineering) is well commented, relatively easy to understand and can be easily modified for userÂ´s specific purpose such as taking any kind of soil for detecting any kind of objects.

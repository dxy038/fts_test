The objective of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of a physical water treatment (PWT) technology using oscillating RF (radio frequency) electric fields in water to mitigate both mineral and bio-fouling in a cooling water application. Heat transfer tests were conducted using a laboratory-scale cooling tower to determine fouling resistance over time, and bio-fouling tests were performed using a heterotrophic plate count method to measure colony forming units (CFU) values per milliliter of cooling water. The results indicated that the present PWT technology could provide an effective mineral fouling prevention by maintaining 90% of the peak heat transfer performance of a heat exchanger, while effectively controlling water-borne microbial organisms.

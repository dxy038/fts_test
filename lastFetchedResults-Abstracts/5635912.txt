A computationally efficient method to encode the spatial concentration of colors in images based on local histogram intersection is introduced. The representation allows image matching at multiple resolutions and partial matching of image regions without requiring image segmentation or cluster approximations. The method has been tested on a heterogeneous database of 16643 images and video frames. Results of objective evaluation using manually selected ground-truth image queries as well as ground-truth video keyframe queries are presented

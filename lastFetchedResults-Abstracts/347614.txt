Objective: To highlight the role of EEG in the diagnosis of SSPE.
Methods: EEG was performed in an 18 month old girl who had a 1 week history of repeated episodes of sudden flexion of the head and trunk and frequent falls.
Results: EEG abnormalities consisted of stereotyped, generalized and synchronous high amplitude periodic complexes. These abnormalities correlated with brief episodes of axial and upper limb atonia on electromyogram examination. They persisted during sleep although abnormal movements disappeared. Biological results and cerebral MRI confirmed the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.
Conclusions: This case is exceptional because of the age of the patient, the clinical presentation and the mode of contamination and it highlights the role of EEG in this diagnosis.

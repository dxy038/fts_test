Purpoe
To invetigate the utility of the 25-Item National Eye Intitute Viual Function Quetionnaire (VFQ-25) in aeing viual function in a heterogeneou group of multiple cleroi (M) patient and to identify correlation of VFQ-25 core with clinically relevant objective viual parameter.
Deign

Comparative cohort tudy.
Method

The VFQ-25 wa ditributed to 34 patient with clinically definite M. Patient underwent a comprehenive ophthalmic examination, including Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy tudy (ETDR) viual acuity (VA), Pelli-Robon contrat enitivity (C), Humphrey viual field 30 to 2 (HVF), and Farnworth-Munell 100-Hue color viion (100-Hue). Expanded Diability tatu core (ED) were recorded for each patient. Comparative analye uing χ2 tet and t tet were performed. pearman rank correlation coefficient were computed to identify relationhip between VFQ-25 core and the aforementioned viual parameter.
Reult

In comparion with a publihed reference group without ocular dieae, M patient had coniderably wore VFQ-25 compoite core (P < .01), being imilar to publihed cohort of glaucoma and cataract patient. VFQ-25 compoite core were found to be modetly and ignificantly correlated with everal clinical parameter, including: VA (r = −0.63, P < .001), C (r = 0.60, P < .001), HVF (r = 0.53, P = .003), and 100-Hue (r = −0.48, P = .01). ED core, the ue of dieae modifying agent, and having a hitory of previou optic neuriti did not correlate ignificantly with VFQ-25 compoite core.
Concluion

The VFQ-25 quetionnaire i a enitive and ueful tool in aeing viual function in M patient. uch patient have quality of life indice imilar to glaucoma and cataract patient, undercoring the ignificance of viual ymptom in M.

A constant envelope multi-carrier modulation scheme is proposed that combines DCT (discrete cosine transform) based multi-carrier modulation and continuous phase modulation (CPM) with the objective of producing a constant envelope waveform. Guard interval and frequency-domain equalization are used to remove ISI on frequency-selective multipath channels. Phase detection and correction is implemented with oversampling. On the AWGN channel, error probability performance is also given and compared with that of BPSK. Simulation results are presented on a multipath fading channel to compare its performance with that of OFDM.

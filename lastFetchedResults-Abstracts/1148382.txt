Glucose oxidase (GOD) kinetics comprises a group of inhibitory, deactivant and diffusional phenomena interacting with each other in a complex way. These phenomena have given rise to differing interpretations, and their description is hindered by studies at moderate glucose concentrations (usual condition in many applications of the enzyme), the presence (or absence) of catalase in the enzymatic preparation and the biases associated to the frequent use of linear transformations for kinetic characterizations. The objective of this work is to achieve a kinetic model that integrates all the mentioned effects and allows satisfactory descriptions in conditions (frequent in microbiological context) of wide intervals of substrate concentration, at long reaction periods and in presence of catalase.

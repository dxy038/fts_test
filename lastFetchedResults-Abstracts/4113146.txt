The authors develop a state variable feedback control for a class of assembly operations. The objective of this control is to increase the number of jobs completed within a time horizon T while keeping the job cycle times within an acceptable range with a prespecified probability. The assembly operations are modeled as stochastic timed-event graphs which in the (max, +) algebra are characterized by a set of linear stochastic difference equations

The testbed MOSART presented in this paper constitutes one way of using an integration framework based on the high level architecture (HLA) for real-time and non real-time applications. The potential of the system is shown in a simple surveillance scenario, but the results indicate that MOSART can be used also for very complex scenarios with many different subsystems involved. The primary objective of the MOSART research testbed is to simplify integration of research results and other advanced functionality into larger simulations and demonstrators. The testbed is a modular software environment which provides basic simulation functionality and enables an efficient integration of in-house and commercial software. The testbed consists of four main parts, which are presented in this paper.

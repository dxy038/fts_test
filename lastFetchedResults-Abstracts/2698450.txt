Resistive superconducting fault current limiters (SFCLs) offer the advantages of low weight and compact structure. Magnesium diboride (MgB<sub>2</sub>) in simple round wire form has been previously tested and shown to be suitable as a low-cost resistive SFCL. The primary objective of this work was to design a resistive SFCL for an 11-kV substation using multiple MgB<sub>2</sub> wire strands. This paper will look into the options for the coil design. Two types of low-inductance solenoidal coils, namely, the series-connected coil and the parallel-connected coil, were theoretically examined and compared. This paper also reports the experimental results of two multistrand MgB<sub>2</sub> prototype coils used as a resistive SFCL. This paper demonstrates the potential of SFCL coils using multistrand MgB<sub>2</sub> wire for distribution network levels.

Objective The aim of this study was to provide
a clinical and epidemiological profile of patients
consulting the psychiatric emergency team (PET) of an
emergency service of a Belgian university hospital.
Method Of all PET patients (N=1,050), demographic
characteristics, axis I diagnosis, any axis II diagnosis,
presenting problems, psychiatric antecedents, and patterns
of referral were assessed. Results Male patients
presented more with hostility or violence towards others
(10 %) and substance abuse (23 %); female patients
presented more with suicidality (31%) and depressed
mood (24 %).Male patients had more psychoactive substance
use disorders (21 %); female patients had more
mood (21%) and adjustment disorders (19 %). About
50% of the patients were unemployed and had sought
psychiatric help in the past. Female patients were more
often referred by the emergency physician (35%) and
health care professionals (29 %); male patients were
more often self-referred (23 %) and referred by the police
(9 %). Conclusion A PET could overcome the discrepancy
between the need of treatment and the effective
use of mental health services.Male and female PET
patients presented different complaints and were given
different axis I diagnoses; they also had different pathways
to care

The aim of this work is to simulate rarefied gas flow in complex geometries, under flow conditions that range from the hydrodynamic, through the transitional, to the molecular regimes. Existing computational models apply to molecular or viscous flow, but the treatment of the transitional flow is still underdeveloped.

l with the difficult transitional flow, two models with overlapping ranges of applicability are introduced. A direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) type model, which can be used in the molecular and up to the lower transitional flow, has been designed. For the viscous to the upper transitional flow, a numerical model using a particle method is proposed. The objective is to obtain a smooth transition between the probabilistic simulation of particle histories and the deterministic approach of the solution of partial differential equations.

MC model has been successfully applied to molecular and lower transitional flow in a complex geometry with stationary and moving boundaries. The test results agree well with published data. The particle method was tested using simplified Navier-Stokes equations in a channel. Preliminary results in the low viscous range seem to indicate that the approach is viable.

Objective: Previous reports have suggested that dialysate levels of lgG and C3 correlate inversely with the likelihood of developing peritonitis.Material and Methods: In a prospective study, we measured lgG and C3 in the overnight dialysate (8-11 h dwell) in 34 CAPD patients over 24 months (monthly levels taken where possible).Results: During this period 24 patients had 1 or more episodes of peritonitis, and 10 had none. There were no significant differences between lgG and C3 levels in the two groups at any time point, and large inter-patient and intra-patient variation in levels were seen.Conclusion: Dialysate levels of lgG and C3 from the overnight dwell are not predictive of the risk of developing CAPD peritonitis. Furthermore, no correlation was found between opsonin levels and onset of clinical peritonitis.

Introducing a middleware layer into wireless sensor networks is a widely accepted solution to facilitate application programming and to allow network organization. In this paper we introduce FACTS, a highly flexible middleware architecture able to provide support for a wide range of different applications. Instead of developing middleware and application apart from one another, we seek to combine them at programming level. Our rule-based language, tailored to this concept and the domain of networked sensors, enables high-level software development. The objective is to combine advantages of event-centric processing and rule-based execution while preserving low resource usage

The objective of the Atlas Reliability Enhancement Program (AREP) was to improve the reliability of the Atlas IIA Launch Vehicle without degrading its performance. This objective was achieved by developing an electronically enhanced rocket engine, the Pratt &amp; Whitney (P&amp;W) RL1OE-1, for the Centaur Upper Stage. Less than three years after AREP began, the USAF terminated the program halfway through the test phase of the second developmental engine. Even though the program ended before a single RL10E-1 engine was shipped, a legacy of lessons learned were indwelled in the experiences of the individuals who participated in the program. AREP was the first DoD launch vehicle program to operate under the new Acquisition Reform Initiative, which went into effect in June 1994. Under Acquisition Reform, acquisition processes are supposed to be based on measurable performance criteria. However, not every organization that participates in the development of a new system knows how to define a measurable performance criterion. That was the challenge facing Lockheed Martin Astronautics (LMA) when it came time to implement a process to manage AREP Reliability risk. Knowing what LMA did for AREP provides insight for others wishing to define a performance-based reliability program. This paper is based on a technical report written by The Aerospace Corporation. The information in this paper is structured in a manner that facilitates communicating valuable lessons learned that are comprehensible to the novice and useful to the expert

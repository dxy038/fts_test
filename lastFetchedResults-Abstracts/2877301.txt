Time varying nature of the constraints, objectives and parameters that characterize several practical optimization problems have led to the field of dynamic optimization with Evolutionary Algorithms. In recent past, very few researchers have concentrated their efforts on the study of Dynamic multi-objective Optimization Problems (DMOPs) where the dynamicity is attributed to multiple objectives of conflicting nature. Considering the lack of a somewhat diverse and challenging set of benchmark functions, in this article, we discuss some ways of designing DMOPs and propose some general techniques for introducing dynamicity in the Pareto Set and in the Pareto Front through shifting, shape variation, slope variation, phase variation, and several other types. We introduce 9 benchmark functions derived from the benchmark suite used for the 2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation competition on bound-constrained and static MO optimization algorithms. Additionally a variant of multiobjective EA based on decomposition (MOEA/D) have been put forward and tested along with peer algorithms to evaluate the newly proposed benchmarks.

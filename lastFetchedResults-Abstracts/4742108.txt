In this paper, a family of bridgeless power factor correction (PFC) rectifier which configures isolated single-stage is proposed. The proposed PFC rectifiers utilize bidirectional switch to handle both positive and negative input voltage without bridge diodes. Dual output windings of transformer enable the rectifiers dispense with any additional magnetic component. As a member of the proposed rectifier family, a bridgeless flyback PFC rectifier is analyzed and experimented to verify its higher efficiency than its conventional counterpart.

This paper proposes a multi-agent technology to energy management of the distributed generations in a micro-grid system. An introduction and analysis of the distributed intelligent multi-agent technology are presented first, including its three-layered architecture and operation mechanism. Then, the objective function about micro-grid system is given. Control strategy of a multi-agent system and several common distributed generations are presented in detail with a framework containing some kinds of agents. Discussion about the multi-agent system and each agentÂ´s behaviors are included. It demonstrates that the proposed multi-agent technology is successfully monitored, controlled and operated for the energy management of the distributed generations in micro-grid system.

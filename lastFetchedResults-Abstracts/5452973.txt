The objective of this work is to increase the range resolution of time-of-flight (ToF) cameras. Our work aims to produce a super-resolution depth map and reduce the depth error within the whole work volume using a novel multi-exposure data acquisition technique and Projection Onto Convex Sets(POCS) reconstruction. The proposed methods will also be applicable to other imaging modalities which have the capability of acquiring range data, such as LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). Performance is demonstrated on ToF and CCD camera jointly to increase both depth map and form high resolution point cloud.

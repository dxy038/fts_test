The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the benefits of using multiterminal DC links in distribution systems. A three level control strategy is considered to obtain an optimal power flow and to improve the voltages transient behavior. Analysis and simulations are carried out over a medium voltage benchmark distribution network from IEEE/CIGRE. Power losses reduction and improved voltage profiles can be obtained by an adequate control of the power flows. Two transient analysis showing the fault ride through capability and voltage sag mitigation are performed. In addition a scaled experimental setup is used to validate simulation results.

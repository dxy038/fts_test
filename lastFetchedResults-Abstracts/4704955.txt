Vehicle scheduling problem is a common problem in trucking industry. Because of the existence of a large number of constraints, it is difficult to obtain the optimal solution. This issue has been an NP difficult problem. In this paper, we will both establish bi-objective vehicle scheduling model with the goal that shortest vehicle Run and least number of vehicles and solve this problem using of genetic algorithm. Practical application justify that the model and algorithm can quickly obtain the optimal solution of the problem.

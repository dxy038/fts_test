Heavy pigs are used in Italy to produce fresh meat, dry-cured ham, salami and lard. Fatty acid profile determines both the dietary and organoleptic qualities of these products. The objective was to study the polymorphisms of two genes that code for enzymes of the fatty acid metabolism, namely, Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and Fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2). We also investigated the polymorphism of the Sterol regulatory element binding protein gene (SREBF1) as it regulates SCD and FADS2 transcription. Significant associations of SCD were found with the ratio of oleic to stearic acid; with the concentration (g/100 g of fat) of stearic and oleic acids. The concentrations of arachidonic and linoleic acids and the ratio of dihomo-gamma-linolenic to linoleic acid were significantly associated with FADS2 polymorphisms. SREBF1 polymorphism was associated with oleic acid concentrations and the ratio of arachidonic to linoleic acids.

ndings suggest that the SCD, FADS2 and SREBF1 polymorphisms are associated with dietary quality of heavy pig meat products.

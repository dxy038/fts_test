In order to better simulate objective´s vibration in transportation. A new vibration test whose each arm connected with crank-rocker mechanism is brought forward on the basis of Delta parallel mechanism. It can carry out vibration from three different directions. Given the inverse position analysis. The objective function is to satisfy harmonic oscillation of moveplatform under the constant speed of mechanical crank. Then each arm´s dimension parameters are computed by the method of optimal design in order to creat condition for designing 3D vibration test with 5~40Hz.

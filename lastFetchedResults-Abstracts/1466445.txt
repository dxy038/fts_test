Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with various human diseases. Phenylbutyric acid (PBA) is a well-known chemical chaperone that regulates ER stress. The main objective of this study was to develop a simple, rapid, and sensitive method for the simultaneous determination of phenylbutyric acid and its metabolite, phenylacetic acid (PAA). A LC–MS/MS analysis using negative electrospray ionization was used. Samples were analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in 15 min of total run time, using d11-PBA and d7-PAA as internal standards. The limit of quantification was 1 μg/g for tissue and 0.8 μg/mL for plasma. Recoveries for plasma and tissues were higher than 81% for both PBA and PAA. The inter-day and intra-day accuracy and precision were within ±15%. We then further successfully validated this method by applying it to determine the tissue distribution of PBA and its metabolite PAA after i.p. injection of PBA at a dose of 500 mg/kg in mice. The maximum concentrations of PBA and PAA in plasma and tissues were seen at 15 min and 45 min, respectively. The PBA plasma concentration was 15-fold higher than the concentration in the kidney, whereas the PAA plasma concentration was 6-fold higher than the concentration in the liver. The area under the curve decreased in the order of plasma &gt; kidney &gt; liver &gt; heart &gt; muscle &gt; lung for PBA and plasma &gt; liver &gt; kidney &gt; heart &gt; muscle &gt; lung for PAA. The tissue to plasma ratio ranged from 0.007 to 0.063 for PBA and 0.016 to 0.109 for PAA. In summary, the LC–ESI-MS method developed in this study is simple, sensitive and reliable.

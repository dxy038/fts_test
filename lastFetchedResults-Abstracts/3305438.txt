Integrated process planning and scheduling is a significant research focus in recent years, which could improve the performance of manufacturing system. In real manufacturing environment, multi-objectives should be taken into consideration simultaneously during the machining process. Meanwhile, the processing time for each job is often imprecise in many real applications. Therefore, multi-objective integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS) problem with fuzzy processing time is addressed in this paper. The processing time is described as triangular fuzzy number. A multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is designed to search for the Pareto solutions of multi-objective IPPS problem with fuzzy processing time. An instance has been designed to test the performance of proposed algorithm. The experiment result shows that the proposed MOGA could obtain satisfactory Pareto solutions for the multi-objective IPPS problem with fuzzy processing time.

The architecture and technology features of the Collins next generation (NGR) digital GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver are described. The objective of this project was to develop an advanced GPS receiver chipset with high antijam capabilities. This program, initiated in 1985, has provided the technology for miniature receiver products for both unmanned and manned vehicle applications. A two-channel version of the receiver is in full-scale development for tactile missile applications. A five-channel version is in test and evaluation as a drop-in replacement for RCVR-3A, the US Department of Defense standard high dynamic receiver. The NGR design started with the digital signal processing architecture developed for the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) handheld GPS receiver. Enhancements were made to improve the antijam and signal acquisition performance. Producible, qualifiable, and cost-effective silicon monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) and semicustom digital technologies were used to develop the core GPS chipset. A system design approach was established to permit reuse of mature and validated GPS software

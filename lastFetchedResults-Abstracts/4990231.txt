Ultrasound contrast agents can be used to detect the microcirculation. In this study, we ask the question whether they can help characterize its morphology. Our objective is to establish whether destruction-reperfusion dynamics of an ultrasound contrast agent can reveal morphological information about the microcirculation. Two fractal vascular models are developed that represent organized ´kidney-like´ and disorganized ´tumour-like´ structures. The models are generated using simple rules of branching and fractal geometry. Flow and destruction-reperfusion are simulated using fundamental laws of hemodynamics. The flow conditions are matched in the models. In principle, the form of the destruction-reperfusion curve may offer information not only relating to vascular volume and flowrate, but also to the organization of the microvascular network

Erbium-doped silica and fluorophosphate fibre amplifiers pumped at 800 nm are examined using a highly quantitative model. The bidirectional pumping scheme is more efficient when excited state absorption is significant. The fluorophosphate glass host is at least 60% more efficient than the Al/P silica.

Background and Objective: Asthma management has improved markedly over the last 50 years, largely due to the introduction of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in the early 1980s. Nevertheless, good-quality outcome in asthma hinge not just on the availability of medication but also on their appropriate use by patients. The outcome of non adherence is loss of opportunities for patients to improve their health, and loss of medication by health-care systems, with subsequent effect of increased mortality. This study was conducted to survey the effect of education and regular follow up on adherence rate of children with mild to moderate persistent asthma.
Materials and Methods: In a semi-experimental study (before and after), two groups of children with mild to moderate persistent asthma, referred to outpatient clinic of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences were compared. First group included 200 asthmatic children who were treated at least for duration of one year by conventional method. The second group included 300 patients at the same age and severity of disease that were treated at least one year by a comprehensive plan of education and regular follow up visits as well. Data were analyzed by chi-square and P<0.05 was considered as significant difference.
Results: Findings indicate that in first group 100(50%) and second group 295(84/3%) had adherence rate more than 50% (/MXOO). Considering adherence rate of > 50% there was significant difference between two groups with mild persistent asthma (/^O.OO).
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that education and scheduled follow up can result in higher degree of adherence.

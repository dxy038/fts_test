Erva-mate (Ilex paraguariensis St. Hil.) is a native species from temperate regions of South America, such as Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina, that is consumed as a beverage known as mate. The objective of this research was to determine the content of caffeic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeine, and gallic acid in mate to explain their influence in beverage taste and sensory differences between native and reforested plants, as well as between beverages from plants of different regions of Brazil (Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul states). Compounds were determined by HPLC and results were related to a sensory evaluation performed by trained tasters. Tasters considered the beverage from reforested plants to be more bitter than the beverage from native plants. Beverages from reforested plants had significantly higher caffeic acid and lower catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeine, and gallic acid content than native plants. Beverages from plants of Santa Catarina state had significantly higher catechin, caffeine, and gallic acid content than plants from Rio Grande do Sul state.

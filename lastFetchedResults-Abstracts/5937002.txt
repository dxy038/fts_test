Considering the deficiencies of the indexes weight method in present risk evaluation, firstly, a formula of calculating the relative significance of indexes was proposed by using rough set theory and the traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method calculation subjective weight was improved. Then the synthesis optimization process was carried on with entropy value method of the objective weight to obtain the combination weight of the evaluation indexes. Finally, the combination weight method was proposed for selecting the value of the favorable coefficient of the subjective and objective weight of the evaluation indexes. The objective and subjective aspects of indexes were taken into account in this method, and a relatively reasonable weight value may be obtained by combining the expert judgment and the objective analysis

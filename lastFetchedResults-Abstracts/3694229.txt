A carrier assignment problem, suitable for engineering the complex interference conditions of 2.5G and broadband fixed wireless access wireless environments, is addressed. The objective function minimizes the interference levels imposed by the carrier allocation, while the constraints assign the carriers required per cell and prevent unacceptable interference situations. The problem is formally stated and mathematically formulated. Solutions, adhering to the genetic algorithm and the simulated annealing paradigms, are discussed and indicative results are presented.

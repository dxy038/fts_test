This paper proposes a selective particle swarm optimization (SPSO) to select optimal capacitor placement and conductor sizing for maximum loss reduction and voltage profile improvement. The problem is posed as an optimization problem with an objective to minimize the total cost of power losses, fixed capacitors and branch conductors. The optimization procedure is subject to some technical constraints, which are voltage limit and maximum permissible carrying current of conductorÂ´s size. The proposed algorithm have been implemented and tested on a 27-bus power system.

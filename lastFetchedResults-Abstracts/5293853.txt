Net end-of-life aging prediction under realistic use conditions is the key objective for any product aging model. In this paper, a net degradation model is introduced and effects such as recovery, subsequent degradation, frequency, duty cycle, and recovery bias are evaluated. The high-kappa recovery behavior observed is consistent with SiO<sub>2</sub> gate stacks, which allows the use of SiO<sub>2</sub> models to predict recovery in both NMOS and PMOS high-kappa transistors.

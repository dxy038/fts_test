In recent years, distributed generation (DG) and renewable energies source (RES) are attracting special attention to distribution systems. Renewable energy such as photovoltaic system and wind turbine generator are used as the sources of green energy. However, the large amount of distributed generation causes voltage deviation beyond the statutory range in distribution systems. This paper proposes a decision technique of optimal reference scheduling of the battery energy storage system and the existing voltage control devices for optimal distribution system operation. In this proposed method, the formulated control objective is solved by optimization algorithm. The proposed method achieves the following be a tunes: The node voltage in maintained in the acceptable range, the fluctuation of active power flow in reduced at the interconnection point in the distribution system, and the total distribution loss are reduced. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by numerical simulations with using MATLAB<sup>&#174;</sup>.

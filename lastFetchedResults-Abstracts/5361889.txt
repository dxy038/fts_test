The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is based on VHF radio transmissions of shipsÂ´ identity, position, speed and heading, in addition to other key parameters. In 2004, the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) undertook studies to evaluate if the AIS signals could be detected in low Earth orbit. Since then, the interest in Space-Based AIS reception has grown significantly, and both public and private sector organizations have established programs to study the issue, and demonstrate such a capability in orbit. FFI is conducting two such programs. The objective of the first program was to launch a nano-satellite equipped with an AIS receiver into a near polar orbit, to demonstrate Space-Based AIS reception at high latitudes. The satellite was launched from India 12<sup>th</sup> July 2010. Even though the satellite has not finished commissioning, the receiver is operated with real-time transmission of received AIS data to the Norwegian Coastal Administration. The second program is an ESA-funded project to operate an AIS receiver on the European Columbus module of the International Space Station. Mounting of the equipment, the NORAIS receiver, was completed in April 2010. Currently, the AIS receiver has operated for more than three months, picking up several million AIS messages from more than 60 000 ship identities. In this paper, we will present experience gained with the space-based AIS systems, highlight aspects of tracking ships throughout their voyage, and comment on possible contributions to port security.

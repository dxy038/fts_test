Objectives. The objectives of this paper are to review the development and impact of computer-assisted learning (CAL) in dentistry with emphasis on the UK.

Data sources. This is a wide ranging review of dental, medical and technical literature.

Study selection. An attempt has been made to evaluate present knowledge in an objective manner and to make some prediction as to the future development and use of computer-based teaching methods in dentistry.

Conclusions. The introduction of computers as an educational tool in dentistry and the provision of CAL is having an impact not only on how dentists are trained but also on the skills they will need to acquire in the future to keep pace with this new technology. It is suggested that there is a great potential for computer-based continuing professional education for dental practitioners, and that the Internet will provide access to such material.

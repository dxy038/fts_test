A method to control an inverter in active parallel filter operation is presented. The method eliminates the standard PI controller in the DC bus voltage control, and the control objective is switched between two goals. Compared to standard designs, this strategy improves the filter speed of response to sudden load current changes, obtaining a very fast compensation. Simulation results are presented to validate the proposed controller

The primary objective of this paper was to present a study on the metrics which can be applied to the software evaluation framework. The paper presents the results of a preliminary study, which focuses on the measurements applied to the framework. It provides a description of the metrics used and an analysis of how they compare to each other in the measurement of the software characteristics. This objective was accomplished by empirically testing the model with quantitative techniques. An earlier qualitative study provided a list of metrics, which were then tested with the quantitative study described in this paper. The results of this study are important as it identifies the metrics, perceived by stakeholders as essential for applying the software evaluation framework to software evaluation.

This paper presents the results of a study of bends for oversized rectangular waveguide having cross-sectional dimensions in the range between 1.5 and 2.5 free-space wavelengths. It is expected that waveguide having these dimensions will be able to transmit 50 to 100 kw of average power at X-band without water cooling. The transmission of at least 5.0 megawatts of peek power at X-band without pressurization is also a design objective.

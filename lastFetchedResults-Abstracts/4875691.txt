In this paper, we study the dynamic traveling repairman problem (DTRP) for dynamic systems. In the DTRP, customers are arising dynamically and randomly in a bounded region R, and when customers arrive, they wait for the repairperson to visit their location and offer a &#194;&#191;service&#194;&#191;-that will take a certain random amount of time s-. In our study, the repairperson is modeled as a dynamic system whose output space contains R and our objective is the average time a customer has to wait to be serviced. We present schemes (for low and high traffic intensities) that guarantee that the expected waiting time for a customer scales within a constant factor of the optimum in terms of traffic intensity.

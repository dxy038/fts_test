Background: Infertility affects about 10-15% of reproductive-age couples. About half the causes of
infertility are female related and approximately 40% of the cases are caused by anovulation, mostly
in PCO women.
Objective: This study was conducted to determine and compare the effects of two drug treatment
regimens: higher dose of clomiphene and a combination of lower dose of clomiphene and tamoxifen
in treating infertile women with PCO.
Materials and Methods: The study was a randomized clinical trial conducted on 100 infertile
patients who referred to Yazd-Iran Infertility Clinic between the years 2001-2003. The patients
were selected who had received at least 3 periods of clomiphene, but no pregnancy had occurred.
They were randomly divided into two groups. In the first group, clomiphene was increased to 100
mg and the second group 20 mg of tamoxifen was added to 50 mg of clomiphene from day 5-9 of
menstruation cycle. Infertility duration, duration of medicine used, PCT score, endometrial
thickness, ovulation, and pregnancy rate were studied in both groups.
Results: Ovulation rate in clomiphene group was 54.9%; Tamoxifen + clomiphene group was
73.5% without significant differences in both groups. (PV = 0.053). Positive pregnancy rate in
clomiphene group was 39.2%; clomiphene + tamoxifen group was 61.2% (P value  <  0.05), which
could be concluded that pregnancy rate was higher in clomiphene/tamoxifen group than in the
clomiphene group. The presence of a dominant follicle in the two treatment groups in women
between 18-24 was not significant, but in women between 25-39 years was significant (PV= 0.049)
(Table III).
Conclusion: The recommendation is to add Tamoxifen to Clomiphene in 35-39 women with 20?
BMI ?26.99 before the use of gonadotropins treatment in PCOS with or without IUI, because these
options have higher risk of multiple pregnancy and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

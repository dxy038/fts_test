In this paper, multi-objective design of multi-machine power system stabilizers (PSSs) using particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed. The potential of the proposed approach for optimal setting of the widely used conventional leadâ€“lag PSSs has been investigated. The stabilizers are tuned to simultaneously shift the lightly damped and undamped electromechanical modes of all machines to a prescribed zone in the s-plane. The PSSs parameters tuning problem is converted to an optimization problem with the eigenvalue-based multi-objective function comprising the damping factor, and the damping ratio of the lightly damped electromechanical modes, which is solved by a PSO algorithm which has a strong ability to find the most optimistic results. The robustness of the proposed PSO-based PSSs (PSOPSS) is verified on a multi-machine power system under different operating conditions and disturbances. The results of the proposed PSOPSS are compared with the genetic algorithm based tuned PSS and classical PSSs through eigenvalue analysis, nonlinear time-domain simulation and some performance indices to illustrate its robust performance for a wide range of loading conditions.

The prime objective of any industrial process is to perform efficiently with variable cost reduction. Internal Model Control (IMC) is a commonly used technique that provides a transparent mode for the designing and tuning of various types of control architecture. In this paper, we have designed the internal model control for binary distillation column for SISO process. The transfer function has been taken from Wood and Berry model. The internal model control has been designed considering three strategies namely, process perfect, process mismatch with disturbances and process model with disturbance only. It has also been tried to reduce the disturbance created in the system by varying tuning parameter (&#955;).

Linkage maps are essential for genome studies in different crops. The objective of the study was to construct a linkage map using Khatoonie, a local melon accession in Iran because of its characteristics as a main accession in Iran. Hence, a cross between Khatoonie and the Drench line Charentais was made to obtain the F2 mapping population. l'o construct map, a total 42 RAPD primers was used. Linkage analysis indicated that 109 RAPDs assigned to 13 linkage groups with a total length of 504.7 cM and distance between adjacent markers in average was 5.2 cM. Adding more markers to this basic map is on going because of being in lack of any linkage map for germplasm of Iranian melon. This map can be used in marker assisted breeding projects and for map-based cloning.

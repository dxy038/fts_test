The objective of this study is the improvement in speed and regularity of transit systems using real-time control strategies, in particular, threshold-based and information-based vehicle holding. This objective is attained by taking into account the inherent uncertainty of transit operation, because of the random travel times and passenger arrivals at stops. A Monte Carlo simulation model of a single transit line is presented, with explicit representation of traffic lights. Both the straightforward threshold-based holding strategy and the strategy based on the availability of real-time information at stops, to take holding decision at single or multiple stops, are represented and compared, taking as a reference the results obtained by a conditional priority strategy at intersections, assumed to be given only by green extension actuated by local sensors. The results are evaluated and compared using performance indicators, coincident with waiting and on board time of transit users and with road traffic delay on transversal roads.

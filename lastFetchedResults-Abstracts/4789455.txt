Based on the clonal selection theory, the main mechanisms of clone, which will be explored in the field of artificial intelligence, are analyzed in this paper. An improved evolutionary strategy algorithm, immunity clonal strategy algorithm (ICS), which includes immunity monoclonal strategy algorithm (IMSA) and immunity polyclonal strategy algorithm (IPSA), is put forward. Compared with the classical evolutionary strategy algorithm (CES), ICS is shown to be an evolutionary strategy capable of solving complex machine learning tasks, like multi-objective optimization, and the results are better. Using the theories of Markov chain, it is proved that ICS algorithm is convergent.

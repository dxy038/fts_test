For wireless communications systems, this work considers a power control algorithm in which a user´s link quality objective, as measured by the signal to interference ratio (SIR), varies with its transmitter power. In particular, as increased interference or reduced uplink gain leads a mobile to raise its transmitter power, that mobile lowers its SIR target. In this way, the likelihood of an infeasible power control problem in which the users´ transmitter powers rise to a maximum, is reduced. This graceful degradation of the SIR is termed soft dropping. Convergence proofs for a soft dropping power control algorithm are presented. Simulation results for a generic CDMA system demonstrate performance improvements over fixed target SIR algorithms

The objective of the present study is development of a pulse-driven phase-controlled magnetron (PCM) in order to expand an application range of a magnetron. The pulse-driven PCM consists of a 2.45 GHz cooker magnetron, a high-voltage pulsed power supply, a reference signal and frequency/phase control circuits. The frequency and phase of the pulse- driven PCM are locked into those of the reference signal by an injection locking method and a phase-locked loop circuit. From experimental results, a kHz-class pulse- driven PCM was successfully developed.

Motivated by increased use in practice and increased interest in the media and among academics, a performance evaluation system was built based on Economic Value Added (EVA) and Balanced Scorecard (BSC) for logistics enterprises. Correlation test and linear regression were run to give empirical support for the system. Leading the long-term vision, EVA is at the top of this system. Other measures distributed in four perspectives - Financial, Customer, Internal business process and Learning and growth - are aimed to a high EVA. EVA gets significantly positive Kendall´s correlation with strategic objective whose proxy is corporate value. In linear regression whose dependent was EVA, operation cost, the first five customers´ revenue ratio, audited internal control report and staff educational ratio were used to represent the four perspectives respectively. The first and the third measures have significant coefficients consistent with theoretic analysis.

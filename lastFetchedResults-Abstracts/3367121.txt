The Interrogator is a Prolog program that searches for security vulnerabilities in network protocols for automatic cryptographic key distribution. Given a formal specification of the protocol, it looks for message modification attacks that defeat the protocol objective. It is still under developement, but is has been able to rediscover a known vulnerability in a published protocol. It is implemented in LM-Prolog on a Lisp Machine, with a graphical user interface.

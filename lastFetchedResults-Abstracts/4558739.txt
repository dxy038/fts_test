Nowadays the multidisciplinarity term is higher, because all programs are using this word, but how is this in practice? How should the conduct of the professors be? How can professors capture studentÂ´s attention? The answers for this and other questions are not simple and are becoming trivial, because it brings many concepts and paradigms that need to be overcome for everybody involved, professors and students, can create the possibility of environmentally useful projects and activities for multidisciplinarity. This paper does not have pretension of answering these questions and less likely to be the solution for multidisciplinarity problems, because only presents, with clear and objective vision, the work that we have developed, in the last years, in the computer engineering program, is trying to obtain more time for the multidisciplinarity wish in several academic activities, both in class and extra-class activities.

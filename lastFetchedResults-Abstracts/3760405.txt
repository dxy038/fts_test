The main objective of this paper is to enable bad data detection for all measurements by strategically placing a minimum number of PMUs in power systems. An algorithm is developed and presented for this purpose. An extension of the algorithm is also presented where the local redundancy is increased to some desired level by adding more PMUs. The extension of the algorithm transforms some of the critical pairs so that errors in them can be identified; however, as indicated clearly at the bottom of Section III-E2 of the paper, there is no guarantee that all critical pairs will be transformed.

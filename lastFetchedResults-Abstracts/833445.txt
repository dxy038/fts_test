A systematic approach is presented to approximate the Pareto optimal front (POF) by a response surface approximation. The data for the POF is obtained by multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Improvements to address drift in the POF are also presented. The approximated POF can help visualize and quantify trade-offs among objectives to select compromise designs. The bounds of this approximate POF are obtained using multiple convex-hulls. The proposed approach is applied to study trade-offs among objectives of a rocket injector design problem where performance and life objectives compete. The POF is approximated using a quintic polynomial. The compromise region quantifies trade-offs among objectives.

The present study applies modeling methods to study the simulated ECG of a subQ monitor with bipolar lead. The objective of the study was to analyze how different locations of ectopic activation affect the ECG obtained with horizontal and vertical electrode orientation. The ectopic activation was set to originate from 6 different locations and conduct through both ventricles. We had implants in 63 locations on anterior thorax. We analyzed the correlations between the ECG signals of horizontal and vertical orientations .The effects of activation origin on the correlation between vertical and horizontal orientations are smallest in the left thoracic region and right upper thorax. The effects of implantation and implant design on ECG should be studied by applying multiple activation sequences.

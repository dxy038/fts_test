Fuzzy Multi-objective Decision-Making (FMODM) was applied to select blasting parameters and establish fuzzy matrix for the objective functions; minimum weighting relative deviation distance method was adopted to optimize the design scheme which not only agrees with the engineering requirements, but also can cut the cost as much as possible. The optimized scheme was compared with an actual engineering data and it is indicated that the optimal parameters obtained by this scheme are basically in accordance with the engineering practice.

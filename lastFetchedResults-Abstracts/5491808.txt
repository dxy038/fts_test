A greatly enhanced cepstral-based pitch estimator which uses the MUSIC algorithm for estimating background noise characteristics is presented. This approach couples the signal enhancement capabilities of MUSIC, which is based on singular value decomposition (SVD) orthogonalization, with the harmonic spectrum estimation capabilities of the cepstrum. Marked improvements are demonstrated over standard fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based cepstral processing. Objective performance evaluations show increased frequency determination capability at low signal-to-noise ratios

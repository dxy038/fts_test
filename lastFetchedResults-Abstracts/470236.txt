Objective
This study was undertaken to assess job satisfaction and quality of life aspects among residents in obstetrics/gynecology before and after the implementation of duty-hour requirements.
Study design
We administered a survey to residents before and after duty-hour restrictions, addressing satisfaction with residency training, quality of life, and predictions/impressions of the effect of reduced work hours.
Results
Satisfaction with overall residency training as a discrete survey item did not change; however, the composite score from all responses to specific items increased. Several specific clinical and academic items garnered higher satisfaction scores in 2004. Residents reported less-than-anticipated increases in healthiness of their lifestyle and a decrease in interest in teaching.
Conclusion
This is a prospective assessment of the effect of duty-hour requirements, improvements in residents' perception of their time and ability to study and pursue research and in clinical areas are encouraging. The perception that there is less interest in teaching is of concern.

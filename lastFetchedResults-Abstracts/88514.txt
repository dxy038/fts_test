The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of fish oil (FO)- and olive oil (OO)-rich diets on Fe metabolism and oxidative stress. Rats were fed for 16 weeks with diets containing 50 g lipids/kg; either OO, maize oil (MO) or FO. OO or MO diets contained a standard amount (100 mg/kg) of all-rac-(alpha)-tocopheryl acetate. FO diets were supplemented with 0, 100 or 200 mg all-rac-(alpha)-tocopheryl acetate/kg (FO-0, FO-1 or FO-2 diets, respectively). At the end of the feeding period, we measured non-haem Fe stores in liver and spleen, and erythrocyte and reticulocyte count. We also determined antioxidants and products derived from lipid peroxidation in plasma and erythrocytes. Our results showed reduced non-haem Fe stores in rats fed any of the FO diets. Reticulocyte percentage was higher in the rats fed FO-0 and FO-1. Plasma (alpha)-tocopherol was very low in rats fed the FO-0 diet. Rats fed the FO-1 and FO-2 diets showed higher (alpha)-tocopherol in plasma than the FO-0 group but lower than the MO or OO groups. We did not observe such differences in the (alpha)tocopherol content in erythrocyte membranes. Superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities were lower in the erythrocytes of rats fed the FO-0 diet. The products derived from lipid peroxidation were also higher in the FO groups. The administration of FO-rich diets increased lipid peroxidation and affected Fe metabolism. On the other hand, the OO-rich diet did not increase oxidative stress and did not alter Fe metabolism. Based on these results, we conclude that FO supplementation should be advised carefully.

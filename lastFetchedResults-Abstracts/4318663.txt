A chance constrained programming formulation for distribution reconfiguration with wind power generator (WPG) is proposed that aims at minimum power loss and increment voltage quality. A scenario analysis method is applied to describe the random output of WPG through the scenario probability and scenario output. A multiple objective particle algorithm (MOPSO) is employed to solve the multi-objective discrete nonlinear optimization problem. The dedicated particle encoding with the mesh information of the distribution network can effectively avoid producing a large amount of invalid solutions. With MOSPO, it is possible to obtain the optimum solution set of each objective while helping the operator to choose the most appropriate plan for reconfiguration. Application of the model and MOPSO algorithm to the 69 distribution network has verified their feasibility and correctness.

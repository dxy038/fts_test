A series of novel 1,2,3-triazole fused spirochromone conjugates have been synthesized bearing both spirochromone moiety as well as a 1,2,3-triazole moiety. Some of the compounds have exhibited potential activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (virulent strain H37Rv). In particular 5e proved to be the most potent derivative exhibiting MIC = 0.78 Î¼g/mL.

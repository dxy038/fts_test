Surge-comparison methods of testing insulation were investigated with the objective of locating as well as detecting faults. Experience of other investigators was confirmed and limitations of methods and equipment studied. Supplementary methods and equipment were devised to extend the field of usefulness of this basic type of tester, especially to the testing of very large machines with multiple-parallel windings. Apparatus studied included a-c motors from fractional-horsepower single-phase to very large three-phase types; a large variety of d-c armatures; and numerous armature, stator, and magnet coils. This surge-comparison tester has proved to be suitable for use by electrical manufacturers and by service and repair shops, as it can be used for testing most common types of electric windings.

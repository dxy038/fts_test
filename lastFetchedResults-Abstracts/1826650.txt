Major consequences of the deinstitutionalization movement of the 1960s are the objective and subjective burdens for caregivers of individuals with chronic mental illness. The purpose of this report is to describe the association between the objective and subjective caregiver burdens. Objective caregiver burden is comprised of those tasks required to care for the client, whereas subjective caregiver burden indicates the extent to which the caregiver “minds” performing these tasks. The design is a longitudinal, quasi-experimental study over a 3-year period, i.e., three waves of data were collected between 1991 to 1994. Data were collected via a telephone interview schedule. Both quantitative and qualitative data are reported. The association between objective and subjective burdens is complex. Findings show that although there are many tasks required in the taking care of the client, the caregiver accepts these tasks. The problem occurs with the uncooperative nature of the client in allowing the caregiver to carry out the tasks. The caregiver-client conflict involving excessive demands and embarrassment results in increased subjective burden.

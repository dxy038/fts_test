Objective: The incidence and outcomes for community-acquired pneumonia during a pregnancy ending with a live birth in the province of Alberta, Canada, were analyzed. Study Design: Hospital abstracts and vital statistics data between April 1, 1994, to March 31, 1999, were used. Results: The incidence of hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia was 1.51 (95% CI 1.35-1.67) per 1000 pregnancies in mothers 18 years and older compared with 1.47 (95% CI 1.42-1.51) per 1000 women (18 to 49 years) in the general population. The relative risk of staying longer at hospital for pneumonia was 0.44 during pregnancy compared with nonpregnant mothers with pneumonia. The relative risk of staying longer at hospital during delivery was 1.88, higher in those with a past hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia. The relative risk of a small-for-gestational-age newborn infant was 1.86 for those with a past hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia compared with those without a past hospitalization. Conclusion: Community-acquired pneumonia during most pregnancies ending with a live birth appears to be well tolerated by mothers and newborn infants. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;18:800-6.)

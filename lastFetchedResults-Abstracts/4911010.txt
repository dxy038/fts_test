Urban area traffic signal control is a complicated issue. Based on the characteristics of vehicle delay, this paper proposes a method for signal timing and phase optimization. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is adopted to optimize the multiphase traffic signal timing and phase sequence at the intersection. The optimization objective is to minimize the average vehicle delay of every cycle at the intersection. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently reduce the average vehicle delay at the intersection and improve the traffic capacity of the intersection. In addition, the algorithm is fast and stable.

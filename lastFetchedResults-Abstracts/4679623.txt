In the coming years, it is expected that long and short range road vehicle radars (LRR, SRR) will all operate at millimeter wave. In several regions of the world, a one GHz bandwidth was selected between 76 and 77 GHz for LRR. To obtain a very high distance resolution for applications like brake- assist and pre-crash, SRR need an even larger bandwidth. Hence, a 4 GHz bandwidth was allocated to provide precise radial range information of objects with a range separation of approximately 5 cm to 10 cm. Directions of the targets are obtained using two or more separate sensors associated to localization techniques. The purpose of this paper concerns a simulation and experimental evaluation of an impulse radio, ultra wide band (IR-UWB) vehicle localization system. In this context, different localization techniques (TDOA, TOA, DOA) will be evaluated in terms of position error for scenarios using three distant, separate sensors. Our objective is to evaluate an optimum technique as a function of the localization range. Simulation results will be compared to experimental results obtained in laboratory. These results will show the interest of coupling two of the following TOA, TDOA and DOA techniques, at different ranges.

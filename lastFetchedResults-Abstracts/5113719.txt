Prior studies show that active-motion early after a fracture surgery can effectively reduce the tissue viscosity. However, due to the postoperative pain and unawareness of the postoperative limitations, a patient prefers to take medication to alleviate pain while complicated rehabilitation exercises can only be implemented under the limited intervention of a therapist, resulting in the patient´s lack of interactive feedback on a daily basis and a failure of self-motions to miss the timing of rehabilitation. This study is intended to develop a lower limb fracture postoperative-guided interactive rehabilitation training system for the hip, knee and ankle joints, and establish a method of motion analysis and a method of motion performance assessment in conjunction with the wireless sensor technology and animation techniques, providing an objective assessment from the caregiver and learning the patient´s rehabilitation status with a simple and easy recording means. Additionally, with the design of interactive feedback, the improved postoperative rehabilitations are tried to increase the participant´s interest in self-management of health and facilitate to keep tracking the rehabilitation information. The medical evidences show that a guided rehabilitation system can enhance the patient´s motive and willingness to be committed to a rehabilitation training as well as increase Quality and Amount of the exercise activity during the training process.

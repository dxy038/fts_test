Drilling is the operation of producing circular hole in the workpiece by using rotating cutter called Drill. The Drilling Operation can also be accomplished in lathe, in which the drill is holding in tailstock and work is held by the chuck. In drilling of bucket wheel excavator teeth an over head crane is used for loading and unloading of teeth over the drilling machine bed. Therefore for each completion of operation the operator need to wait for overhead crane for loading and unloading of teeth which increase the time of production. Hence manufacturing cost is increased due to labor charges and overall machining time. In order to minimize the cost of production, it is planned to eliminate the repeat usage of over head crane for loading and unloading of teeth by introducing a workholding device having a capacity to fix ten teeths at a time period. Workholding device required a Base, Inner shaft, Housing unit, Jig &amp; Fixture and Locking Device. The objective of this paper work is to designing a workholding device need to hold the workpiece using Pro-E Wildfire software. Then calculating the clamping force analytically by static analysis of all designed components is using Ansys software. Based on the dimension, all parts are manufactured and assembled to test its performance.

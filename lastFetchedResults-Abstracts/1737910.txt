The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of moderate glomerular dysfunction on oxidative stress. We determined the plasma and erythrocyte malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, as a marker of lipid peroxidation, erythrocyte glutathione (GSH) levels and activities of GSH-Px, GSH Red and SOD as an antioxidant enzymes, and plasma trace element levels containing Fe, Cu and Zn in twenty proteinuric patients (6.8 Â± 5.1 g/day) with moderate glomerular function and in 20 anemic control subjects. We found that the erythrocyte and plasma MDA levels and erythrocyte GSH-Px activities were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) and the erythrocyte GSH levels and activities of GSH-Red and SOD activities were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) in the patients than in the anemic subjects. Plasma Fe and Zn levels were not to be found significantly different in the patients compared to the anemic subjects. But plasma Cu levels were significantly higher in the patients (p &lt; 0.05) when compared with the levels of anemic subjects. This study was concluded that cellular antioxidant activity decreases in proteinuric patients with moderate glomerular function. This may increase lipid peroxidation reactions by causing oxidative stress in erythrocyte membranes.

In this paper we study the problem of scheduling a stochastic task graph with the objective of minimizing the makespan and maximizing the robustness. As these two metrics are not equivalent, we need a bicriteria approach to solve this problem. Moreover, as computing these two criteria is very time consuming we propose different approaches: from an evolutionary meta-heuristic (best solutions but longer computation time) to more simple heuristics making approximations (bad quality solutions but fast computation time). We compare these different strategies experimentally and show that we are able to find different approximations of the Pareto front of this bicriteria problem.

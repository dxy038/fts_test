Access to abundant clean energy and access to water are probably two of the major challenges that humanity will face in the future. Societies are having trouble creating the conditions for adequate energy supply to take place and defining public policy to address the problem. Authors were invited to provide a sample of how energy public policies are being defined around the globe. The objective of this special issue is to recognize the challenges inherent in defining a public policy, based on specific experiences. Two regional views are provided first (Europe and Latin America), followed by three country-specific case studies (the United States, the United Kingdom, and India).

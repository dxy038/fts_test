Objective
Do repeat prenatal corticosteroids suppress neonatal cortisol concentrations?
Study design
Randomized controlled trial of women given weekly repeat corticosteroids or saline placebo, while at risk of preterm birth, until 32 weeks' gestation.
Results
Cord serum cortisol concentrations in infants exposed to repeat corticosteroids were similar compared with infants exposed to a single course of corticosteroids (mean difference −26 nmol/L (95% CI −57, 5 nmol/L, P = .10), as were prestress salivary cortisol concentrations on day 3 (median 16.5 vs 15.3 nmol/L, P = .96). The adrenal response to a stressor on day 3 was lower in the repeat corticosteroid group compared with the single course group (median 11.9 vs 21.4 nmol/L, P = .02). Cortisol concentrations were lower in the repeat corticosteroid group on day 7 (median 11.7 vs 18.2 nmol/L, P = .04), but not on days 14 and 21.
Conclusion
The short- or long-term clinical impact, if any, of these changes in adrenal function needs to be determined.

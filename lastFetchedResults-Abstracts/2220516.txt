Due to flood damage of most watersheds in the country, the necessity of forecasting systems, zoning and flooding are more consideration. Now with the increasing availability of digital information and computer analysis, geographic information systems (GIS), play important role in the hydrological and hydraulic modeling. WMS Software, including new software that zoning flood explored. In this research a part of the Glaz River that passes the Oshnavieh city and has the potential to high flooding potential and damage of the infrastructure the city has selected. The main objective of this research is flood zonation in the region. In order to estimate the flood, according to historical data available and hydrometric stations and the maximum instantaneous flood, normal statistical distribution of, log normal two parametric, log normal three parametric, log Pearson type III and Gamble used. To determine the distribution of superior Test PPCC was used. For zoning depth of flooding, after calculation of the hydraulic profile of the water surface by the model (HEC-RAS) and Then the water surface profile model (HEC-RAS) for the return periods of 25 and 50 and 100 per year was calculated. Finally, flood hazard zonation maps defining the risk function, in the city was prepared. Results showed that the river within the Oshnavieh city limits Glaz River due to improper management, and more has become a channel and the ability to cross the river passing through floods with return periods of 25 years and more. Similarly flood damages with high return periods will be irreparable in the city. According to these maps, high-risk positions and can be identified and prioritized in urban planning.

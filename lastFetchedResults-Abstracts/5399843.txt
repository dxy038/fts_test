The objective of this study is to simulate and analyze the effects of fuzzy logic based tuning of PID controllers for a heating and cooling energy system, while accounting for the dynamics of the major system components. A that a less amount of control signal, interpreted as cooling or heating energy fed into the system, shows the appropriateness of the controller, and the simulation results represent the excellent performance of proposed controller for this purpose.

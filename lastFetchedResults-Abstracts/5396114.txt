The objective of this paper is to carry out design and analysis of a Ka-band, FSS-backed reflectarray for dual band X/Ka-band application. In this design, broadband ring structure has been utilized as the cell element of the reflectarray and a single loop was used for the construction of the FSS-backed reflectarray which replaces the reflectarray ground plane. Prototypes of this FSS-backed reflectarray was fabricated and tested. The measurements demonstrated that the gain of the reflectarray is almost the same as its conventional counterpart backed by solid ground plane. Characterization of the out-of-band performance of this antenna demonstrated close to 0.6 dB insertion loss.

A cloud classification scheme is developed to be used with the SSM/I measurements in association with the METEOSAT classification. Before classifying SSM/I data, an objective technique is applied to enhance spatial resolution of measurements to the resolution of the 37 GHz channel. Different classification algorithms have been performed. The fuzzy C-Mean algorithm seems to provide the best match with the METEOSAT classification, used as the ground truth

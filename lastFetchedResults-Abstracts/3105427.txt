Knowledge management capability (KMC) evaluation is a required work with strategic significance. However it still has not been addressed in the extant literature. KMC evaluation is involved in multi-criteria decision-making problems and the evaluation indexes are characterized with grey, fuzzy and difficult to quantify. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate a grey evaluation method for KMC. First, a framework for evaluating KMC is presented, which includes two dimensions and six attributes. Then, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the theory of grey system are introduced in setting up a comprehensive evaluation model. Additionally, an example is used to illustrate the availability of the proposed method. The result shows that grey evaluation which combines advantages of the qualitative and quantitative methods can be applied to evaluate KMC conveniently and scientifically. Meanwhile the evaluation results can help practitioners judge the necessity to improve the KMC and determine which dimension or attribute is the most needed direction to improve.

Each year, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for significant mortality in the population. Whilst the disease is now being diagnosed earlier, determining patient prognosis remains a challenge. Current prognostic indicators, such as TNM stage, Fuhrman grade, and RCC subtype, are inadequate. Unlike several other malignancies, RCC lacks a biomarker that can stratify patients into high, intermediate, or low risk for developing metastases. Additionally, antiangiogenic therapy is currently offered to patients with metastatic disease, however, a biomarker to monitor treatment efficacy is lacking. Recent attention has focused on surrogate markers of tumor vascularization as a source of prognostic biomarkers, as tumor growth is ultimately dependent on neovascularization. Two cell populations of interest, circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and circulating endothelial progenitors (CEPs), have been demonstrated across several studies to contribute to tumor vascularization. Given these findings, studies have examined their utility as biomarkers of prognosis by correlating their levels with progression-free survival and prognostic determinants such as tumor volume and weight. However, their role in predicting prognosis in RCC, as well as their potential to act as markers of treatment efficacy in metastatic RCC, remains to be established. Previous studies on CECs and CEPs in the context of cancer will be outlined in this review.

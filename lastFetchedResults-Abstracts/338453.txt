Objective
Some phenotypic and functional properties of lymphocytes from bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell donors were compared in a randomized study.
Materials and Methods

Lymphocyte subsets were analyzed by immunocytometry in blood harvested from bone marrow donors (n = 27) and from peripheral blood stem cell donors before and after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilization (n = 23) and in bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell grafts.
Results

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilization increased the blood T and B, but not NK, lymphocyte counts. All lymphocyte counts were not, vert, similar10-fold higher in peripheral blood stem cell grafts than in bone marrow grafts. Analysis of CD25, CD95, HLA-DR, and CD45RA expression shows that T-cell activation level was lower after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilization. Similarly, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor reduced by twofold to threefold the percentage of interferon-γ, interleukin-2, and tumor necrosis factor-α–secreting cells within the NK, NK-T, and T-cell subsets and severely impaired the potential for interferon-γ production at the single-cell level. mRNA levels of both type 1 (interferon-γ, interleukin-2) and type 2 (interleukin-4, interleukin-13) cytokines were not, vert, similar10-fold lower in peripheral blood stem cell grafts than in bone marrow grafts. This reduced potential of cytokine production was not associated with a preferential mobilization of so-called “suppressive” cells (CD3+CD4−CD8−, CD3+CD8+CD56+, or CD3+TCRVA24+CD161+), nor with a modulation of killer cell receptors CD161, NKB1, and CD94 expression by NK, NK-T, or T cells.
Conclusion

Our data demonstrate in a randomized setting that quantitative as well as qualitative differences exist between a bone marrow and a peripheral blood stem cell graft, whose ability to produce type 1 and type 2 cytokines is impaired.

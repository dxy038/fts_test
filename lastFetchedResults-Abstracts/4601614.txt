In this paper, a model-based FDI-scheme for the detection and isolation of sensor faults in the vehicle lateral dynamics control system ESP is presented. The main objective is to handle the model uncertainties and to isolate faults. In order to reduce false alarm rate on the one hand and to ensure fault detectability on the other hand, a parity space based solution is presented. To achieve a numerical stable online realization on an electronic control unit (ECU), the FDI system is realized in an observer structure. The FDI-scheme has been tested using real driving data

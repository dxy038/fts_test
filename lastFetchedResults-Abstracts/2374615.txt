The main objective of the present study is to assess the temporal variability of the carbonate system, and the mechanisms driving that variability, in the Rio San Pedro, a tidal creek located in the Bay of Cadiz (SW Iberian Peninsula). This shallow tidal creek is affected by effluents of organic matter and nutrients from surrounding marine fish farms. In 2004, 11 tidal samplings, seasonally distributed, were carried out for the measurement of total alkalinity (TA), pH, dissolved oxygen and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) using a fixed station. In addition, several longitudinal samplings were carried out both in the tidal creek and in the adjacent waters of the Bay of Cadiz, in order to obtain a spatial distribution of the carbonate parameters. Tidal mixing is the main factor controlling the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) variability, showing almost conservative behaviour on a tidal time scale. The amplitude of the daily oscillations of DIC, pH and chlorophyll show a high dependence on the spring–neap tide sequence, with the maximum amplitude associated with spring tides. Additionally, a marked seasonality has been found in the DIC, pH and oxygen concentrations. This seasonality seems to be related to the increase in metabolic rates with the temperature, the alternation of storm events and high evaporation rates, together with intense seasonal variability in the discharges from fish farms. In addition, the export of DIC from the Rio San Pedro to the adjacent coastal area has been evaluated using the tidal prism model, obtaining a net export of 1.05×1010 g C yr−1.

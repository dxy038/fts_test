Objective: We report our experience with a transvaginally applied intracervical fibrin sealant at <24 weeks’ gestation. Study Design: This is an observational study of a referred patient population, with preterm premature rupture of the membranes at <24 weeks’ gestation. Results: Twelve women consented to our protocol. The mean gestational age at preterm premature rupture of membranes was 19 weeks 4 days (range, 13-23 weeks); the mean gestational age at treatment was 20 weeks 5 days (range, 17-23 weeks). All women had a diminution in the amount of amniotic fluid leakage with an increase in amniotic fluid index. Among the 12 pregnancies (13 fetuses), there were 7 surviving neonates. Two women had apparent “resealing” of the membranes. Conclusion: Fibrin sealants in midtrimester rupture of the membranes may lead to improved outcomes and now warrant formal evaluation.

In the age of Big Data, we must do best to economically extract value from very large volumes of a wide variety of statistics. However, because of subjective and objective reasons, it is becoming increasing clear that much data is of poor quality, which has serious effects on the research results. With the analysis on the cause and process of the low quality data, this paper introduces the concept of gray system and proposes a data-gray-correction model, which could change the original data into gray interval number and reduce the influence from the former. Assessing the quality of data with classical econometric model and correcting the data by error correction model, then find the reasonable range of the real data and instead the crisp data by interval number, which contain much more information. An example is provided to illustrate the ecological civilization evaluation process under gray interval number.

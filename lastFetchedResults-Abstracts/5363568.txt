This paper suggests the Backtracking Search Optimization Algorithm (BSOA)-based tuning of the parameters of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers for a pancake direct current (DC) torque motor systems. These motors are important in the framework of Diesel engine exhaust gas recirculation valves in automotive applications. The BSOAs solve optimization problems that minimize objective functions expressed as the weighted sum of overshoot plus the integral of squared control error. The parameters of the PID controllers are the elements of the vector variables of the objective functions. The impact of the parameter that controls the amplitude of the search direction matrix is analyzed in terms of a digitally simulated case study that performs the shaft angle control.

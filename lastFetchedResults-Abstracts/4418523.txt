In the study of Retinex image enhancement methods, there is a need to determine the quality of the image enhancement. But the images obtained through different Retinex image enhancement methods were quite similar. Thus, subjective evaluation criteria are not reliable. In this paper, the SIFT feature points are presented as an objective evaluation of images. Image quality evaluation method based on SIFT features were turned out to be feasible. Experimental results are consistent with the conclusions drawn by synthesizing information entropy, standard deviation, and the mean squared error.

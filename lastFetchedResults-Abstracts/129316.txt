Optimum use of renewable water resources is one of the economical goals of the governments. Sustainable development was considered as an active design process by the farmer that should focus on creating and maintaining adaptive capacities in order to tune the farm system to an everchanging environment. Because sustainability involves social, ecological and economic aspects, the farmer must be enabled to integrate soft and hard parameters in decision-making. The objective of the research described in this paper was to develop a model that helps decision makers to design a sustainable agricultural system. Mathematical programming {MP) has been a widely used tool for studying and analyzing agricultural systems. As a result of this study of water sustainable agriculture, we present lessons for future project development and policy formulation and reform. The results indicate that, with improving of irrigation efficiency, groundwater resources level will be increased.

Brainstem tuberculoma is an uncommon entity especially in the immunocompetent adult. The authors describe the case of a 32-year-old immunocompetent woman with no systemic signs or symptoms of tuberculosis, presenting with sudden-onset hemiparesis and diplopia. MRI of brain revealed an enhancing lesion in the midbrain and thalamus. Cerebrospinal fluid examination was normal. Chest imaging was consistent with miliary tuberculosis; however initial expectorated sputum was culture negative. Bronchosopy sputum culture was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Her PPD was negative. Patient became asymptomatic with treatment for tuberculosis and follow-up MRI showed complete resolution of the lesion a year later. We conclude that a high index of suspicion is essential to make an early diagnosis of intracranial tuberculoma, since often, traditional TB tests like PPD and sputum examinations can be negative.

Background and Objective: Considering the significant incidence of nosocomial infections in hospitalized patients, this study was done to determine the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from wound infection and drug sensitivity pattern, Tehran-Iran.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, Staphylococcus aureus isolated  and identified according to standard procedures from the wound infections of 614 patients referred to Baqiyatallah hospital, Tehran-Iran during 2006-07. The samples were examined and antibiogram was performed by disc diffusion method on Mueller Hinton agar with 12 antibiotics.
Results: 100 (16.28%) of wound infection of Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 614 patients. The infection rate in men was twice compared to women. The highest rate 29 (29%) was observed in people aged 40 to 60 group. Also specimen's patients with immunosuppressive diseases (28 cases), surgical site infection (16 cases) and normal wounds (13 cases) were considered to be most prevalent isolates. Antibiotic sensitivity testing revealed that 96 (96%) of isolates were sensitive to vancomycin, 95 (95%) and 92 (92%) were resistant to penicillin and cotrimoxazole, respectively. Our result showed that 43% of strains were resistant at 11 antibiotics.
Conclusion: This study showed that the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus was 16.28% of samples, with 43% antibiotic resistance. The highest sensitivity was toward to vancomycin.

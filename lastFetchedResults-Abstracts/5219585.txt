In this article, we describe a specification model that seeks to couple formal specification methods and agent-oriented software engineering techniques. The objective is to allow faster formal development of flexible and reusable multiagent systems (MAS) with strict requirements of quality and reliability. The specification model is specifically tailored to support highly dynamic and evolutive characteristics of MAS. The agents are formally specified and instantiated by a framework and reuse is achieved by transforming the framework structural model into multiple agents. Agent flexibility, and adaptation capacity is ensured through the use of design patterns and properties such as: encapsulation, high-cohesion, low-coupling and through the definition of a formal XML model. The specification model represented in XML can be transformed into a code block that needs few adjustments, granting the system a high flexibility and trustworthiness. The purpose is to reduce time, effort and costs associated with MAS design and development with high quality requirements and reliability.

In speech synthesis the role of prosody is very crucial. To make the synthesized speech more natural and soothing to the human ears various prosody and intonation model together with emotional model have been experimented over last few decades. Apart from the segmental quality and voice characteristics, it depends mostly on the quality of the prosody model which is responsible for the naturalness of any TTS system. But as it is very hard to evaluate prosody model in an objective way, a perceptual comparison method is adopted in this work to evaluate prosody model.

Real-life design problems of electromagnetic components are usually highly nonlinear. These problems can be efficiently solved with stochastic global optimization algorithms. This paper deals with an application of a novel Multi-Objective Self-Organizing Migrating Algorithm (MOSOMA) to the design of two electromagnetic components: layered dielectric filters and Yagi-Uda antennas. The optimization of dielectric filters considers two objectives: the minimization of reflection in the pass band and its maximization in the stop band. Bandpass, low-pass, and band-stop filters having seven dielectric layers are optimized here. An option for treatment of both continuous parameters and discrete parameters, and for dealing with optimization constraints without any change in the optimization algorithm, are briefly discussed. Yagi-Uda antenna optimization deals with two objectives: the maximization of gain, and the minimization of the relative sidelobe level, while impedance matching is considered as a constraint for the proposed designs. Yagi-Uda antennas are analyzed using <i>4NEC2</i> software, based on the Method of Moments. Cooperation of a <i>MATLAB</i> optimization script and the <i>4NEC2</i> software in a non-interactive mode is explained. Results for four- and six-element antennas are presented. The results of both the problems are compared to results from available references.

The objective of this work is to create a theoretical model and to conduct the detail research of the electromagnetic radiation interaction with granular product and insects. The theoretical research on the electromagnetic wave interaction with granular agricultural product and insects is done in the present work through the solving of electromagnetic boundary problem [1]. It is well-known that boundary problems of electrodynamics are the most complicated ones in the mathematical physics and are urgent in the theory of wave processes. We use the methods based on integral equations of macroscopic electrodynamics to avoid complications at consideration of proper boundary problems.

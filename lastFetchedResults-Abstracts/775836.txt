This paper presents a numerical study about the performance of a Beta Stirling solar thermal engine system. This
system is composed of a solar collector box connected to a regenerator hydraulic system and a transmitting power system.
The objective of the system is to offer a new alternative to help solving stagnant water pollution in hot countries
like Thailand by circulating water in canals, lakes, ponds etc. for aeration using solar energy.
The purpose of this study is to determine the power output and actual heat transfer on the performance of the solar
thermal engine. The solar thermal engine is analyzed using a mathematical model based on the first law of thermodynamics
for processes with finite speed, with particular attention to the energy balance at the receiver. The result of calculations
showed that the regenerator volume and phase angle must be chosen carefully to fulfill the requirement that
total fluid mass in the system is constant and to obtain maximum power output throughout the day.

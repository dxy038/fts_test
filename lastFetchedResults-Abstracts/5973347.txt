The objective of this effort is to develop a computer tool for drawing, editing and simulating timed Petri nets using object oriented programming (OOP). The developed C++ based Timed Petri Net Simulation Tool, TiPNet, simulates discrete systems with both deterministic and stochastic transitions and immediate transitions. Net debugging and performance result tabulation are built-in. The XView Toolkit is used for building TiPNet´s interactive graphical user interface in compliance with AT&amp;T´s OPENLOOK standard on a Sun workstation running SunOS 4.1.X. Compliance with the XWindow standard makes the developed tool portable to other XWindow systems, and TiPNet can run remotely on a network

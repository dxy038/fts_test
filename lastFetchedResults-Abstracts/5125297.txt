The purpose of this paper is to find an objective criterion that can correlate well with subjective assessment. Then, this criterion can train young ultrasonographers for practical diagnosis. Subjective assessment was proposed to medical experts, the comparison of objective quality is referred into diagnosis of twelve ultrasonographers. A number of objective quality measurements are evaluated for medical ultrasonic echo image compression. It is shown that although some numerical measurement correlates with observersÂ´ response, they are not reliable for all testing images. For female breast image, it is difficult to select the measurement, because the relationship between objective quality and ultrasonographers is fluctuation. Hence, determination of the consistency is need, the results show that contrast comparison measurement can correlate with ultrasonographers. Therefore, this measurement is high potential to evaluate image quality for medical ultrasonic echo image compression.

This paper highlights the effect of emissions regulations on in-use emissions from heavy-duty vehicles powered by different model year engines. More importantly, fuel economy data for pre- and post-consent decree engines are compared.
The objective of this study was to determine the changes in brake-specific emissions of NOx as a result of emission regulations, and to highlight the effect these have had on brake-specific CO2 emission; hence, fuel consumption. For this study, in-use, on-road emission measurements were collected. Test vehicles were instrumented with a portable on-board tailpipe emissions measurement system, WVU's Mobile Emissions Measurement System, and were tested on specific routes, which included a mix of highway and city driving patterns, in order to collect engine operating conditions, vehicle speed, and in-use emission rates of CO2 and NOx. Comparison of on-road in-use emissions data suggests NOx reductions as high as 80% and 45% compared to the US Federal Test Procedure and Not-to-Exceed standards for model year 1995â€“2002. However, the results indicate that the fuel consumption; hence, CO2 emissions increased by approximately 10% over the same period, when the engines were operating in the Not-to-Exceed region.

A database contains data ranging from different degree of confidentiality, and is widely accessed by variety of users. As the importance of database become more and more vital in business, database security turn up to be a nonnegligible issue in order to protect data from its vulnerability to potential attackers and cryptanalysts. Encryption adds an additional layer of security to make data unusable if, despite all efforts, someone does get unauthorized access to the raw data. Previous researchers had done a lot of efforts in database encryption, including encrypting "data-at-rest" and "data-in-motion". Although encryption is being shown as the strongest security alternative for data protection, there are still some drawbacks observed by implementing encryption of data-at-rest. Furthermore, implementing either one of the above-said strategies is not sufficient to keep data safe from exposure. And hence, combining the two approaches is necessary and emerges as a better choice. The main objective of designing this hybrid solution is to boost up the performance of a database engine when data encryption is requisite.

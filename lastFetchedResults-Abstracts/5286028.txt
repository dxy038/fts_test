In this paper, we aim at providing a solution to the problem of network congestion that arises when huge amount of data such as multimedia data is transferred in mobile ad hoc networks. This issue has been addressed by designing a protocol that performs routing intelligently and minimizes the delay in data transmission. The objective of this work is to move the traffic away from the shortest path that is obtained by a suitable shortest path calculation algorithm to a less congested path so as to minimize the number of packet drops during data transmission and to avoid unnecessary delay. For this we have proposed a protocol named as Congestion Aware Selection of Path with Efficient Routing (CASPER). Here, a router runs the shortest path algorithm after pruning those links that violate a given set of constraints. The proposed protocol has been compared with two link state routing protocols namely, OSPF [1, 2] and OLSR [3, 4, 5]. The results achieved show that the proposed protocol performs better in terms of network throughput and transmission delay in case of bulky data.

Objective
Radiotherapy is an important aspect of multimodal cancer therapy, but radiation-induced acute intestinal injury is a common and serious problem. Disruption of morphologic mucosal integrity and normal bacterial microflora after abdominal radiation leads to malabsorption and bacterial translocation.
Methods

Lactobacillus bulgaricus strain isolated from yogurt was given as a probiotic to rats subjected to radiotherapy. On postradiation day 8 rats were killed. Mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, and spleen were excised for microbiologic examinations. Segments of jejunum, ileum, and colon were evaluated for the presence of inflammation, vascularity, and mucus cells.
Results

The results of this study suggest that probiotics may have a protective effect on intestinal mucosa.
Conclusion

Probiotics added as substrates can be given by an oral or enteral route to patients who undergo radiotherapy to prevent radiation-induced enteritis and related malnutrition.

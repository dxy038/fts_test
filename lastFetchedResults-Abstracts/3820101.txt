We investigate from an algorithmic perspective the maxmin fair allocation of bandwidth in wireless ad hoc networks. We formalize the maxmin fair objective under wireless scheduling constraints, and present a necessary and sufficient condition for maxmin fairness of a bandwidth allocation. We propose an algorithm that assigns weights to the sessions dynamically such that the weights depend on the congestion in the neighborhood, and schedules the sessions that constitute a maximum weighted matching. We prove that this algorithm attains the maxmin fair rates, even though it does not use any information about the statistics of the packet arrival process.

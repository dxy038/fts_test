Objective
To describe the perceived quality of life of teen mothers.
Study design
The Medical Outcomes Survey–Short Form 36, version 2 is a scale that measures a subject's perception of 8 health dimensions. The Medical Outcomes Survey–Short Form 36, version 2 and a demographics survey were completed by women during obstetric or gynecologic visits to a resident continuity clinic. Mean scores were compared between women with children and those without.
Results
There was no significant difference between adults or teens, with or without children, in any health component scale with the exception of social functioning. When compared with the normative population age, all groups in our population scored significantly on physical functioning and role-physical subscales. In addition, teens with children scored lower on the role-emotional subscale.
Conclusion
Perceived quality of life in teen mothers does not appear to be lower than quality of life in teens without children or adult women.

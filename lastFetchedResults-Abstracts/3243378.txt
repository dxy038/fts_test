This paper presents the study of an optimization technique that is developed to locate the optimal location and the size (power rating) of Distributed Generation (DG) for its installation to a distribution system. The type of the chosen DG is photovoltaic (PV). In this study, the author proposes the new technique called Swarm Evolutionary (SEP) technique where the concept of applying and substituting the concept of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in some part of Evolutionary Programming (EP) is applied on IEEE 69 radial bus distribution system. The result is then compared with the result from classic EP and Artificial Immune System (AIS). The objective is to minimize overall system power loss and improving voltage profile. The proposed optimization technique is developed under MATLAB programming. Test results indicate that Swarm EP technique can reduce the total system loss and improve the voltage profile better than EP and AIS for the distribution system under various loading conditions.

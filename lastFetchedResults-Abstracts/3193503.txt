Due to the requirements on capital investment and performance level for real transmission expansion planning. In order to seek satisfying transmission system expansion plan and fully reflect subjective preferences of decision maker. In this paper, physical programming is presented to solve the evaluation of transmission expansion scheme. Investment cost for new transmission lines and power grid vulnerability are considered in physical programming model. Test results on IEEE-RTS 24-bus power system show that the proposed method can reflect the expertsÂ´ preference and avoid the conflict between different objective functions with different dimension, and it is practicable.

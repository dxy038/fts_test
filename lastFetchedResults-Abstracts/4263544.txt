In this paper we present the POCEMON platform, a platform aiming to the early prognosis and diagnosis of autoimmune diseases at any point of care, even the primary. The objective of the POCEMON platform is the development of a diagnostic lab-on-chip device based on genomic microarrays of HLA-typing. The POCEMON is going to advance and promote the primary health care across Europe by supporting a) point-of-care diagnostics, b) monitoring of immune system status and c) management of the chronic multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) autoimmune diseases. The platform combines high-end Information and Communication Technologies based on microfluidics, microelectronics, microarrays and intelligent diagnosis algorithms.

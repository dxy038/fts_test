Logistics industry has been developing rapidly in China, but it is still a fledgling industry. Some Chinese scholars have made considerable researches on it, but the study in this field has been at the initial stage so far. On the basis of previous studies, we establish a more comprehensive and objective evaluation indicator system on the principles of all-around perspectives, close relationship and data accessibility and then use factor analysis method and statistics of 2006 to do empirical study by SPSS software on the logistics industryÂ´s competitiveness in 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China. The analysis result suggests that the logistics industries in some regions are effective, as there are heavy demands for logistics services, but unfavourable logistics condition; meanwhile, some regions have much potential in the development of logistics industries, which are weak in competitiveness mainly because of weak demand for logistics services at present.

The authors describe a research project involving qualitative data collection from large organizations in the U.S., Japan and Europe. Its main objective is to understand what "distributed" means when discussing the management of distributed projects, an issue largely glossed over by the relevant literature. The discussion presented suggests dimensions to the concept of "distributedness" through a theory-based model. An understanding of the distributedness dimensions simplifies the practical application of how to manage such systems.

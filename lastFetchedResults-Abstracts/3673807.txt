The problem of optimal uplink packet scheduling for non-real-time data in CDMA systems is investigated and a load-based optimisation model is presented. In contrast to existing models, the proposed model takes the actual load of each mobile user into consideration and adopts an achievable throughput in the objective function. The proposed model also optimises the resource utilisation. Numerical results show that the proposed model can achieve a higher throughput and a higher resource utilisation.

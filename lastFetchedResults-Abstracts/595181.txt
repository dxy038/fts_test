Objective: To determine the frequency of G6PD deficiency in the etiology of anaemia and jaundice and to determine the most common age of presentation with anaemia and jaundice due to GOPD deficiency in adults.\/aterial and Methods: We did a hospital based study in the department of Medicine Khyber Teaching Hospital Peshawar from June 2003 to December 2003. The data of adult patients with signs and symptoms of anaemia and jaundice hyk collected on structured proforma. The clinical presentation and laboratory investigation results were documentedResult*.: Out of 200 patients studied, 24 (12%) patients were found to he deficient in G6PD enzyme. The male to female ratio u a.s 21:3 (87.5% and 12.5%) respectively. The age of appearance of jaundic e in adults varied (most common age from 13 to 17 years). The most common signs and symptoms were Jaundice, anaemia and haemoglobinuria. All GOPD deficient patients except one recovered spontaneously when the offending precipitating factor were stopped or treated. One {0.5%,) died because of rapid fall of haemoglobin and delayed recognition of the condition and subsequent blood trans fusionConclusion: GOPD deficiency is not an uncommon cause of jaundice and anaemia in our patients. The jaundice due to GOPD mainly affects the adults m 2nd or 3rd decade. Therefore all the children and adults with jaundice and anaemia should be screened for G6PD status

In this paper the authors propose and analyze a network-based control architecture for power electronics building block (PEBB) devices. The objective of this approach to PEBB control is to create a distributed control system capable of guaranteeing maximum flexibility in the control of a power distribution system. In this control system, controller and controlled device are connected through the network, which affects the measurement and control signals with delays and other effects. This application is therefore subject to the known challenges of networked controllers. The main goal of this work is to outline a design methodology for controllers operating with measurements coming from a network. An approach is proposed here to assess the robustness of the control system in presence of delay and to design the controller for robustness to network delay. This approach is based on uncertainty analysis, assuming that such delay is the main element of uncertainty in the system. The theoretical foundations of this approach are discussed, together with the simulation and implementation of a physical laboratory prototype.

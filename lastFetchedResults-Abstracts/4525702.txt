An iterative transmission line technique for the determination of complex permittivity of non-magnetic, isotropic materials is addressed. The method is based on minimizing the objective function measuring the error between simulated and measured scattering parameters by classical Newton´s method. An Electromagnetic field solver is used to solve the forward problem which is repeated in the application of Newton´s method at each iteration. Since full-wave simulation is carried out, the method has no strict limitations on the geometry of the samples. For validation, proposed method is tested against partially loaded waveguide measurements at K-band.

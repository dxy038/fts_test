In order to improve accuracy of parameters and performance indexes for the filter, improve quality of the filter and meet the real-time requirements, an evolvable hardware structure and design method for an analog filter is presented in the paper. Evolvable hardware structure for the filter is devised by genetic programming. Optimization design of Parameters for the filter is realized by improved multi-objective adaptive genetic algorithm. Experiment shows that values of evolutionary parameters are in line with theoretical values exceedingly, and simulation results are satisfying.

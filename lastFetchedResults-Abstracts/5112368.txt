In this paper, we consider robust joint linear precoder/receive filter designs for multiuser multi-input multi-output (MIMO) downlink that minimize the sum mean square error (SMSE) in the presence of imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). The base station (BS) is equipped with multiple transmit antennas, and each user terminal is equipped with one or more receive antennas. We consider a stochastic error (SE) model and a norm-bounded error (NBE) model for the CSIT error. In the case of CSIT error following SE model, we compute the desired downlink precoder/receive filter matrices by solving the simpler uplink problem by exploiting the uplink-downlink duality for the MSE region. In the case of the CSIT error following the NBE model, we consider the worst-case SMSE as the objective function, and propose an iterative algorithm for the robust transceiver design. The robustness of the proposed algorithms to imperfections in CSIT is illustrated through simulations.

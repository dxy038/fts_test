This paper deals with optimization of pocket machining operations. The objective of this research is to extend the pocket machining algorithms that ever exist. The development aimed to identify the angle of triangular areas that can reduce the number of steps in the inner portion stage (IPS) process and corner portion stage (CPS) process. This step reduction makes the cutting-tool or cutter path length becomes shorter. With shorter cutter path length the machining time will become shorter too. The reducing of machining time will reduce production costs.

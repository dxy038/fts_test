The objective is to present and analyse the UWB communication systems signal processing point of view on the receiver side, with the purpose of using the technology for wireless high data-rate short range communication. The simulation was to use the tedious Monte-Carlo simulation to match the semi-analytic experiment shown in the original paper (M.Z. Win and R.A. Scholtz, 1998). This simulation is to get the same results as of the original theoretical and semi-analytic BER curves for the different rake receivers

Inspired by natureÂ´s method of survival and reproduction, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a powerful optimization technique that has been successfully applied in many fields. Here, the authors attempt to solve the Beam Intensity Modulation problem in Radiotherapy Treatment Planning (RTP) using GA. With pre-selected multi-beam gantry positions, field size and ignoring scattering from regional beam sources, the authors allowed the program to search for an optimum beam intensity solution that would most closely match the clinically prescribed dose values. The dose based objective function ensures that the tumor region receives sufficient radiation while simultaneously limiting the irradiation received by critical organs, which are the most radio-sensitive parts of a human body, and other healthy tissues. The simulation results the authors obtained showed that GA has a potential to be used as an optimization tool in RTP

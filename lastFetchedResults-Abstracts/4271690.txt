Objective: optimization of the medicinal preparation craft of removing toxic membrane to seek a best effective method to treat belt-shaped blister measles using the Chinese native medicine. Methods: the orthogonal experiment was designed to inspect its PH value, the amount used on carbomer, the amount used on PVA . Results: the best preparation craft of removing toxic membrane is : The PH value is 7, the amount of carbomer is 0.2 g, the amount of PVA is 8 g. Conclusion: This experiment is reasonable designed, preparation craft is reliable, and the quality is stable. This preparation is a better choice for the belt-shaped blister measles non-oral taking medicine.

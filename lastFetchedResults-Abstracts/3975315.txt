A novel algorithm for the detection of artifacts in compressed video is described. The algorithm does not require access to the original video and therefore can be very useful in situations where quality assessment needs to be carried out at the receiver end. The proposed method is insensitive to other common video artifacts such as blurring for similar levels of objective distortion. The use of fast transformations in the frequency domain makes the method attractive for real-time applications

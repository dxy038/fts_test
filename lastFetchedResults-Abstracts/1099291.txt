The objective of the INTERBOA experiment was to measure from underneath and with small observatories flying at 35 km in altitude the electromagnetic perturbations and the X-ray radiation associated with auroras during magnetic substorms. We overview the realization and the main electromagnetic features of 5 quasi-stationnary flights obtained during two balloon campaigns in the arctic region of Scandinavia.

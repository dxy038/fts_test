Making a success of a consultancy means finding a niche where you can offer clients an edge over competing consultants. You cannot be all things to all people. If, for instance, you want to function as a customerÂ´s representative reviewing process designs, project economics and schedules, be sure to portray yourself as such. If you want to specialize in particular unit operations, you should emphasize that forte. Among other choices, you may intend to make your name as an expert witness, or as an economic and market analyst, an adviser on educational curricula, a counselor to government or nongovernmental organizations, or to equipment vendors or technology licensors; whatever the choice, be sure to advertise yourself specifically as such. In any case, be objective and never stretch the facts as to your capabilities. Later in this article, we give recommendations on how to market your services.

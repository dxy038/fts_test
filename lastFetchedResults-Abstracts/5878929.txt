Cerebral aneurysm is defined as a weakened portion of an artery in the brain. Its rupture leads to a specific case of bleeding known as a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Literature indicates that a significant portion of patients suffering from SAH are initially misdiagnosed and subjected to the risks associated with aneurysm re-rupture. Traditional methods of detection that are recommended by the physicians include computer tomography (CT) scan, lumbar puncture (LP) and angiogram. Unfortunately, CT scan is ineffective after 12 hours, and angiogram only applicable in cases of finding the aneurysm before surgery. This paper discusses the invasive technique of lumbar puncture because of the technical limitations in performing a quick and objective evaluation. Bilirubin, resulting from the chemical decomposition of whole blood is a clear indicator a hemorrhage. This metabolite can be detected after a spinal tap, by differentiating its optical signature from that of fresh whole blood. We introduce the development of a diagnostic system that is based on visible spectroscopy to quickly and objectively assess low-blood volume SAH. The system integrates innovative hardware and a powerful software interface. The paper explores algorithms that accounts for the noise and distortion from blood in CSF. Furthermore, a hardware platform is introduced, that is portable and user-friendly composed of specific components designed to have the sensitivity and specificity.

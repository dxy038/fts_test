The objective of this paper is to review some recently developed sum rules and physical bounds in scattering and antenna theory. The sum rules are based on identities for Herglotz functions that relate the quantity of interest integrated over all wavelengths with its static polarizability dyadics. They are transformed to physical bounds by applying variational principles for the polarizability dyadics together with various estimates of the integrals. The theoretical findings are exemplified by numerical results for several configurations.

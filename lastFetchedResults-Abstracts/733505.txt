Objective.
Comparison of hospitalizations for coronary heart disease and stroke in older Baby Boomers, aged 45–54 years (the 1946–1955 birth cohort) in 2000 with that of the 1936–1945 birth cohort in 1990 and the 1926–1935 birth cohort in 1980.
Method and data source.

Analysis of the annual National Hospital Discharge Survey that collects data on discharges from non-federal short-stay hospitals.
Results.

Among hospitalizations for coronary heart disease, 294,000 (15.4%) in 1980, 289,000 (14.7%) in 1990, and 329,000 (15.2%) in 2000 occurred among adults aged 45–54 years. However, the age-specific hospitalization rate (per 100,000) for coronary heart disease was lower in 2000 than in 1990 or 1980 (p < 0.05). Among hospitalizations for stroke, 37,000 (6.0%) in 1980, 42,000 (6.5%) in 1990, and 64,000 (8.5%) in 2000 were observed in this age group. The age-specific hospitalization rate (per 100,000) for stroke in 2000 compared to that in 1990 or 1980 was higher among women (p < 0.05) but lower among men (p < 0.05). The proportion of transfers to another care facility after discharge in 2000, 1990, and 1980 increased for coronary heart disease and stroke in successive decades of middle-aged adults.
Conclusion.

Baby Boomers made a greater impact on absolute numbers of coronary heart disease and stroke hospitalizations in 2000 relative to that of 45–54-year-olds in 1990 and 1980.

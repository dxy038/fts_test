Presents new ways for teaching such EMC topics as common and differential mode currents, shielding, and wire-to-wire/field-to-wire coupling methods. The objective is accomplished by first bringing `the computer ageÂ´ to the teaching of EMC/EMI. Some of the basic concepts of electromagnetic compatibility are covered by studying the approaches which several successful EMC modeling programs have used for solving the basic interference tasks. Finally the course directs the students to implement several of the learned modeling techniques into representative subsystems. A parallel objective of the course is to make analysis, rather than test, the most efficient way of implementing an EMC plan in the design stages of an electronic product

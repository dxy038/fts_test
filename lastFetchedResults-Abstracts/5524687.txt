A fuzzy adaptive internal model controller (FAIMC) for the time-varying open-loop stable plant has been introduced in this paper. This control scheme consists of two main parts; a fuzzy dynamic model and a fuzzy model-based controller. Fuzzy dynamic model is identified online by using the input and output measurement of the plant. It serves as the internal model and tries to track the output of plant adaptively. The fuzzy model-based controller is designed to pointwise minimize an H <sub>2</sub>-performance objective based on the identified fuzzy model. It aims at improving the robust performance of the closed-loop control system. The application of fuzzy adaptive internal model controller in the laboratory scale Process Control Unit (PCU) from Bytronic shows that this kind of control scheme is appropriate for controlling the time-varying stable plant with time-delay. The whole control system possesses very satisfactory robust performance

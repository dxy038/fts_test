Background: Among different teaching methods in the field of mathematics, each method has its own implications and consequences in the areas of cognitive, emotional, mental, physical and creative thinking, and so on. But not using active methods of teaching mathematics in schools, and lack of attention to nurturing creativity has attracted our attention to the discovery method. 
 Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the impact of guided discovery methods of teaching mathematics and creativity on the third grade of elementary school girls. 
Methods: In this study, pre-test and post-test control group quasi-experimental method was used. For this purpose, 30 students from third grade girl students in the school academic year 2010-2011 of Ardakan city were selected randomly and creativity tests were carried out.
Results: Findings of the study indicates that the guided discovery method of teaching math students have an impact on different aspects of creativity and it has grown. This approach will undoubtedly be one of the most appropriate methods for teaching mathematics to students.
Conclusion: The study shows that the use of active teaching methods in schools, particularly in guided discovery methods such as mathematics textbooks have challenged the increase of creativity in the students.

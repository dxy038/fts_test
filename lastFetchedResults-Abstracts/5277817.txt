In todayÂ´s society, robots are used in many aspects of our lives. For instance, the robot is used as assistance at home, office workplace, hospital, industry plants, educational institution, waste disposal facilities, and others. However, the use of robots to detect and to avoid the exposure to toxic and harmful chemicals has not been addressed adequately. This remains a critical issue and a challenge. To face the challenge, the objective of this paper is to provide a unique perspective in designing and building a tele-operated (human operator with remote control) and autonomous robot (self-guided without human interference) that can detect harmful and lethal chemical gases (NO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, LPG, CH<sub>4</sub>, CNG, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH, NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub> and others) on the ground. Applications include coal mine explosion prevention and detections of natural gas and other industrial and explosive chemicals leaks, detection of harmful gases in public gathering places such as subway stations, shopping malls, and airports. This solar chemical detection robot (SCDR) will potentially reduce the massive loss of human life and reduce the destruction to our environment resulting in land prosperity and a healthier ecosystem. The power management and distribution system of SCDR will be powered by an eco-friendly rechargeable battery which can be recharged during the day by solar energy. This will extend the service hours of the SCDR.

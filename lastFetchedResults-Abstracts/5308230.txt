This paper presents a 60GHz LNA and PAs connected together with input and output switches to create a bidirectional amplifier to be used as a front end block in a 60GHz phased array. The LNA and PA are targeted for low power operation consuming 12mA and 17mA accordingly from 1.3V supply with 23dB gain 7dB NF and 7dBm Psat including all the input and output switches and 0.14mm<sup>2</sup> chip size. This state of the art performance with compact size is achieved by 5 single ended stages. Special design technique and considerations were used to lower the switching loss and to combat feedbacks at this high gain and frequency.

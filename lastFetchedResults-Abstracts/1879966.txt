Lysophospholipids may play an important protective role during primary infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) by enhancing innate antimycobacterial immune response of both macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells. Here, we show that treatment with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) of mice aerogenically infected with MTB immediately after infection results in a significant early reduction of pulmonary CFUs and of histopathological damage in comparison with control mice. In contrast, treatment of acute disease does not result in any improvement of both microbiological and histopathological parameters. Altogether, these results show that LPA treatment can exert protective effect if administrated during primary infection, only.

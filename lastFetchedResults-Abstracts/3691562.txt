Several new liquid impregnants for capacitors have been suggested as possible alternatives to PCB´s which are being replaced in view of their harmful effects. The application of castor oil, a vegetable product, has been studied in the authors´ laboratory with the same objective. The results of the investigations have shown that castor oil possesses most of the favorable properties of a good impregnant. This paper gives a detailed analysis of the dielectric behavior of the oil alone and all-paper capacitors impregnated with castor oil.

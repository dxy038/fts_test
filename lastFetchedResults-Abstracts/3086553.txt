3G mobile system are designed to provide multimedia services. To fulfill QoS requirements for video applications, a robust video codec should be employed. In this paper, a robust and effective algorithm for Group of Blocks (GOB) Intra refresh in H. 264/AVC is presented. The objective is to mitigate the error propagation and improve the perceptual video quality over the mobile networks. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently improve the video quality when errors occur.

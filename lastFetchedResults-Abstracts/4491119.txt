AGV as an important part of automated warehouse system, it can improve the efficiency of the system. One way travelling path of AGV is simple, but always leads to deadlock and lower efficiency. On consideration of bidirectional AGV travelling path, an alternative path policy is proposed to avoid deadlock. The transporting tasks of AGV are constructed by bipartite graph and a task allocation based on maximum-weight matching in bipartite graph is proposed. The steps of allocation method are described in detail. An algorithm based on immune algorithm is given to solve the problem. The simulation result shows that the proposed method is effective and can be used in practical.

Several fields of research demand very high magnetic field intensities with the largest possible radial and axial access volumes for samples and beams. To achieve this objective while maintaining the best possible uniformity places stringent demands upon the superconductor and the design procedures. Conventional rectangular cross-section windings cannot always be designed to make efficient use of the winding volume. This paper describes the use of superconductive tape modules wound with a "slant" to the module face as a means of maximizing the field intensity and achieving useful aperture and sample access with optimized magnet geometry. The angle of the slant is influenced by the desired aperture angle of the radial access port at the magnet midplane. Techniques are described for exact calculations of the axial magnetic field intensity for the slant winding geometry: also, examples will be given of construction techniques and performance.

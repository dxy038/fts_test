We consider energy-efficiency- and user-comfort-driven design of indoor light-emitting-diode (LED) lighting control systems by achieving spatial illumination rendering adapted to presence and daylight conditions, and user preference for the amount of rendered illuminance. A localized illumination rendering strategy for lighting control is presented, where a given level of uniform illuminance is provided with a certain user satisfaction level over a user-occupied zone, and a lower illuminance level is maintained in unoccupied zones. Under these illuminance constraints, our objective is to minimize a weighted sum of power consumed in localized illumination rendering and the net user dissatisfaction with the rendered illumination. This is achieved by determining the dimming levels for controlling the multiple LED luminaires. Algorithms for centralized and distributed lighting control are proposed. Simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of the algorithms in achieving power savings and in meeting user preferences of illumination levels.

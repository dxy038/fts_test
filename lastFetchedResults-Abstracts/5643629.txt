Telephone speech is typically bandlimited to 4 kHz, resulting in a `muffledÂ´ quality. Coding speech with a bandwidth greater than 4 kHz reduces this distortion, but requires a higher bit rate to avoid other types of distortion. An alternative to coding wider bandwidth speech is to exploit correlations between the 0-4 kHz and 4-8 kHz speech bands to re-synthesize wideband speech from decoded narrowband speech. This paper proposes a new technique for highband spectral envelope prediction, based upon codebook mapping with codebooks split by voicing. An objective comparison with several existing methods reveals that this new technique produces the smallest highband spectral distortion. Combined with a suitable highband excitation synthesis scheme, this envelope prediction scheme produces a significant quality improvement in speech that has been coded using narrowband standards

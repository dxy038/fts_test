Objective
The purpose of this study was to examine perinatal outcomes between Asian American and Pacific Islander subgroups.
Study design
This is a retrospective study of all Asian American/Pacific Islander women who were delivered at Stanford University Medical Center from 1998 to 2003. Asian American women were subdivided into the following groups: Indian/Pakistani, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Pacific Islanders (individuals from Tonga, Samoa, Guam, or Polynesia), and Vietnamese. Perinatal outcomes included gestational hypertension/preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm delivery, cesarean delivery, birthweight <2500 g, and birthweight >4000 g.
Results
In the study population of 3779 Asian American women, there were statistically significant differences (P< .01) between most of the outcomes that were examined. Filipina women had the highest risk of gestational hypertension/preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio, 2.21); Indian/Pakistani women had the highest risk of preterm delivery (adjusted odds ratio, 1.67), gestational diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio, 1.39), and low birthweight at term (adjusted odds ratio, 2.30); and Pacific Islander women had the highest risk of macrosomia (adjusted odds ratio, 3.67).
Conclusion
Significant differences in perinatal outcomes exist between subgroups of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. Future research on race/ethnicity and perinatal outcomes should examine heterogeneity among these groups before collapsing these individual subgroups into the larger group “Asian.” Individuals should be counseled regarding perinatal risk according to their specific Asian subgroup.

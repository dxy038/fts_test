Background & Objective. Osteoarthritis is progressive degenerative disease resulting in significant af-fection of joints. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) are widely used in this condition but are associated with significant side effects; hence the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toler-ability of nutritional supplements such as Glucosamine, Chondroitin sulphate and methyl sulfonyl meth-ane in osteoarthritis as an alternative approach for this condition. Patients & Methods. Thirty-seven pa-tients from medicine and orthopedic out patient departments were assessed for severity of osteoarthritis based on visual analog scale, Lequesne’s index, goniometry, and radiography and enrolled into the open label study. All patients received cartivit (Glucosamine, Chondroitin sulphate and MSM) two tablets thrice a day for twelve weeks and were reassessed for changes in above parameters every four weeks. The tolerability was also assessed during the monthly visits. Results. Out of 32 patients who completed study, there was significant improvement in pain and Lequesne’s index at four, eight and twelve weeks (p < 0.05). There was gradual improvement in joint mobility over twelve weeks. There was no improvement in radiological changes in twelve weeks study period. Patients tolerated the study medication well and there was no abnormality observed in the various biochemical markers during the study. Conclusions. Gluco-samine, chondroitin sulphate and methyl sulfonyl methane combination was useful in decreasing pain, improving functional ability and improving joint mobility and was well tolerated in patients with osteoarthri-tis.

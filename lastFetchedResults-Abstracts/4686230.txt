The current status of the Large Helical Device (LHD) project is reported. The LHD device is a heliotron/torsatron-type superconducting machine, scheduled to be constructed by the newly established National Institute for Fusion Science as the major interuniversity fusion research project in Japan. The basic design parameters of the device are the following: poloidal pitch number of the helical coil=2, toroidal pitch number=10, toroidal magnetic field=4 T, major radius=4 m, and coil minor radius=0.5-0.6 m. The total stored magnetic energy is ~2 GJ. The heating power, (absorbed power in the plasma) is 20 MW. The physical objective of this project is to produce currentless, steady-state, high-temperature plasmas and conduct various experimental programs to develop a helical fusion system as an alternative approach to the tokamak. The magnetic configuration and helical divertor configuration are described. The helical device design, conductor design, support structure design, and refrigeration design are given in detail. The heating systems, neutral beam injector (NBI), and diagnostic system are also discussed

An increasing number of private households are becoming producers of renewable energy. From an economic perspective it is beneficial to utilize this energy both locally and promptly. This does require the ability to be able to deal with local excess production at short notice using, for example, an electronic trading platform. The objective of "PeerEnergyCloud" is to research and develop cloud-based technologies for such a trading platform. In this paper we describe an interactive demonstration as it was presented to a wide audience at the CeBIT 2012 fair which took place in Hanover, Germany. The demonstration shows a future energy scenario demonstrating techniques which are necessary as a basis for a civil marketplace for trading renewable energies. We will especially focus on the learning of profiles and based on this the forecast of energy consumption and production. Visitors could indicate individual sensors and available data, switch on and off appliances and hence influence the given user profile and experience the changes on the forecast and in the agent system\Â´s behavior. Like the visitors of the CeBIT conference attendees will be able to experience in an interactive demonstration techniques which are necessary as a basis for a civil marketplace for trading renewable energies.

Antibiotics are used for treatment of honey bee diseases. Antibiotics lower the
numbers of beneficial bacteria in the body. Antibiotics disrupt normal microflora
balance of digestive tract. Antibiotic use in food animal production has been
associated with the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. In
response to these practices and attendant problems, several organizations have
called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production. For this reason,
nutritional additives were used to reduce of antibiotics. Two of these additives are
probiotics and citric acid. Both of them are used in honey bee nutrition and have
antibacterial activities. Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms, including
Lactobacillus species, Bifidobacterium species and yeasts that may beneficially
affect the host upon ingestion by improving the balance of the intestinal
microflora. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of
Saccharomyces cerevis iae as a probiotic organism and citric acid as an intestine
acidifying factor that restrict the growth of intestinal bacteria on the microflora of
honey bee digestive tract. To achieve this, bacteria of honey bee digestive tract
were isolated and identified. Then, the effect of citric acid and probiotics were
investigated. The results showed that citric acid is effective on bacteria of honey
bee digestive tract and its MIC and probiotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae reduce the
number of bacteria of honey bee digestive tract.

In the objective of streaming the video to the end-user with the best possible quality, in this paper we propose an approach that couples the SNR scalable video coding (SVC) extension of H264/AVC, with the path diversity provided by video distribution network (VDN). Our method adapts to the heterogeneity of end-users using the scalable video coding. Moreover, it adapts to network bandwidth fluctuation by observing the changes of the available bandwidth over the multiple overlay paths, and updating the streaming strategy accordingly.

We propose an improved decentralized method for environment control in wireless sensor/actuator networks. In our method, the objective function is defined to balance energy saving against control signal quality. Each sensor node calculates initial values in an iterative process for estimating optimal control signals using the sensor signals received from neighboring nodes. We evaluated its accuracy and efficiency by using motes

A prototype of voltage-source soft-switching PWM inverter-type auxiliary resonant bridgeleg
link snubbers is proposed with bidirectional active power switches and voltage clamping diodes for
a new high-power high-voltage application. The voltage clamping diodes in the active resonant
snubber are more effective in protecting the bidirectional active switches in the bridge-leg linked
auxiliary resonant snubber from surge voltage spikes caused by energy stored in the auxiliary
quasiresonant inductors and inductive parasitic wiring components. A variety of resonant snubber
circuit topologies with voltage clamping diodes are presented and demonstrated. As an example of the
variations of the proposed auxiliary active resonant-commutation snubber topologies, operation of a
single-IGBT bidirectional switch with two voltage clamping diodes is analysed and discussed in detail
for the auxiliary resonant bridge-leg link snubbers. The operating performance of the new active
auxiliary resonant snubber-associated inverter-fed DC to DC power converter with voltage clamping
diodes is practically demonstrated and evaluated to verify its effectiveness for a high-power highvoltage
x-ray generator.

The primary objective of this review is to discuss recent technological developments in the field of solid-phase microextraction that have enhanced the utility of this sample preparation technique in the field of bioanalysis. These developments include introduction of various new biocompatible coating phases suitable for bioanalysis, such as commercial prototype in vivo SPME devices, as well as the development of sampling interfaces that extend the use of this methodology to small animals such as mice. These new devices permit application of in vivo SPME to a variety of analyses, including pharmacokinetics, bioaccumulation and metabolomics studies, with good temporal and spatial resolution. New calibration approaches have also been introduced to facilitate in vivo studies and provide fast and quantitative results without the need to achieve equilibrium. In combination with the drastic improvement in the analytical sensitivity of modern liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry instrumentation, full potential of in vivo SPME as a sample preparation tool in life sciences can finally be explored. From the instrumentation perspective, SPME was successfully automated in 96-well format for the first time. This opens up new opportunities for high-throughput applications (&gt;1000 samples/day) such as for the determination of unbound and total drug concentrations in complex matrices such as whole blood with no need for sample pretreatment, studies of distribution of drugs in various compartments and/or determination of plasma protein binding and other ligand–receptor binding studies, and this review will summarize the progress in this research area to date.

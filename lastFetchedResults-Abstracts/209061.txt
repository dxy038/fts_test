Background & Objective: Tetra Carbon Cholride has been known as reference hepatotoxin
because it can cause necrosis, fatty change, cirrhosis and cancer liver, Silymarin has
hcpatoprotective and anti hepatoxin effect. This study was done to determine the protective
effect of Silymarin in acute hepatotoxicity of CCl4 in rats.
Materials & Methods: In this experimental study, we chose 251.11/kg dose of CCl4 (in mineral
oil solvent) as an optimum dose. The hepatotoxic effects ofintraperiotoneal injection ofCCl4 for
obtaining parameters of toxicity and therapeutic effects have been examined. According to
enzymatic results (increase in ALT and AST) and histopathologic changes (grading the changes
in liver including cytoplasmic granularity, cloudy swelling, necrosis and fatty change), the
interval between prescribing silymarin and sampling was determined. Silymarin as a suspension
in propylene glycol CMC 2% (3/2 ratio) has been prescribed in 50, 200 and 800mglkg doses and
serum and liver samples were obtained. Negative control group received silymarin vehicle in
CCI4 solvent, drug control received 800 mg/kg of silymarin in CC14 solvent and positive control
received silymarin vehicle after injecting CCI4.
Results: The results showed that prescribing 50mglkg silymarin one hour after injecting CCI4,
in addition to inhibiting transaminase activity, prevents progress of liver injury up to 50% of
positive control group. Cellular repair and regeneration are also enhanced, So the grade 3necrosis
in positive control group is decreased to grade 0.5 in silymarin gourp in 48 hours prescribing
silymarin (50mg/kg).
Conclusion: This study showed that up to six hours after injecting CCl4 significantly prevents
hepatotoxicity, and cause acceleration in repair of liver injuries.

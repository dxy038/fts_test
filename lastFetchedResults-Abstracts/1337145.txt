The objective of this study was to compare results from endometrial cytological and bacteriological examinations obtained by two different laboratories. One laboratory used endometrial swabs and the other endometrial biopsies for the examinations. A higher proportion of sterile, cytology positive cases were found in the laboratory using swabs (148/401 [37%] vs 12/237 [5%], P < .0001). In both laboratories it was found that positive cytology was less likely to occur when Escherichia coli was isolated than if other species were isolated. This tendency was significant in both laboratories (P < .05 vs P < .0001).

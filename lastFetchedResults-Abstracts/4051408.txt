Relaxation oscillators can usually be represented as a feedback system with hysteresis. The relay relaxation oscillator consists of relay hysteresis and a linear system in feedback. The objective of this work is to study the existence of periodic orbits and the dynamics of coupled relay oscillators. In particular, we give a complete analysis for the case of unimodal periodic orbits, and illustrate the presence of degenerate and asymmetric orbits. We also discuss how complex orbits can arise from bifurcation of unimodal orbits. Finally, we focus on oscillators with an integrator as the linear component, and study the entrainment under external forcing, and phase locking when such oscillators are coupled in a ring

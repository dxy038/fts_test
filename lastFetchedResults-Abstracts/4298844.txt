Motivated by the problem of adaptive resource management in decentralized sensor networks, the paper derives an algorithm for the distributed computation of the conditional posterior Crame&#769;r-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) for nonlinear tracking applications as an alternative to the non-conditional (conventional) PCRLB. Using the proposed conditional bound, a decentralized adaptive sensor-selection algorithm is then developed with the objective of dynamically activating a subset of observation nodes to optimize the networkÂ´s performance. Our Monte Carlo simulations verify the superiority of the proposed decentralized PCRLB based sensor selection approach in bearing only tracking applications over its conventional counterparts.

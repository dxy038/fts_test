In this paper, we introduced our recent study to construct a speech interface agent which can communicate smoothly with everyday users and can be a communication partner for them. To evaluate the interaction between users and this agent model, e.g., whether a user regards this agent as a communication partner or not, we need to refer the objective indicator which reflects users´ internal status accurately and reliably. We then explained the experimental setting to acquire such objective indicator based on the users´ cognitive, behavioral and physiological indexes.

This paper presents a new optimization method (MOCDEA) called cloud droplets evolution algorithm which is applied to multi-objective optimization and engineering design problems. The fundamental concepts and ideas which underlie the proposed algorithm is inspired from nature and based on the observation of cloud formation process and phase transformation of the matter. The proposed algorithms are compared with a number of other well-known optimization algorithms and the experimental results suggest that MOCDEA is able to provide better performance.

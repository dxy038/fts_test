Color plays an important role in consumer purchase decisions of pork. For this reason, the objective of this study was to determine the usefulness of instrumental measures of bloom and bloom as a function of pH. Color was measured with two instruments on pork chops of varied ultimate pH (5.1â€“6.1) in a vacuum package and again after blooming. During bloom, Hunter a* increased while Minolta a values changed little. Bloom had no effect on either measure of lightness (L* or L). With bloom, Hunter Hue Angle decreased indicating an increase in red color, while Minolta Hue Angle measurement increased with bloom, implying a decrease in true red color. Although lightness was unaffected by bloom, pH had a significant effect on Hunter L* and Minolta L values. Increasing pH resulted in an increase of Hunter a*, but not Minolta a, in both unbloomed and bloomed chops. Hunter Hue Angle was consistently higher than Minolta Hue Angle regardless of bloom status or pH.

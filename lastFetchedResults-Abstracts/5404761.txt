The paper shows that the 5-variable rate equation model can be reduced to an effective 2-variable system, which permits to clarify the relevant dynamical processes during the laser turn-on. The objective is to determine practical analytical expressions for (i) the steady state intensity, (ii) the relaxation oscillation frequency, and (iii) the damping rate which could be guidelines for optimizing the performances of quantum-dot (QD) lasers.

Objective: To study the mechanism of cortical reflex myoclonus.
Methods: A patient with stimulus sensitive myoclonus of the left foot had an array of subdural electrodes placed over the right sensorimotor cortex.
Results: Stimulation through one of the electrodes (contact 13) facilitated leg muscles with the shortest latency and was presumed to lie over the motor cortex. Tibial nerve stimulation evoked a potential with the shortest latency 1 cm further posteriorly (contacts 11–12). These contacts were presumed to lie over the sensory cortex. The potential at 11–12 was followed by a much larger potential that reversed polarity at contact 13. Back averaging from spontaneous myoclonic jerks showed a cortical premovement potential which reversed polarity at contact 13. The threshold for the motor evoked potential in leg muscles evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation was lower on the affected side. Electrical stimulation through contact 13 produced cortical potentials that could be recorded at adjacent contacts. The combination of a positive potential followed by a negative potential recurred at ˜35–40 ms intervals, each positive potential generating a myoclonic jerk. Additional waves resembling I waves accompanied only the first positive potential. Surgical removal of the cortex under electrode 13 abolished the myoclonus.
Conclusions: The myoclonic jerks arose in the motor cortex. We postulate that there is increased excitability or synchronization of the cortical neurons at that site. The spontaneous, peripherally induced and recurrent cortical potentials and myoclonic jerks can occur without participation of the circuitry of the presumed I waves

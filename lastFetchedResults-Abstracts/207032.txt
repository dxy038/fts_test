PSPC or split step Fourier migration is a method based on downward continuation of seismic wave field in frequency-space and frequency-wave number domains. Compared with the phase shift method, this method is a superior algorithm with the ability to handle lateral variations in the velocity field. Therefore, the method is a depth migration, which works in the post stack domain.
In this study, the ability, precision and validity of PSPC migration in the processing of real data sets with strong lateral velocity variations is verified.
In order to achieve this objective, the velocity section used by migration algorithms has been improved in different steps by the iterative method of residual move-out analysis through applying pre stack Kirchhofftime migration.
The improved velocity section was then used to apply pre stack Kirchhoff depth migration to original CMP gathers and PSPC migration to the stack section and the results were compared.

Modern electric power utilities are facing many challenges due to increasing power demand but the growth of power generation and transmission has been limited due to limited resources, environmental restrictions and right-of-way problems. These problems can be minimized by installing Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS) devices to optimize the existing transmission system. In this paper, variable shunt susceptance model of Static VAR Compensator is used to regulate the voltage magnitude at specified bus. A Multi objective function containing active power losses, fuel cost, branching loading and voltage deviation is taken and BAT and Firefly Algorithms are applied. The time of computation, objective function value and susceptance of SVC are determined. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is carried out on IEEE 30 Bus System by varying its parameters like population, Pulse rate and Loudness and the results are compared. The above analysis is carried without and with the presence of Static VAR Compensator and the results are presented and analyzed.

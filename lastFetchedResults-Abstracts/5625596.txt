An adaptive image and video retargeting algorithm based on Fourier analysis is proposed in this work. We first divide an input image into several strips using the gradient information so that each strip consists of textures of similar complexities. Then, we scale each strip adaptively according to its importance measure. More specifically, the distortions, generated by the scaling procedure, are formulated in the frequency domain using the Fourier transform. Then, the objective is to determine the sizes of scaled strips to minimize the sum of distortions, subject to the constraint that the sum of their sizes should equal the size of the target output image. We solve this constrained optimization problem using the Lagrangian multiplier technique. Moreover, we extend the approach to the retargeting of video sequences. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides reliable retargeting performance efficiently.

This paper presents a new bidirectional three-port DC-DC converter, which connects a fuel cell, an ultra-capacitor and a load via three-winding transformer and full bridge rectifier. It is based on current-fed switching network and multi-resonant circuits, using in flexible distributed generations. The proposed topology has only four active switches with common ground gate driving for each input port. Moreover, the current drawn from each input port is low current ripple owing to its topology. Phase shift controlling handles power exchanging through each port and overlapping phase is used to adjust output voltage around its rated voltage. MATLAB/SIMULINK2012a environment is used to simulate the different modes of operation of this proposed converter.

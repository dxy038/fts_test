Our objective is to develop a new interactive CACSD package for the design of linear multivariable control systems. The package will incorporate the Stable Factorization design technique together with other recent design methodologies such as the Systematic Design Approach. In order to provide a high level of interactive design environment for the user, knowledge-based or expert systems development tools will also be provided within the package. In addition, the user will be provided with a library of optimization programs, as well as the facilities to write user-defined functions and procedures.

We present a novel multi-constrains routing algorithm, called one-step delay-constrained pool sharing (ODPS) algorithm, in a survivable mesh network. The goal of this algorithm is to compute a pair of link-disjoint primary and backup paths between a given source and destination nodes, which guarantees full recovery from any single link failure in the network. Our objective is to minimize the total end-to-end delay time along the primary and backup paths as well as the resources (such as backup bandwidth) used in the network. Our approach solves the trap-topology issue of the two-step delay-constrained pool sharing (TDPS) algorithm which we introduced in our earlier contribution. Using simulation, we have studied both TDPS and ODPS algorithms on the existing North-American transport networks. We show that ODPS avoids trap-topology, and outperforms TDPS in terms of the total end-to-end packet delay.

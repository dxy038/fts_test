The Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission has the scientific objective of measuring both soil moisture and freeze/thaw state from space. The mission will make both active radar and passive radiometer measurements at L-band in order to retrieve soil moisture. Some studies, however, indicated that these measurements are susceptible to radio frequency interference (RFI) in several geographic locations. As SMAP is a global mission and its mission life is 3 years, it is crucial for SMAP to understand the RFI over the whole globe and its temporal behavior. There will be impacts to the instrument system design and ground data processing in order to mitigate RFI. In this paper, strategies and procedures for performing this RFI study will be presented, and some results utilizing the RFI observed in the ALOS PALSAR data are described. The nature of the observed RFI is characterized and suggests some bands are relative free of RFI. The SMAP radar system will use a 1 MHz bandwidth, which can be placed within these suggested ldquoclearrdquo frequencies. The ALOS PALSAR data covers 28 MHz within the 80 MHz allocated for active L-band remote sensing. In addition, an initial analysis with UAVSAR data, which uses the entire 80 MHz allocation, indicates the relative severity of RFI over the whole band. An algorithm to remove RFI is suggested and its performance is shown for some data from ALOS PALSAR and UAVSAR.

With the emerging installations of multitype renewable energy sources and energy storage elements, the dc electronic distribution systems in residential buildings (dc nanogrid) are becoming an alternative future system solution, achieving a zero net-energy consumption and optimized power management. The concept of the energy control center (ECC), which interconnects the dc system to the traditional ac utility grid, is introduced, and the operation function of ECC converter suitable for dc nanogrid application is defined. This paper investigates a two-stage topology using a full bridge in series with a bidirectional synchronous rectifier dc&#8211;dc converter as a single-phase ECC for dc nanogrid, with a significant reduction of the dc-link capacitor value. The operation analysis and the design of passive components are provided. A bidirectional control system and the design process are also presented in terms of the system requirement and the small dc-link capacitor.

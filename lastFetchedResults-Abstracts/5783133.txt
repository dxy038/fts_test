An induction motor drive using an improved high-frequency resonant DC link inverter is presented. The resonant circuit was systematically analyzed first to establish the criteria for initial current selection, and a new circuit was then proposed to establish the bidirectional initial current. The proposed current initialization scheme solves voltage overshoot and zero-crossing failure problems in the ordinary resonant DC link inverters. A three-phase 3 kW IGBT (insulated-gate bipolar transistor) based 60 kHz resonant link inverter has been constructed and successfully tested with an induction motor drive. The speed control system is implemented using two microprocessors: TMS320C25 for computation and INTEL 80386 for monitoring and user interface. Experimental results showing the superior operation of the proposed resonant DC link inverter drive are presented.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

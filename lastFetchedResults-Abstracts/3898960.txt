This paper presents a game-theoretic communication structure, which is a network constructed among distributed controllers in the microgrid. This helps to share local controller information, such as control input, individual objectives among controllers, and finds a better optimized cost for the individual objectives. The modeling follows a game-theoretic framework for the energy conversion and control elements inside small-scale power systems (SSPS) or microgrids. These elements form teams to optimize performance and operation based on available information and communication. The team players are able to minimize a common objective when there is communication, and shift to the individual local objectives when communication fails. This paper also presents analysis to determine the minimal performance standards for the given level of communicated information. Then it shows optimal information mixing for team player modeling. In addition, a Stackelberg model is proposed for the microgrid with a leader-follower modeling approach. The last part of this paper shows possible examples with network contingency study with team player participation.

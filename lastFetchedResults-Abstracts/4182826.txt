To find the optimal reorder point and order quantity which minimize the total average cost, an EOQ model with fuzzy lead time was proposed. By analyzing the convexity of the objective function, the optimal solution was obtained for each &#945;-cut of lead time with Kuhn-Tucher Conditions. Hence, the membership function of the optimal reorder point and order quantity were defuzzified into real number. Furthermore, examples were provided in which the lead time was characterized as a trapezoidal fuzzy number and the optimal reorder point and order quantity were resolved.

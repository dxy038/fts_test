This article addresses resource reallocation among production processes. Proposed model is formalized in the base of Barnum and Gleason model [2]. The objective function minimizes the sum of same kind inputs. This model reallocates resource to all subunits such that DMU allocation efficiency improves and also concerns subunits efficiency. A production function is defined for any output and therefore model is generalized to multiple outputs. Also an application is investigated involving bank area.

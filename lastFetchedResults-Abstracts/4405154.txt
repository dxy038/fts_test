In this paper, an optimal design of an electromagnetic digital actuators array is presented. This array is composed of 25 elementary electromagnetic digital actuators arranged in a 5 &#215; 5 matrix configuration. A magnetic static model of the array is presented and has been used for the optimization of the array. Genetic algorithm technique has been used for this optimization study. In the paper, optimization based on single-objective and multi-objective genetic algorithms have been implemented and compared. Finally the optimal design of the actuators array has been determined.

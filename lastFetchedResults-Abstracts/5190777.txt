Vehicle dispatching plays an important part in improving event reaction ability, saving rescue time and reducing property losses in urban traffic emergency systems. Combined with characteristics of emergency rescue, an optimal object based on the shortest emergency time is established and proved to satisfy the definition of the best dispatching plan. An algorithm based on convex combination method is also proposed. Finally, an example illustrates that the optimal objective is rational and the algorithm is effective.

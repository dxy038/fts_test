Free viewpoint video (FW) is on its research stage with many problems to be resolved. Due to no original data can be used to compare with when the arbitrary viewpoint image is reproduced, quality evaluation for the new viewpoint image becomes one of the difficulties in realizing FW. Ray space representation is the main approach to realize FVV of complex scene and ray space interpolation is one of the key techniques in ray space-based FW. The quality of interpolated ray space determines the quality of the novel view image. In this paper, we proposes a new method by calculating the euclidean distance of normalized edge direction histogram between interpolated ray space and perfect ray space to evaluate the quality of ray space. The experimental results show that, the proposed objective quality evaluation can well evaluate the quality of an arbitrary virtual view image generated from different types of interpolated ray space slices.

This paper presents an innovative approach for tactical data links - developed in close collaboration with the Australian Army Signal Corps RASC, with the objective of overcoming the problem of fibre-optic cables´ propensity to damage in the field. The result of this successful collaboration has led to the development of a field deployable communications product that uses copper cables (WD-1/TT type) as its communications medium and is capable of extending data over 5 miles at bandwidth of up to 22Mbs - an effective soldier friendly alternative to the fibre-optic cable based systems, especially on a brigade level and below. The paper reviews the rationale behind the selection of an ´off the shelf transmission technology and its adaptations to make it highly suitable for the military field deployed environment. Technical and logistical advantages of using copper wires in modern data applications are presented, including the Australian Army´s report of the early field trial. This collaboration and the resulting product won the AFCEA ´Golden Link Award´ as well as a number of other prestigious industry awards for its outstanding innovation.

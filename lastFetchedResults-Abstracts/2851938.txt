In this paper, we propose a new rate control scheme designed for the newest high efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard, and aimed at enhancing the quality of regions of interest (ROI). Our approach allocates a higher bit rate to the region of interest while keeping the global bit rate close to the assigned target value. This algorithm is developed for a videoconferencing system, where the ROIs (typically, faces) are automatically detected and each coding unit is classified in a region of the interest map. This map is given as input to the rate control algorithm and the bit allocation is made accordingly. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves accurate target bit rates and provides an improvement in the region of interest quality, both in objective metrics and based on subjective quality evaluation.

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of preventive immunization on the incidence of allergies in Poland.18617 (53.8% female, 24.2% 6-7 years old, 25.4% 13-14 years old, 50.4% 20–44 years old) were selected by stratified cluster sampling method in 8 cities and 1 rural area. 4783 of whom underwent objective outpatient screening assessments. Study subjects were evaluated for any association  between  preventive  immunization  against  rubella,  measles,  typhoid  fever, smallpox and incidence of atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma.There was no increased risk of allergy incidence in the majority of vaccinated subjects against rubella, measles, typhoid  fever, or smallpox (OR  from 0.42 (ppppp=0.005), varicella (OR=1.18; p=0.003); rhinitis and AR following vaccination against measles (respectively OR=1.22; pp=0.0002).  No  higher risk of allergic  diseases  was  demonstrated  in vaccinated individuals diagnosed by doctor in an outpatient setting.These data do not demonstrate a causal relationship between vaccinations and allergic conditions.

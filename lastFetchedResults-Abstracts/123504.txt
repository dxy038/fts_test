Introduction & Objective: The modality for treatment of hemorrhoidal disease has changed over the years. Rubber band ligation (RBC) is the most popular of the non-surgical intervention, that it's not popular in Iran. Despite its simplicity, the rate of retreatment in RBL was higher than hemorrhoidectomy. In this study, we compared Hemorrhoidectomy (H group) and rubber band ligation (RBL group).
Materials & Methods: In this non-randomized clinical trial, from October 2001 to August 2002, the outcomes of 105 patients with grade II & III hemorrhoids, who underwent hemorrhoidectomy (39 patients) or RBL (66 patients) were compared. Patients were managed as out -patients and examined at the end of the first and second week for any complications and the outcomes of treatment.
Results: Pain existed in 66.5% of the H group and 47% of the RBL group in the first visit (p<0.05) and decreased to 15% and 13% at the end of second week.
The patient's satisfactory score was significantly different in both groups. Patients in the RBL group were satisfied more than those in the H group in first visit (p<0.05) but satisfactory score was the same in both groups in second visit.
Conclusions: RBL group showed a better outcome in comparison to hemorrhoidectomy. Especially in grade II hemorrhoids due to the simplicity and less early complications.

Dynamic route guidance system is an important section of intelligent transportation systems. The main core of this system is computation of shortest path based on the real-time information. In this research the formulation of dynamic guidance of vehicle has been presented based on characteristics of intelligent transportation systems and using the general level of service criteria which include such variables as travel time, fuel consumption objective consideration of socio-economic reality and more completely description of traffic condition. Because of time-varying flows on traffic networks, the routing algorithm based on artificial intelligence techniques emphasized on a hybrid genetic algorithm to solve the presented model is developed, the important results of this paper is the ability of designing algorithm in better trip planning, routing decisions in urban transportation network include the robust routing strategy in adjustment with dynamic traffic condition and presentation of several route alternative to reduce travel cost. Finally the experimental simulation results which verify the feasibility and validity of this algorithm are shown.

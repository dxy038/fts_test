The objective in the courses described herein was to teach circuit analysis, optimization, and design in a way that recognizes the important role of computers, but does not become overpowered by the myriad subtleties and irrationalities of real-world computers. This paper discusses the authorÂ´s experience in using existing interactive computer facilities to teach graduate and undergraduate circuits subjects, and suggests promising directions in which to go and not to go. Questions raised concern the role of omnibus circuit analysis programs, if any, how to teach numerical analysis without quite, time-sharing economics, and the use of a computer in teaching machine mode someday.

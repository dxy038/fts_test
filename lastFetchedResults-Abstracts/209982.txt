Background and Aim: The main objective of using adhesive material is the improvement of restorative materials
bonding to dentin surface in clean environment. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of EDTA on bond
strength of composite resin to dentin surface when used at different times and concentrations prior to application of
adhesive systems by employing Scanning Electronic Microscope (SEM).
Materials and Method: A total of 100 dentin samples were prepared from 50 human premolars. These samples were
divided into two groups according to bonding type (Clearfil SE Bond=group L Futurbond NR=group II) and each one
was classified 5 subgroups according to time and concentration of EDTA as follows: 1 - Control. 2- EDTA 15%, 30
seconds. 3 - EDTA 15%, 60 seconds. 4 - EDTA 24%, 30 seconds. 5 - EDTA 24%, 60 seconds. These samples were
conditioned and composite cylinders were adhered to them. After 500 cycles of thermocycling, the testing for microshear
bond strength was conducted on these samples. Another lO samples were demineralized for 30 seconds with
6NHCL and dcprotcinized with 2.5% Naocl for 10 minutes, air dried with desiccators and viewed under SE!vt Data
were analyzed using one-way as well as three-way ANOV A and Tukey tests.
Results: The mean Micro-shear bond strength in group 1 (Cleorfil SE bond) were: 31.88 (±13) for subgroup I, 2S.4
(±13) in subgroup 2, 29.8 (±9) in subgroup 3, 29.2 (±il) in subgroup 4, and 32.7 (±12) in subgroup 5. The mean
Micro-shear bond strength in group 2 (Futurbond NR): were: 22.6 LLlO) for subgroup I. 28.5 (±9) in subgroup 2. 27.3
(± [0) subgroup 3, 32.4 (± IS! in subgroup 4, and 31.1 (± 14) in subgroup 5.
There were no significant differences between the samples conditioned and the ones not conditioned with EDTA, time
and the concentration of EDTA applied and also the two bonding types.
Conclusions: EDTA conditioning prior to use of the two bonding agents under investigation in this study did not
improve the bonding strength of the self etch systems, neither did the time and the concentration of EDTA applied.

This paper presents improved mathematical reliability model for optimal protective devices placement in Micro Grid (MG). The objective is to improve calculation for System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), and Total Cost (TC) including Fix Cost of device investment, Cost of permanent interruption, and temporary interruption. SAIFI, SAIDI, and TC are minimized by Improved Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (IBPSO). For single objective optimization problems, Binary PSO is improved by balance sigmoid function. Results show that the given number of distributed generation (DG) and optimal protective devices placement including reclosers, switches, and fuses can increase reliability and decrease the frequency, duration, and cost of interruption in MG system.

This paper presents a theoretical analysis of a detailed optical link between two communication platforms (HAPs), both situated at 20 km height from the EarthÂ´s surface. The main objective here is the calculation of data rate load which can be transmitted through the link for various link parameters. The proposed scenarios cover different cases concerning the transmitter and receiver characteristics. The principal convention throughout this study is a constraint on transmit power (less than 1 W) independently of the data rate.

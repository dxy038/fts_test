The main objective of the present study is to develop a modified membrane bioreactor (MBR) system for the treatment of municipal wastewater for the enhanced biological removal of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) simultaneously with the ultimate goal of optimizing the two processes. The paper will address the implementation and optimization of the MBR process with respect to biological characteristics, operational performance, and effluent quality. The system utilizes anoxic P uptake and nitrificationdenitrification in a MBR. Following optimization, the system achieved 99% chemical oxygen demand (COD), 98.4% NH3-N, 77.5% TN, and 96.3% P removal producing effluent biological oxygen demand, COD, NH3-N,NO3N,NO2-N, and P of <3, 3, 0.4, 5.8, 0.050, and 0.18  mg/L, respectively.

The main objective of this paper is to identify the hysteresis effect of a piezoelectric element (PE) and show its influence on the impact drive mechanism (IDM) which is a piezoelectric actuator (PA). As the IDM takes action due to the piezoelectric force, a Leuven model of the frictional force is proposed to modify the dynamic equations. For completely realizing the dynamic model, an adaptive identification method is quoted to experimentally identify the hysteresis parameters of the Boucâ€“Wen model. Moreover, a feedforward compensator is designed to make reparation the loss force of the PE due to nonlinearity of the hysteresis effect. Finally, simulation results of our compensator and the designed voltage waveforms are taken as the input commands to validate the excellent tracking performances of the IDM.

This paper addresses H<sub>&#8734;</sub> filtering problem for fuzzy dynamical systems with time delays based on Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) model. The main objective is to obtain fuzzy H<sub>&#8734;</sub> filter such that the filtering error system is stable and guarantees a prescribed estimation error level. By use of delay-dependent Lyapunov functional approach, sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of fuzzy H<sub>&#8734;</sub> filter in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMI). An example is given to illustrate the proposed results.

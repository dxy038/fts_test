The first, termed vertical, analyzes the semantics of the application and distributes it across multiple nodes based on its community of users and how they access the system. The second, termed horizontal, declusters the applicationÂ´s data across multiple nodes with the objective to distribute client requests evenly across these nodes. Hybrid, our third approach, considers a horizontal partitioning of services identified by a vertical partitioning. The paper describes the application of each approach to newsblaster

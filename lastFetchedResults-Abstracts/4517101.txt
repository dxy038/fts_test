In this paper artificial neural network (ANN) technologies and analytical models have been investigated and incorporated to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of machinery self diagnostic system. Several advanced vibration trending methods have been studied and used to quantify machine operating conditions. An on-line, multi-channel condition monitoring procedure has been developed and coded. The major technique used for self diagnostic is a modified ARTMAP neural network. The objective is to provide a rigid solution for condition-based intelligent self diagnostic system.

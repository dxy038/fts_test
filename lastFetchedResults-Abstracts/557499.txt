Background: Food insecurity and hunger not only affect physical health, but also
have social and psychological effects. Therefore, providing food security for society is
one of the major goals of social and economical development programs. The objective
of this study was to determine the prevalence and intensity of food insecurity at North
West of Tabriz as a population sample of East Azerbaijan province.
Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 300
subjects, 18-78 years old (168 females and 132 males) that were selected by simple
sampling method. Demographic questionnaire was completed and information related
to food consumption was collected by using 24- hours' food recall questionnaire for
three days a week (one holiday and two days at the middle of the week). Hunger index
was determined as inadequate intake of energy and hidden hunger index as inadequate
intake of the key nutrients (energy, vitamin A, protein, riboflavin, calcium). Data were
analyzed by Nutrition III software.
Findings: The prevalence of hunger and hidden hunger were 26% and 41.6%
respectively. All of the subjects with hunger consumed calcium less than
recommended levels. They also consumed riboflavin, protein and vitamin A 94.8%,
74.3 and 56.4% lower than recommended levels respectively. Subjects with hidden
hunger consumed calcium, riboflavin, protein, and vitamin A 89.6%, 77.6%, 19.2%,
and 9.6% lower than recommended levels respectively. Only 32.3% of subjects were
secure in terms of getting all those five key nutrients, i. e. energy, protein, vitamin A,
riboflavin and calcium.
Conclusion: Food insecurity in this area is prevalent, therefore programming for
taking the edge off it and giving correct information on sufficient, varied and balanced
diet is recommended.

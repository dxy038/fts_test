ABSTRACT : In this context, a novel structure has been proposed for improving Harmony Search (HS) algorithm to Unit Comment (UC) problem. The HS algorithm by improvise, update and check operators obtain optimal solution for defined objective function. In proposed improved HS (iHS) algorithm, two important control parameters have been adjusted to obtain better solution from simple HS algorithm. The objective function of this study consists of three terms; operation and start up, as well as shut down costs. To confirm robustness of iHS algorithm, this algorithm has been tested on systems with 10, 20, 40 and 60 generating units and its results have been presented as schematic and tabular and compared with simple HS algorithm and other works.

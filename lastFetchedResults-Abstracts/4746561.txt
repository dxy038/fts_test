Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) which utilise IEEE 802.15.4 technology operate primarily in the 2.4 GHz globally compatible ISM band. However, the wireless propagation channel in this crowded band is notoriously variable and unpredictable, and it has a significant impact on the coverage range and quality of the radio links between the wireless nodes. Therefore, the use of Frequency Diversity (FD) has potential to ameliorate this situation. In this paper, the possible benefits of using FD in a tunnel environment have been quantified by performing accurate propagation measurements using modified and calibrated off-the-shelf 802.15.4 based sensor motes in the disused Aldwych underground railway tunnel. The objective of this investigation is to characterise the performance of FD in this confined environment. Cross correlation coefficients are calculated from samples of the received power on a number of frequency channels gathered during the field measurements. The low measured values of the cross correlation coefficients indicate that applying FD at 2.4 GHz will improve link performance in a WSN deployed in a tunnel. This finding closely matches results obtained by running a computational simulation of the tunnel radio propagation using a 2D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method.

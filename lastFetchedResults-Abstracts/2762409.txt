A welding transformer represents a vital part of a resistance spot welding (RSW) system. Therefore, it is essential to ensure minimum copper loss in the windings. This paper describes a single-objective optimization procedure, which includes searching for the minimum copper loss in RSW transformer windings in regard to the dimensions of the primary and secondary windings. Copper loss in windings is obtained using an improved analytical method of successive approximation, which enables the calculation of current density distribution in coils with rectangular conductors. Finally, the calculated optimum windingsÂ´ dimensions are further used in a parametric numerical model with the finite element method to confirm the reduction of copper loss.

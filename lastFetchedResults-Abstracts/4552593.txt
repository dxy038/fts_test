The objective of this paper is to show a low-cost and an easy deployable technique that allows to acquire the frequency response of a transceiver with different configurations between two receiver daughter boards: BasicRx and LFRX, and two transmitter daughter boards: BasicTx and LFTX, at a frequency range from 1 up to 30 MHz using the low-cost hardware module USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral) to implement the Software Defined Radio (SDR) concept based on license-free GNU Radio software. This system avoids the need of an expensive Frequency Response Analyzer (FRA). The transceiver amplitude frequency response gives a correction parameter using any transceiver configuration in order to acquire any external electrical circuit amplitude frequency response, acoustic signature of a room, failure detection on transformers coils, etc. The frequency range depends on the transmitter and receiver boards used. It also aims to show a good type of signal to be transmitted, one technique of measuring the received signals in a semi-automatic way and the constraints in the phase frequency response using this system.

This paper introduces a new adaptive spatiotemporal video demosaicking solution suitable for single-sensor digital video cameras. The proposed solution uses bidirectional multistage filters operating on spectrally-generated inputs to follow varying spatiotemporal characteristics of the captured video, reduce demosaicking errors, and restore the full-color information in a cost-effective way. Experimentation reported in the paper suggests that the proposed solution produces visually pleasing videos while outperforming the previously proposed computationally efficient video demosaicking methods.

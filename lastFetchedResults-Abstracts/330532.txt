Objective:  Previously, we have reported that incorporation of the antibacterial monomer 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (MDPB) was effective in immobilizing bactericide in the resin matrix, and an antibacterial composite without release of the agent could be achieved. In this study, an attempt was made to increase the density of bactericide immobilized in composite, and the inhibitory effects of this modified antibacterial composite on plaque accumulation were determined, focusing on the reliability of the effects and the mechanisms to affect the plaque formation.

Methods: An experimental composite containing immobilized bactericide at 2.83% was prepared by the incorporation of MDPB into a prepolymerized resin filler of control composite, and elution of antibacterial components and inhibition of in vitro plaque accumulation by Streptococcus mutans were determined. The inhibitory effects of the experimental composite on the attachment, glucan synthesis and growth of S. mutans on the surface were also examined in addition to the comparison of surface roughness and hydrophobicity with controls. The results were analyzed using the Student's t-test.

Results: The experimental composite had reproducible inhibitory effects against plaque accumulation compared with control (p<0.05), although it showed no elution of unpolymerized MDPB. The plaque-inhibitory effect of the experimental composite was found to depend upon the ability to inhibit the attachment, glucan synthesis, and growth of bacteria on its surface as no significant differences in the surface characteristics were obtained between control and experimental composites (p>0.05).

Significance: It was indicated that the experimental composite containing bactericide-immobilized filler has the possibility to be used clinically with an effective anti-plaque property.

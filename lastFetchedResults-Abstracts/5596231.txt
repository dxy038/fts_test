Ship motion is a complex controlled process with several hydrodynamic parameters that vary in wide ranges with respect to ship load condition, speed and surrounding conditions (such as wind, current, tide, etc.). Therefore, to effectively control ships in a designed track is always an important task for ship masters. This paper presents an effective adaptive autopilot for ships that ensure the optimal accuracy, economy and stability characteristics. The PID control methodology is modified and parameters of a PID controller is designed to satisfy conditions for an optimal objective function that comprised by heading error, resistance and drift during changing course, and loss of surge velocity or fuel consumption. Designing of the controller for course changing process is based on the Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS) control theory, while as designing of the automatic course keeping process is based on the Self Tuning Regulator (STR) control theory. Simulation (using MATLAB software) in various disturbance conditions shows that in comparison with conventional PID autopilots, the designed autopilot has several notable advantages: higher course turning speed, lower swing of ship bow even in strong waves and winds, high accuracy of course keeping, shorter time of rudder actions smaller times of changing rudder direction.

A new methodology for monitoring and establishing water quality criteria has been devised and employed. It is based on statistical relationships found in the environment and can be used to accept or reject environmental conditions created by manmade influences. This criteria and methodology has been successfully employed in Hawaii and American Samoa and is currently used in the private sector. Results indicate an objective means to accept or reject water quality conditions, account for natural variations in water quality and identify environmental stress.

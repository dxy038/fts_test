Main objective of this research proposal is to develop ruggedised strategic GPS based Vehicle Tracking System (VTS). For ruggedisation, system needs to be tested for specifications according to the different standards such as JSS-55555/MIL-STD-810E (Environmental) and MIL-STD-461E (EMI/EMC). This paper gives brief survey of strategic testing procedures, typical severities of the tests, and probable failures/damages in the electronics/communication systems/circuits. The tests include Environmental, Dynamic, Corrosion, Mould growth, Radiated/ Conducted Emission and Susceptibility, ESS and Burn-in, etc. This paper also explains the effect of all these tests on the equipment leading to probable damages/failures in the system for which cognizance must be taken in the design for improvement of reliability of the equipment to make the equipment compatible with stringent requirements. The outcome of these tests may be probable damages like failure of semiconductor devices and components, destruction of electronic circuits, breakage of PCB, damages in the enclosures, drift in the specifications / parameters, functional impairments, malfunctioning of the equipment, etc. The brief methodologies of ruggedisation such as selection of MIL grade components, use of shock mounts, specialized enclosure design, balanced mechanical layout, and use of protective coatings are recommended. These methodologies are useful to ensure the compatibility of GPS based Vehicle Tracking System with different standards like JSS-55555/MIL-810E (Environmental).

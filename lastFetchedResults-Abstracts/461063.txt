Background
The risk of occupational acquisition of bloodborne pathogens via exposure to blood and body fluids is a serious problem for health care workers in Turkey. Because there are no systematic recording programs in Turkey, national data concerning frequency of exposures are not readily available.
Objective

To determine the risk factors of exposure to blood and body fluids among health care workers (HCWs).
Methods

This study was conducted in the hospitals of Ankara University School of Medicine. A structured survey form was administered by person-to-person interview.
Results

The study included 988 HCWs: 500 nurses (51%), 212 residents (21%), 152 nurse assistants (15%), and others (13%). Six hundred thirty-four (64%) of the HCWs had been exposed to blood and body fluids at least once in their professional life (0.85 exposure per person-year). The most frequent cause of the sharps injuries was recapping the needle (45%). Of the injured HCWs, 60 (28%) were not using any personal protective equipment, and 144 (67%) did not seek any medical advice for injury.
Conclusions

Systematic control measures, including an effective and goal-oriented education program targeting HCWs, prospective record keeping, and instillation of a special unit for the health of HCWs should be implemented in the hospital setting.

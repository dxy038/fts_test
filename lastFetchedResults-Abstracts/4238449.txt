Summary form only given. The ArmyÂ´s Pulse Power for Future Combat System (FCS) Army Technology Objective (ATO) program is developing the high-voltage pulse power components required to allow for the integration of revolutionary survivability and lethality in ground combat vehicles. This paper will describe recent advances in high energy density (MED) biaxial-oriented poly-propylene (BOPP) capacitors.

The main objective of medical image segmentation is to extract and characterise anatomical structures with respect to some input features or expert knowledge. This paper describes a way of medical image segmentation using an appropriately defined fuzzy clustering method based on a fuzzy similarity relation. The considered relation is defined in terms of the Euclidean metric. A fuzzy similarity relation-based image segmentation algorithm is also introduced. To illustrate the obtained segmentation process some examples of computed tomography imaging are considered. Some results, using the classical fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm are also presented, for a comparison purpose

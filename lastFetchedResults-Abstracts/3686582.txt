Transmission of encoded video sequences over unreliable networks usually requires the adoption of protection techniques to guarantee good reconstruction quality at the receiver side. Multiple description coding (MDC) strategies add reliability to real-time video applications, where retransmission is not possible and packet losses afflict several frames degrading the overall quality. This paper presents a novel MDC scheme based on the H.264/AVC standard and a multiple description scalar quantizer which encodes the residual information into two descriptions. Finally, objective and visual performances are presented.

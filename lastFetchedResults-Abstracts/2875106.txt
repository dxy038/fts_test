In this paper a video database, ReTRiEVED, to be used in evaluating the performances of video quality metrics is presented. The database contains 184 distorted videos obtained from eight videos of different content. Packet loss rate, jitter, delay, and throughput have been considered as possible distortions resulting from video transmission. Video sequences, collected subjective scores, and results of the performed analysis are made publicly available for the research community, for designing, testing and comparing objective video quality metrics. The analysis of the results shows that packet loss rate, throughput/bandwidth, and jitter have significant effect on perceived quality, while an initial delay does not significantly affect the perceived quality.

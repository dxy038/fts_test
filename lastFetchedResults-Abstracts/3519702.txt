Rapid advances in wireless communications and networking technologies, linked with advances in computing and medical technologies, facilitate the development and offering of emerging mobile systems and services in the healthcare sector. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the current status and challenges of mobile health systems (m-health) in emergency healthcare systems and services (e-emergency). The paper covers a review of recent e-emergency systems, including the wireless technologies used, as well as the data transmitted (electronic patient record, bio-signals, medical images and video, subject video, and other). Furthermore, emerging wireless video systems for reliable communications in these applications are presented. We anticipate that m-health e-emergency systems will significantly affect the delivery of healthcare; however, their exploitation in daily practice still remains to be achieved

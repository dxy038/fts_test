The objective of the Mission/Flight System Integration Study (M/FSIS) is to identify the requirements and development objectives for electronics systems technologies and conceptual architectures in future weapon system applications (in and around the year 2005), based on analyses of future missions, threats, scenarios, aerospace system concepts, and technology trends. The products are substantiated requirements for future electronics functions, systems, and architecture; technology development objectives and roadmaps; and conceptual electronics architectures and functional definitions. The study outputs will serve to guide laboratory technology development planning and programs; guide weapon system program office long-range electronics planning; illustrate user needs in terms of electronics requirements; and guide air logistics center weapon-system master planning.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

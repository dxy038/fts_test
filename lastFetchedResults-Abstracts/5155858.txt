The main objective of this research is to present a fast and efficient method based on genetic algorithms (GAs) to measure the frequency deviation, as well as the voltage magnitude and phase angle of a noisy sinusoid wave. The frequency estimation is formulated as an optimization problem, where the aim is to minimize the estimation error. The use of GAs has an advantage of better immunity against noise disturbance present in the input data. In addition, this work investigates the implementation of a GA scheme in FPGA (field-programmable gate array) in order to obtain a device that can work properly in real time. The new approach is able to accurately estimate the frequency, voltage magnitude and phase angle, simulating an on-line frequency relay. The proposed methodology provides an efficient alternative to frequency relays having advantages compared to traditional approaches.

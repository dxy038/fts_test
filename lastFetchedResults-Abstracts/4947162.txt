Measurement of the quality of distorted image still remains an important issue. In this paper, we propose a new objective measurement, denoted as image quality score (IQS) that better matches the visual information fidelity (VIF) than using fundamental image quality measurements. IQS can be used to measure the quality of gray scale image in different distortion types such as blurring, additive Gaussian noise, impulsive salt &amp; pepper noise and JPEG2000 images. From the experiments, we found that IQS correlates well with the judgment of human observers. Moreover, it gives the result of distorted image quality from 1 to 5 (unacceptable to excellent quality).

Black zira is a perennial herb with highly valuable impact in the pharmaceutical industries. To overcome the existing limitations of the field, achieving efficient regeneration methods provides the possibility of genetic manipulation and improvement of traits in this plant. Our objective in this research work is to develop an efficient regeneration protocol of bleack zira being used in genetic improvement programs. After optimizing the conditions for sterilization and seed germination, sterile cotyledonary seedlings were obtained on MS basal medium. We investigated efficient callus induction, rooting and shoot regeneration methods on Murashige and Skoogâ€™s medium containing different concentrations of growth regulators including BAP, NAA and IAA in a factorial experiment based on completely randomized design with 3 replications. A significant increase in callus, rooting and regeneration from rootlet explants was observed. We noted that BAP and NAA were more capable for callus initiation and long-persistent development. It is shown that the most frequency and dry weight of callus was obtained on medium MS supplemented with 0.5 or 1mg/l BAP and NAA. Often frequency of rooting was influenced by NAA growth regulator. Also BAP and IAA in single stage regeneration in this study were found to be effective so that the addition of IAA to the culture medium caused reduction in callus development and showed direct shoot regeneration from cotyledon node, hypocotyl and rootlet explants.

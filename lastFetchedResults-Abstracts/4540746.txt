Design considerations are given for fault-tree analysis (FTA) using spreadsheet software. The objective is to demonstrate, by means of examples, how microcomputer spreadsheet software can be used as an alternative to the mainframe commercial FTA package for designing the fault tree and performing tedious computations. Experiences in using this approach for fault tree analysis are described, and the sensitivity analysis of fault-tree research is addressed

This work presents a Web-based visualized architecture, design, and implementation for assessing project performance by integrating earned value (EV) analysis and database management system (DBMS). Particularly, a novel probabilistic multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) process is applied to identify the optimal software for developing the Web-based DBMS based on interviews with domain experts and professional engineers. EV analysis serves as a control technique that helps project managers (PMs) monitor cost overruns and project delays. Leveraging modern technology, Web service enables PMs to access project information without constraints of time or place. The developed management information system (MIS) provides an objective measure of completed work that PMs can use to monitor project progress and assess project achievements by converting project data into manageable information clusters. Additionally, the system offers construction personnel a simple and flexible method of tracking, modifying, and updating cost and time-based project data.

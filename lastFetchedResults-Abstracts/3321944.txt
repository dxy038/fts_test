A full non-linear ship model is used to simulate the motions of a DP ship. The DP controller synthesis is based on an H<sub>2</sub> control approach. The work presents both the simulation and the control models used in the control design. To achieve satisfactory stability robustness levels, linearisations performed during control procedures are improved using information on the thruster domain of operation. The objective of the control design is to improve the system performance relative to standard Kalman filtering.

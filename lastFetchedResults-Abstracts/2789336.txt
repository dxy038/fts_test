A computer machine vision system that can be used for automatic high-speed fruit sorting and grading is proposed. The objective of the project is to develop the advanced quality control inspection system makes use of distributed network architecture to interface the camera unit to a computer system through GigE LAN environment in a flexible way. The development work activity involves in dynamic capturing of image signal from camera when the objects are moving on the conveyor in real time based on synchronized trigger events. This project planned to do in visual studio using OpenCV. The process involved for estimating the colour information and geometry parameters makes use of sequence of complex library functionality like removing the noise, detecting the edges, smoothing, dilate, erode, filling, deblurring, filtering, histogram, colour values, pixel averaging, etc.

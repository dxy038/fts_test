Objective: The purpose of the study was to evaluate our experience with ultrasound-guided bipolar diathermy forceps for cord occlusion in complicated monochorionic twin pregnancies. Study Design: Seventeen consecutive cases were included: 9 cases were twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome; 2 cases were twin reversed arterial perfusion syndrome, and 6 cases were discordant for fetal abnormality. Bipolar diathermy was performed under local anesthetic with the use of 3-mm forceps with ultrasound guidance. Results: Cord occlusion was successfully accomplished in all cases between 18 and 27 weeks’ gestation. There were 2 deaths of the co-twin within 12 hours; 1 death was due to cord hemorrhage, and 1 death was unexplained. One neonatal death occurred after delivery at 27 weeks, and 1 woman with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome elected termination of pregnancy when hydrocephaly was diagnosed 7 days after the procedure (probably related to the underlying pathologic condition). All other co-twins are alive and well, although 2 pregnancies were complicated by preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes before 30 weeks’ gestation. Conclusion: Bipolar diathermy is an effective procedure for cord occlusion, although it still has significant morbidity and mortality rates. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185:703-7.)

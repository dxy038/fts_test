The interface of mobile phone in Bangladesh is mostly in English. Few mobile operators introduced Short Messaging Services in Bangla. Text entry in Bangla in mobile phone is not simple due to the structure and large number of characters in this script. The objective of this paper is to propose an easy and faster mobile input method. We proposed frequency based two-layer multitap (FBTLM) Bangla input method for mobile phones. The evaluation was done by keystroke comparison and user experiments by text entry. According to the result, we found our proposed FBTLM takes 42% less keystrokes than existing one layer multitap (OLM) and 17% less keystrokes than two layer multitap (TLM). Moreover, our proposed FBTLM method takes 42% less tapping time than OLM and 26% less tapping time than TLM.

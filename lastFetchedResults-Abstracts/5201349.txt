This paper studies optimal input excitation design for parametric frequency response estimation. The objective is to minimize the uncertainty of functions of the frequency response estimate at a specified frequency &#969; while limiting the power of the input signal. We focus on least-squares estimation of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) models and minimum variance input design. The optimal input problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem (semi-definite program) in the second order statistics of the input signal. We analytically characterize the optimal solution for first order FIR systems with two parameters, and perform a numerical study to obtain insights in the optimal solution for higher order models. The optimal solution is compared to the case when a sinusoidal input signal, with frequency &#969; and amplitude that gives the same accuracy as the optimal input, is used as excitation signal. For first order FIR models with two parameters the input signal power can be reduced at best by a factor of two by using the optimal input signal compared with such a sinusoidal input signal. Numerical studies show that less is in general gained for higher order systems, for which a sinusoidal input signal with frequency &#969; often is optimal. We consider estimation of the &#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub>-norm of a stable linear system, that is the maximum of the absolute value of the corresponding frequency response. An asymptotic error variance expression for &#8459;<sub>&#8734;</sub>-norm estimates is derived.

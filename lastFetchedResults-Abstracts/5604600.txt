The paper put forward the idea and the theory of highway regionalization. The evaluation indexes system was es-tablished, and principal component analysis was used to lower dimensions and it can eliminate the correlation and information overlaps lying in multi-indexes. Cluster analysis was used to classify these regions into several categories according to the new indexes obtained from PCA.The results can be use to predicate the reasonable scale of highway network in the West. The results show that this method can simplify the original complicated problem and lead to an objective, reliable, convincing conclusion and make the prediction of the reasonable scale of highway network in the West is pertinence and maneuver-ability.

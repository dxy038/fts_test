The objective of the present study was to describe ultrastructural changes in the nucleus and cytoplasmic organelles during in vitro maturation (IVM) of buffalo cumulus–oocyte complexes (COCs). The structures were collected by ovum pick-up (OPU). Some COCs, removed from maturation medium at 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h, were processed for transmission electron microscopy. The average number of COCs collected by OPU/animal/session was 6.4, and 44% of them were viable. Immature oocytes had a peripherally located nucleus, Golgi complex and mitochondrial clusters, as well as a large number of coalescent lipid vacuoles. After 6 h of IVM, the oocyte nucleus morphology changed from round to a flatter shape, and the granulosa cells (GC) lost most of their contact with zona pellucida (ZP). At 12 h the first polar body was extruded and the aspect of lipid droplet changed to dark, probably denoting lipid oxidation. Cortical granules were clearly visible at 18 h of maturation, always located along the oocyte periphery. At 24 h of IVM the number of cortical granules increased. Ultrastructure studies revealed that: (1) immature oocytes have a high lipid content; (2) the perivitelline space (PS) increases during IVM; (3) Golgi complexes and mitochondrial clusters migrate to oocyte periphery during IVM; (4) 6 h of IVM are enough to lose contact between GC and ZP; (5) the oocyte lipid droplets’ appearance changes between 6 and 12 h of IVM

This article presents integration of a wireless power transmission and bidirectional data communication system for implantable neural recording applications. Wireless power transfer is realized by means of magnetic coupling at 10 MHz achieving 36% efficiency. Downlink communication at 1 Mbps is realized on the same frequency as the wireless power transmission by changing the amplitude of the source signal. Uplink communication at 1.8 Mbps is performed at MICS band by means of an integrated transmitter and a discrete receiver. Design and implementation of the entire system has been explained and practical integration issues have been discussed.

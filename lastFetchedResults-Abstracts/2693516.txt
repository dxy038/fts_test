The generalized formulation of weighted optimal guidance laws with impact angle constraint is investigated here. From the generalized formulation, we explicitly find the feasible set of weighting functions that lead to analytical forms of weighted optimal guidance laws. This result has potential significance because it can provide additional degrees of freedom in designing a guidance law that accomplishes the specified guidance objective.

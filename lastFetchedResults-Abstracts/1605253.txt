Supply chain management (SCM) issues have been popularly discussed in recent years. However, few papers in past literature have been dedicated to the use of fuzzy multi-objective-game framework for analyzing how the strategic partnership influences individual and global performance in a supply chain. This study formulates a game framework for the investigation of strategic behavior of supply chain partners based on fuzzy multi-objective programming, the alliance matrix and achievement level/aspiration degree. This work assumes the partners as having multiple objectives and the supply chain is multi-product and multi-material. To validate our model we simulate the micro- and macro-performance of a supply chain by the achievement level under various partner alliances. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is conducted. Finally, some useful lessons are summarized.

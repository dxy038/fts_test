An adaptive control scheme for manipulators with redundant degrees of freedom is presented. The control objective is to achieve a desired interaction force between the end-effector and the environment as well as to regulate the robot tip position in Cartesian space. This control approach does not require measurement of the joint acceleration or the force derivative. Global convergence results are obtained in the sense that all signals remain bounded and the force and position tracing errors converge to zero

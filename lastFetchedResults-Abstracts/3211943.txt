Image/video interpolations and super-resolution are topics of great interest. Their applications include HDTV, image coding, image resizing, image manipulation, face recognition and surveillance. The objective is to increase the resolution of an image/video through upsampling, deblurring, denoising, etc. This paper reviews the development of various approaches on image interpolation and super-resolution theory for image/video enlargement in multimedia applications. Some basic formulations will be derived such that readers can make use of them to design their own, practical and efficient interpolation algorithms. New results, such as hole filling using nonlocal means for 3D video synthesis and fast interpolation using a simplified image model will be introduced. New directions and trends will also be discussed at the end of the paper.

Introduction: Presence of keratinized tissue around implants for maintaining periimplant health and their long term stability has been a controversial issue. The aim of this study is to assess the correlation between the width of keratinized tissue and periodontal indices around implantsupporting fixed partial dentures. Materials  Methods: In this crosssectional study, 90 pateints who had implantsupported fixed partial dentures were divided into three groups with 30 patients in each one. Based on type of their prostheses it would be single crown, bridge or splinted. Periimplant examinations were accomplished by means of measuring the width of keratinized mucosa (KM), the width of attached mucosa (AM), probing depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival recession (GR), gingival index (GI), and plaque index (PI) and collar metal show. The data was analyzed by Pearson  Spearman correlation test by SPSS20 software. Result: There was significant relationship between KM and AM in all groups (P<0.001). Also there was significant relationship between KM and PD in bridge group (P<0.04, r=0.32), and between KM and single crown group [BOP (P<0.014, r=0.4)  GI (P<0.02, r=0.38)] respectively, but this trend for AM and PD in splint group has proved to be inverse (P<0.035, r= 0.33). There was no significant relationship in other data. Conclusion: With limitations of this study, it can be concluded that increasing the width of keratinized and attached mucosa is not necessarily associated with objective periimplant health.

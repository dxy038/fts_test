When submarine docks at military harbor or other calm area, the requirement of maneuver control is strict. Although there is any disturbance of ocean wave in calm area, it is difficult to ensure the accurate maneuver control since the submarineÂ´s large inertia and imprecise model. In order to obtain excellent surface maneuver control performance, this paper applies fuzzy controller to steering yaw actuator to track the course of submarine. Because of large inertia, the fuzzy controller used in this paper takes three state variables such as heading angle, yaw rate and yaw acceleration as inputs. Comparing with single and two inputs fuzzy controller, the three-input fuzzy controller is difficult to design fuzzy rules and adjust membership functions. For the optimization of three-input fuzzy controller, this paper uses a multi-objective optimization method to design an optimal track for a certain steering angle under the actual constraint of yaw rate and yaw acceleration. With the optimal path which possesses the best synthetical performance of response rate and stability, this paper uses online experiments to track it and records the data of the three state variables and the rudder actions. At last, with the data of inputs and output, it is easy to use GA to optimize rules of fuzzy controller. Without imprecise model of submarine, this paper designs an excellent fuzzy controller for the submarine maneuver control successfully.

This paper presents Improved Mountain Clustering (IMC) based medical image segmentation. Proposed technique is a more powerful approach for X-Ray image based diagnosing diseases like lung cancer and tuberculosis. The IMC based segmentation approach was applied on lung X-Ray images and compared with some existing techniques such as K-Means and FCM based segmentation approaches. The performance of all these segmentation approaches is compared in terms of cluster entropy as a measure of information. The segments obtained from the methods have been verified visually.

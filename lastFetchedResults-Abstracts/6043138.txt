Summary form only given. This paper proposes a new partition method for reliable H.264 video transmission over wireless channels wherein the impact of each inter MB to error propagation is analyzed. A relationship between image quality and the correctly received MB is established and this helps the encoder find the truncation point to satisfy the quality requirement. The inter partition (or C type) data are further divided into several partitions, then unequal error protection (UEP) can be applied to them with the use of the priority encoding transmission (PET) method. The use of a new fast iteratively improved bidirectional local search algorithm is suggested. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can achieve better results than conventional H.264 coding method when transmitting over wireless channel and can obtain more graceful degradation with the increasing of packet loss rate

This paper presents a procedure for designing fault-tolerant systolic array with orthogonal interconnects and bidirectional data flow (2DBOSA) for matrix multiplication. The method employs space-time redundancy to achieve fault-tolerance. The obtained array has &#937; = n(n+2) processing elements, and total execution time of T<sub>tot</sub> = 6n -5. The array can tolerate single transient errors and the majority of multiple error patterns with high probability. Compared to hexagonal array of same dimensions, the number of I/O pins is reduced for approximately 30%.

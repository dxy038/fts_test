In this paper, we put forward a relatively robust optimization algorithm for emergency facility location with uncertain demands (weights of nodes). We assume that for each node, only an interval estimate of the corresponding weight is known. The objective function is to minimum the total weighted distance between emergency facility and all emergency nodes. We compare the robust optimization result and the optimization result. Comparison result shows that the deviation of the robust optimization solution is the minimum in uncertain case compared with the value of optimization function. So this algorithm can avoid risk to a great extent.

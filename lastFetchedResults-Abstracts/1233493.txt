In this work, non-associative finite strain anisotropic elastoplasticity fully coupled with ductile damage is considered using a thermodynamically consistent framework. First, the kinematics of large strain based on multiplicative decomposition of the total transformation gradient using the rotating frame formulation, is recalled and different objective derivatives defined. By using different anisotropic equivalent stresses (quadratic and non-quadratic) in yield function and in plastic potential, the evolution equations for all the dissipative phenomena are deduced from the generalized normality rule applied to the plastic potential while the consistency condition is still applied to the yield function. The effect of the objective derivatives and the equivalent stresses (quadratic or non-quadratic) on the plastic flow anisotropy and the hardening evolution with damage is considered. Numerical aspects mainly related to the time integration of the fully coupled constitutive equations are discussed. Applications are made to the AISI 304 sheet metal by considering different loading paths as tensile, shear, plane tensile and bulge tests. For each loading path the effect of the rotating frame, the equivalent stress (quadratic or non-quadratic) and the normality rule (with respect to yield function or to the plastic potential) are discussed on the light of some available experimental results.

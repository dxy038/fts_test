Background and Objective: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal trait, which is
caused by mutations in Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR) gene. FH penetrance is about
100% and worldwide prevalence for heterozygous subjects is almost 1 in 500 and for homozygous
1 in 1,000,000. The patients are at risk of premature coronary heart disease (CHD) due to defective
LDLR and hence cholesterol metabolism disorder. The aim of this study was identifying genotype
of possible mutation in an Iranian FH patient.
Materials and Methods: Promoter and all 18 exons including exon-intron boundaries of LDLR
gene were scanned. Polymerase chain reaction - single strand conformation polymorphism (PCRSSCP)
was used as mutation scanning method. DNA sequencing was used to identify any nucleotide
change(s).
Results: A new frameshift mutation (660-661InsCC) was found in proband.
Conclusion: This mutation causes a truncated, non-functional protein, which results in
hypercholesterolemia. The mutation can be screened in proband's relatives to find other FH
patients.

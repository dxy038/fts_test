The fungus Hirsutella rhossiliensis is an obligate pathogen with a broad host range among nematodes. Microbivorous nematodes are abundant around plant roots and may serve as hosts for the fungus. Our objective was to determine the influence of the bacterial-feeding nematode Teratorhabditis dentifera on the abundance of H. rhossiliensis. Experiments were conducted in a growth chamber with pots containing pasteurized soil, the fungus, and potato plants. The abundance of infectious conidia was compared in pots with and without T. dentifera after 50 or 70 days. The nematode reached high densities (10-40/cm3 soil) but had no effect on the abundance of conidia. Many individuals were dauer juveniles, a stage that acquired conidia but did not become infected. To test whether this life stage could deplete the pool of conidia in soil, different proportions of dauer juveniles with (resistant) and without (susceptible) a sheath were added to H. rhossiliensis-infested soil. The number of conidia in the soil decreased with an increasing proportion of resistant nematodes. Different stages of T. dentifera appear to have opposing effects on H. rhossiliensis; while adults and regular juveniles acquire conidia, become infected, and produce new infectious conidia, dauer juveniles can deplete the supply of conidia.

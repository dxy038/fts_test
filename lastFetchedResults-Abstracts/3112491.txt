This paper describes a laboratory project for teaching the fundamental concepts of electrohydraulic servomechanism to undergraduate/graduate control engineering students. Although electrohydraulic servomechanisms have dominated the industrial control scene for quite some time, typical control courses do not have these as an integral part of the overall laboratory experience. Thus, the main objective of the proposed experiments is to alleviate this deficiency to a certain extent. The paper includes detailed descriptions of the experimental setup and the laboratory projects.

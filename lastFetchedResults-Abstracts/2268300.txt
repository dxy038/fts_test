Methodology: With understanding the standing out of scientific activities in the field of social psychology, we can set up a comprehensive representation of scientists and researchers in the field and to identify the strengths and weaknesses of previous investigations. 
A descriptive-analytical method by using scientometrics indicators was recruited to analyze the productive activity of countries in the field of social psychology during a period of 20 years (1990-2009). We used the trial version of Hist-Cite software to map the historical Structure of Scientific Output in the field of social psychology through the period of study.

USA, England and Canada were the most prolific countries in the subject area. The University of Michigan، Texas و Calif. Los Angeles were the most productive universities.
Conclusion: Mapping the historical Structure of scientific publications in the subject area indicated that there have been formed 3 major clusters in Local Citation Scale (LCS) and 4 major clusters in Global Citation Scale (LCS).

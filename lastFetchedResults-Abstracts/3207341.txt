Compensating temporary overload or site outage in cellular mobile networks is still an unsolved problem in order to avoid situations where services are unavailable. For this objective, we propose to use a swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with cellular technology to temporarily offload traffic into neighbouring cells in LTE/4G networks. We discuss relay placement, amount of relays and relay transmit power for overload and outage compensation and provide an analytical model for evaluating system performance in the downlink. We assume that the spatial separation between the aerial service provider, users, and offload eNodeB is beneficial for temporarily increasing spectral efficiency. Our results give evidence, that aerial network provisioning can be used for optimizing mobile networks in overload and outage scenarios.

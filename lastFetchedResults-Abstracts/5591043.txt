In this paper, we present an algorithm for cluster analysis that provides a robust way to deal with datasets presenting different types of clusters and allows finding more than one structure in a dataset. Our approach is based on ideas from cluster ensembles and multi-objective clustering. We apply a Pareto-based multi-objective genetic algorithm with a special crossover operator. Such an operator combines a number of partitions obtained according to different clustering criteria. As a result, our approach generates a concise and stable set of partitions representing different trade-offs between two validation measures related to different clustering criteria.

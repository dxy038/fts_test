This paper investigates robust L<sub>2</sub> - L<sub>infin</sub> filtering problem for a class of linear uncertain time-delay systems. The uncertainties in the system are time-varying and bounded, and time delays are time-varying. The objective is to design linear memoryless filters such that for all uncertainties, the resulting augmented system is robust stable independent of delays and satisfies the proposed L<sub>2</sub> - L<sub>infin</sub> performance. Based on Lyapunov stability theory in time-delay systems, a sufficient condition on the existence of robust L<sub>2</sub> - L<sub>infin</sub> filters is derived. The problem of robust L<sub>2</sub> - L<sub>infin</sub> filters is turned into the solution problem of linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the effect of the proposed approach

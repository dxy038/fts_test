A three-dimensional, volumetric, data acquisition and reconstruction system for ultrasonic imaging is described. The method entails storing the digitized waveforms from each element of a multielement annular array, with bidirectional mechanical scanning. The system was implemented through digitization of the RF signals from each of the rings of an annular-array transducer, storage of the signals in computer memory, and offline image reconstruction. Initial reflection and reflex transmission images acquired with this system are presented. The results of different image reconstruction algorithms are demonstrated.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

A study was conducted with the objective to evaluate the effect of physical activity, breed, age, sex and body condition on serum levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides of horses in Colima, Mexico. Blood samples were collected from 40 clinically healthy stallions and geldings, a half of them physically active and the rest sedentary. Additional information on frequency and intensity of physical activity was recorded and total cholesterol and triglycerides serum levels were determined. Average total cholesterol and triglycerides serum level were 2.37±0.65 and 0.30±0.11mmol/L respectively. Total cholesterol serum level was not significantly affected (P < 0.05) by any factor under study, whereas body condition had a significantly effect (P < 0.05) on triglycerides serum level. In active horses, no effect (P > 0.05) of frequency and intensity of physical activity on the study variables were observed.

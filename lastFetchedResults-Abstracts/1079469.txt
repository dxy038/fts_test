The objective of this work is to analyse the drying of the Sultanine grape variety by three different solar processes. Three drying kinetics have been established respectively in a natural convection solar drier, under a tunnel greenhouse and in open sun. These tests show that the solar tunnel greenhouse drying is satisfactory and competitive to a natural convection solar drying process.

The objective of this paper is to perform dynamic nonlinear analysis of shell structures using a vector intrinsic finite element (VFIFE). The procedures of VFIFE are designed to carry out a vector-mechanics-based theory, vector form analysis in which a fundamental concept called point value description is proposed. It enables VFIFE to deliberately treat the shell problems with large deflections, large overall motions and even fragmentations. The interaction forces amid particles are complemented by the generalized forces evaluated by a triangular element of VFIFE family recently developed using physical modeling procedures. In this paper, the problems with large overall motion, large deflection, nonlinear material property and contact/impact are further tested to justify the performance of the element on highly nonlinear analysis. It is reveals that the VFIFE element has good reliability and accuracy on solving shell problems with multiple nonlinearities.

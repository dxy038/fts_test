The paper deals with the problems of building CAD systems using the methodology of problem adaptation. It is shown the method of creation of adaptors - artificial intelligent program components - using the paradigm of objective-oriented programming. Also it is discussed some common scientific aspects of building intelligent objects and the development of intelligent information environments on the platform of agent technologies

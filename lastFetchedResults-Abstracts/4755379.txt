End-to-end (E2E) reliable communication in Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) is a challenging task due to long delay and frequent link disruptions. To enable reliability, the IETF is currently looking at strategies to integrate erasure coding mechanisms inside DTN architecture. The objective is to extend the ability of the existing DTN bundle fragmentation mechanism to support cases where bundles have a high probability of being lost. To date, discussions agree that an intermediate node can re-encode bundles, leaving all decoding process at the destination node in order to let intermediate node operations be as simple as possible. We propose to study and analyze possible re-encoding strategies at intermediate nodes using an on-the-fly coding paradigm. We also investigate how re-encoding and acknowledgment strategies based on this coding scheme would enable E2E reliable communication. Finally, we propose an adaptive mechanism with low complexity that deals with both re-routing events and network dynamics which are common in the context of DTN. Simulation results show that re-encoding at the relay and the adaptive mechanism allows a significant reduction in terms of network overhead injected by erasure codes while ensuring the E2E reliability.

This paper addresses a new decentralized robust LFC design in a deregulated power system under bilateral-based policy scheme. The LFC problem is formulated to a PI based multi-objective control problem via a mixed H/sub 2//H/sub /spl infin// control technique. The robust PI control problem is reduced to a static output feedback control synthesis, and it is solved using a developed iterative linear matrix inequalities algorithm to get a robust performance index close to specified optimal one. The proposed method is applied to a 3-control area power system with possible contract scenarios and a wide range of load changes. The results are compared with H/sub 2//H/sub /spl infin// dynamic control design.

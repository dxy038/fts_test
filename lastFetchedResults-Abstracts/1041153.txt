This study focuses on the measurement of the ultimate flexural and tensile strength of GUSMRC, a new class of green ultra-high performance fiber reinforced cementitious composites (GUHPFRCCs) in which 75% of the volume contains ultrafine palm oil fuel ash (UPOFA). This green concrete is currently under development at the Universiti Sains Malaysia (GUSMRC). The main objective of this study is to investigate the potential of UPOFA as a partial binder replacement for the ultimate flexural and uniaxial tensile strength of GUSMRC mixtures. Results showed that UPOFA enhances the flexural and uniaxial tensile responses of fresh UHPFRCCs. The highest flexural and uniaxial tensile strength values at the 50% replacement level after 28 days were at 42.38 MPa and 13.35 MPa, respectively, indicating the potential of utilizing UPOFA as an efficient pozzolanic mineral admixture for the production of GUSMRC with superior engineering properties.

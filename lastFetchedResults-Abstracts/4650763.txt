The paper presents a conceptual framework that extends the use of multiple objective decision making (MODM) technique within the knowledge based decision support system architecture. The system can guide users systematically towards the selection and application of the most appropriate method for their decision making. The conceptual framework has been implemented as an intelligent and graphical user interface (GUI) based multiple objective decision support systems prototype, called intelligent multiple objective decision support system (IMODSS)

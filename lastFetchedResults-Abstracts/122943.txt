Introduction and Objective: Nowadays because of profound of electrical in strumpets, the human bodies exposure to electromagnetic a fields are increased. Staff and workers who are working in power stations are exposed to electromagnetic fields. Moreover people living in areas close to high voltage power lines are exposed to relatively high electromagnetic fields. Present study was done test to the hypothesis that exposure to electromagnetic fields from high voltage power lines alters the liver function indices. Materials and Methods: The study population comprised 33 male subjects who worked in high electrical power stations in Shiraz, as exposed group and 50 unexposed sex and age matched subjects as control group. The mean of magnetic field was estimated 0.094 mT. Liver function indices includes total bilirubine, direct bilirubine, SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, serum albumin, and total serum protein. Results: Although the studied indices were in normal range, there were several statistically significant differences between the two study groups. Statistical analysis of data using stepwise multiple regression method showed that serum albumin and total bilirubine decreased (t=-2.86, P< 0.05) and increased (t=2.69, P<0.05), respectively, as a result of occupational exposure to electromagnetic field.
Conclusion: The present study shows that exposure to electromagnetic fields has some effect on function of liver.

Electromagnetic coupling through a narrow-slot aperture to a region containing a thin-wire structure is computed as a characterization of electromagnetic compatibility and interference (EMC/EMI) issues. Results are presented for coupling through a narrow slot to multiple, thin, straight segments of wire in a cavity. The slot has width and depth and the wires have arbitrary position and orientation within the coupled region. By varying the wires/slot geometries the interaction of the respective resonance structures is examined. Results for a coupled half-space as well as results for a complex cavity enclosure containing multiple thin-wire scatterers are presented. The objective of this work is to compute coupling through a narrow slot to a complex cavity containing thin-wire scatterers with arbitrary position and orientation within the cavity, accounting for slot depth, wall losses, and dielectrics in the slot region. Previously, results have been presented that were limited to half-space coupling. The full wires/slot/cavity coupling is now incorporated into the model.

One of the most important issues in industry, particular casting industry is to determine the internal structure of objects such as identifying the interfacial boundary configurations between material, identification of impurities or mechanical properties of the material. The objective of the present inverse problem is to identifiedsimultaneously two regular interfacial boundary configurations and  mechanical properties of the components of a multiple (three) connected domains using a discrete number of displacement measurements obtained from an uniaxial tension test. A unique combination of a global optimization method i.e. the ImperialistCompetitiveAlgorithm (ICA) and local optimization methods i.e. Simplex Method (SM) along with the inverse application of the Boundary Elements Method (BEM) areemployed in an inverse software package. A fitness function, which is the summation of squared differences between the measured displacements and computed at identical locations on the exterior boundary, is minimized. The obtained results (run-time and error-rate),clearly demonstrate the efficiency of this present algorithm (the ImperialistCompetitiveAlgorithm and Simplex Method)to optimize the objective function and the estimation simultaneously two regular interfacial boundary configurations and mechanical properties.

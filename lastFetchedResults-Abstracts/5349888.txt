A novel wavelet domain approach based on nonlocal means filtering is presented to eliminate artifacts generated in discrete wavelet domain based super resolution techniques. These artifacts are generated due to shift variance of discrete wavelet transform. Objective analysis reveal superiority of the proposed technique over the conventional and state of art super resolution techniques.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The role of CRP as a predictor of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and its complication is controversy. This study was performed to evaluate the relationship between serum c- reactive protein (CRP) levels with complication of Acute MI.
METHODS: This study was performed on 100 patients with Acute Ml who were admitted in heart department of Babol Shahid Beheshti hospital. The level of CRP measured on third day of admission. Prevalence of CRP level in patients group with complication included electrical, mechanical and hemodynamical compared with uncomplicated group. FINDINGS: CRP was increased in 85% of patients. Complications of AMI were observed in 64% of patients. The mean level of CRP in complicated group was significantly higher than uncomplicated group (110.8Â±61.2 and 32.2$38.3 respectively, p<0.041). The mean CRP levels in patients with electrical, mechanical and hemodynamical complications were 80, 139.6 and 137.4 micg/ml respectively, which was significantly higher than uncomplicated group (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that there was an association between serum CRP levels and cardiac complication in early phase of AMI. CRP can predict the complication of AMI at early phase.

Recent research has begun to place greater emphasis on the strategic use of IT in seeking to build firm´s capability, thus innovating firm´s business value. In this context, many leading firms have been put efforts to formulate agile structures, processes, and governance mechanisms for firm´s IT activities but there is lack of conceptual framework to understand how well ITG is formed within the organization. Recent literature reviews found that ITG framework have been discussed independently rather than in an integrated and convergent manner failing to provide a comprehensive conceptual framework. The objective of this paper is, therefore, to develop a conceptual ITG framework that reflects current research gap and useful for further research and development of IT research fields.

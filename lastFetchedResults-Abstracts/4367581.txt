A fully operational bidirectional optical code division multiplexed system has been successfully implemented within the KomNet field trial. 4/spl times/155.52 Mbit/s signals each in up- and downlink are transmitted over a 20 km two fibre feeder. Transmission of the signals over DWDM metro rings is discussed.

Summary form only given. Improvements in plant quality, root strength and seed germination through different means has been the subject of research for many. For example, low intensity and extreme low frequency magnetic field on sunflower and wheat seeds germination have produced positive effect. In this study different variety of soybean seeds have been exposed to electromagnetic and magnetic fields using an anechoic chamber and HelmholtzÂ´s Coil. The objective was to determine changes in the germination rate, if any, as a function of frequency, field intensity and duration of exposure. Soybean was chosen because, compared to other bio-fuel resources, it produces the maximum energy per gram and any increase in germination due to EM or magnetic field exposure would result in a greater production of this important asset. Experiments were conducted with four different varieties of soybean seeds namely Magellan, Maverick, SS97-6946 and Williams82. Results show that at 128 Watts, 100 MHz frequency and with exposure time of 10 minutes, only one variety of soybeans (Magellan) had a seven percent increase in the germination rate and was statistically significant. With an increase in the number of seeds per batch, the percent increase of germination for Magellan got down to five while for the other three types there was no change. There was statistical significance for germination of Magellan even for this experiment. Experiments were also conducted with the seeds in magnetic field of strengths 1G 5G and 10 G and exposure durations of 1 min, 5 min, 10 min and 20 min. Positive effect with 5 and 10 G field strength is reported. The number of seeds used in the magnetic field experiments was 25 and germination rate increase was again seen in the Magellan variety. This was further analyzed through statistical analysis which showed that for 5 G and 10 G field strengths the germination rate was significant.

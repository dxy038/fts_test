Plant development is orchestrated by transcription factors whose expression has become observable in living plants through the use of fluorescence microscopy. However, the exact quantification of expression levels is still not solved and most analysis is only performed through visual inspection. With the objective of automating the quantification of cell nuclei fluorescence we present a new approach to detect cell nuclei in 3D fluorescence confocal microscopy, based on the use of the sliding band convergence filter (SBF). The SBF filter detects cell nuclei and estimate their shape with high accuracy in each 2D image plane. For 3D detection, individual 2D shapes are joined into 3D estimates and then corrected based on the analysis of the fluorescence profile. The final nuclei detection´s precision/recall are of 0.779/0.803 respectively, and the average Dice´s coefficient of 0.773.

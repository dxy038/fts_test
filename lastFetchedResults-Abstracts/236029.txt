Tropical rain forests are characterized by large numbers of the species with diverse growth habits. The objective of the present study was to determine the distribution of nutrient content in the major trees of the tropical rain forests in Xishuangbanna. This will improve the understanding of the nutrient losses from such sites that result from harvesting and flow of nutrients within the ecosystem and lead to the development of effective and rational forest management strategies. Based on the results in this study, the distribution of nutrients among biomass components of trees varied: The ordering of major elements concentrations was K>N>Mg>Ca>P in branch, stem and root tissues but was N>K>Mg>Ca>P in leaves. The maximum amount of all nutrients per ha occurred in the stems followed by branches, roots and leaves. Of the total uptake of 6167.7 kg ha−1 of all nutrients, the contribution of various nutrients was found to be N (2010.6 t ha−1), P (196.3 t ha−1), K (2123.8 kg ha−1), Ca (832 kg ha−1) and Mg (1005 kg ha−1). However, comparing the nutrient uptake of other tropical and sub tropical forests, the results indicated that rates for the Xishuangbanna forests were 20–35% lower than previously reported values.

Emerging multi/many-core architectures, targeting both High Performance Computing (HPC) and mobile devices, increase the interest for self-adaptive systems, where both applications and computational resources could smoothly adapt to the changing of the working conditions. In these scenarios, an efficient Run-Time Resource Manager (RTRM) framework can provide a valuable support to identify the optimal tradeoff between the Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of the applications and the time varying resources availability. This paper introduces a new approach to the development of a system-wide RTRM featuring: a) a hierarchical and distributed control, b) the exploitation of design-time information, c) a rich multi-objective optimization strategy and d) a portable and modular design based on a set of tunable policies. The framework is already available as an Open Source project, targeting a NUMA architecture and a new generation multi/many-core research platform. First tests show benefits for the execution of parallel applications, the scalability of the proposed multi-objective resources partitioning strategy, and the sustainability of the overheads introduced by the framework.

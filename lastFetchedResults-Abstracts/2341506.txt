Objective
Some studies suggest that detection of epileptic discharge is unusual during the
first postictal week of febrile seizure and others believe that EEGs carried out
on the day of the seizure are abnormal in as many as 88% of the patients. In this
study, we intend to compare early and late EEG abnormalities in febrile seizure.
Materials & Methods
EEG was recorded during daytime sleep, 24-48 hours (early EEG) and 2 weeks
(late EEG) after the seizure in 36 children with febrile seizure (FS), aged
between 3 months and 6 years. EEGs that showed generalized or focal spikes,
sharp, spike wave complex, and slowing were considered as abnormal EEG.
Abnormalities of the first EEG were compared with those of second EEG.
Results
The most common abnormal epileptiform discharges recorded in the early EEG
were slow waves (27.6%) and sharp waves in late EEG (36%). Distribution of
abnormalities in early and late EEG showed no significant statistical difference.
Conclusion
The early and late EEG recording had the same results in patient with febrile
seizure.

Land surface temperature (LST) have been widely used for environmental studies and urban heat island (UHI), using satellite derived images. LST retrieval from satellite images has many advantages for research as compared with in-situ measurement of air temperatures. For example, it will help to reduce the time consuming, more coverage of the study area with the high spatial resolution, etc. The objective of our study is to retrieve the LST over Penang Island and compare the trend and average value of LST within different types of (land useor land cover) LULC changes in single satellite image. LST was retrieved by ATCOR3_T using PCI Geomatica 10.1 image processing software. The supervised classification was chosen to classified LULC changes over Penang Island. From the result obtained from different classification method, maximum likelihood classification showed the most accurate result compared with minimum distance-to-mean and parallelepiped methods. The urban areas with high density resulted shown the highest LST between different LULC changes.These changes in LULC yield the significant difference in LST between urban and rural area. Therefore, LST proved to be a good and effective tool to predict the impact of LST to different LULC. Besides, the relationship between LST and NDVI also been investigated for different LULC changes in this study. The strong negative and positive correlation was observed between LST and NDVI for different LULC changes.

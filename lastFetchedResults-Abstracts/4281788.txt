A broad overview is given of various factors affecting the frequency stability of surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) resonators. The objective has been to unravel the causes of large frequency drifts observed in SAW resonators operating at temperatures of 135&#176;C and beyond. Experimental data are presented on both the long-term and short-term frequency stabilities of SAW devices at 25&#176;C and 175&#176;C for moderate to high drive levels. The behavior of SAW devices with pure aluminum and copper-doped aluminum electrodes are compared. It is shown that the short-term frequency stability of SAW devices with copper-doped aluminum electrodes is a few parts in 10<sup>10</sup> even at 175&#176;C and for moderately large drive levels. Overall, the best short-term frequency stability is found to be for a gate time of 0.1 s

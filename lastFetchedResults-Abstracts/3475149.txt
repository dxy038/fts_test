The selection of the optimal capacitor is a multiobjective optimization problem. An approach to solving a multiobjective optimization problem is to transform it into a single objective problem. In this letter the use of the power factor and the efficiency as constraints is proposed because power factor in distributions systems may be allowed within certain limits such as 0.85 and 1.0 and similarly for the efficiency.

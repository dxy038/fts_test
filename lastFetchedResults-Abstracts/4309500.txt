The quality analyst software is a tailor made software with the objective to considerably support quality analyst (QA) and the related users to conduct process and products verifications in an efficient way. It will eventually contribute in the continuous improvement of the processes in the quality management system (QMS). On average, a QA is assigned 35 projects and has to conduct 3 process verifications, 3 product verifications and other quality activities for each different project. In all, the QA has to manage around 210 verifications. Due to the loads of activities, QAs cannot perform properly and manage well their tasks. Thus, the QMS lifecycle for continuous improvement of the processes is incomplete and hence it does not serve its purpose. The quality analyst software assist the QA in effective planning and automatically record scheduled meeting in MS Outlook calendar, successful execution of the plan through automatic reminders, ease in collecting data, no tasks/ input doubling-up, provide traceability through e-mails, quick availability of significant reports at the right time, in the right format and to the right person. Up to 1.3 hours is saved per process verification. Days lost in making follow-up to closure are rationalized. The quality analyst software can greatly streamline processes, reduce cycle times, increase efficiency, minimize errors, and generally, improve the overall service levels. Based on data recorded and defined critical factors, the system will keep on adjusting and increasing the accuracy of its estimated values and thus be able to propose to the domain user reliable and realistic values.

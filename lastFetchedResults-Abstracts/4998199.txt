Optimization is a usual step of control design. To do so, clear design goals have to be defined and sufficient system information must be given as prerequisites. However, data are often inaccurate or missing and design goals may change during operation. That is why a concept of self-optimizing systems is proposed, which is able to optimize the system even during operation. The proposed concept should be understood as a framework to incorporate various control and optimization methods. A key element of the proposal is the operator controller module, which consists of a cognitive part for planning tasks with lower real-time requirements and a reflective part for the execution level. A particular focus is given to how to handle multi-objective optimization with on-line adaptation of the objectives depending on internal and external design goals. Examples how to employ the concept in practice are given

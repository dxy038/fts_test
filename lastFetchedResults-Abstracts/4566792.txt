This paper proposes a Web Based Online Real-time Outage Cost Assessment and Information System(WOROCAIS) for power system outage cost assessment. The proposed WOROCAIS is a kind of web based survey method for outage cost assessment. While conventional survey methods have done outage cost assessment based on survey paper lists collected by post mail or visiting customers, the proposed WOROCAIS is a web based online survey operation and assessment system. Therefore, it can curtail expenditure for survey and also is more convenient than conventional method. It will be set up for actual outage cost assessment system of KEPCO in South Korea in near future. The WOROCAIS will be applied in various research and actual planning and operation areas. First of all, the assessed results may be not only applied as one of objective function for generation system and grid expansion but also operational planning problems in power system.

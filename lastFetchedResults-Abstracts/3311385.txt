In this paper, Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is introduced to be used as OAM mechanisms for IP radio access network (RAN) to improve the networksÂ´ performance. Besides a BFD-triggered node failure or link failure detection mechanism is proposed and tested. Testing results show that the proposed mechanism can effectively avoid or reduce burst loss and the protection switching time decreased from second -level to millisecond-level which satisfied the carrier-class networks demands. The results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.

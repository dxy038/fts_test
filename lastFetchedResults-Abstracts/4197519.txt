The main objective of this system is to develop a secure ATM in future. In general, all the keypad based authentication system having several possibilities of password guessing by means of shoulder movements. Shoulder-surfing is an attack on password authentication that has traditionally been hard to defeat. This problem has come up with a new solution by following two methods of proposal idea one is designing shuffled Automated Teller Machine keypad which displays the shuffled numbers in the Liquid Crystal Display keypad which confuses person who standing near you to guess the password. Another one is to develop the Bluetooth application between the user and Automated Teller Machine counter for communicating a password via the wireless medium. This type of awareness preventing PIN theft in future and the proposed idea is implemented using the UTLP kit.

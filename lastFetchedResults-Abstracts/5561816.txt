Pneumatic artificial rubber muscles (Parms) show similarity to biological muscles. A 2-sliding control technique is applied to the first two degrees of freedom of a robot actuated by such muscles. The Parms are arranged in opposite pair or antagonistic configuration. The objective is to show that without the use of the equivalent control, it is still possible to control the robot and at the same time reduce the chatter. Experimental results are presented.

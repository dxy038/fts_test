This paper presents a method for solving the convergence demand responsive transport problem, by using a stochastic approach based on a steady state genetic algorithm for enumerating a set of optimizing sprawling spanning trees, which constitute the best solutions to this problem. Specifically designed to speed up the convergence to optimal solutions, we introduce an oriented convergent mutation operator, allowing multi-objective considerations. So this solution lays the first stakes for considering real-time solving of such a problem. Led by computer science and geography laboratories, this study is provided with a set of experimental results evaluating the approach

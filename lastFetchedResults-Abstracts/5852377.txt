The water supply system has a high operational cost associated with its operations. This is characteristically due to the operations of the pumps that consume significantly high amount of electric energy. In order to minimize the electric energy consumption and reduce the maintenance cost of the system, this paper proposes the use of an Adaptive Weighted sum Genetic Algorithm (AWGA) in creating an optimal pump schedule, which can minimize the cost of electricity and satisfy the constraint of the maximum and minimum levels of water in the reservoir as well. The Adaptive weighted sum GA is based on popular weighted sum approach GA for multi-objective optimization problem wherein the weights multipliers of the individual fitness functions are adaptively selected. The algorithm has been tested using a hypothetical case study and promising results have been obtained and presented.

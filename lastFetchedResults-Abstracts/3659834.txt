The determination of the least costly long-term expansion of a power system in the presence of uncertainty about future loads is formulated as a mathematical optimization problem. It is recognized that more information about these future loads will be acquired with time. The objective is to find an expansion policy such that the investment decision is based on an up-to-date estimate of the system requirements.

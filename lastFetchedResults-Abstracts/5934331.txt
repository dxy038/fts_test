We consider forward-link power allocation in a wireless network with stochastically varying data requests. We assume a user´s service preferences are specified via a utility function that depends on the received data rate. The allocation of power across users is studied, where this allocation may depend on both a user´s channel and utility. The objective is to maximize the time-averaged utility rate subject to a stochastic total power constraint at the transmitter. For a large, heavily loaded network, we introduce a Gaussian approximation for the total transmitted power, which is used to decompose the power constraint into three more tractable constraints. We present a solution to this problem that is a combination of admission control and pricing of power. The optimal trade-off between these approaches is characterized. Numerical examples are given to illustrate these ideas.

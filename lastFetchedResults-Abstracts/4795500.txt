In this paper, a new mathematical model for the optimal location of automatic reclosers in distribution systems for fault isolation and load transference is proposed. A multi-objective formulation which considers the energy levels of the system together with the reliability in communication channels of reclosers as first objective and investment costs of reclosers and communication technology as second objective is developed. A MICRO-GA multi-objective optimization technique is used to solve the problem because it is easy to implement and computationally efficient. The applicability and efficiency of the method is analyzed from results obtained in test systems of the literature specialized.

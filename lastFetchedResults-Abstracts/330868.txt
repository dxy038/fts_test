Objective: To investigate the effect of different dentin treatments on the microtensile bond strength of a self-etching primer and a simplified, total-etch adhesive system.

Methods: Flat dentin surfaces were created on extracted human third molars. The surfaces were treated with one of the following conditioners: self-etching primer for 20 s (Clearfil SE Primer), 37% phosphoric acid for 15 s or 0.5 M EDTA for 30 s. Conditioned surfaces were then bonded with either Clearfil SE Bond or Single Bond followed by resin composite (Z250) build-ups constructed incrementally. Application of SE Primer was included when Clearfil SE Bond was used, after phosphoric acid and EDTA conditioning. After 24 h storage in water at 37 °C, the teeth were longitudinally sectioned across the bonded interface to produce beams with 1.0 mm2 of adhesive area, tested with the microtensile method at a rate of 0.5 mm/min. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test.

Results: The highest bond strength mean was found for the combination SE Primer/Single Bond (58.5±20.8 MPa), followed by the EDTA/Clearfil SE Bond (47.8±15.1 MPa) and phosphoric acid/Single Bond (40.9±14.3 MPa). The remaining combinations showed statistically similar (p>0.05) tensile bond strength.

Significance: The bond performance of the adhesives tested was dependent on the dentin conditioner. Pre-treatment with a mild etchant such as 0.5 M EDTA improved the bond strength of Clearfil SE Bond. Single Bond performed better when a self-etching primer was used as the dentin conditioner, probably by preventing the formation of a defective zone at the base of the hybrid layer. Overall results indicate that higher bond strengths can be achieved by conditioning dentin with milder etchants, suggesting that deeper demineralization may prevent proper resin infiltration, hence compromising the bond.

The objective of this letter is the fabrication and piezoelectric characterization of poly(vinylidene fluoride)-trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) thin films enhanced with zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles. The incorporation of piezoelectric ZnO nanoparticles will enhance bulk film piezoelectricity while preserving the mechanical flexibility of PVDF-TrFE. The nanocomposites are fabricated by spin coating. Piezoelectric properties are measured by applying electric fields while measuring their response using a Sawyer-Tower circuit.

In the current study with broiler chickens, the objective was to assess whether a mannanoligosaccharide (MOS) preparation would have anticoccidial activity. One-day-old birds were given a single, mild coccidiosis infection with a mixture of three Eimeria species: Eimeria acervulina, Eimeria maxima and Eimeria tenella. Infected and non-infected birds were fed a diet without or with 10 g MOS/kg. Growth performance, feed intake and feed conversion were not different (P&gt;0.05) among the treatment groups. The feeding of the MOS preparation reduced oocyst excretion and diminished the severity of coccidiosis lesions induced by E. acervulina (P&lt;0.05) but did not affect the lesions mediated by E. maxima and E. tenella (P=0.69 and 0.84, respectively). Further research is necessary to explain the observed effects in terms of mechanisms and to assess their practical relevance.

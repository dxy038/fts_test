Infrastructures are becoming more and more interoperable, while stakeholders are not aware of the overall behavior. In order achieve a global awareness, in this paper the need for cooperation is stressed; however, due to security and commercial issues, only few, very abstract data can be shared.In this paper a distributed interdependency estimation framework is provided, able to grant a minimal disclosure of data among the infrastructures, while letting operators make decisions with a wider perspective.The final objective of this research is to define an effective framework for the problem at hand, and then implement and validate an on-line distributed state/interdependency estimator within the EU IST MICIE project.

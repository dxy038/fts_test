BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There are so many factors affecting the posts retention, such as length, diameter, surface, etc. Moreover, another influencing factor is canal irrigators, which are used before cementation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of different root canal irrigators in the retention of casting post.
METHODS: In this study, 80 recently extracted central teeth with the same size and shape were selected, and after root canal treatment (RCT), the canals were prepared with the same length and diameter. Post’s length was the same with the mean size of 12mm. After canal preparation, acrylic post & cores were constructed. Then spruing, investing and casting were done. Before cementation, samples were classified into 4 groups (20 cases in each group) and each group were irrigated by different root canal irrigators: group A: by normal saline, group B: hypochlorite sodium 2%, group C: citric acid 10%, group D: EDTA+ hypochlorite sodium 2%. Then the canals were dried and posts were cemented by Glass Inomer GC Fuji I. The evaluation of maximum force to push the posts out was done by Zwick machine and the diagram was traced by computer. For data analyzing, Kruskal wallis and one way ANOVA and tuckey tests were used and confidence interval was set at 95% (α= 0.05).
FINDINGS: The average and standard deviation in 4 groups were: group A: 47.7±8.6 kg, group B: 46.8±9.3 kg, group C: 45.7±6.9 kg, group D: 43.9±6.8 kg. There was no significant difference between the four groups.
CONCLUSION: The root canal irrigators had no influence on the retention of the casting posts which were cemented by Glass Inomer.

This paper presents a mathematical model for a flow shop scheduling problem consisting of m machine and n jobs with fuzzy processing times that can be estimated as independent stochastic or fuzzy numbers. In the traditional flow shop scheduling problem, the typical objective is to minimize the makespan). However,, two significant criteria for each schedule in stochastic models are: expectable makespan and the probability of minimizing the makespan. These criteria can be considered for fuzzy problems as well. In this paper, we propose a solution for the fuzzy model by the use of fuzzy logic based on developing the model presented by MacCahon [18].

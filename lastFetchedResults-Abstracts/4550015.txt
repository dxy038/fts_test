Several mathematical and physical models of corona effect have been developed over the world. The main difference between them resides in the modeling techniques and the adopted hypotheses. To the author knowledge, until now the ATP-EMTP (ElectroMagnetic Transients Program) package does not have such model. The main objective of this work is the implementation of a model which is based on the phenomenon physical properties using the ATP-EMTP interface called MODELS. The implemented model has been exploited to predict the non-linear variations of the corona charge as a function of voltage and the corona capacitance for coaxial conductor configuration. The obtained results show that the model reproduces accurately the experimental results.

Size reduction is a constant objective in new technologies for which very accurate devices are needed when manipulating submillimetric objects. A new kind of microfabricated microrobot based on the use of bistable modules is designed to perform open-loop controlled micropositioning tasks. The DiMiBot (a specific digital microrobot) opens a new paradigm in the design of microrobots by using mechanical stability instead of complex control strategies. We propose a new architecture of digital microrobot for which forward and inverse kinematics models are easy to use. These kinematic models are validated with finite-element-analysis simulations before the fabrication of a real DiMiBot prototype. Tests and characterization of the prototype are made and compared with the desired behavior. Thanks to its submicrometric resolution and to its small dimensions (~ 400-&#956;m thickness), it is able to manipulate microobjects in confined environments, where no other robot can be used.

A novel multi-objective optimization problem with dynamics water spillage strategy for short-term hydrothermal scheduling (MSTHS) was described in this paper. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) and electromagnetism-like magnetism(EM) based hybrid algorithm was applied in solving the MSTHS and determining the optimal water discharge of cascade hydroelectric plants and fuel scheduling of coal-fired plants to develop the near-optimal scheduling strategy. The simulation with eight cascade hydroelectric plants and six coal-fired plants shows that the hybrid method is computationally efficient, simple and fast. In addition, the proposed method can obtain lots of non-inferior optimal solutions as optional decision-making for different preference of decision-maker.

Vehicle routing problems have been extensively analyzed to reduce transportation costs. More particularly, the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) imposes the period of time of customer availability as a constraint, a very common characteristic in real world situations. Using minimization of the total distance as the main objective to be fulfilled, this work implements an efficient hybrid system which associates non-monotonic simulated annealing to hill climbing with random restart (multi-start). Firstly, the algorithm is compared to the best results published in the literature for the 56 Solomon instances. Then, it is shown how statistical methods - analysis of variance and linear regression - can be used to determine the significance degree of the systemÂ´s parameters to obtain an even better and more reliable performance

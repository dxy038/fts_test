Hot spring thermal energy conversion (STEC) plant is a system that converts thermal energy into electricity by using the temperature difference between hot spring water and sea/river water. In this paper, the diffuser multi-objective control problem of STEC plant is presented. Based on the step test, the nonlinear separation model of working fluid dryness and pressure difference between turbine inlet and outlet for STEC plant was identified. According to the concept of back-off, a multi-objective coordination algorithm using the information of process static constraints was proposed. Based on the identified nonlinear separation model, a solution for STEC diffuser nonlinear predictive control was proposed. The application results have verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solution

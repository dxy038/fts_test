Background and Objective:leishmaniasis is a Zoonotic disease that is transmited by sandfly to human. This study were carried out in order to demonstrate some ecological characters of leishmaniasis vectors in Kalaleh district, Golestan province ,Iran, during 2006-07.
Materials and Methods: In present study 6 villages were selected. Sandfly were collected by sticky traps. 3 places were sampled in each village and in each places 20 traps were installed. After sampling collection, we used diagnostic criteria to identify the Sandflies, also confirmed human cases were recorded according to the months of identification.
Results: 4900 sandflies were detected in 6 villages and 12 species of sandflies were identified, which including P.papatasi, P.mongolensis, P.caucasicus, P.caucasicus group, P.sergenti, P.alexandri, P.kazeroni, P.brevis, P.(adlerius) sp, S.sintoni, S.clydei, S.sogdiana). P.papatasi was predominant species in indoor places (46.1%) and S.sintoni was in outdoor places (36.7%). Sandflies activities extended from early May through mid October with two peaks in mid June and September. Human infection had a important peak in January. During the collection of sandflies, the species of P.alexandri, P.kazeroni, P.brevis, P.(Adlerius sp.), S.clydei and S.sogdiana were collected for the first time from this area.
Conclusion: In this study, P.papatasi was the predominant species in this area. Sandflies second activity peak occured in September that is crucial for transmission of disease. The incubation period for this disease was four months.

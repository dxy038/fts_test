This paper presents a novel implementation of a Takagi-Sugeno-type fuzzy logic controller (FLC) on a two-wheeled mobile robot (2WMR), which consists of two wheels in parallel and an inverse pendulum. The control objective of the 2WMR is to achieve position control of the wheels while keeping the pendulum around the upright position that is an unstable equilibrium. The novelties of this work lie in three aspects. First, the FLC is a synthesized design which utilizes both heuristic knowledge and model information of the 2WMR system. The FLC structure, including the fuzzy labels, membership functions, and inference, is chosen based on heuristic knowledge about the 2WMR. The output parameters of the FLC are determined by comparing the output of the FLC with that of a linear controller at certain operating points, which avoids the difficulty and tediousness in manual tuning. The linear controller is designed based on a linearized model of the 2WMR system. Second, the proposed FLC is a simple and realizable design for real implementation. Only two fuzzy labels are adopted for each fuzzy variable. Sixteen fuzzy rules are used with eight output parameters and four range parameters for the membership functions to be determined. Third, the proposed FLC is successfully implemented on a real-time 2WMR for regulation and setpoint control tasks. Satisfactory responses are achieved when the 2WMR travels not only on a flat surface but also on an inclined surface. Through comprehensive experiment-based investigations, the effectiveness of the proposed FLC is validated, and the FLC shows superior performance than the existing methods.

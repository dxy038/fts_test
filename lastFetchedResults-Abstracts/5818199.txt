In order to accelerate the realization of engineering process of the interference accelerometer, the advantage of the carrierless demodulation algorithm of asymmetrical 3 &#215; 3 coupling output is analyzed in this paper. Simulation analysis of the demodulation algorithm is done and the correctness of the algorithm is validated with the Matlab-Simulink software. The platform for data acquisition and signal processing is established based on S3C2410, WINCE operating system is transplanted into the ARM processor. The portable objective code of the demodulation algorithm is obtained through RTW, and the signal processing platform is tested through outputting waveforms with the NI data acquisition card. And the result shows that the signal processing platform can real-time demodulate the test signal with the 20Hz~1KHz frequency. The signal processing platform provides a feasible program for realizing the digitization of the optical interference accelerometer.

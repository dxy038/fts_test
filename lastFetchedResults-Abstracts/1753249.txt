The Leishmania strains belonging to cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) have been reported to possess close homology in genome profiles. To confirm this on genetic basis an attempt was made to differentiate Leishmania major; Leishmania tropica and Leishmania donovani genetically for the first time using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)â€”a high throughput DNA fingerprinting technique. The objective of this research work was to identify DNA markers of CL and VL. Ten combinations of selective primers detect a total of 1487 informative AFLP marker. Percentage of polymorphism was 45.12%. Three hundred and thirty-seven unique AFLP markers were also identified in three species of Leishmania. A clear distinction was revealed between L. major and L. donovani. It was inferred by AFLP analysis that a higher rate of polymorphisms occurred among Leishmania species which indicate the distinguished pattern of the disease cause by Leishmania, i.e. VL and CL. Analysis based on polymorphic AFLP markers revealed considerably high genetic variation among the genome of these species which was sufficient to distinguish between CL and VL.

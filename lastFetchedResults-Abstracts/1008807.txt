A hyperelastic constitutive law is proposed to describe the mechanical behaviour of fibre bundles of woven composite reinforcements. The objective of this model is to compute the 3D geometry of the deformed woven unit cell. This geometry is important for permeability calculations and for the mechanical behaviour of the composite into service. The finite element models of a woven unit cell can also be used as virtual mechanical tests. The highlight of four deformation modes of the fibre bundle leads to definition of a strain energy potential from four specific invariants. The parameters of the hyperelastic constitutive law are identified in the case of a glass plain weave reinforcement thanks to uniaxial and equibiaxial tensile tests on the fibre bundle and on the whole reinforcement. This constitutive law is then validated in comparison to biaxial tension and in-plane shear tests.

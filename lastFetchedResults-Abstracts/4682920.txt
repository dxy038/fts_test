This paper presents a new model named NETPLAN for a long term, national level, multi-objective planning which optimizes energy system and transportation system infrastructure upgrade. The multi-objective of NETPLAN includes cost minimization, sustainability and resilience enhancement. NETPLAN applies network flow LP model to represent the energy and transportation network by using arcs and nodes structure. In NETPLAN, energy flows along the arcs within the network are decision variables. Emissions associated with energy flows depend on the fuel type, emission control equipment, and the amount of generation. Compliance strategies include new power plants with low emission rate, retrofitting with emission control equipment, changing dispatch way, fuel switch and earlier retirement. Study scenarios are developed to examine the impact of existing and proposed environmental regulations. The case study results show the needs of renewable energy resources increasing to meet the environmental regulations.

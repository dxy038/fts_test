This paper introduces a brief formal specification to prove a recovery model for system survivability. The model has some scenarios of finding available resource adopted from fault tolerance concepts to preserve the system and resumes its critical service when damage occurred as soon as possible. The fault tolerance is discussed in different perspective. The Z Notation is used to specify the model as it provides a succinct and unambiguous way of specifying services. The specification is mathematically-based and state-based system. It is expected that a basis for decision support can be created based on this specification. The objective of this paper is to discuss the possibility of using specification for a model.

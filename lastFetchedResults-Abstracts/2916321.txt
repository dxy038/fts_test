The objective of the authors´ work is to provide a two point T<sub>1</sub> measurement technique to enable well localised spectra to be obtained within an acceptable time scale, from which the T<sub>1</sub> relaxation times of the chemically shifted lines in the spectrum can be calculated. The method is demonstrated by measuring the T<sub>1</sub>´s of a set of calibrated gadolinium-doped water phantoms. In vivo T<sub>1</sub> values obtained by the technique for the inorganic phosphate, the nucleotide triphosphate, &#945;, &#946;, and &#947; and phosphocreatine metabolites for the calf muscle of normal volunteers are also presented

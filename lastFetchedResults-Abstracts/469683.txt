Objective
The purpose of this study was to examine the diagnostic performance of ultrasonographic measurement of the cervical length and vaginal fetal fibronectin determination in the prediction of preterm delivery in patients with preterm uterine contractions and intact membranes.
Study design
Ultrasound examination of the cervical length and fetal fibronectin determination in vaginal secretions were performed in 215 patients admitted with preterm uterine contractions (22-35 weeks) and cervical dilatation of ≤3 cm. Outcome variables were the occurrence of preterm delivery within 48 hours, 7 days, and 14 days of admission, delivery ≤32 and ≤35 weeks, as well as the admission-to-delivery interval. Statistical analysis included chi-square test, receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, logistic regression, and survival analysis.
Results
The overall prevalence of preterm delivery ≤35 weeks was 20% (43/215). The prevalence of spontaneous preterm delivery within 48 hours, 7 days, and 14 days of admission, and delivery ≤32 and ≤35 weeks were 7.9% (17/215), 13.0% (28/215), 15.8% (34/215), 8.9% (9/101), and 15.8% (34/215), respectively. ROC curve analysis and contingency tables showed a significant relationship between the occurrence of preterm delivery and both cervical length and fetal fibronectin results (P< .01 for each). Both tests performed comparably in the prediction of spontaneous preterm delivery. However, when fetal fibronectin results were added to those of cervical length (<30 mm), a significant improvement in the prediction of preterm delivery was achieved.
Conclusion
Fetal fibronectin adds prognostic information to that provided by sonographic measurement of the cervical length in patients with preterm uterine contractions and intact membranes.

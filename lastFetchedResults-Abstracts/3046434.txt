In this paper, we investigate scheduling in multiuser OFDMA systems. The objective is to maximize the resource utilization in a network, while a required quality of service (QoS) per user is satisfied. A notion of revenue maximization is used to determine the optimal OFDMA subcarrier allocation to different users based on their required QoS. The optimal solution for the problem is presented and its performance and complexity are studied. An iterative low complexity algorithm is also proposed to achieve near optimal performance.

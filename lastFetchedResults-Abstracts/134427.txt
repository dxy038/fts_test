Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the efficacy and side effects of nortriptyline vs. trazodone in the treatment of nonpsychotic major depression among middle-aged patients in a double blind randomized clinical trial. Method: Thirty patients (40-60 year-old) with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder were selected which have been diagnosed according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria as well as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) (minimum score = 20). Cases were randomly assigned into two groups, each consisting of 15 cases. Patients were treated for 8 weeks with either nortriptyline (25-100 mg/day) or trazodone (75-300 mg/day). Results: Findings showed that both drugs were effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Side effects of trazodone and nortriptyline were comparable; however, trazodone causes transient positional dizziness while nortriptyline causes decrease in libido, vaginal dryness, and weight gain. Conclusion: According to the results of this research, it seems that trazodone is preferred for the patients who can not tolerate the anticholinergic side effects or weight gain. Meanwhile, authors believe that other conditions of the patients should be taken into account while choosing between trazodone and nortriptyline.

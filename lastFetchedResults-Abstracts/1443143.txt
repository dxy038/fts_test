Control of frictional forces is required in many applications of tribology. While the problem is approached by chemical means traditionally, a recent approach was proposed to control the system mechanically to tune frictional responses. We design feedback control laws for a one-dimensional particle array sliding on a surface subject to friction. The Frenkel–Kontorova model describing the dynamics is a nonlinear interconnected system and the accessible control elements are average quantities only. We prove local stability of equilibrium points of the un-controlled system in the presence of linear and nonlinear particle interactions, respectively. We then formulate a tracking control problem, whose control objective is for the average system to reach a designated targeted velocity using accessible elements. Sufficient stabilization conditions are explicitly derived for the closed-loop error systems using the Lyapunov theory based methods. Simulation results show satisfactory performances. The results can be applied to other physical systems whose dynamics is described by the Frenkel–Kontorova model.

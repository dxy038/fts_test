This paper describes an automatic retinal image analysis system which can be used for the mass screening of diabetic retinopathy patients. Fundus photographs were scanned and processed sequentially to identify the optic disk and the fovea through a Hough transform, to trace the blood vessels by a Gaussian filter and finally to detect the exudates using dynamic thresholding. An objective diagnosis could be provided based on the results of the analysis

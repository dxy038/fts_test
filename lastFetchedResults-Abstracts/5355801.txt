The method to validate in laboratory the in-band electromagnetic susceptibility of the Eurobalise system used for data transmission in railway application has not yet been standardized. This paper describes a study which aims at evaluating the radiated immunity test to electromagnetic disturbances in the 4 MHz range corresponding to the transmission carrier frequency used by the beacon for transmission. Typical disturbance signals recorded in the rolling stock environment are intended to be used as an excitation signal for this immunity test. At first, the test is developed for the whole transmission system that consists of a beacon/antenna set. However, another objective of this work is to perform the immunity evaluation of the on board antenna alone although its operation requires the presence of a beacon in principle. These different test set up are presented in this paper as well as their performances.

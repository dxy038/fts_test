Objective
The aims of this study were to prove the presence of transient phrenic nerve palsy in children after cardiac surgery by successive recordings of diaphragmatic action potentials (DAPs), and to decide the indication of diaphragmatic plication in infants with postoperative phrenic nerve palsy.
Methods
The DAPs were recorded from 11 infants (age 0–54 months) under artificial ventilation after cardiac surgery. The successive DAP recordings were performed within 3–4 days (0W), 1 week (1W) and 2 weeks (2W) after operation to make a final decision for diaphragmatic plication to wean artificial ventilation.
Results
The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the DAP changes in successive recordings, namely, patients with normal DAPs at 0W, patients with transient depression of DAPs at 0W followed by recovery to normal DAPs by 1W and/or 2W, and patients with persistent depression of DAPs of the affected side necessitating plication of hemidiaphragm.
Conclusions
In infants with phrenic nerve palsy after cardiothoracic surgery, persistently abnormal DAPs in repeated electrophysiologic examinations for at least 2 weeks after surgery are a useful guidance to support clinical and radiological evidence for an indication of diaphragmatic plication.

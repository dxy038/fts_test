In this paper, we present bi-directional data vortex interconnection network in which the packets are routed both in the forward as well as in the reverse directions. We have simulated the hardware model of a single node with data flow from the node in both the directions and routing. The cascading performance of nodes has been studied by varying the input power from -15 to 0 dBm and BER characteristics up to 70 cascaded nodes have been verified. The terminal reliability analysis of bi-directional data vortex is carried out, as reliability and fault tolerance are important parameters for any multistage interconnection network. Finally, the comparison of the terminal reliability between the proposed bidirectional architecture with two data vortex networks connected in parallel for bidirectional operation is presented.

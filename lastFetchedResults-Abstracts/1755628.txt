Objective
r studies have shown an association between alexithymia and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). There has been some controversy as to whether this is attributable solely to psycho-social domains of HRQoL or also to physical domains. Furthermore, there are no studies on HRQoL profiles in representative general population samples controlling for sociodemographic variables, mental health and somatic health.
s
udy forms part of the Health 2000 Study. Altogether 5090 participants from general population, aged 30-97 years, filled in the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale and the 15D HRQoL scale. Depressive and anxiety disorders were assessed in a structured psychiatric interview. Physical health was examined by physicians. The 15-dimension HRQoL profiles of both alexithymic and non-alexithymic subjects were obtained by analysis of covariance, controlling for sociodemographic and health-related variables.
s
exithymic group had significantly (P&lt;.001) lower mean scores on every dimension of the 15D even after controlling for confounding demographic variables, somatic diagnoses and depressive and anxiety disorders. The differences were greatest in the psycho-social domains.
sions
hymia seems to be a personality trait with a statistically significant association to every dimension of HRQoL, not only to psychosocial domains. However, the associations between alexithymia and some somatic dimensions may be of little clinical significance.

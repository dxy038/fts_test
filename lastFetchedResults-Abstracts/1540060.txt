This paper presents a study of multi-objective optimal design of full state feedback controls. The goal of the design is to minimize several conflicting performance objective functions at the same time. The simple cell mapping method with a hybrid algorithm is used to find the multi-objective optimal design solutions. The multi-objective optimal design comes in a set of gains representing various compromises of the control system. Examples of regulation and tracking controls are presented to validate the control design.

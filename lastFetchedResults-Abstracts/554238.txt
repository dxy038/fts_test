The Main objective in this project is to find out how much of consensus and social integration exists among three following ethnic groups: Turkmen, Sistani and the so-called Fars who have had many years of nearby living and continuous socioeconomic interactions. To achieve this objective, the acceptance gap among these three ethnic groups on the economic, social, culture and political dimensions were examined. A questionnaire was constructed and the people's attitude in each ethnic group toward the people of other two ethnic groups was evaluated. By using Frequency Distribution Tables and appropriate statistical techniques, the collected data were then analyzed and the following conclusions emerged: 1) Turkmen showed the wider acceptance gap with Sistani's people and narrower one with the Fars; 2) Sistani ethnic group expressed wider acceptance gap with Turkmen and narrower one with Fars; 3)Fars showed wider acceptance gap towards Sistani people than toward Turkmen. In general, economic dimension, in comparison to other four dimensions, showed the least acceptance gap and political dimension showed the widest acceptance gap among ethnic groups.

Springback in metal forming process is tendency to partially return to its original shape because of the elastic recovery of the material upon release of the forming force. In order to increase accuracy of dimension in products, it is desirable to eliminate or reduce this phenomenon. It is the main objective of present work to study the amount of springback generated during deep drawing forming of titanium sheets and influence of plate thickness and heat on springback. For this purpose, LS/DYNA computer code is used to simulate forming process. For tools (mandrel, clamped, matrix) preheating of 200 degree centigrade and for plating 200, 300 and 400 degree centigrade are used for first, second and third stage of forming respectively. Results are compared with available results in literature for V-shape forming. This comparison shows that springback changes directly with material and geometry of tools and with increasing temperature, formability of Titanium alloys has increased and springback are decreased.

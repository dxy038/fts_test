Objective: We examined the concentrations of oxytocin and extended forms of oxytocin in umbilical plasma with and without labor.
Study design: Umbilical venous and arterial blood were sampled in 27 term fetuses delivered vaginally and 13 delivered abdominally before labor. Extended forms and oxytocin were measure by radioimmunoassay and compared by analysis of variance or t test.
Results: Concentrations of extended forms were higher than oxytocin concentrations (24.7 ± 3.1 6.1 ± 1.2 pg/ml, p< 0.01). Extended forms were higher in umbilical venous than in arterial plasma (29.6 ± 5.0 vs 19.8 ± 3.1 pg/ml, p< 0.05); oxytocin concentrations were not significantly different (4.7 ± 1.6 vs 7.8 ± 1.8 pg/ml). Concentrations of extended forms were markedly lower with than without labor (17.14 ± 3.0 vs 37.1 ± 5.7 pg/ml, p = 0.01). Ratios of extended forms over oxytocin decreased with labor.
Conclusion: In umbilical plasma extended forms of oxytocin are more abundant than oxytocin. Extended forms originate in the uterus and decrease markedly with labor.

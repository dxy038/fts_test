Background and Objectives: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is one of the most common Salmonella serotypes in gastroenteritis cases. ERIC-PCR method is used for genotyping studies and examinations in order to apply appropriate preventive and controlling conditions. This research was carried out with the objective of investigating the genotyping of Salmonella typhimurium strains in the treatment centers of Kerman province.
&nbsp;
Methods: In this descriptive study, different strains of Salmonella Typhimurium, were isolated from different treatment centers. All strains were examined using standard methods of microbiology, biochemistry, and molecular biology. Genetic relationship between the strains was evaluated by ERIC-PCR method.
&nbsp;
Results: In this study, Among 891 stool and blood samples of patients with diarrhea, 48 strains of Salmonella typhimurium, were isolated. The isolates were classified in terms of genotyping into 15 different groups using ERIC-PCR method, which the highest number of the strains was in the 14th group (25%, 12 strains).
&nbsp;
Conclusion: The results of the present study showed high discrimination power of ERIC-PCR method for molecular typing and genetic diversity of Salmonella typhimurium strains isolated from human samples. Therefore, this method can be used for epidemiological studies in order to investigate the source of contamination, genetic diversity and its relationship with geographical distribution and drug resistance of the isolated strains.

Objective: The aim of the present investigation was to explore probable association of renal artery stenosis (RAS) with coronary artery disease (CAD) and the prevalence of renal artery stenosis (RAS) in patients with CAD.

Patients and methods: This study comprised 165 consecutive patients with CAD, including 52.7% males and 47.2% females with respective mean ages of 60.3 ±8.9 and 59.5±10.1. The patients underwent simultaneous coronary and renal angiographies, and the lumen reduction of 50% or more was considered as significant stenosis. Indeed, stenosis of more than 70% of the arterial lumen was regarded as severe.

Results: According to our findings, the prevalence of renal artery stenosis in our hypertensive and normotensive patients were 46.2% and 19.5% respectively (p=0.002). Renal artery angiography revealed that 64 (38.8%) of the patients had simultaneous renal artery stenosis. RAS is more common in females than males (p=0.031). Multivariate analysis revealed that among all examined factors, hypertension and serum creatinine were associated with RAS. There was no correlations found between gensini score and RAS (p=0.63).

Conclusion: We found a relatively high prevalence of RAS including 46.2% in hypertensive and 19.5% in normotensive patients in our patients with CAD.

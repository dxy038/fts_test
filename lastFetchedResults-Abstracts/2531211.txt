Objective(s): According to the unique properties of magnetic nanoparticles, Nickel Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF) was synthesized successfully by ultrasound irradiation. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are organic–inorganic hybrid extended networks that are constructed via covalent linkages between metal ions/metal clusters and organic ligands called a linker. Materials and Methods: The nanoparticles were synthesized by Ultrasound  Method Under a synthesis conditions, All chemicals were used as received without further purification. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on LEO- 1455VP equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy at university of Kashan in Iran. Transition electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on EM208 Philips transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Results: Results showed that Ni-MOF synthesized by this method, had smaller particle size distribution and It was found that the different kinds of ligand leads to preparation products with different morphologies and textural properties. Moreover, ultrasound irradiation method has significant effect on microstructures of as-synthesized MOFs and can improve their textural properties compared to method without using hydrothermal route.The XRD patterns of the samples obtained from ultrasound irradiation was well matched with that of as-prepared Ni-MOF by solvothermal method. Conclusion: This rapid method of ultrasonic radiation as compared to the classical solvothermal synthesis, showed promising results in terms of size distribution, surface area, pore diameter and pore volume.

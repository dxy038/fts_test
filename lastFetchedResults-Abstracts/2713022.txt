A single-objective predictive control method that deals with four main control objectives applied to a multivariable single-phase three-level neutral-point-clamped converter operating as an active power filter is proposed in this paper. The four control objectives are to self-support the dc-bus voltage under load variations, to compensate the reactive power and the current harmonics, and to balance the dc capacitor voltages by using a predefined combination of the redundant switching states of the converter. The main contribution of the proposed method is that these objectives are accomplished without using weighting factors in the cost function, which eliminates problems such as multiobjective optimization or additional empirical procedures for determination of these factors. As a result, the method is easy to implement and rapidly selects the optimal voltage to improve the dynamic-state performance. Experimental results from a 2-kVA prototype are presented to prove that the method is valid for single-phase compensation. The well-known effect of model parameter errorsÂ´ issue, which is inherent in predictive control methods, is also tested to confirm that the harmonic distortion in the grid current is below 5% even when the predictive model has a 25% error between actual and theoretically estimated grid impedance values.

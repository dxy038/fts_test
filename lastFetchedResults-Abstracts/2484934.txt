Background and Objective: Regarding prevalence of epilepsy and inefficiency of the present treatments, this study was done to evaluate anti-epileptic activity of Paeonia officinalis L alcoholic extract as an anti-convulsive herbal candidate. 

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 40 male mice were divided into 1- control 2- valproate 3, 4 and 5 P. Officinalis extract at doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg. All of the animals were kindled by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (100 mg/kg, i.p.) injection and the seizure steps onset times 1- myoclonic contraction 2- limb jerk 3- general convulsion and 4- hind limb tonic extension were calculated. In treatment groups, the extract was applied 30 min before PTZ injection. Finally, calculated data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey tests. 

Results: Obtained data show that the extract (100 mg/kg) could significantly increase tonus onset time (186.5±14.17) in comparison to control animals (117.75±16.36) (p  <  0.05). Also, the HLTE duration time by three doses of the extract 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg were 5.28±0.6, 3.3±1.79 and 4.76±1.01, respectively, which were significantly lower than control (7.85±1.2) (p  < 0.05). 

Conclusion:  Overall, P. officinalis extract could not changes the threshold at pre-convulsion periods, but exactly the convulsive onset time was markedly diminished by the extract. Also, HLTE duration time as a real marker of seizure was significantly reduced by the extract.

Objective: A “frameless” intrauterine drug delivery system that releases 14 μg/d of levonorgestrel was used to treat nonatypical and atypical endometrial hyperplasia in 12 women. Study Design: This noncomparative study had up to 3 to 4 years of follow-up. Results: The cure rate was 100%, as confirmed by repeat endometrial biopsy. Conclusion: This method could be considered an alternative to hysterectomy. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:1297-8.)

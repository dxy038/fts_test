Reliable information on the heat transfer mode inside biological materials is essential for optimising food treatments and living tissues applications. The objective of this paper is to presents a transmission line matrix (TLM) solution to account for the heat wave propagation in such biological materials. A good agreement is found between the TLM results and analytical or experimental ones.

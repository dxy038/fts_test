     The objective of the present study was to determine the relationship between the meta-cognition knowledge (cognitive strategies and meta-cognitive), implicit intelligence theories and attitude to the help-seeking behaviors with third grade mathematic students’ performance in guidance school of Tabriz. The statistical population was 10235 people, out of which 375 people were chosen through Morgan’s table. The sampling method was multi-stage random sampling. To gather the data four questionnaires were used (implicit intelligence theory, help-seeking, learning strategies, and researcher made). The data were analyzed through Pearson’s correlation coefficient, multiple regression, and academic achievement test. The results showed that there was a significant difference between the attitude and help-seeking behaviors with students’ mathematic performance. There was also a significant between multiple intelligence theories (innate & additive intelligence) with cognitive and metacognitive strategies. There was negative significant difference between innate intelligence with help-seeking acceptance. There was a positive significance between the use of cognitive strategies and metacognitive. The multiple regression analysis showed that help-seeking acceptance variable significantly predicts the mathematical performance.

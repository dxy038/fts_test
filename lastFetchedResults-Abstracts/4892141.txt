This paper describes the capabilities of a new facility that has been developed on the campus of Oregon State University by support from the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). The purpose of the Motor Systems Resource Facility (MSRF) is to promote the effective and efficient use of electric motors, drives and generators by providing consulting and analysis services backed by test and evaluation capabilities rated up to 300 hp (225 kW). The laboratory is designed to be both highly flexible in its capabilities and to be of maximum efficiency through the use of a bidirectional, unity power factor, active rectifier dynamometer power converter. Extracts from recent test projects are given including a comparison assessment of switched-reluctance and induction motor drives and an investigation of in-service efficiency measurement techniques.

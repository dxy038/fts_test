In order to decrease the energy consumption, the energy saving effect of variable frequency speed pump in water injection system is discussed and an optimal method to gain the optimum control parameters in the water injection system based on genetic algorithm is put forward. A mathematical model for the optimum parameters of centrifugal pumps is established, in which the minimum total electric power consumption of the fixed-speed pumps and variable speed pumps is taken as the objective function, the restriction to pump displacement and injection pressure are taken as constraint conditions. The optimal parameters of the model are concerned with both disperse and continuous variables. According to the characteristics of the model, dual coding of the chromosome with both binary system and decimal system based on genetic algorithm is used , in which the selection, intercross and variation modes are put forward. The software based on the optimisation model is programmed. The optimal calculation of the running scheme of some oilfield&#8217;s water injection system as a case is given, and the great economic benefit has been gained.

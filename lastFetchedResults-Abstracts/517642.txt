The main objective of present work was to compare the overall performances of “moving-bed” and “conventional” sequencing batch reactor. For this purpose, different experimental parameters including COD and dye concentration, turbidity, MLSS concentration, MLVSS/MLSS ratio, sludge volume index (SVI) and Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP) were calculated. One conventional sequencing batch reactor and three moving-bed sequencing batch reactors (MB-SBR) were operated in this study. Each MB-SBR was equipped with a type of moving biofilm carrier. The results of dye, COD and turbidity analysis showed that there were no significant differences between the moving-bed and conventional sequencing batch reactors in the matters of effluent quality. A higher fluctuation of MLSS concentration and also higher SVI were observed in moving-bed compared to that of the conventional sequencing batch reactor. Higher ORP values which mean higher oxidation potential were measured in the reactors equipped with the moving carriers in comparison with those measured in the conventional sequencing batch reactor.

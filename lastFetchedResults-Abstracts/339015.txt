Objective
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) develops as the consequence of a series of genetic changes in a hematopoietic precursor cell. However, the definitive diagnostic protein biomarkers for AML are still unclear. In our study to identify the biomarkers for an initial diagnosis, detection of relapse, and monitoring the minimal residual disease in AML by a less invasive method, serum proteins reflecting alterations in their proteomes were analyzed.
Materials and Methods

We compared the two-dimensional electrophoresis patterns of human sera of 12 patients with AML with those of 12 normal subjects. The differentially expressed spots were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight and electrospray ionization quadupole time-of-flight mass spectrometries.
Results

Eight proteins that expressed differentially in the AML group were found. The expression levels of Î±-2-HS-glycoprotein, complement-associated protein SP-40, 40, RBP4 gene product, lipoprotein C-III, and an unknown protein were downregulated in serum of AML patients, whereas the other three proteins, including immunoglobulin heavy-chain variant, proteosome 26S ATPase subunit 1, and haptoglobin-1 were upregulated.
Conclusion

These results suggest that these proteins can be used as less invasive diagnostic and monitoring biomarkers of AML if further studies are done.

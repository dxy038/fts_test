Evaluation of QoE for web browsing is a challenging topic as it involves many different factors related to human as well as technical issues. To understand such a large number of human and technical metrics is both difficult and tricky. Two main objectives of this paper are to propose and develop a new QoE assessment approach for web browsing. The proposed QoE assessment of Web based services uses a comprehensive set of metrics in order to construct a full and detailed understanding of usersÂ´ experiences in a web based service environment. The analysis and validation of QoE assessment of Web based traffic using both objective parameters from networking, application, and content perspectives have shown the efficacy of the proposed assessment. A comprehensive set of metrics has been evaluated on the overall web user QoE.

The main objective of this work is creation of a synthetic ECG signal in software MATLAB based on the analysis of Fourier series. The individual elements of ECG signal are approximated by mathematical model, which is thoroughly described, explained and then applied. The output is a synthetic model of an ECG. Our approach to modeling biological signals allows change input parameters (amplitude and period of significant elements ECG). Synthetic models of biological signals can be used for demonstration purposes, but mainly serves as a material for functionality detectors for measuring and predicting lengths of waves and intervals.

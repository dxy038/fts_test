High bidirectional holding-voltage clamps are introduced for applications operating in harsh environments. The clamps\Â´ terminals are formed with complementary doped 3-D "T" pattern and island active regions. Transmission-line-pulsed current in the ranges of &#177;0.15 and &#177;0.39 mA/&#956;m<sup>2</sup> is demonstrated for &#177;40- and &#177;25-V holding-voltage clamps, respectively. The high bidirectional holding voltage is optimized without increasing spacing between the terminals of the devices, achieving a compact clamp architecture successfully codesigned with advanced transceiver circuits.

The main objective of the present study is to estimate wind power potential of Gökçeada Island in the Northern Aegean Sea in Turkey using the wind data collected at four different locations. Wind data collected over a period of 3 years at Uğurlu and Çınaraltı stations and a period of 10 years at Aydıncık and National Weather Station. In this regard, wind data collected at 10 and 30 m of height above ground, were extrapolated to 50 m which had been chosen as the wind turbine hub height, using power law. Extrapolated wind data of four stations were represented by Weibull probability density functions to find the wind speed distribution curves. Two Weibull parameters of the wind speed distribution function, shape parameter k (dimensionless) and scale parameter c (m/s) were calculated by the developed Fortran programme on monthly and yearly basis to find the wind profiles. Annual wind speed distributions throughout the Gökçeada Island were also obtained using the calculated Weibull probability density function parameters. The suitability of the distributions is judged by the discrepancies between the observed and calculated values of the monthly average wind speed. The results show the general availability of wind energy potential across Gökçeada Island.

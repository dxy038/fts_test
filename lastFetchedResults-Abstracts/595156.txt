Objective: The objective of the study was to observe the effect of short-term noise on heart rate.Material and Methods: One Hundred and seventeen (117) medical students were selected as subjects. Subjects having normal resting heart rate and blood pressure were included in the study. Subjects with hearing defect were excluded from study. Auditory aquity was confirmed by audiometry before the start of experiment for each subject. A noise of a 90 dB intensity and 4000Hz frequency was produced for 10 minutes. Heart rate was recorded before, during and after exposure to noise.Results: Heart rate increased in 104 (88.9%) subjects, with an average rise of 8.938+ 1.037. In 73 subjects (70.19%) it came back to basal level within 02 minutes. Increase in heart rate was observed in more number of males as compared to females; however, the difference was statistically insignificant.Conclusion: Heart rate increases during exposure to noise.

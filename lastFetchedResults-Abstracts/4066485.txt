This paper presents the evaluation of the performance, in terms of uncertainty, of a tool designed to estimate the main parameters of a model of a photovoltaic panel (PVP) under real and/or simulated working conditions. The presented tool permits the characterization of the panel, and it is useful to predict its behavior in whatever working condition; in this way, it is possible to compare the actual and expected performance to prevent any decrease in the output power, so permitting the replacement of the monitored module before it goes out of order or its efficiency falls under a given threshold. The well-known two-diode model is used to estimate the parameters of the electrical equivalent circuit of the PVP and to simulate the <i>I</i> -<i>V</i> and <i>P</i>-<i>V</i> characteristic curves in any given environmental condition of irradiance and/or temperature. The model and the estimation algorithm are implemented with MATLAB functions, whereas data acquisition and result presentation are managed by a LabVIEW graphics user interface. The presented tool has been validated against an experimentally characterized PVP. The environmental parameters of the model such as irradiance and temperature have been set (with their respective uncertainties) during simulations or directly measured during the outdoor tests, whereas the others parameters have been evaluated using a best-fit algorithm on the measured data. The estimation is based on the minimization of a new objective function and on a modified expression of the model resistances, which differ from those mentioned in the available literature. After a review of the state of the art, this paper provides the description of the estimation technique and its validation by means of simulations and experiments. Some results are also provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed test method.

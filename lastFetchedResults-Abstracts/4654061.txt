The importance of having a system through which meaningful population data could be collected at national level and on a continuous basis in the African continent cannot be overemphasized. As such, national governments through the legislature pass mandates and other procedures for registration of all births and deaths, as well as having a national system of civil registration and vital statistics in place. The main objective of this study was to develop a data model for population registration and national identification system (PRNIS) for Uganda, in which the demographic changes such as birth, marriages, migration, deaths, and some socio-economic characteristics of population are continuously recorded. Data used in developing this data model for PRNIS was collected through interviews, observation and secondary sources. The study created a model which can be used to develop a system for continuous registration of events, ascertainment of accurate statistics of population, provide proof of identity of citizens and create a repository for vital statistics in Uganda.

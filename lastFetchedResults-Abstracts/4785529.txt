In this paper, we evaluate the performance of existing and new objective measures in terms of predicting the quality of reverberant speech and speech enhanced by dereverberation algorithms. We use subjective quality ratings designed to evaluate the quality of speech along three dimensions: speech coloration, reverberation tail effect and overall speech quality. Experimental results assess the correlations between the proposed objective quality measures and the three subjective rating scales and suggest that PESQ-based measures can very reliably predict the quality of reverberant and dereverberated speech.

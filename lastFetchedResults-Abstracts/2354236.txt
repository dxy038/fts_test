Objective: In this study, nano-biocomposite composed of poly (lactide-co-glycolide)
(PLGA) and chitosan (CS) were electrospun through a single nozzle by dispersing the CS
nano-powders in PLGA solution. The cellular behavior of human adipose derived stem
cells (h-ADSCs) on random and aligned scaffolds was then evaluated.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, the PLGA/CS scaffolds were prepared
at the different ratios of 90/10, 80/20, and 70/30 (w/w) %. Morphology, cell adhesion and proliferation
rate of h-ADSCs on the scaffolds were assessed using scanning electron microscope
(SEM), 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and trypan
blue staining respectively.
Results: H-ADSCs seeded on the matrices indicated that the PLGA/CS composite matrix
with aligned nanofibres and higher content of CS nano-powders gave significantly better
performance than others in terms of cell adhesion and proliferation rate (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: We found that CS enhanced cell adhesion and proliferation rate, and
aligned nanofibers guided cell growth along the longitudinal axis of the nanofibers,
which would provide a beneficial approach for tissue engineering.

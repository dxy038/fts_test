Nowadays, in modern logical discussions reference is made to a new logic called fuzzy logic. This field was introduced under this name by Professor Lotf alizadeh to the world. Fuzzy logic criticized classical Aristotelian logic because here, when describing the realities, Aristotle draws a distinct line between "zero and one" and "black and white". However, according to fuzzy logic the$$xlernal world is like a graded continuum, thus, in order to know about it, insteacfeof^peaking of "A or non-A", we must speak of "A and non-A" so that the different cales between zero and one or the gray areas between black and white are not ignored either.
 
 
 
If we cast a glance at Sadrian philosophy, we will witness some elements such as gradation in the objective world, the trans-substantial motion, and also some ambiguous fuzzy collections that lead the Transcendent Philosophy towards fuzzy philosophy. However, Mulla Sadra's philosophy, rather than merely following a fuzzy approach, is a fuzzy philosophy in which elements such as Man, the world, and the relationship between God and the world have been portrayed in a fuzzy form. The creation of human beings has been initially corporeal and its continuity in the form of a trans-substantial motion until reaching the level of rationality and even leaving the soulish state is a good example of a fuzzy and continuum-like design of a picture in Sadrian anthropology. The fuzzy Transcendent Philosophy, while acknowledging its differences from the modern fuzzy logic, is very useful for attaining a true knowledge of Man and reality.

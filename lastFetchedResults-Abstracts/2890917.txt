This paper presents the design and testing results of an electrothermally driven MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) actuator. Different from conventional uni-directional thermal actuators, this in-plane bi-directional electrothermal actuator is capable of producing displacements in two directions as a single device. The RF MEMS switch driven by this cascaded electrothermal actuator is also proposed. Due to this bidirectional actuator, the proposed switch can not only realize the OFF-state to ON-state shifting but also provide an additional deep OFF-state. At the deep OFF state, the isolation better than -30 dB can be achieved at the whole frequency range of 0 ~ 40 GHz.

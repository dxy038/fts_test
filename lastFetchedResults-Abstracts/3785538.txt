The authors report the fabrication of OEICs incorporating DFB lasers, 3 dB couplers, Mach-Zehnder interferometers, monitor photodiodes and high speed pin signal detectors, providing functionality for low cost, bidirectional telephony and unidirectional broadband communication links for access networks. This work represents the first time subcomponents have been monolithically integrated into an OEIC to support such a link. The process and design is compatible with solder bump packaging and enhanced coupling efficiency waveguide couplers

A possible cause of coupling between microwave communication systems is the scattering of microwave energy by rain. This can result in interference to microwave links, and a degradation in performance. A number of rainscatter monitoring receivers were deployed around the UK by the BT Research Laboratories (BTRL Martlesham Heath). These experiments concentrated on the 11 GHz band shared by terrestrial radio relay systems and the fixed-satellite service. The objective of the measurement programme was to use existing BT 11 GHz terrestrial link transmitters, practical interference geometries and standard small earth station receiving hardware to carry out measurements under conditions representative of those experienced by satellite earth stations operating within the UK. The paper presents the results obtained from this measurement programme

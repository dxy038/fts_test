Small scale energy storage system incorporating a battery bank has attracted special interest as a promising load leveling system. Because battery bank voltage of this system is low, it is important to use a bidirectional chopper suitable for large step-up/step-down ratio. In this paper we propose a circuit topology of bidirectional chopper appropriate for small scale load leveling system and present the analytical and experimental results

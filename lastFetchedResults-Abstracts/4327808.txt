Simulation assessment of error and veracity is the precondition in power system dynamic simulation validation that is directly related to power system stability. Own to the applications of wide area measurement system (WAMS) that could provide synchronous measured information of power grid, it is possible to assess dynamic simulation. Based on the principles of similarity theory and analytical hierarchy process (AHP), this paper proposes general assessment method on amplitude similarity degree of simulation and its relative error criterion by analyzing the characteristics of power system dynamic stability and variables. This method could not only systematically reflect the similarity degree of whole system and every time period, but also provide objective quantitative information and reference for further model validation and parameter correction. A case study is presented to verify the proposed method on the basis of the measured data from WAMS of certain power grid.

In this paper, new approach to maintenance scheduling of generating units of GENCOs in competitive environment are presented. In this environment, the decision making process is decentralize where each company try to maximize its own benefit. Therefore, the principle to draw up the unit maintenance scheduling will be changed significantly. The profit of each GENCO is defined as total profit which is the sum of its individual unitsÂ´ profit from the auctions over the study horizon. The aim of each GENCO is to minimize his maintenance investment loss (MIL). Therefore, he hopes to schedule its maintenance on the weeks when the market clearing price (MCP) is lower. The objective function of ISO is to minimize fee of purchasing power energy with equal ratio of reserve capacity in each period. So the target of the ISO is near to the benefit of society. Therefore there are two objective functions for finding an optimum maintenance schedule in restructured power systems. In this paper we apply genetic algorithm methodology for solving the optimization problem corresponding to the generation maintenance scheduling.

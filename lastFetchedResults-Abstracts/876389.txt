Some sufficient conditions are obtained for the existence and global exponential stability of a periodic
solution to the general bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks with distributed delays by
using the continuation theorem of Mawhin’s coincidence degree theory and the Lyapunov functionalmethod
and the Young’s inequality technique. These results are helpful for designing a globally exponentially stable
and periodic oscillatory BAM neural network, and the conditions can be easily verified and be applied in
practice. An example is also given to illustrate our results.

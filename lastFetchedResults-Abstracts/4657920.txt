This paper proposes a new full-reference objective metric for image quality assessment. The reference and distorted images are decomposed into a number of wavelet subbands, in which mean curvatures and perceived error of the wavelet coefficients of two images are computed and integrated to give overall quality index. Taking structural similarity and error visibility into account, the new method can achieve high consistency with subjective evaluation compared with other metrics. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed metric.

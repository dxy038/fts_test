Arbitrary sample rate conversion (ASRC) is used in many applications of DSP. ASRC algorithms based on integer-ratio oversampling and continuous-time resampling filters enable good resampling quality for wideband signals. A previous publication introduced an overall optimization scheme for structures based on oversampling and Lagrange interpolation to design the oversampling component such that the design error of the overall frequency response is minimized with respect to a selectable error norm. However, the achievable quality strongly depends on the continuous-time resampling filters. Lagrange interpolators show severe deficiencies when used in this role. The present paper proposes a design objective for continuous time resampling filters that are specifically adapted for use with oversampling and the overall optimization scheme. ASRC systems utilizing these so-called optimized image band attenuation (OIB) resampling functions achieve significant quality improvements over existing approaches. Performance analyses show that this class of filters enables implementations with reduced complexity for a wide range of design specifications.

A procedure is presented for the selection of filters on distribution feeders that have distributed variable harmonic sources and variable loads and compensating capacitors, using worst-case analysis. The objective is to minimize the destructive effect of harmonics over a wide range of load conditions and capacitor settings. The genetic optimization algorithm was used to find the worst voltage harmonic distortion resulting from each filter selection. An example feeder is analyzed to display the advantage of the worst-case approach over conventional fixed load analysis

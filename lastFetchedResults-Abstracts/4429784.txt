We consider a single class wideband traffic (queueing) model: a wideband traffic stream characterized by offered load, peakedness, and a fixed bandwidth requirement is offered to a trunk group. Our objective is to derive a blocking estimate at the trunk group. A fundamental relationship between traffic peakedness and bandwidth requirement is uncovered, i.e., for a wideband traffic stream, there is a linear relationship between its peakedness and bandwidth requirement. In particular, for a Poisson arrival process, its peakedness is equal to its bandwidth requirement. The discovery of this relationship is a key result that leads to the solution of the problem

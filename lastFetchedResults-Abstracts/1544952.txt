In this paper, an evolutionary algorithm (EA)-based fuzzy proportional-derivative (PD)-type controller is employed to reservoir control of dams with the purpose of operating spillway gates during any flood of any magnitude, which is not predictable beforehand. EA is used to evolve the main parameters of the fuzzy PD controller. The use of the EA, in conjunction with a systematic neighborhood structure for the determining of fuzzy rule-base parameters, leads to a significant improvement in the performance of the controller. The major objective of the controller is to achieve better system performance over the conventional control methods. In order to demonstrate the high performance of the presented method, we simulate the control system using different probable inflow hydrographs of various magnitudes. The simulation results indicate that the EA-based fuzzy PD controller not only performs an accurate and efficient solution, but also exhibits more desirable and reliable results than the conventional approaches.

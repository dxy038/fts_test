Background: In neutron interaction with matter and reduction of neutron energy
due to multiple scatterings to the thermal energy range, increasing the probability of
thermal neutron capture by neutron captures makes dose enhancement in the tumors
loaded with these materials.
Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate dose distribution in the
presence of 10B, 157Gd and 33S neutron capturers and to determine the effect of these
materials on dose enhancement rate for 252Cf brachytherapy source.
Methods: Neutron-ray flux and energy spectra, neutron and gamma dose rates and
dose enhancement factor (DEF) are determined in the absence and presence of 10B, 157Gd and 33S using Monte Carlo simulation.
Results: The difference in the thermal neutron flux rate in the presence of 10B and 157Gd is significant, while the flux changes in the fast and epithermal energy ranges
are insensible. The dose enhancement factor has increased with increasing distance
from the source and reached its maximum amount equal to 258.3 and 476.1 cGy/h/Âµg
for 157Gd and 10B, respectively at about 8 cm distance from the source center. DEF for 33S is equal to one.
Conclusion: Results show that the magnitude of dose augmentation in tumors
containing 10B and 157Gd in brachytherapy with 252Cf source will depend not only
on the capture product dose level, but also on the tumor distance from the source.
33S makes dose enhancement under specific conditions that these conditions depend
on the neutron energy spectra of source, the 33S concentration in tumor and tumor
distance from the source.

This paper proposes a simulated annealing algorithm for multiobjective optimizations of electromagnetic devices to find the Pareto solutions in a relatively simple manner. The algorithm is based on the successful introductions of the Pareto set as well as the parameter and objective space strings. The new rank formula and fitness-sharing functions together with the stop criterion and other improvements are investigated in the proposed method. Two numerical examples for validating the robustness of the proposed method are also reported.

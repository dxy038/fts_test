A kinematic is presented that is fully parallel and actuator redundant. Actuator redundancy refers to the use of more actuators than are strictly necessary to control the mechanism without increasing the mobility. The uses of this form of redundancy include the ability to partially control the internal forces, increase the workspace, remove singularities, and augment the dexterity. Optimization takes place based on several objective functions. The kinematic dexterity, the forces present at the actuators, and the uniformity of the dexterity over the workspace are all investigated as potential objectives. Global measures are derived from each of these quantities for optimization purposes. Instead, optimization of several factors is done simultaneously by specifying a primary objective and minimum performance standards for the secondary measures

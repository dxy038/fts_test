Objective
Our purpose was to determine the long-term results after abdominal sacrocolpopexy.
Study design
Computer-coded procedure logs identified women who had an abdominal sacrocolpopexy performed from 1985 to 1992. Subjects answered a validated, condition-specific symptom questionnaire, a sexual function questionnaire, and a demographic survey. Failures were defined by reoperation or symptoms. The data were analyzed with use of the Student t test and the Fisher exact test.
Results
At the time of surgery the subjects (n = 38) had a mean age of 59.2 years (range 40-77 years), parity 4.03 (1-9), BMI 26.5 (18.6-40.2), and stage of prolapse 2.56 (0-4). The mean follow-up interval was 13.7 years (10-17 years). The total number of failures was 10 (26.3%), 4 (10.5%) because of reoperation and 6 (16%) because of symptoms. Symptom distress scores were low and similar between failures and successes. Twelve subjects were available for examination and most defects were noted in the anterior wall.
Conclusion
This long-term outcome analysis of abdominal sacrocolpopexy found the procedure to be durable with a 74% success rate at a mean follow-up of 13.7 years.

The objective of this paper is to address the design of an architecture for scientific applications utilizing sensor data. The proposed architecture models applications as services in a service-oriented architecture. This architecture is, mapped to a heterogeneous architecture that contains highperformance, data-driven components and SOA-style components, and a superimposed on a service architecture that provides dynamism.

This paper presents multi-objective optimization approach for determining optimal location of distributed generators in deregulated electricity market. Distributed generators optimal location have been obtained in a most suitable zone which has been identified based on the variation of real power flow sensitivity and real power loss sensitivity. The multi-objective function consist maximization of voltage improvement as well as minimization of line losses in the network. The pattern of voltage profile improvement, line loss reduction, and real power flows have been obtained for pool electricity market model. The proposed multi-objective optimization approach has been applied for IEEE 24 bus reliability test system.

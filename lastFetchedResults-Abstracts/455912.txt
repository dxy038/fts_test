Objective: To investigate the relationship of inflammation and endothelial activation with insulin resistance and adiposity in type 2 diabetes. Methods and results: Hundred and thirty-four (45 female) type 2 diabetic subjects aged 50â€“75 in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes Study in Helsinki were examined before fenofibrate intervention. Fasting levels of circulating intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) (vascular cell adhesion molecule), ultra-sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP), human serum amyloid A (hSAA), interleukin-6 (IL-6), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), secretory phospholipase A2 IIA (PLA2), total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, P-glucose, HbA1c, and serum free insulin were determined. Insulin resistance was assessed by the homeostasis model. HOMA IR correlated significantly with all measures of adiposity and markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. BMI was significantly associated with inflammation and endothelial activation, but with neither lipoproteins nor glycaemic control. After controlling for age, gender and BMI, HbA1c correlated significantly with CRP, hSAA, ICAM-1, E-selectin, and HOMA IR. HDL cholesterol correlated inversely with IL-6, M-CSF, E-selectin, and HOMA IR. HbA1c, phospholipase A2, VCAM-1, and HDL cholesterol remained independent determinants of HOMA IR in the linear regression analysis controlled for age, gender, and BMI. Conclusion: Endothelial activation and acute-phase reaction correlate with insulin resistance and obesity in type 2 diabetic patients.

This algorithm uses the idea of three-way radix quicksort to divided the population into three sections, Recursively sort the different sections until all the individuals have been classified and assigned the fitness value. The proposed algorithm is validated by 6 benchmark test problems. Compared with four other state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, TQIEA achieves competitive results in two quality indicators.

In this paper, a six-phase machine drive system fed by parallel converters is proposed. It is composed of two parallel three-phase to three-phase dc-link converters without isolation transformers. The proposed topology presents fault tolerance characteristics. The model of the system is derived, and it is shown that the reduction of circulating current is an important objective in the system design. Suitable control strategy of the system based on odq approach, is developed. Simulated and experimental results are presented.

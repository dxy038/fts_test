The status of modelling work focused on developing the advanced tokamak (AT) scenarios in DIII-D is discussed. The objective of the work is twofold: (a) to develop AT scenarios with ECCD using time dependent transport simulations, coupled with heating and current drive models, consistent with MHD equilibrium and stability; and (b) to use time dependent simulations to help plan experiments and to understand the key physics involved. Time dependent simulations based on transport coefficients derived from experimentally achieved target discharges are used to perform AT scenario modelling. The modelling indicates that off-axis ECCD with approximately 3 MW absorbed power can maintain high performance discharges with qmin > 1 for 5-10 s. The resultant equilibria are calculated to be stable to n = 1 pressure driven modes. The plasma is well into the second stability regime for high-n ballooning modes over a large part of the plasma volume. The role of continuous localized ECCD is studied for stabilizing m/n = 2/1 tearing modes. Progress towards validating current drive and transport models, consistent with experimental results, and developing self-consistent, integrated high performance AT scenarios is discussed.

The objective of our study was to assess the feasibility of dynamic susceptibility contrast MR technique after bolus injection of SPIO and Gd-DOTA in a tumor model implanted in rats. Tumors were subcutaneously implanted in 24 rats. A FLASH sequence and EPI were evaluated. Different doses of AMI 227 and Gd-DOTA were assessed. Mean signal intensity vs. time curves were plotted. Well-shaped curves of the first pass of the contrast agent were only obtained with Gd-DOTA. According to these results it appears difficult to assess tumor blood volume with USPIO dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging.

Material and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Surgical "A" unit, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar from January 2003 to December 2003. A total of 92 patients were studied. The patients were admitted through emergency or OPD with one or other mode of presentation of the abdominal tuberculosis or with complications arising from it.Results: Out of 92 patients studied during the specified period, 60 were female patients. Sixty-five patients were below the age of 30 years. Intestinal obstruction (45.60%), abdominal mass (27%), and peritonitis (19.5%) were the common modes of presentation. Per-operatively ileo-caecal mass was found in 25%; strictures alone in 21.74%; stricture with perforation in 19.56% and ascites in 10.86% cases. Operative procedures performed were; adhesiolysis (27%), right hemicolectomy (19.50%), ileostomy (19.50%), ileotransverse bypass (16.30%) and local resection with end to end anastomosis (13%).Postoperative complications included wound infection (24%), cholestatic jaundice (4.34%) and septicemia in 2.2%> patients. There was one death (1.1%).Conclusion: Due to a wide variety of nonspecijic presenting symptoms and signs, abdominal tuberculosis is diagnosed late leading to delay in management and more complications.

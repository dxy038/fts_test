In vitro experiments used to investigate the three-dimensional kinetics of the intact, normal ligamentous human lumbar spine and the changes due to injuries are described. A major objective was to assess the extent of injury and the necessity for surgery. The analysis of the data is described, and the results are discussed. The utility of the method is assessed and compared with that of in vivo studies. The experimental technique has enabled the injury types that are likely to induce spinal instability to be identified.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Objective: To clarify the effect of prolonged feeding of a high-fat and sucrose, and to clarify the effect
of sucrose instead of other carbohydrate on obesity and immunity in C57BL/6J mice. Methods: We investigated
the development of obesity and immune cell function in four groups of mice fed high-fat, high-fat plus highsucrose,
high-sucrose, and control diet for 7 months. Results: Mice fed high-fat and high-fat plus high-sucrose
groups developed severe obesity. Body weight, adipose tissue weight, serum leptin, blood glucose, and insulin
were significantly higher, while the level of serum soluble leptin receptor was significantly lower in mice fed
high-fat and high-fat plus high-sucrose diets than in mice fed the control or high-sucrose diets. Splenocyte
proliferation stimulated by T-cell mitogen (PHA, ConA, and anti-CD 3 antibody) and B-cell mitogen (LPS) was
significantly lower in both obese, high-fat and high-fat plus high-sucrose groups than in control and high-sucrose
groups. However, these parameters did not differ between high-fat and high-fat plus high-sucrose groups.
Conclusions: Long-term feeding of high-fat diet and high-fat plus high-sucrose diet similarly induced severe
obesity in C57BL/6J mice. Not only T-cell, but also B-cell function may be impaired in mice made severely
obese by the high-fat or high-fat plus high-sucrose diets.

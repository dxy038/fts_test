This paper describes a technique for mapping objects such as insects and plants in the field on a blank map in mobile learning. We propose map creating system that utilizes man´s subjective geographic recognition in addition to a GPS. With the help of man´s ability of recognizing placement of objects and geographical relations between objects, objective geographic information with small error given by a GPS is effectively compensated.

Realism means that moral value and necessity are something real and we should discover them,not invent them. Here the idea of realism considers the origin of ethics as non-empirical, rational, and metaphysical.
Applied ethics means using moral principles and standards in certain cases. Therefore, the value of moral judgment is investigated in meta-ethics, and value standards of moral judgment by normative ethics. The most important question in applied ethics is interference. Interference refers to the lack of harmony between two binding judgements having the criteria in compliance due to the inability of the one who has the responsibility to excute them simultaneously. 
Realism is related to interference moral  in some aspects, such as the existence of instances of interference, the possibility of providing a solution, and dependence of correct criterion for solving the cases of interference on realism. The objective criterion means that every act which is most influential concerning its nearness to God takes priority. According to non-realism, first,no interference can occur and, second, in case  the idea of interference is accepted, it is not possible to provide a solution.

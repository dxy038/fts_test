A decentralised approach to control the risk in a transportation network where dangerous goods may be transported is presented. The approach is based on a graph representation of the territory where each vertex represents a sub-region of a defined extension, and links represents the dangerous goods flow from a sub-region to another. The mathematical model of the system is presented according to a quadratic objective function, a linear state equation, and other linear constraints. The model is then decomposed in a series of sub-problems according to a classical dual decomposition approach related to convex optimization. A simple example is reported as case study.

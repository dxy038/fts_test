RFID network planning involves many objectives and constraints and it belongs to the class of NP-hard problems. Such problems were recently successfully tackled by nondeterministic optimization metaheuristics where swarm intelligence represents a prominent branch. We present improved firefly algorithm adjusted for multi-objective RFID network planning where our proposed algorithm improved results considering all relevant performance measures tested on the same benchmark functions and compared to the previously known results from the literature.

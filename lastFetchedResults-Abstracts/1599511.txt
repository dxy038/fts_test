The objective of this paper is to systematically study the qualitative behavior of solutions of the nonlinear delay population model x ( n + 1 ) = x ( n ) exp ( − p ( n ) + q ( n ) r + x m ( n − ω ) ) , n = 0 , 1 , … , where p ( n ) and q ( n ) are positive periodic sequences of period ω , m , and ω are positive integers and ω &gt; 1 . First, by using the continuation theorem in conincidence degree theory, we establish a sufficient condition for the existence of a positive ω -periodic solution x ¯ ( n ) with strictly positive components. Second, we establish some sufficient conditions for oscillation of the positive solutions about a periodic solution. Finally, we give an estimation of the lower and upper bounds of the oscillatory solutions and establish some sufficient conditions for the global attractivity of { x ¯ ( n ) } . Some illustrative examples are included to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the results.

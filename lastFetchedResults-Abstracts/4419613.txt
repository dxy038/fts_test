An intelligent control scheme for a twin rotor multi-input multi-output system (TRMS) is proposed in this paper. The control objective is to make the TRMS move accurately and quickly to the predefined attitudes including the azimuth angle and the pitch angle in decoupled and cross-coupled conditions. The control scheme uses PID control and a self-organizing cerebellar model articulation controller (SOCM). The SOCM is based on a simple addressing CMAC with tunable layer number and is used to compensate for PID control. Simulations show that the proposed control scheme can improve the attitude tracking performance.

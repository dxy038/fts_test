This paper proposes optical path accommodation design algorithms for both the wavelength path (WP) and virtual wavelength path (VWP) schemes with or without failure restoration. The optical path (OP) employs WDM/FDM (wavelength/frequency division multiplexing) and wavelength routing in the path layer of the transport network. The proposed algorithms adopt some heuristic approaches to the algorithmic complexity caused by the NP-completeness of the wavelength assignment problem. The objective function is taken as minimizing the average total number optical path cross-connect (OPXC) ports, in other words, OPXC system scale. Utilizing the developed algorithms, extensive simulations quantitatively evaluate the OPXC system scale requirements of a large scale network whose physical topology and path demand distribution pattern are arbitrary. The simulations reveal the basic difference between the WP and VWP schemes

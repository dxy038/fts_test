In this paper, we propose a framework for efficient discovery of OWL-S based Web services. We use proactive push model approach for providing service notifications to service requesters over Web Service registry. We discuss the applicability of publish/subscribe paradigm within the current requester/provider model of semantic Web service discovery. Our objective is to reduce the searching over UDDI by different service requesters having same requests and also by repeated service requesters having same requests again and again in search of newly published and updated advertisements. Our proposed approach is effectively useful in Autonomous Semantic Grid where software agents require Web services instantaneously to accomplish their goals.

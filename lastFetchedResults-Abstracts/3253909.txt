We would like to take this opportunity to welcome you to the second international workshop on Software Engineering Challenges for the Smart Grid (SE4SG 2013). The workshop focuses on understanding and identifying the unique challenges and opportunities for Software Engineering (SE) to contribute to and enhance the design and development of the smart grid. In smart grids, the geographical scale, requirements on real-time performance and reliability, and diversity of application functionality all combine to produce a highly demanding problem domain for software engineers to address. The objective of this workshop is to bring together members of the software engineering community and the power engineering community to understand these requirements and determine the most appropriate software engineering tools, methods and techniques.

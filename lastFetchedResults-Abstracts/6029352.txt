This paper presents one of the OPF methodologies that allow performing scheduling and market auctioning simultaneously. The problem uses a non-linear model of electrical network, which allows taking into account voltage constraints, injections of reactive power and line current constraints. Consideration is also given to integral generation output constraints, ramp rate, and reserve constraints. Transformer taps and reactive power sources are scheduled to resolve congestion management issues and to minimize power losses. The proposed algorithm is based on an interior-point method. There are two forms of objective functions provided: one is for constant and another one is for elastic power consumption. These problems can be solved with variable dispatch intervals during planning period. There were several techniques developed to increase computational performance of the discussed algorithm. The proposed methodology is implemented in the form of ldquoLincorWinrdquo software, which is used by the System Operator to solve the problems of daily scheduling and nodal price analysis for a model with more than 6,500 nodes. This paper also includes a discussion of several possible applications of the methodology for the real-time scheduling and balancing market issues.

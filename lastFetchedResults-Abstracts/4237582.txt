Development of distribution systems lead in higher system losses and poor voltage regulation. Consequently, an efficient and effective distribution system has become more urgent and crucial. Hence, number, location and capacity of distributed generation can be optimized using evolutionary algorithm. This paper uses a hybrid optimization method based on discrete particle swarm optimization and imperialist competitive algorithm with the objective to minimize the overall cost of annual energy losses and depreciation on the cost of distributed generation in order to improve productivity. Furthermore, the Backward-Forward sweep iterative method was adopted to solve the radial load flow analysis. Simulations are carried out on 69-bus radial distribution network using Hybrid PSO approaches in order to show the accuracy as well as the efficiency of the proposed solution technique.

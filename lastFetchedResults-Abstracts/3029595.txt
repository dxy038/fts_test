The main objective of this work is to report the development of a computerized biofeedback system as well as several results of its application. Although conceived mainly for electromyogram-biofeedback (EMG-biofeedback), and for use in physiotherapeutic applications, the system is flexible enough to be used with any physiological variable and application. Developed as a part of an existing digital polygraph, biofeedback classes contemplates many different biofeedback methods, such as visual and sound feedback tools. Object oriented paradigm was employed to implement this system, which is being used to train patients with facial palsy to improve facial muscle contraction and asthmatic children to improve inspiration using mainly the diaphragm muscle. Results obtained show that both patients and health professionals find the system easy and pleasant to work with.

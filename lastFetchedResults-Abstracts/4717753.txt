The primary objective of Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) is to control the data usage by authorized users. Traditional control mechanisms are mostly implemented based on security domains and deploy strict polices on actions spanning different domains which will decrease the usability and flexibility of the system. The Chinese Wall Policy combines discretionary and mandatory aspects of access control so that it is a good choice for DLP. This paper extends the traditional conflict and alliance relationship and presents an efficient framework ACWF. The ACWF maintains dynamic relationship between different data objects and provides reference mechanism to confine the corresponding usage domain. We present an applicable scenario analysis and implement a secure removable storage device based on ACWF. The results show the efficiency of ACWF in DLP application.

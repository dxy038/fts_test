In stereo video communication over the Internet, video quality is always not guaranteed since packets losses always occur. The loss of packets may result in the loss of a whole right video frame. To deal with such a case, an error concealment algorithm for whole-right-frame losses in stereo video, which is based on relativity analysis, is proposed in this paper. It chooses different information to conceal a lost right frame according to relativity analysis. Experiments results show that the proposed method can effectively restore the lost right frame, in both good objective and subjective quality

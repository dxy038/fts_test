When determining the weights of the factor influencing the cluster system load balancing, judgments are inevitably somehow subjective, which will affect the results of decision making. Reducing the influence on weights from subjective factors as much as possible is very important for load balancing. This paper introduces the group decision theory based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and constructs load balancing model based on the group AHP. The dynamic weights of each expert can be obtained by analyzing the similarity of judgment matrixes experts offer, and then we can get the objective and representative polymerization decisive opinions which enhance the reliability of the decision-making results. The experiments in the paper prove the validity of the method which is simple and easy to implement.

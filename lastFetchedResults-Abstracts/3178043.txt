SAR satellite has pulse compression gain through the process including range and azimuth. Efficient jammers against the SAR satellite with simulated elements were evaluated in the view of power and SAR image. In this paper, J/S is analyzed for SAR with RF propagation equation firstly. Several jamming signals against SAR signal were added into SAR image through pulse compression process. Objective jamming performance of the signals was evaluated using euclidean distance.

A custom genetic algorithm was developed and implemented to solve multiple objective multi-state reliability optimization design problems. Many real-world engineering design problems are multi-objective in nature, and among those, several of them have various levels of system performance ranging from perfectly functioning to completely failed. This multi-objective genetic algorithm uses the universal moment generating function approach to evaluate the different reliability or availability indices of the system. The components are characterized by having different performance levels, cost, weight, and reliability. The solution to the multi-objective multi-state problem is a set of solutions, known as the Pareto-front, from which the analyst may choose one solution for system implementation. Two illustrative examples are presented to show the performance of the algorithm; and the multi-objective formulation considered for both of them is the maximization of system availability, and the minimization of both system cost, and weight.

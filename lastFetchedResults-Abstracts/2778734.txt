In this paper, we propose robust power allocation and admission control schemes for providing probabilistically constrained quality of service (QoS) in selective relaying based decode-and-forward (DF) cooperative cellular systems. The proposed schemes are robust against imperfect channel state information (CSI) in slow fading while optimizing the total uplink transmit power in these cooperative wireless networks. At first, we derive novel closed-form solutions for the optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize total uplink transmit power while meeting the probabilistic QoS guarantees for a given number of admitted users. This is achieved by approximating the probabilistic optimization problem into a convex deterministic form and then by deriving closed form analytical solutions for power allocation using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The closed-form property of these solutions allows us later to develop a very low-complexity suboptimal algorithm for joint admission control and power allocation in presence of imperfect CSI and selective relaying. We also conduct comprehensive simulation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes and to highlight the benefits gained from considering channel estimation errors in resource allocation for cooperative cellular systems.

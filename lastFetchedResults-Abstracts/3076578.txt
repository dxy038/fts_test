In this paper, a new design approach and measured results of a novel, wideband, bidirectional, bandpass distributed amplifier are presented. A prototype bandpass distributed amplifier in the band ranging from 842 MHz to 3.17 GHz has been designed and measured. The distributed amplifier has a nearly constant gain, linear phase response, and acceptable return losses in the passband. The amplifier topology is suitable for monolithic implementation.

Introduction: Clearly, there are some challenges and difficulties
in fulfilling social accountability which should be identified and
dealt with in order to reach the ultimate goal. The main objective
of this study was to identify the challenges associated with social
accountability.
Methods: In this qualitative study, focus groups and in-depth
semi-structured interview were used to obtain the opinions and
experiences of 35 people with 4 focus groups of students, faculty
members, patients and their companions in Jahrom University of
Medical Sciences. Purpose-based sampling was performed. The
participants asked “What is social accountability?” And then
it continued with the more specific question, i.e. “What factors
increase or decrease social accountability?” After identifying the
categories and sub-categories, conventional content analysis was
used to analyze the data.
Results: Overall, 97 codes were extracted from the text and five
main categories were revealed: notification, sense of responsibility,
practical education, and professional status and ethics.
Conclusion: Since there are numerous challenges in the field of
social accountability, it is essential that we understand the challenges
and barriers and take effective steps to implement reforms.

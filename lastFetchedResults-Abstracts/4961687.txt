This paper propose a multi-objective optimization algorithm to optimize the motion path of space manipulator with multi-objective function. In this formulation, Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) is used to minimize the multi-objective function. The planning procedure is performed in joint space and with respect to all constraints, such as joint angle constraints, joint velocity constraints, torque constraints.We use a MOGA to search the optimal joint inter-knot parameters in order to realize the optimal motion trajectory for space manipulator. These joint inter-knot parameters mainly include joint angle and joint angular velocities. The simulation results test that the proposed multi-objective genetic algorithm has satisfactory performance.

Wavelength assignment has become an important issue in SONET/WDM ring design with the application of optical add-drop multiplexers in optical networks. Among wavelength assignment methods, circle construction for all-to-all uniform traffic is of great importance because these circles can be used for wavelength assignment under non-uniform traffic conditions. In this paper, we propose a matrix based circle construction algorithm for all-to-all uniform traffic in a bidirectional SONET/WDM ring. This algorithm divides all-to-all uniform traffic into a group of full circles and so results in an efficient wavelength assignment.

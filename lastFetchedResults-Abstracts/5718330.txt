Spectral modeling properties of seven selected all-pole modeling methods were compared by using both objective and subjective tests. Model behavior was evaluated with vowel sounds corrupted by uncorrelated Gaussian and Laplacian background noise. Objective tests were computed with the logarithmic spectral differences (SD<sub>2</sub>) and subjective speech quality was assessed with the degradation category rating (DCR) listening test. In both tests, the WLPC method, where the weighting function was the short time energy of the speech signal, gave the best results. The correlation between the objective and subjective results was found to be remarkably strong

Background: It has been shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to
deleterious effects on a range of sperm parameters. Vitamins E and C are capable of
reducing ROS levels and lipid peroxidation.
Objective: The aim of study was to determine the level of lipid peroxidation as
indicated by Malondialdehyde (MDA) and vitamins E and C in sperm and seminal
plasma of asthenoteratozoospermic and normozoospermic men and their relationships
with semen parameters.
Materials and Methods: Forty men with normozoospermic and 60 infertile men with
asthenoteratozoospermic semen profiles were randomly selected. Semen analysis was
done according to the WHO standard. Sex hormonal profiles were measured by ELISA
methods. The level of vitamins (C and E) and MDA were measured by HPLC and
tiobarbiotic acid, respectively.
Results: MDA concentration in the spermatozoa (0.1±0.06 nmol/ml) and seminal
plasma (1.9±0.35 nmol/ml) of asthenoteratozoospermic were significantly higher than
in normozoospermic males (p < 0.001).The level of vitamins E and C in seminal plasma
of normozoospermic were significantly higher than in asthenoteratozoospermic males
(p < 0.01). However, the amount of vitamin C in the spermatozoa of normozoospermic
was significantly less than in asthenoteratozoospermic males (p < 0.01). Sensitivity,
specificity, positive and negative prognostic value of MDA of seminal plasma and
spermatozoa were more than vitamins C and E. The level of vitamin C of spermatozoa
had more diagnostic value when compare to vitamins C and E in seminal plasma.
Conclusion: The level of MDA in seminal plasma and spermatozoa and vitamin C in
spermatozoa may be a diagnostic tool for etiology of infertility in the
asthenoteratozoospermic patients.

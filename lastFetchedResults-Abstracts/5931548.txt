Skin capillaries may be imaged using video-microscopy for the purpose of studying blood micro-circulation in patients with diabetes and various connective tissue diseases. Nailfold capillaries have been classified according to a taxonomy based on the following descriptive classes: cuticulis, open, tortuous, crossed, bushy and bizarre. They may be modified in disease and have an anomalous width (enlarged, giant) or length (elongated). An automated software system has been produced to classify capillaries and has achieved more objective and consistent results than a panel of clinicians

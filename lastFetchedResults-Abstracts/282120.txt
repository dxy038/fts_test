The objective of this study was to examine the behavioural correlates of perfectionism in a real world achievement task and to assess whether perfectionism is associated with self regulation strategies, attributions, and behaviour that is self-defeating. We also examined the predictive validity of the distinction between adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism on our dependent measures. A total of 198 students completed questionnaires about perfectionism, their standards, attributions, and behaviours at two time points; one week before their mid-term exam, and one week after receiving their grades. Data were analyzed with a combination of correlational and between group statistics. Overall, individuals high in perfectionism set a higher standard for the exam, were more likely to fall short of their goals, and experienced more negative affect about the exam, whether they had met their goal or not. There were some important differences between adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism; adaptive perfectionism was associated with fewer negative consequences for this achievement situation. Over time, the behaviours and cognitive-emotional responses related to perfectionism could lead to significant distress and this research suggests an important potential pathway from perfectionism to psychopathology.

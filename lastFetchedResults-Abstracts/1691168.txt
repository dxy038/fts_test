Inroduction & Objective: Almost any type of stress, whether physical or neurogenic, causes an immediate and marked increase in ACTH secretion and adrenocortical secretion of cortisol. Probiotics can be effective in reducing the harmful effects of stress are inspired. This study aimed to assess the effect of Lactobacillus casei strain TD2, native iranian probiotic on adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion in male wistar rats under chronic restraint stress condition.
Materials and Methods For this study, 40 male Wistar rats were selected the same age and approximate weight (110-130 gr). After a 2-week adaptation period, the rats were divided into four groups of ten, including two control groups and two trial groups randomly. The negative control group were gavage for 21 days with 1 ml phosphate buffer at neutral pH. Positive control group in addition to a daily gavage buffer, were placed for 15 minutes each day for chronic restraint stress on restrainer. First trial group was received per day of probiotic Lactobacillus casei TD2, while the second trial group in addition to probiotics, stress was received. After the test period, rats were anesthetized with ether and blood was taken by heart. By separating the plasma ACTH levels in the blood were measured using kits.
Results: The results of this test and comparing positive and negative controls showed that during stress, hormone levels significantly increased treatment 2 It also became clear that receiving probiotics in second trial group caused a significant decrease in hormone concentration compared to the positive control.
Conclusions: The results of this test indicate that the probiotic can reduce the negative effects of chronic stress and reduce ACTH hormone levels of blood significantly.

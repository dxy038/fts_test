The paper describes the development, design and costs of the London Electricity BoardÂ´s supply system since nationalisation. Information is given on the pattern of demand and load densities. Methods and aims in use since nationalisation and before are reviewed against the objective of a specific code of reliability as well as a prospective fourfold increase in future consumer demands. Alternative methods of supply have been examined alongside the experience of one in increasing use over the past 30 years. Reasons are given for the adoption, for the future, of designs based on present practices. Explanations are given for such modifications as are seen necessary for meeting, with long-term economy, the demands now in prospect.

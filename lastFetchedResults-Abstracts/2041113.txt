The modelling and simulation of ice nucleation triggered by acoustic cavitation was addressed in this study. The objective was to evaluate the number of nuclei generated by a single gas bubble and afterwards by a multi-bubble system as function of the acoustic pressure (ultrasound wave amplitude) and supercooling level (liquid temperature). According to our calculations, the nucleation could be initiated with moderated acoustic pressure amplitude (around one bar) even at low supercooling levels (around few degrees). These results may provide a sound basis for the control of ice crystal size and morphology which is a key issue in industrial freezing and freeze-drying processes.

Recent advances in computer vision technology and the falling prices of related devices has extended the use of video/CCTV by making it practical to automatically identify vehicles visually either online or off-line. The objective of the research is to develop a computer-vision based automatic vehicle identification system to achieve vehicle identification using optical character recognition (OCR) techniques. The work involves investigations into real-time automatic number-plate recognition and its extension to other aspects of road traffic monitoring and control

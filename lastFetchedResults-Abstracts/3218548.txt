This paper applies a computationally efficient simulation-based optimization (SO) algorithm suitable for large-scale transportation problems. The algorithm is based on a metamodel approach. The metamodel combines information from a high-resolution yet inefficient microscopic urban traffic simulator with information from a scalable and tractable analytical macroscopic traffic model. We then embed the model within a derivative-free trust region algorithm. We evaluate its performance considering tight computational budgets. We illustrate the efficiency of this algorithm by addressing an urban traffic signal control problem for the full city of Lausanne, Switzerland. The problem consists of a nonlinear objective function with nonlinear constraints. The problem addressed is considered large-scale and complex both in the fields of derivative-free optimization and simulation-based optimization. We compare the performance of the method to a traditional metamodel method.

This article describes the efforts undertaken at the School of Aerospace Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology for the development of a low-cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) test-bed for educational purposes. The objective of this test-bed is to provide an avenue for the involvement of undergraduate students (primarily) and graduate students (secondarily) in UAV research. The complete design and development of all hardware interfaces of the UAV platform including the on-board autopilot is presented. Based on flight test data a linear model has been developed for the lateral and longitudinal dynamics.

In recent years, urban development and industrialization have caused the accumulation of heavy metals in soil. Pollution of soils signi?cantly reduces the environmental quality and affects the human health. Using chemical methods to evaluate soil pollution is both difficult and time consuming. In many recent studies, magnetic susceptibility measurements have been employed for pollution monitoring as a non-destructive and fast technique. The objective of this research was to determine the spatial variability of magnetic susceptibility and the concentration of selected heavy metals and the effect of land use on their variations in surface soils of the Isfahan region. A total of 158 composite surface soil samples (0-5 cm) were taken from an area of about 700 km2. Magnetic susceptibility was measured at 
low frequency (0.46 kHz) using a Bartington MS2 dual frequency sensor. The concentration of total lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) were measured in all the soil samples. The spatial variability of these variables was examined by kriging. No significant difference was found between uncultivated and agricultural lands. The concentration of Cu, Zn and Pb are positively correlated with magnetic susceptibility (?lf). It appears that the major factor controlling the enhancement of magnetic susceptibility in the study area is anthropogenic activities. It appears that the concentration of Pb, Cu and Zn has been affected by anthropogenic sources such as traffic emissions and industrial activities. The results also suggest that magnetic methods could be used to estimate the heavy metal contamination from anthropogenic sources in soils.

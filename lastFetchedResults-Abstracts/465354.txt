OBJECTIVE: This report describes a technique for total colpocleisis performed on women with posthysterectomy vaginal eversion and presents the outcome of this surgery.
STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-three women, aged 51 to 94 years (78.1 ± 8.8, average ± SD) with vaginal eversion were treated with total colpocleisis. Twenty-four women had previously undergone a total of 40 operations for prolapse, and many had a massive prolapse with scarring and ulceration. Five women had stress incontinence, and an additional 12 had poor urethral support without stress incontinence. In association with colpocleisis, 14 had suburethral plication of the endopelvic fascia; two, needle suspensions; and one, a pubovaginal sling. Three had a perineorrhaphy.
RESULTS: Operations lasted from 30 to 205 minutes (101 ± 33.4, average ± SD), and the estimated blood loss ranged from 20 to 750 ml (206 ± 171, average ± SD). No operative complications occurred. Postoperatively, congestive heart failure developed in two women and one had pneumonia; all illnesses resolved with appropriate therapy. There were no complications at the operative site. Average follow-up was 35 (±48) months. All women were initially cured of the vaginal eversion. Recurrent eversion developed in one woman 1 year after surgery and was successfully treated with repeat colpocleisis. Of five women with preoperative stress incontinence, four were cured and one lost to follow-up. No new stress incontinence occurred.
CONCLUSION: Total colpocleisis is an effective operation for the treatment of vaginal eversion in selected situations. When defective urethral support is corrected at the time of the operation, postoperative incontinence is not usually a problem. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;176:1228-35.)

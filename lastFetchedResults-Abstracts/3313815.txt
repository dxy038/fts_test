Objective: To evaluate the results of <sup>99</sup>Tc<sup>m</sup>-sistamibi scintigraphy of patients with suspected primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Methods: The results of <sup>99</sup>Tc<sup>m</sup>-sistamibi scintigraphy and initial parathyroid hormone (PTH) measurement in 198 patients with suspicious PHPT were retrospectively analyzed. 198 patients with clinical suspicion of PHPT underwent <sup>99</sup>Tc<sup>m</sup>-sistamibi scintigraphy and measured PTH. Ninety patients underwent surgery. The postoperative pathology was used as the gold standard for PHPT. The sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, accuracies of <sup>99</sup>Tc<sup>m</sup>-sistamibi scintigraphy, <sup>99</sup>Tc<sup>m</sup>-sistamibi scintigraphy combined with dynamic monitoring of PTH measurement were compared and evaluated. Results: The sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, accuracies of <sup>99</sup>Tc<sup>m</sup>-sistamibi scintigraphy and <sup>99</sup>Tc<sup>m</sup>-sistamibi scintigraphy combined with dynamic monitoring PTH measurement was 80%, 94.29%; 65%, 35%; 88.89%,88.61%; 48.15%,63.64%; 77.78%,81.11%, respectively. Conclusion: Detection of <sup>99</sup>Tc<sup>m</sup>-sistamibi scintigraphy combined with dynamic monitoring PTH measurement can increase the diagnostic accuracy and decrease the rate of missed diagnosis.

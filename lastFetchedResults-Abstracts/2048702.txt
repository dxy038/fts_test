Abstract:
Objective: This study aimed to investigate the role of perceived social support in predicting psychological disorders in people with mobility impairment and its comparison with normal subjects.
Materials & Methods: In This causal comparative study, 49 subjects were chosen among all people with mobility impairment by random sampling and 50 subjects among ordinary people by available sampling. Data were gathered with Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Multidimensional Scale for Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and were analyzed by chi-square, ANOVA and multivariate regression.
Results: Results showed that there are significant differences between mobility impaired and normal subjects with respect to their stress (P<0.05), anxiety, depression and significant others social support (P<0.01). There are relationships between the stress of mobility impaired persons and their perceived social support of friends and significant others; between the depression of mobility impaired persons and their perceived social support of friends, family, significant others and their total social support; and between the anxiety of mobility impaired persons and their perceived social support of friends, family and significant others (P<0.05). Regression analysis showed that models about the prediction of stress, depression and anxiety based on perceived social support were significant for people with mobility impairment and normal subjects (P<0.01).
Conclusion: These results have amplifications about the prevention of social and psychological dysfunctions and are usable in rehabilitation for people with mobility impairment.

Objective
ytic activity is increased in conditioned media from human gingival and pulp fibroblasts in response to exposure to triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA). The purpose of this study was to determine if this conditioned media with hydrolytic activity could cause the biodegradation of a dental resin material.
s
material specimens were stored for 30 days at 37 Â°C in distilled water, unconditioned media, artificial serum, conditioned media from human gingival and pulp fibroblasts and conditioned media from human pulp and gingival fibroblasts that were exposed to TEGDMA. The media was exchanged every other day. The specimens were subjected to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) before and after storage. The area under the carbonyl peak was calculated for all the specimens to determine the extent of the degradation.
s
ences before and after storage in the area under the carbonyl peak were statistically significant for the specimens stored in the conditioned media from the fibroblasts that were exposed to TEGDMA. All of the other specimens did not produce differences in the area under the carbonyl peak that were statistically significant when comparing the before and after storage results.
icance
odegradation demonstrated here could contribute to the marginal leaking seen clinically with the use of resin materials in dental restorations.

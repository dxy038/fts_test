Writing effective and efficient exams is a crucial component of the teaching and learning process. Exams are a common approach to assess student learning and the results are useful in a variety of ways. Most often, results are used to provide students with feedback on what they have learnt or to evaluate the instructional effectiveness of a course. Certainty-Based Marking (CBM) scores an objective test (usually done on a computer) in a way that rewards students for identifying and distinguishing between individual answers being reliable or unreliable. It penalizes confident errors and rewards a thoughtful and realistic judgment by the student on the basis of limitations of his/her knowledge.

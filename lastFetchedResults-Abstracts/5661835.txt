We introduce a novel power allocation and scheduling scheme in a DS-CDMA (direct sequence-code division multiple access) wireless communication system with real-time connections. Generally in a CDMA system all users share the same bandwidth which makes the system, interference limited. Because of this nature of such a system, power control is crucial especially in the uplink. Traditionally, for real-time traffic power control is aimed to have equal received powers at the base station to overcome the near-far effect. We relax this design objective and explore a different power allocation and scheduling scheme to achieve maximum total throughput in the system. We formulate the optimization problem which achieves the optimum power allocation and scheduling scheme, and then reduce the optimization problem to a linear programming problem and solve it. We use our results to discuss and compare our novel scheme with the traditional perfect power controlled CDMA systems, to show that the introduced scheme outperforms traditional perfect power controlled CDMA.

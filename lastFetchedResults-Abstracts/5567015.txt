Summary form only given. Among the different structures envisaged for a high capacity Pan European Network, a partitioned approach seeks to partition the network into "WDM islands", where traffic is carried by many 2.5 or 10 Gbit/s systems, interconnected by trunks where one or few WDM channels operate in OTDM at higher bit rates. In order to directly connect the high speed OTDM links to the WDM islands, an high throughput all optical transmultiplexer, i.e. a bidirectional interface between OTDM and WDM data streams and vice-versa, is required. This interface, besides handling signals suitable for long haul transmission can perform wavelength adaptation or exchange between neighbouring areas, broadcasting and signal regeneration.

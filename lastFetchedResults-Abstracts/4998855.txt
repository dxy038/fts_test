With the advent of wireless transceiver reconfigurability, a need has been felt to take profit of digital signal processing tools, this way increasing RF circuitsÂ´ complexity and heterogeneity. Having this objective in mind, this paper presents an analytical formulation and a novel numerical method for simulating, in a very efficient way, strongly nonlinear heterogeneous RF circuits running in three different time-scales. In order to reduce the computational workload, a new multi-line double multi-rate shooting technique is proposed to operate within a multi-dimensional warped time framework. Obtained results of an illustrative circuit, reveal significant advantages in speed over previous methods recently proposed for the simulation of the same category of circuits.

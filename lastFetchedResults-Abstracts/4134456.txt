The need to correct view- and sun-angle-dependent intensity gradients in aerial and satellite images is well established, with bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) kernel-based techniques receiving much of the recent attention in the literature. In these methods, a plausible (physical or empirical) model of the BRDF is fitted to the data and then used to normalize the image to standard solar and view angles. As yet, very little attention has been paid to the case where the images are hyperspectral (i.e., there are many contiguous bands captured simultaneously), beyond using known techniques on each band. This can lead to loss of spectral integrity and poor agreement on overlapping regions unless careful attention is paid to these factors. In this paper, a range of techniques that can be employed for the purpose of hyperspectral mosaicking is presented.

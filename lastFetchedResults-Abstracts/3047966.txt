This work presents a path-tracking hybrid controller for articulated vehicles. It is based on the approximation of the desired path with lines and arcs: suitable controllers are designed for tracking each line and arc and the control objective is attained by switching among the different controllers. Each controller is designed using partial linearization methods and variable structure control theory. The proposed control approach allows the driving point to track any desired path, starting from the set of feasible vehicle configurations, both in forward and backward motion, as confirmed by simulation.

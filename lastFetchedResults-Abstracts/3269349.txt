This paper presents the modeling and analysis of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation systems penetrating into low voltage distribution feeders. The solar PV module is modeled as a constant PQ generation source and incorporated within an unbalanced distribution feeder. Furthermore, a distribution optimal power flow (DOPF) model is developed that includes the PV module and examines feeder operation from the perspective of the Local Distribution Company (LDC). Objective functions such as minimization of total energy drawn from the substation and minimization of total losses are considered. A realistic feeder system of Hydro One Inc. is used for the studies for various penetration levels of PV resources. Results show that total losses and total energy drawn from the substation is reduced with increased penetration of solar PV resources. However, this is accompanied with an increase in reactive power drawn from the external grid.

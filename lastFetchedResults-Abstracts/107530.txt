In the surveillance of multiple targets by mobile sensor agents (MSAs), system performance relies greatly on the motion-control strategy of the MSAs. This paper investigates the motion-planning problem for a limited resource of M MSAs in an environment of N targets (M< developed. is approach motion-planning online cooperative a case, multi-MSA-multitarget the For points. target of sequence traverse to agent mobile for path loop suboptimal generate proposed then algorithm gradient-approximation A targets. time-optimal find as so interpreted further problem MSA, single case In target. each observations consecutive two between duration time average minimize objective whose optimization an formulated time, over degrades information track that fact on Based radius. turning bounded with speed constant at moving mass point modeled MSA kinematics

The objective of this paper is to accomplish the modeling and coupling effect analysis of a high-speed aircraft. A 2D model of the high-speed aircraft is assumed. The description of the aerodynamic characteristics including forces and moments system models is included in this paper. The analysis and policies of decoupling are put forward based on the data of the high-speed aircraft. Results show that optimization of airframe aerodynamics and control strategy can reduce the effect of coupling. This can be helpful for hypersonic flight control design concepts.

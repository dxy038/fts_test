Computer simulation of such kind phenomena raises interest to the development of high-speed numerical techniques for solving appropriate problems that can be considered as scattering of fields radiated by transient sources. The objective of this work is to investigate fields near perfectly conducting voluminous objects, located near the grounded plane. These objects can be excited either by feeding coaxial line or by currents, flowing in the gap between the body and plane. This kind of problem can be described as a scattering problem with the given excitation. Appropriate mathematical problem consists of solution of the magnetic field integral equation in the time domain

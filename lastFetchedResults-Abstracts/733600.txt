Objective
Smoking increases the risk for influenza and pneumococcal disease, but vaccination uptake is lower among smokers than non-smokers. We therefore aimed to determine reasons for not complying with vaccination among smokers and non-smokers.
Method

In 2005 a self-administered questionnaire was sent to a random sample of Dutch patients (n = 4,000) assessing medical, social and behavioural determinants. Independent factors associated with not complying with influenza and pneumococcal vaccination among smokers and non-smokers were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis.
Results

In all, 1,725 of 4,000 patients returned the questionnaire (response rate: 43%), 426 (25%) were smokers. Among smokers self-reported flu vaccine uptake was 42% and among non-smokers 52% among both only 0,2% received both vaccines. Most important predictors of not complying in smokers and non-smokers were patient's beliefs not to be susceptible to disease (odds ratio (OR) 4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0, 8.0 and OR 2.8, CI: 2.0, 3.9), finding it difficult to go to the GP for vaccination (OR 2.5, CI: 1.3, 4.8 and OR 1.8, CI: 1.3, 2.6) and being against vaccination (OR 2.4 CI: 1.3, 4.4 and OR 1.8, CI: 1.3, 2.6), respectively.
Conclusion

There are no substantial differences in determinants associated with not complying with influenza and pneumococcal vaccination between smokers and non-smokers but there is a trend towards stronger associations in smokers.

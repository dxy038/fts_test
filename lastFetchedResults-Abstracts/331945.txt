Objective: This study was based on the hypothesis that conflicting findings and inconclusive consensus regarding the role of occlusal factors in the masticatory system are due to the variations in the definitions and methods used to describe and examine the occlusal factors. The object of this study was to determine whether contact patterns during lateral movement vary with mandibular positions and whether the contact pattern in lateral positions close to the maximum intercuspation has characteristics distinct from those in an edge-to-edge position.

Methods: Occlusal contacts of 86 young adults were examined using shim stock in regulated lateral positions: 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 mm from the maximum intercuspation, where the 0.5, 1 and 2 mm positions were defined as lateral positions close to the maximum intercuspation and the 3 mm position as an edge-to-edge position.

Results: The occlusal contact pattern in the 0.5 mm position showed a marked prevalence of posterior tooth contacts on the working and the non-working sides, compared with the 1, 2 and 3 mm positions. The occlusal contact pattern in the 3 mm position predicted the presence or absence of the occlusal contact in the 1 and 2 mm positions (sensitivity>0.7) but not in the 0.5 mm position (sensitivity<0.6).

Conclusion: The occlusal contact patterns during lateral movement varied greatly with mandibular positions. The examination method of the occlusal contact pattern in one unregulated position will be invalid. It is necessary to distinguish the occlusal contact patterns between a position close to the maximum intercuspation and an edge-to-edge position when investigating its role in the masticatory system and in oral disease.

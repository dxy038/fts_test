This paper has the objective to provide a scientific applied exhibition for a new modeling concept in fire sciences in an important case of study that has no important advances since a lot time. Is the concept of the energy transformation in a electrical wire from electrical power to radiant heat. We will give a general glimpse of the state of the art in electrical design, focusing on the fire safety, where there are defined two general types of fire hazards, the electrical arcing that has been widely studied, and the thermal generation where we focus our research. This work uses a new mathematical model to perform calculations of thermal conduction and heating caused by electrical current in electrical conductors with overload condition. This new model is approximately one thousand times more accurate than the classical Joule&#769;s Law.

This paper investigates the resource allocation problem in a relay-aided cognitive radio (CR) system under the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission. Different from the conventional CR resource allocation problem, the relay node here is capable of performing subcarrier permutation over two hops such that the signal received over a particular subcarrier is forwarded on a different subcarrier. The objective is to maximize the throughput of the CR network subject to a limited power budget at the secondary source and relay node, as well as the interference constraints at the primary receiver. The optimization is performed under a unified framework where the power allocation at the source node, power allocation at the relay node, and subcarrier pairing at the two hops are optimized jointly. Finally, numerical examples are provided to corroborate the proposed studies.

Abstract
Objective: Diabetes mellitus is the most common metabolic disease. One of the most common problems in diabetic patients is atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease which is induced by hyperlipidemia. Impaired lipid metabolism resulting from uncontrolled hyperglycemia has been implicated in cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients. Also, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) has been regarded as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to examine the correlation between HbA1c, fasting blood sugar (FBS) and 2 hours postprandial glucose (2hpp) with serum lipid levels in type 2 diabetes.
Materials and Methods: In this study, 100 diabetic patients in Yazd Diabetes Research Center were chosen. FBS, 2hpp, HbA1c and serum lipid levels were analyzed in patients. Serum Lipids and glucose were measured by enzymatic method. HbA1c was measured by DS5 analyzer and DS5 Pink Reagent kit.
Results: There was significant correlation between FBS and total cholesterol (TC) (r=0.25, P=0.039), 2hpp with TC (r=0.338, P=0.033) and 2hpp with LDL (r=0.39, P=0.01), but there were no correlations between HbA1c and TC (r=0.2, P=0.06), HbA1c and triglyceride (P=0.2, r=-0.14), HbA1c and HDL (P=0.25  r=-0.14) and HbA1c with LDL (P=0.08,  r=0.2).
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the high levels of serum glucose are associated with high levels of cholesterol and LDL and can be a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases

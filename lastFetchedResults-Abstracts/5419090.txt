A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm incorporating preference information is proposed. The algorithm uses a new nine grade evaluation method to convert the linguistic preferences expressed by the decision maker to the importance factor of each objective. A new outranking relation called &#194;&#191;strength superior&#194;&#191; based on the preference information is constructed via a fuzzy inference system to compare individuals instead of the commonly used Pareto dominance relation. Simulation results indicate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

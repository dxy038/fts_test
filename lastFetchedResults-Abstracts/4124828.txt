A sequence of BCU classifiers for online dynamic contingency screening is developed and their theoretical basis is provided. The design objective of the BCU classifiers is to ensure that unstable (single-swing or multiswing) contingencies be completely captured and that the number of contingencies needed for further analysis be significantly reduced. An architecture for online dynamic security assessments consisting of the BCU classifiers and an online transient stability (time-domain) simulation program is presented. The effectiveness of the developed BCU classifiers and proposed architecture is evaluated with very promising results using 7120 contingencies on a 50-generator, 145-bus power system and a 202-generator, 1293-bus real power system data

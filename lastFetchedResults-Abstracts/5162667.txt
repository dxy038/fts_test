Matrix converter is an array of controlled bidirectional switches connecting directly between the source and the load. This paper presents a comparison between the different modulation strategies employed in the matrix converter and presents an approach to increase the voltage transfer ratio beyond unity. Here we aimed at obtaining a single phase output from a poly phase input supply. A new fuzzy modulation scheme is implemented for the different configurations of poly phase to single phase matrix converter to increase the voltage gain compared to the previous method.

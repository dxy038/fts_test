In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method for the design of M-channel uniform linear-phase (LP) filter banks. We are mainly concerned with the significant aliasing caused by the two adjacent filters, leading to a near-perfect-reconstruction (NPR) system. With some assumptions, a matching condition is drived for efficient aliasing cancellation. By using the proposed design criteria to construct each filter, the requirements imposed on the entire filter bank become those on individual filters. It greatly simplifies the design of NPR uniform LP filter banks and no objective function in the optimization is explicitly required. In addition, the proposed method is more general with no limitation on the channel number and filter length. As illustrated by examples, the proposed method can provide a simple and efficient alternative for designing NPR uniform filter banks with the expected LP property.

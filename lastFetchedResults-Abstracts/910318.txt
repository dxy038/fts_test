This study presents a framework for Visually Interactive Decision-making and Design using Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization
(VIDEO). The VIDEO framework allows users to visually navigate large multi-objective solution sets while aiding decision makers in identifying
one or more optimal designs. Specifically, the interactive visualization framework is intended to provide an innovative exploration tool for
high-order Pareto-optimal solution sets (i.e., solution sets for three or more objectives). The framework is demonstrated for a long-term groundwater
monitoring (LTM) application in which users can explore and visualize tradeoffs for up to four design objectives, simultaneously. Interactive
functionality within the framework allows the user to select solutions within the objective space and visualize the corresponding
monitoring planâ€™s performance in the design space. This functionality provides the user with a holistic picture of the information provided
by a particular solution, ultimately allowing them to make a more informed decision. In addition, the ease with which the framework allows
users to navigate and compare solutions as well as design tradeoffs leads to a time efficient analysis, even when there are thousands of potential
solutions.

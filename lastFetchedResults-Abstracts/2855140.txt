H-KWS 2014 is the Handwritten Keyword Spotting Competition organized in conjunction with ICFHR 2014 conference. The main objective of the competition is to record current advances in keyword spotting algorithms using established performance evaluation measures frequently encountered in the information retrieval literature. The competition comprises two distinct tracks, namely, a segmentation-based and a segmentation-free track. Five (5) distinct research groups have participated in the competition with three (3) methods for the segmentation-based track and four (4) methods for the segmentation-free track. The benchmarking datasets that were used in the contest contain both historical and modern documents from multiple writers. In this paper, the contest details are reported including the evaluation measures and the performance of the submitted methods along with a short description of each method.

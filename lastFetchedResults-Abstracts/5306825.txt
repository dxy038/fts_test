The main objective of this research is to study the corrosion analysis for the effect on products in the salt fog test and damp heat test respectively. The test was taken on several typical metals with the consideration of the climate in the southeast coastal areas in China. Corrosion in alternating salt fog test and damp heat test turns out to be more severe than corrosion in the constant salt fog test when tested on corrosive metal without passivation layer. The corrosion analysis for the effect on products in alternating salt fog test and damp heat test was explicated in the end.

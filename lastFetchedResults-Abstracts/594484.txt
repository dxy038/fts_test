Academic delay of gratification predicts academic performance, motivation, self-regulation and self-efficacy in students. Due to the importance of academic delay of gratification in teaching-learning processes, there is a need for special tools proportional to the Iranian culture. The objective of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of Persian form academic delay of gratification scale, including reliability, validity, and factor analysis. The population consisted of Iranian high school students from Karaj (N = 600, 326 boys and 274 girls) who were selected based on multistage cluster sampling. They were tested by academic delay of gratification scale and motivated strategies for learning questionnaire. Test-retest reliability academic delay of gratification scale based on the results of two performance tests and its internal consistency by Cronbach's alpha coefficients were calculated and confirmed. To analyze the concurrent validity and to determine the validity factor motivation strategy-learning questionnaire was used, which indicated that concurrent validity is adequate. In addition, results indicated that the separate confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for the male and female samples showed a goodness of fit with the data. The findings of factor analysis as well as the reliability and validity coefficients were similar to the previous studies conducted in the original culture. Regarding its good psychometric properties, the scale is an appropriate instrument to measure student's academic delay of gratification.

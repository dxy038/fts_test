This paper presents an approach for the enhancement of reverberant speech by temporal and spectral processing. Temporal processing involves identification and enhancement of high signal-to-reverberation ratio (SRR) regions in the temporal domain. Spectral processing involves removal of late reverberant components in the spectral domain. First, the spectral subtraction-based processing is performed to eliminate the late reverberant components, and then the spectrally processed speech is further subjected to the excitation source information-based temporal processing to enhance the high SRR regions. The objective measures segmental SRR and log spectral distance are computed for different cases, namely, reverberant, spectral processed, temporal processed, and combined temporal and spectral processed speech signals. The quality of the speech signal that is processed by the temporal and spectral processing is significantly enhanced compared to the reverberant speech as well as the signals that are processed by the individual temporal and spectral processing methods.

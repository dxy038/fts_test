This paper reports a comprehensive study on an image processing and feature extraction tool particularly for 3-D range image applications in manufacturing processes. The library of the algorithms developed in this study is formatted into an easy-to-use imaging tool that consists of many useful algorithms and functions. The objective of this study is to produce a library of 3-D range imaging algorithms that can effectively employ imaging and vision techniques and be applied to industrial automation environments. A group of new algorithms have been developed and tested in manufacturing applications

Objective
Many recommendations for aspirin in stable cardiovascular disease are based on analyses of all antiplatelet therapies at all dosages and in both stable and unstable patients. Our objective was to evaluate the benefit and risk of low-dose aspirin (50-325 mg/d) in patients with stable cardiovascular disease.
Methods
Secondary prevention trials of low-dose aspirin in patients with stable cardiovascular disease were identified by searches of the MEDLINE database from 1966 to 2006. Six randomized trials were identified that enrolled patients with a prior myocardial infarction (MI) (n = 1), stable angina (n = 1), or stroke/transient ischemic attack (n = 4). A random effects model was used to combine results from individual trials.
Results
Six studies randomized 9853 patients. Aspirin therapy was associated with a significant 21% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death) (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-0.88), 26% reduction in the risk of nonfatal MI (95% CI, 0.60-0.91), 25% reduction in the risk of stroke (95% CI, 0.65-0.87), and 13% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI, 0.76-0.98). Patients treated with aspirin were significantly more likely to experience severe bleeding (odds ratio 2.2, 95% CI, 1.4-3.4). Treatment of 1000 patients for an average of 33 months would prevent 33 cardiovascular events, 12 nonfatal MIs, 25 nonfatal strokes, and 14 deaths, and cause 9 major bleeding events. Among those with ischemic heart disease, aspirin was most effective at reducing the risk of nonfatal MI and all-cause mortality; however, among those with cerebrovascular disease, aspirin was most effective at reducing the risk of stroke.
Conclusion
In patients with stable cardiovascular disease, low-dose aspirin therapy reduces the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality, and increases the risk of severe bleeding.

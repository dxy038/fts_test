In recent years, different versions of the moral argument for existence of God are formed and presented. The argument from moral objectivism of CS Lewis is one of them. Lewis by appealing to the common moral orders and laws in human life and by considering ethical Quarrelling, moral criticism, and human excuses when he or she is failed to obey moral laws, asserts the objectivity of moral orders and values. Then he establishes the basis of his moral argument regarding the difference between the nature of the moral law and natural law. While Lewis seeks for the basis of the objective moral rules he shows that the only real basis for moral judgments is a great mind. This Article reviews lewis's moral argument and then evaluates it.

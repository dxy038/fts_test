Background:  Barrier creams are important to protect the skin in occupations with chemical exposure. The value of hydrogels in barrier creams has never been studied. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current technology in barrier cream formulation and explore the utility of hygrogels in skin protection. Methods: A total of 80 men, women, and children between the ages of newborn to 80 years >were studied with the following dermatologic conditions: household hand dermatitis (21), occupational hand dermatitis (18), latex glove irritant contact dermatitis (9), diaper dermatitis (5), cutaneous wounds (17), and allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) (10). In this study, the investigators used a split body approach, in a double-blind randomized fashion, where one body site was treated with a traditional petrolatum-based cream while the other body site was treated with a hydrogel-based barrier/repair cream. Both subject and investigator assessments were recorded by questionnaire. Results:  The hydrogel barrier/repair cream showed better skin improvement than the petrolatum-based cream in both subject assessment (62%, P = .0048) and investigator assessment (75%, P = .0000003). Conclusion: Hydrogel barrier/repair creams might represent a new, effective approach to skin protection.

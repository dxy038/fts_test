As one of the largest electric utilities in the United States, American Electric Power (AEP) has a mission to operate its critical transmission infrastructure with a high level of availability and to achieve operational excellence. AEP is implementing an Asset Health Solution which will provide asset health situational awareness and actionable information based on data collected from smart sensors placed in the network. The objective of AEP´s Asset Health Solution is to apply existing operational data, real-time sensor data, advanced engineering analytics and forward looking business intelligence to establish a commanding view of AEP´s transmission system performance. The uniqueness of AEP´s approach is to address the system asset health requirement as an end-to-end process using a systematic and holistic approach. This approach leverages AEP engineering knowledge and operational performance experience which is strengthened with the equipment and technical expertise, service experience, and business intelligence of its technology partner.

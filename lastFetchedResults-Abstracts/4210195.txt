We introduce genetic algorithm to the problem of small unmanned helicopter height control in this paper. In base on the stability of pitching angle control loop, we gain the parameters of flying height outside loop controller which is constituted by height feedback signal. Aim at the features of highly stability control model for small unmanned helicopter, we select the system rise time, steady-state error and the combination of overshoot proportion as the optimization objective function. The simulation results showed that the PID controller using genetic algorithm design has better adaptability and stability, ensure the system control effect and improve the system performance.

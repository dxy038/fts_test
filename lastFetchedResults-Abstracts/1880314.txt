An experimental study on the transient power characteristics of a fuel cell generator has been conducted. The generator is hybridized by a proton exchange membrane (PEM) as theÂ main power source and a lithium-ion battery as the secondary power source. power-conditioning module consisting of a main bidirectional converter and an auxiliary converter has been designed to manage the hybrid power of the generator that copes with fast dynamics of variable loads. Sensors embedded in the generator have measured the electrical properties dynamically. It was found that the present power-conditioning scheme has well controlled the power flow between the fuel cell stack and the battery by regulating the power flow from or to the battery. In addition, the thermal management system using pulse width modulation (PWM) schemes could limit the operation temperature of the fuel cell generator in a designed range. Furthermore, the dynamics of electrical efficiency of the generator are found to be parallel with those of the net system power. Finally, the stability and reliability of the fuel cell generator is proven by the rational dynamic behaviors of thermal and electrical properties for over 30-h demonstration.

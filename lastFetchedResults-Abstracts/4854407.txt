The paper raises a new objective weighting method called Gini coefficient weight, which is based on the perspective of economic. This new method preferably reflects the volatility of single indexical information and difference degree. According to the comparatively of Gini coefficient weight method, the entropy weight method and standard deviation weight method, it can tell us that the evaluation results got from this Gini coefficient weight method are coincide with the other two methods. Furthermore, the variance shows that this Gini coefficient weight way could display the best discrimination. So it implies that this Gini coefficient weight is an effective objective weight method.

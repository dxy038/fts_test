In this paper a technique that enables efficient synthesis of the prediction signal for application in multi-scale motion compensation is presented. The technique targets prediction of high-pass spatial subbands for motion compensation at higher scales. Since in the targeted framework these subbands are obtained by high-pass filtering of prediction signal in pixel domain, an adaptive approach for filtering is proposed to support decomposition of differently predicted frame areas. In this way an efficient application of different prediction modes at all scales used for compensation is enabled. Experimental results show that for fast sequences where such an application of different prediction modes is crucial, the proposed adaptive transform introduces significant objective and visual improvements.

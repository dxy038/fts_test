In this paper, inverse DEA with performance cone constraints, when some of outputs level decision making units are undesirable, is discussed. So that, by changing the input level and maintain the efficiency index of the unit under evaluation, the desirable output level (undesirable) increase (decrease) will be. For this purpose multi objective linear programming (MOLP) model are used.

A new multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for Environmental/Economic power Dispatch (EED) problem based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed in this paper. The new algorithm has adopted the maintenance method of Pareto candidate solution set based on the max-min distance density. The algorithm effectively guarantees the convergence of the algorithm and the diversity solutions. The performance of algorithm has been examined over the standard IEEE 30-bus six-generator test system, and other multi-objective evolutionary algorithm are compared. Testing and comparing results showed this paper algorithm is feasible and efficient.


Introduction: Postgraduates’ viewpoint about thesis is an area of interest for administrators of medical universities. The objective of this study is to overview postgraduates’ viewpoints about supervisors’, co-supervisors’ and statistical advisors’ contribution to theses in Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS).
Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted during 2011-2012 on 270 theses having statistical advisors and finished within 2006 to 2011 at four faculties of TUMS. A 5 point scale questionnaire was developed by the researcher about professors’ involvement and cooperation then delivered to samples. Descriptive statistics, independent t, Kruskal Wallis, and Mann Whitney U tests were used to analyze data.
Results: The highest cooperation rate of supervisors in PhD theses (2.8±1.20) and master theses (3.3±1.27) related to proposal preparation. The highest cooperation rate of co-supervisors in PhD theses related to questionnaire development and data gathering (2.5±1.34) and preparing proposal for master theses (2.7±1.38). The highest cooperation rate of statistical advisors in PhD theses (2.9±1.36) and master theses (3.4V1.24) was data analysis.
Conclusion: Due to low cooperation level of co-supervisors compared to supervisors and statistical advisors, we recommend to revise the role of co-supervisors in theses. Moreover, the arrangement of the authors’ name in final publications should be changed according to their contribution to the work.

Nowadays, electrical systems are experiencing high peak demand. One resource that is currently becoming an important resource is the demand response (DR) which can be defined as the set of techniques, programs and systems capable of getting consumers to reduce or shift their consumption, minimizing demand peaks, and as a consequence, reducing the economic costs and improving the security of the electrical system. One of the major challenges in this area is related to the inclusion of DR in unit commitment and economic dispatch formulations. Currently, these programs consider fixed demand or a basic model of DR in the formulation, therefore, the inclusion of a detailed model of DR in these programs involves modifying both the objective and constraints functions. The objective of this work is the study of different DR patterns from the point of view of the operating system.The study considers mainly housing loads. Different types of models and methods of DR are reviewed, some recommendations are remarked in relation to the efficient operation of the power system with the inclusion of different DR models.

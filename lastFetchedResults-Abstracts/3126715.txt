Investigating gene networks is important for understanding mechanism of cellular functions. Recently there have been increasing research interests in synthesizing gene networks and several studies have been done. Synthesizing gene networks is a complementary approach to understanding functions of gene networks, and it could be the first step in controlling and monitoring living cells. In this paper, we discuss the controller design problem: for a given objective gene network and a desired expression pattern sequence, design a controller gene network such that the objective gene network has desired one. We propose a controller design method by discrete-time network learning in which the cost function includes evaluations of behavior of controllers. Numerical experiments are given to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

This paper proposes a new approach to determine objective weights geometrically in the multiple attributes decision making (MADM) problems. The proposed method chooses an assumptive attribute as reference to measure the angles between other attributes and itself. The angles reflect the relative importance or weights of these attributes. An example is introduced to demonstrate the effectiveness and stableness of the proposed approach. The insensitiveness to different normalizations of the new method are also analyzed.

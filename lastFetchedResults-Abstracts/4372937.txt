A flat strip grating with one-dimensional periodicity is one of the canonical geometries in electromagnetic scattering problems. Accurate and efficient numerical solutions have been obtained for the resistive strip gratings by the method of singular integral equations (SIE) and the method of the duel, series equations (DSE). A magneto-dielectric strip grating has been also treated by the latter method previously by Zinenko et al. (1998). The objective of the present paper is to extend the above mentioned SIE approach accompanied with the regularization procedure to the scattering from the impedance strip grating in free space in order to obtain an accurate numerical solution to this scattering problem

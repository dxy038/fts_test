The challenges that Brazil faces to set down real genetic improvement programs for goats
are enormous, due to the vast range of its territory, along with the peculiar characteristics
of the Northeast Region, which concentrate 93% of the goat population. This is the
most extensive semiarid region of the country, where environmental resources are limited,
with poor and irregular rainfall, with direct implications on scarcity and quality of forage,
lack of a supply chain structured. Adding to this, the most of the herds are small, without
appropriate management, run by small producers with scarce financial resources, and
little technical assistance. The objective of this paper is to present a view of policies and
technical-scientific activities regarding genetic improvement programs for goats in developing
countries, establishing a parallel with actions of improvement carried out in Brazil in
recent years, centered on the production of meat and dairy. The major experiences, challenges,
needs and priorities will also be discussed to make possible, in the shortest time the
consolidation of solid improvement programs for goats in Brazil.

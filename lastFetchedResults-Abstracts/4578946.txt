This paper presents the performance evaluation of transceiving JPEG-2000 image over peer-to-peer wireless links. The latest image codec JPEG-2000 is implemented [2000], and a peer-to-peer transceiver model is established for wireless transmission. The standard test images are compressed by the codec within the transceiver, and subsequently transmitted from peer to peer over IEEE 802.11b wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) [1999] and General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) [1998] networks. For Wi-Fi, due to its substantially high data rate, image transmission time is not as critical. For GPRS, due to the restricted data rate and power resources, it is meaningful to investigate the performance of image transmission over GPRS-involved wireless links. Therefore, in this paper, JPEG-2000 images are compressed in lossy mode and transmitted over GPRS-GPRS and GPRS-Wi-Fi links. Since network usage time and amount of data transferred are cost-determining factors, transmission times for various compression ratios are recorded. Levels of compression can be evaluated using both objective and subjective criteria, yet subjective criteria is more dominant for the smaller screen-size and lower processing power of GPRS-supported devices

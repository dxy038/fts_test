Objectives. Influenza vaccination is an effective intervention to diminish morbidity and mortality associated with this disease in aged populations and at-risk groups. The objective of this work was to describe population patterns of vaccination among Galician women and to identify factors associated with vaccination.

design. Cross-sectional study.

s. Cases aged 65 years and over were selected from the Women's Social and Health Interview, Galicia 2000 (n=1111). The association between influenza vaccination last season and several sociodemographic, lifestyle, health status and health services variables was assessed by logistic regression.

s. In total, 56.3% of cases had received the influenza vaccine. The following variables were significantly associated with vaccination: age 70–74 years (odds ratios, OR=1.56; 95% CI: 1.09–2.26); age≥75 years (OR=1.88; 95% CI: 1.31–2.71); residence in towns with 5000–20,000 inhabitants (OR=1.79; 95% CI: 1.16–2.77); annual income €6.010 (OR=1.39; 95% CI: 1.01–1.90); unfavourable self-perception of health (OR=1.46; 95% CI: 1.06–2.00); not being a caregiver (OR=1.67; 95% CI: 1.17–2.38); married (OR=1.45; 95% CI: 1.05–2.01); tetanus vaccination (OR=1.43; 95% CI: 1.07–1.93); and visiting a physician in the last 2 years (OR=4.83; 95% CI: 2.61–8.93).

sions. The level of vaccination among Galician women is low, although it is higher than that in Spanish women overall. This work has identified groups of women who are less likely to be vaccinated, and who should be targeted in future vaccination campaigns.

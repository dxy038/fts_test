Algorithm for Model Bidirectional Reflectance Anisotropics of the Land Surface (AMBRALS) has been developed for scientific user community by Lucht et al. since 1995 as a surrogate for the operational MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/Albedo code. It is a family of kernel-driven BRDF models including the operational MODIS BRDF/Albedo main algorithm, and. adopts command line format. In this study, we develop a visual WindowÂ´s interface for AMBRALS named VAMBRALS based on the core codes of the AMBRALS to keep consistent with AMBRALS with a series of improvements and innovations. First, VAMBRALS has partly realized image data processing function, initially defined a temporary image converting format file. Second, VAMBRALS has developed a new ability to forwardly calculate reflectance and black-sky albedo at arbitrarily given view and illumination geometry. Third, VAMBRALS has accomplished hybrid programming of C++ and Interactive Data Language (IDL) to visualize model kernel functions and realistic BRDF observations.

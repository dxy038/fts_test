In this article we illustrate how simulation and gaming can be used to support lean manufacturing systems. More in particular we study a case example from industry - a manual assembly line for mail-inserting systems - for which we have developed a simulation game. This paper focuses on the development steps of the simulation game. The objective of the game is to support the introduction of lean principles in an existing assembly line. The simulation game can be used to demonstrate applicability of a lean control concept at the assembly line and to train workers to make appropriate control decisions within this concept. In this paper, we indicate a definite need for the development of this game. The systematic way in which it is developed, the use of a general simulation language in the design phase, and its usefulness may stimulate the introduction of simulation games in more industrial settings

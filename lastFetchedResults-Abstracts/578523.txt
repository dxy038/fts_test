Background: Laser-tissue interaction on low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has
widespread medical applications (e.g., improved wound healing). The tensile strength
of radiated tissue by LLLT is known to be increased mainly because of cross collagen
bands developed after radiation.
Objective: In this work, we studied the instantaneous effect of radiation of polarized
laser beam on the viscoelastic tissue properties.
Methods: The viscoelastic behavior of tissue was investigated by experimental
measurement and analyses of stress-strain plots.
Result: LLLT increased the viscoelastic properties of the irradiated soft tissue.
The maximum variation in viscoelasticity was attained when the direction of laser
polarization is parallel to the tissue stretch vector. The variation also depended on
duration of laser irradiation.
Conclusion: Viscoelastic properties of soft tissue can be changed by polarized
laser radiation.

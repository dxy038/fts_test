The main objective of this study is to conduct an optimal micro-siting of 1kW wind turbine to provide electricity for the eco-house project at Sultan Qaboos University (SQU). The study utilizes the Numerical Weather Prediction models data to provide the required wind information. WAsP application is used to calculate the wind climatology and the annual energy production. It was found the closest potential site can generate 1.945MW at 10m and 2.938MW at 30m above the ground. On the other hand, the farthest potential site which is around 45m away from the eco-house can generate 1.449MW and 3.150MW at 10m and 30m above the ground respectively.

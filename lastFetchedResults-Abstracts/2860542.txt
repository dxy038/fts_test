In the past decade, Hybrid Electric Vehicles have been demonstrated to significantly reduce the fuel consumption and emissions. However, this capability strongly depends on the sizing of the components and on the quality of the energy management. These challenges require new optimization procedures for a systematical exploration of the design space to find the optimal component sizings and control trajectories. A novel two-layer optimization strategy based on a multi-objective problem formulation is proposed. The first layer consists of a multi-objective genetic algorithm for determining the best system design parameters with respect to fuel consumption and driving performance. The second layer solves a deterministic hybrid optimal control problem (HOCP) to find for each individual of the population pool the optimal continuous and discrete control trajectories for the energy management. The proposed optimization strategy is benchmarked to a one-layer genetic algorithm approach on a parallel hybrid design study.

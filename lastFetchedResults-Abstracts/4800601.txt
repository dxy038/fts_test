This paper presents the software architecture of an electronic copilot whose purpose is to give an appropriate support to the driver in all traffic situations. The objective is to increase the driver possibilities to take the right decision in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, the information presented to the driver must be carefully selected depending on the current traffic situation. After a global description of the copilot functional architecture, the authors present the Dynamic Data Manager in charge of updating the world model, and the Situation Analysis Module that diagnoses the situation, controls the sensors running mode and determines the messages to send to the driver. This work takes place in the European Prometheus Pro-Art project and will be integrated in a vehicle prototype called Prolab2. This French demonstrator integrates the works of nine research laboratories and two car companies, PSA and RENAULT

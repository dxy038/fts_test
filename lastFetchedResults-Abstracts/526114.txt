Background: Danae racemosa is used medicinally and as a culinary spice. Its constituents are stated to have antithrombotic, antihepatotoxic, antinociceptive and antioxidant.
Objective: Enhanced oxidative stress and changes in antioxidant capacity are considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic diabetes mellitus. 
Methods: Wistar male rat (n=30) were allocated into three groups, control (n=10) and two test groups (each of ten). Animals in test groups were subdivided into groups of 2 that received fresh extract equivalent to 200 & 400 mg/Kg/Rat/day Danae racemosa extract. Fresh Danae racemosa extract was administered with gavages for 28 consecutive days. Animals were kept in standard condition. On twenty eighth day, the testes of rats in the all groups were removed and sperm was collected from epididymis and was prepared for analysis.
Results: The percentage of sperm viability and motility in both test groups significantly increased (p < 0.05), but the sperm concentration significantly increased only in the group that received the high dose of Danae racemosa extracted, (p < 0.05). It was evident that there was no difference on sperm morphology and testis weight in test groups comparing to control group. 
Conclusion: In our study Danae racemosa extract has significantly affected the sperm number and percentage of viability and motility; it seems that using 400 mg/Kg/Rat/day of Danae racemosa extract is effective in sperm health parameters.

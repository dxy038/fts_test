This paper describes a novel adaptive solution system for electromagnetic field problems. The solution method is based on a meshless approach and thus the preprocessing effort is minimized. The positions of the nodes used for this solution are determined adaptively using a Kohonen neural network (NN). The objective of the proposed approach is to obtain an optimal placing of the nodes before adding any new degrees of freedom to reduce the error.

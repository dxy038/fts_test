The paper optimizes AVS key coding algorithm, and designs high coding efficiency and high coding quality AVS encoder XAVS based on x86 platform. It supports IPPP, IBBP structure, films on a variety of formats of media sources to AVS compression, rate control, rate distortion optimization, and packaged into the standard TS stream. The experiment results show that subjective quality of XAVS is better than that of rm52j; In the case of the same objective quality, the output bit rate of XAVS is lower than the rm52j about 5% and Encoding speed of XAVS is 4-7 times that of rm52j.

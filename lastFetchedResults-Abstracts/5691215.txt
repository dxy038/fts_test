For service level agreement over company networks or community ones, this paper studies evaluation of a user-satisfaction with objective TCP variables in an online shopping Web service by experiment. In this experiment, the authors measure 31 variables concerned with TCP performance and assess a user-satisfaction for three actual Web services. Then, to clarify relationship between the user-satisfaction and the objective TCP variables, they utilize multivariate statistics: the principal component analysis and the multiple regression analysis. The experimental results show that the user satisfaction can be estimated with three or four objective TCP variables in the online shopping service.

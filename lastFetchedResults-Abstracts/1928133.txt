An optimization methodology for a microchannel, plate-fin heat sink suitable for the cooling of a linear parabolic trough Concentrating Photovoltaic/Thermal (CPVT) system is applied in this study. Two different microchannel configurations are considered, Fixed (FWμ) and stepwise Variable-Width (VWμ) microchannels respectively. The performance evaluation criteria comprise the thermal resistance of the heat sink and the cooling medium pressure drop through the heat sink. Initially, the effect of the geometric parameters on the heat sink thermal and hydrodynamic performance is investigated using a thermal resistance model and analytical correlations, in order to save computational time. The results of the 1-D model enable the construction of surrogate functions for the thermal resistance and the pressure drop of the heat sink, which are considered as the objective functions for the multi-objective optimization through a genetic algorithm that leads to the optimal geometric parameters. In a second step, a 3-D numerical model of fluid flow and conjugate heat transfer for the optimized FWμ heat sink is developed in order to investigate in detail the flow and thermal processes. The overall analysis demonstrates that microchannel heat sinks achieve very low values of thermal resistance and that the use of variable-width channels can significantly reduce the pressure drop of the cooling fluid. Furthermore, it is proven that the 1-D model is capable of providing a good estimate of the behavior of the heat sink.

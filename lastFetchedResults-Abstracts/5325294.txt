The advent of Information Technology as a highly leveraged enabling tool for delivery of services in the public and the private sector has by now been universally recognized. This has redefined the fundamentals and has the potential to change the institutions as well as the mechanisms of delivery of services forever. It is in this context that the issues of Smart Governance - Electronic Governance needs to be analyzed. Quite obviously, therefore, the objective of achieving Electronic Governance (EG) goes far beyond mere computerization of standalone back office operations. It means to fundamentally change as to how the Government operates and this implies a new set of responsibilities for the executive, legislature and the citizenry. The effort should aim to bring about a social catharsis which needs to be coordinated in a comprehensive, strenuous and deliberated fashion.

In this paper, we formulate an optimal design problem of system reliability as a nonlinear integer programming problem with interval coefficients, transform it into a bicriteria 0â€“1 nonlinear programming problem without interval coefficients, and solve it directly using GA with holding nonlinear objective functions. Also, we demonstrate the efficiency of this method with a numerical example.

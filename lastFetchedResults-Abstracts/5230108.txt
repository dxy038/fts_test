Main objective of this paper is to discuss comparison the results of injection moulding process simulation analysis generated by particular software with those obtained in a small-scale industrial process. The samples were produced by ´Dasset´ injection moulding machine at laboratory. Component was modelled using Rhinoceros Computer Aided Design (CAD) software. Simulation analysis was performed using moldflow plastics insight (MPI). Two different positions of gate were selected for simulation to investigate the accuracy of the software. Polyethylene (PE) and high impact polystyrene (HIPS) were selected for analysis and production. Comparison with the samples showed that MPI predict maximum pressure needed to fill the mould cavity accurate. MPI predicted flow path and weld lines graphically those were similar to the machine´s process. SIMPOL does not provide such results. It was not possible to compare with the machine´s result because of the machine´s problem. In addition to these results, MPI generated more simulation analysis report of injection moulding process.

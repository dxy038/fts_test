Background: Intensified strategy includes special attention
to the symptoms such as cough (more than two weeks), fever
(more than three weeks), night sweats (more than three weeks),
and weight loss (more than 3 kg per month). If any of the above
symptoms was positive, in suspected individuals for TB, more
assessment should be done. The aim of this study was to compare
between intensified and routine case finding for a better case
selection method for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis among
HIV-Infected Persons.
Methods: The sample size was calculated 237 patients (474 for
the two groups). In the current study, the patients were divided
randomly into two groups: A) intensified case finding group
and B) routine case finding group. Considering the sputum
culture as the gold standard, we calculated the sensitivity and
specificity, Positive predictive value (PPV), Negative predictive
value (NPV) for fever, weight loss, coughing more than two
week, night sweats, and PPD test.
Result: A total of eight positive cases of tuberculosis were
detected in the intensified while four were found in the routine
case finding group. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV
for cough in diagnosis of TB were 25%, 87%, 6%, and 97%,
respectively. For weight loss, they were 62.5%, 83%, 10.8%, and
98.5% respectively while these amounts were, 7%, 85%, 97.6,
37.5 for night sweats. For fever, they were, 25%, 92.9%, 10.5%,
and 97% respectively, and for PPD they were 87.5%, 40%, 4.6%,
and 98.9%, respectively.
Conclusion: Key symptom screening, such as cough, fever,
weight loss and night sweats, has an important role in detecting
TB among HIV-infected patients.

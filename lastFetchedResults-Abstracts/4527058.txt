Problematic command and control situations are often characterized with high levels of uncertainty and severe time constraints. In time compressed situations where only a limited number of information can be considered by the decision-maker, it becomes critical that the information available is the most relevant for taking action in that situation. This paper presents a Framework for the Analysis of Information Relevance (FAIR). The objective with this stepwise framework is to guide filtering and prioritization of information based on its level of relevance to the situation. The rationale is that with adequate filtering and prioritization processes, the decision-maker is left with only the most relevant information to act within a time-constrainted window of opportinity.

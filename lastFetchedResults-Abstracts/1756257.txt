Objective
jective of this study was to examine the changes in spouses' coping styles that occur in the first year after a patient's stroke and the influence of these changes on the spouses' psychosocial functioning.
s
l of 211 spouses of patients with stroke were assessed at three different time points using self-reported questionnaires (at the time of the patient's admission to inpatient rehabilitation, 2 months after discharge and 1 year poststroke). We used linear mixed-model and multiple linear regression analyses to analyse the data.
s
s' use of an active coping style decreased significantly in the first year poststroke. There were no significant overall changes in the use of a passive coping style. The use of a passive coping style at admission and increases in passive coping style in the first year poststroke predicted worse psychosocial functioning 1 year poststroke. The models explained between 32% and 50% of the variance in quality of life, depressive symptoms and strain.
sion
esent study indicates that spouses' passive coping style is maladaptive poststroke when used in the acute as well as in the chronic phase. Use of an active coping style decreases in the first year poststroke, but these decreases do not predict psychosocial outcomes.

This paper aims to identify the main factors affecting seafarers' attraction and retention as a result of an empirical survey. The main objective of this research is studying the effect of workplace environment in conjunction with the type and class of ships on seafarers' attraction and retention by focusing on containerships, bulk carriers, and tankers. In this study, different items associated with retention and attraction of seafarers are self-assessed by respondents using a 5-point Likert scale from ‘Strongly Disagree’ to ‘Strongly Agree’. The respondents are randomly selected from the seafarers of three main Iranian shipping lines, including NITC, IRISL, and BOSACO. In comparison with the two other types of ships, tankers' seafarers are most satisfied with their working condition.

Conventional supervised methods for image categorization rely on manually annotated (labeled) examples to learn good object models, which means their generality and scalability depends heavily on the amount of human effort available to help train them. We propose an unsupervised approach to construct discriminative models for categories specified simply by their names. We show that multiple-instance learning enables the recovery of robust category models from images returned by keyword-based search engines. By incorporating constraints that reflect the expected sparsity of true positive examples into a large-margin objective function, our approach remains accurate even when the available text annotations are imperfect and ambiguous. In addition, we show how to iteratively improve the learned classifier by automatically refining the representation of the ambiguously labeled examples. We demonstrate our method with benchmark datasets, and show that it performs well relative to both state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches and traditional fully supervised techniques.

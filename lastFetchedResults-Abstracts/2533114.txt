Background and Objective: Fe4NiO4Zn nanoparticles are used in nano technological applied arenas. Given the importance of liver in detoxification of the body, this study dealt with the toxicity effect of Fe4NiO4Zn nanoparticles on changes of hepatic factors

Materials and Methods: Twenty four Wistar rats were randomly assigned to three groups: A control group(1) and two treatment groups (2, 3) which received 0.5cc of saline, 0.5cc of solution containing 100, 200 ppm Fe4NiO4 for 7 successive days, respectively. Then, parameters such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), transferrin (TR) and albumin were measured on days 2, 7 and 14 after the treatment.

Results: Mean TR levels, on day 7 after the intervention in the group of Fe4Nio4Zn (200ppm) and on day 14 of the study in both groups of  Fe4Nio4Zn (100,200ppm) significantly decreased. Likewise, on day 2 of the study the average of LDH in the group of Fe4Nio4Zn (100ppm) and on days 7 and 14 in both groups of Fe2Nio4Zn(100,200ppm) significantly decreased. Mean ALP showed a significant decrease on day 2 after the intervention in both treatment groups as compared with the control group.

Conclusion: Findings concerning reduced hepatic factors throughout this study assert that the body can gradually eliminate Fe4Nio4Zn nanoparticles after the injection. On the other hand, the toxic effects of these elements are eliminated either as a consequence of the loss of the properties of nanoparticles after the administration or due to a state of hepatocyte tolerance.

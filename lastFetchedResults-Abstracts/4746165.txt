For semi-autonomous human-machine system, because all possible events that might happen during the expected lifetime of the system operation usually could not be predicted in the design phase, it is very important to dermine what human to does and what e fore machine to does. This paper presents a theoretical framework for ecological function allocation by "who does what and when and how to does" considerations during the design process of human-machine interface for some mobile machines. The primary objective is to explore ergonomics principals that will be able to apply into human-machine interface design for advanced vehicle, it is expecting to address the impact of driver interfaces layouts, traffic information types, and driving behavioral factors on the advanced vehicles design and development.

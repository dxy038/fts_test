 Background and Objectives: Based on previous studies it was known that in the most of countries prevalence of nosocomial infections is 6 to 10 percent. However with using right methods of disinfection and antiseptics and sanitation a lot of this infections could be controlled with a low cost. Various mineral and organic antiseptics could be used in hospitals to disinfect. The objective of this study is to possibility of making a liquid disinfectant in method of NaCl electrolysis and study it's application for disinfection of surfaces.

Materials and Methods:A pilot was designed for this study. Solutions with 5 density of NaCl (1, 3, 5, 7, 10 %) in 4 different pH (2, 4.5, 7, 9.5, 10) was prepared and got under influence of 5 currents (0/2, 0/4, 0/6, 0/8, 1 Ampers). Then a sample gathered from anode column of pilot and was examined on Staphilococus aureus microbial strain based on 9485 standard of ISIRI.

Results:Results from this study showed that increasing density of salt, increasing electrical flow and decreasing pH causes more bacterial mortality in Staphilococus aureus strain.

Conclusion: Results from this study showed that in1- 5% salt density, pH=7 and 1A electrical flow every bacteria in Staphilococus aureus strain will be destroyed completely.

Background and Objective: Computerized tomography and fluoroscopic computerized tomography are amongst the methods used for guiding needle biopsy processes; however, fluoroscopic computerized tomography demonstrates the images during the process of biopsy. This
study aims to compare and contrast the success of biopsy under guide of computerized tomography and fluoroscopic computerized tomography, independently and based on the location of the mass. Materials and Methods: This research was a descriptive study of case series type. For this purpose, 206 patients were evaluated who came to hospital in a one-year period because of a mass in an anatomic location and underwent biopsy of the mass under guide of computerized tomography
and fluoroscopic computerized tomography and their pathological records were analyzed. The required data were extracted and were analyzed by SPSS software. Results: In this study, among 206 subjects, 122 were examined under guide of fluoroscopic tomography and 84 under guide of conventional computerized tomography. In all anatomical
locations of the mass except for mediastinum, negative cases of biopsy in conventional computerized tomography were more than fluoroscopic computerized tomography the total rate of success in fluoroscopic computerized tomography group was 86.1% and in conventional computerized tomography it was 76.2%. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the fluoroscopic computerized tomography in biopsy is more successful than conventional computerized tomography in pelvis, abdomens, bone and liver and this might be the result of the feasibility of watching the biopsy needle during the procedure.

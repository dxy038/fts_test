Objective (s): Breastfeeding has many benefits for both mother and child. However, in recent years breastfeeding has declined. This study aimed to determine the association between participation in childbirth preparation classes and breastfeeding.
Methods: This was a cross sectional study of 600 pregnant women attending to prenatal education classes in Babol, Iran during year 2014 to 2016. Data were collected by a questionnaire including items on demographic and reproductive content. To determine the relationship between participation in childbirth preparation classes and breastfeeding chi-square and logistic regression analysis were used.
Results: Statistically significant difference observed between number of sessions before birth with breastfeeding from birth to 24 months. Mothers participating in 4 sessions and more were more likely to use less formula milk for feeding their babies (p < 0.05). Also, compared with term newborns, preterm newborns used more formula milk (p < 0.05). Significant association between breast feeding status with demographic and reproductive characteristics and kind of delivery were not found.
Conclusion: Prenatal education classes might be useful in improving breastfeeding.

Planning and Scheduling is a decision-making process of allocating limited resources to tasks over time with the goal of optimizing a certain objective. Most of them do not have a polynomial time algorithm and are NP-hard problems. The requirements from a real world application might be that several goals need to be achieved simultaneously, which makes problems even much harder to solve. This paper presents a general framework of a logic-based Benders cut for multi-objective planning and scheduling problems arising in emergency restoration. Disjunctive cuts are generated based on logical inference. Our computational results show that the algorithmic framework allows rapid solution of these problems, enabling the determination of representative points on the efficient frontier set of optimal solutions for a multiple objective optimization problem in emergency management.

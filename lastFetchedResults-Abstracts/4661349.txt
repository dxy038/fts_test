To limit the falling of many power poles in areas affected by typhoons, the wind-bearing capability of pole foundations must be verified for transmission and distribution. A mechanical loading scheme is proposed in this paper to simulate the wind loads for power poles in transmission and distribution systems. First, the calculation algorithm for wind loads on wired power poles is discussed, and the range of wind loads is derived and highlighted for normal power poles. Consequently, a mechanism model that is loaded with a pole bending moment is presented, and a detailed mechanical design of the loading mechanism is implemented through optimization and simulation. Detection units and motor devices are designed for installation on the mechanism links to realize the automatic loading and unloading control of pole bending moments. Field experiment results show that the bending moment exerted on power poles can reach a maximum value of 40kNm loading moment. Furthermore, this system has the advantages of automatic loading and unloading, convenient assembly and disassembly, and easy operation. Hence, the research achieves its objective.

We present a novel client-driven multiview video streaming system that allows a user to watch 3D video interactively with significantly reduced bandwidth requirements by transmitting a small number of views selected according to his/her head position. The user´s head position is tracked and predicted into the future to select the views that best match the user´s current viewing angle dynamically. Prediction of future head positions is needed so that views matching the predicted head positions can be prefetched in order to account for delays due to network transport and stream switching. The system allocates more bandwidth to the selected views in order to render the current viewing angle. Highly compressed, lower quality versions of some other views are also prefetched for concealment if the current user viewpoint differs from the predicted viewpoint. An objective measure based on the abruptness of the head movements and delays in the system is introduced to determine the number of additional lower quality views to be prefetched. The proposed system makes use of multiview coding (MVC) and scalable video coding (SVC) concepts together to obtain improved compression efficiency while providing flexibility in bandwidth allocation to the selected views. Rate-distortion performance of the proposed system is demonstrated under different experimental conditions.

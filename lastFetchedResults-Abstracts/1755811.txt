Objective
t evidence regarding the association between psychopathology and subclinical atherosclerosis show inconsistent results. The present study examined whether subclinical atherosclerosis was more prevalent in a large cohort of persons with depressive or anxiety disorders as compared to non-depressed and non-anxious controls.
s
ne data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were used, including 2717 persons, free of clinical cardiovascular disease. Participants had a DSM-IV-based current or remitted depressive (major depressive disorder, dysthymia) or anxiety (social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia) disorder (n=2115) or were healthy controls (n=602). Additional clinical characteristics (severity, duration, age of onset and medication) were assessed. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was used as a measure of vascular risk and was categorized as low (≤0.90) and mildly low ABI (0.90–1.11) indicating subclinical atherosclerosis, and high ABI (&gt;1.40), which was previously designated as a cardiovascular risk factor, reflecting arterial stiffness and wall calcification.
s
pared to normal controls, persons with current (i.e., past year) depressive, anxiety or comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders showed a two- to threefold increased odds of low ABI (OR=2.78, 95% CI=1.05–7.35; OR=3.14, 95% CI=1.25–7.85; OR=2.67, 95% CI=1.09–6.51, respectively). No associations were found with mildly low or high ABI. Also, we did not further find a differential role for symptoms severity, duration, age of onset, and use of psychotropic medication in the link between psychopathology and subclinical atherosclerosis.
sion
s with current depressive or anxiety disorders were more likely to have subclinical atherosclerosis compared to healthy controls.

A model of comprehensive evaluation of regional power quality based on multilevel extension method is first put forward in this paper. A new index system is established, with the characteristic indexes include voltage level, load capacity, number of users, importance of the user, user sensitivity and quality performance of the subregions. Then, the subjective weighting algorithm based on improved analytical hierarchy process and the objective weighting algorithm based on extension index of power quality are developed respectively. Case study validates the effectiveness of the comprehensive evaluation method of regional power quality.

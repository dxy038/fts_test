This paper seeks to analyze and criticize the theory of “Utilization and satisfaction” in the media. According to this theory, the viewers, “desire” and “needs” are imposed on the media and they effect the process of policy-making and planning. Hence, the media should be viewer based; that is, the media should follow the viewers’ inclinations and meet their objective needs. It seems, the main claim of this theory is, generally speaking, inconsistent with some Islamic injunctions with regard to the duties of cultural institutes including mass media regarding the way of dealing with the viewers. A religious media or that which adheres to Islamic principles and has lofty ideals cannot and must not confine its attention in its cultural policies and programs to the false needs which have special objectives. In the eye of Islam, it is only real needs that should be met and observing Islamic ideals has special effect on the sublimity-seeking movement of the believers in their holy travel to achieve the ultimate aim, and that is the nearness to God. Therefore, the media which is regarded idea constrates its attention on satisfying the real and common needs of viewers.

In this study, the main objective is to explore the microstrip patch antenna fabrication technology utilizing semi-insulating SiC materials. Sample patch antennas will be designed operating at X, S, and C bands. Following the simulations, the designed antennas will be fabricated in a clean room environment. The antennas consist of a semi-insulating SiC dielectric medium and of conductive layers on the front and back of the SiC substrate. Upon fabrication, reflection coefficient measurements are performed for validation and are compared with the simulations. Results regarding antenna parameters such as return loss, radiation pattern, and efficiency are presented. The fabrication process of the antennas is also explained in detail.

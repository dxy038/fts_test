Recent advances of robotic/mechanical devices enable us to measure a subjectpsilas performance in an objective and precise manner. The main issue of using such devices is how to represent huge experimental data compactly in order to analyze and compare them with clinical data efficiently. In this paper, we choose a subset of features from real-time experimental data and build a classifier model to assess stroke patientspsila upper limb functionality. We compare our model with combinations of different classifiers and ensemble schemes, showing that it outperforms competitors. We also demonstrate that our results from experimental data are consistent with clinical information, and can capture changes of upper-limb functionality over time.

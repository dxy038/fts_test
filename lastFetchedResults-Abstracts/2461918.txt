The objective of the current work is assessment of the effects of neutron irradiation on the mechanical properties of blanket and divertor materials of a future fusion energy generation Demonstration Power Plant (DEMO). The emphasis is put on the review of the tensile, Charpy impact and fracture toughness properties of EUROFER97 and EUROFER ODS (9%Cr) steels irradiated up to a displacement damage dose of 80 dpa in order to address (i) irradiation dose dependence of mechanical properties, (ii) irradiation temperature dependence of the mechanical properties, (iii) helium effects on the mechanical properties. The assessment will be used to give recommendations on the operating temperature range for the First Wall and helium cooled Breeding Blanket materials and to identify needs for structural materials R&amp;D.

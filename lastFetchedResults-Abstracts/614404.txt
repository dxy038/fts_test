Introduction & Objective: Visiting is one of the basic needs of patients and their families while
they are in coronary care units (CCUs). As the healthcare system moves toward a consumerdriven
paradigm, talking about visiting hours has become a controversial and interesting
topic. The aim of this research was to determine the effects of programmed visiting on
physiological indexes in CCU patients.
Materials & Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, 60 patients with acute myocardial
infarction were selected through convenience sampling and randomly divided into two
groups. Patients in the case group were asked to name those who are more comfortable with
and love to be present at the visiting time. Visitors were trained for proper visiting. Data was
collected by a questionnaire and Cardiac Monitoring. Physiological indexes (systolic and
diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen
saturation) were assessed 10 minutes before and during visiting, as well as 10 and 30 minutes
after visiting. Data was analysed by SPSS software 18.
Results: In the case group, the mean scores of physiological indexes (systolic and diastolic
blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation ) 10
minutes before visiting, during visiting and 10 and 30 minutes after visiting were not
statistically significant (p > 0.05) . But the differences were statistically meaningful in the
control group (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: According to this study, presence of family members and friends in CCU wards
based on programmed visiting does not make any significant difference in physiological
indexes of the patients, so there is not any reason for restricting visiting patients in CCU.

In this study, the operating conditions of an industrial fixed-bed ethylene oxide reactor are optimized via differential evolution (DE) algorithm to boost the ethylene oxide yield with taking into account the catalyst deactivation. A mathematical heterogenous model of the reactor has been used in order to evaluate the optimal operating conditions, both at steady state and dynamic conditions. Two different cases have been investigated in this regard. In the first case, optimum inlet molar flow rate, inlet pressure of the reaction side and temperatures of shell and tube sides have been obtained within their practical ranges. In the second case, a stepwise approach has been followed in order to determine the optimal temperature profiles for saturated water and gas in three steps during operation. The objective of eachÂ optimization case study is to maximize the ethylene oxide production rate. The effect of optimal operating conditions on the reactor performance has been compared with corresponding industrial conditions over a period of three operating years. 1.726% and 4.22% yield enhancement of ethylene oxide production can be achieved by application of first and second optimization case studies, respectively.

This paper is concerned with the method of impulsive controller design for linear systems with multiple-packet transmission. First, the mathematic model of respond closed-loop is built in terms of linear impulsive systems description. Second, on the basis of guaranteeing closed loop systems stability, the design method of the impulsive feedback controller and the design procedure are given. Finally, numerical simulation is provided to demonstrate that asymptotically stability of close-loop linear uncertainly impulsive system with multiple-packet transmission is guaranteed by using the impulsive controller.

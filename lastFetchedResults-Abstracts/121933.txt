Background: Considering the rapid increase in the prevalence of non - communicable diseases especially cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in different countries and the relationship between CVD risk factors in childhood and adulthood, from many years ago some successful interventions have been implemented in developed countries in order to improve lifestyle from early life .
Objective: To determine appropiate community-based interventions in order to improve the families' lifestyle for primary prevention of non-communicable diseases.
Methods: One of the projects of Isfahan Healthy Heart Program is called Heart Health Promotion from Childhood. Evaluating the present situation in Isfahan, Najaf Abad and Arak, different interventional strategies were planned and performed in Isfahan and Najaf Abad and Arak remained as the reference area. After 3 years, the outcome evaluation will show the efficiency of interventions.
Findings: The mean values of knowledge about risk factors were not different in three cities. Near half of the middle-and high school students had 2 hours of regular physical exercise in school (P>0.05). The mean duration of watching TV was about 4 hours in different parts. Despite the knowledge of students about the benefits of liquid oils, the most type of consumed fat was the solid hydrogenated fat. The most prevalent snacks were cheese puff, cake, biscuit, chips, fruit, bread & cheese and chocolate. In Isfahan and Najaf Abad 40.6% and in Arak 42.8% of students had at least one smoker in their family.
Conclusion: This project tries to provide a suitable model of community-based interventions compatible with the cultural and socio-economic context of our community to be implemented in the current education and health services.

A technocentric approach to the use of simulation software in production system design uses it as an expert tool to assist system designers in a one off design. A human centred approach, in contrast uses simulation software to support teams of users to make key decisions about system design. In addition, it provides support for continued improvement and development activities by the users. In order to achieve these aims, the software must be easily usable by users, involve clear graphics to act as a prototyping tool and be sufficiently robust to work within an industrial context. This paper describes three industrial experiences in the design and implementation of team based cellular manufacturing employing standard simulation software packages (highly complex graphic software: AUTOMOD, medium to high complexity: SIMA and low complexity: SIMVIEW) and accompanying standard participatory design techniques. Each failed to achieve the intended goal of human centred system design. Reflecting on this experience, principles for software and design techniques capable of realising human centred simulation objective are offered

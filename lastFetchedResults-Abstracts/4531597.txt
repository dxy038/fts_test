In recent years, a lot of work has been done in the field of Opinion Detection in blogs but most of the research is based on machine learning or lexical based approaches. The objective of this paper is to focus on Social Network based evidences that can be exploited for the task of Opinion Detection. We propose a framework that makes use of the major elements of the blogosphere for extracting opinions from blogs. Besides this, we highlight the tasks of opinion prediction and multidimensional ranking. In addition, we also discuss the challenges that researchers might face while realizing the proposed framework. At the end, we demonstrate the importance of social networking evidences by performing experimentation.

Summary form only given. Quantum teleportation, first proposed as a method for teleporting an unknown spin-1/2 quantum state from a sender, "Alice", to a receiver, "Bob", has been extended to continuous-variable quantum teleportation (CVQT). In this variant of quantum teleportation, Bob and Alice share a nonlocal entangled two-mode field which, ideally, should have perfect correlations between in-phase quadrature (\´position\´ x) and out-of-phase quadrature (\´momentum\´ p), although the requirement of perfect correlations can be relaxed somewhat. The experimental success of CVQT has recently been reported, with two-mode squeezed light providing the nonlocal, entangled source shared between Alice and Bob. The objective here is to consider whether CVQT has indeed been achieved, or could ever be achieved, in optical experiments employing conventional laser sources. In particular we show that, in the context of this experiment, Alice and Bob may not employ independent laser sources for their operations if the state is to be teleported, yet this requires them to share more than just the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) resource.

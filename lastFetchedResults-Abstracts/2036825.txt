Objective: To determine the effects of local administration of platelet rich plasma (PRP) on peripheral nerve regeneration in rat sciatic nerve transection model.
Methods: Forty-five male white Wistar rats were randomized into three experimental groups (n=15): Normal control group (NC), silicon group (SIL), PRP treated group (SIL/PRP). In NC group left sciatic nerve was exposed through a gluteal muscle incision and after homeostasis muscle was sutured. In SIL group left sciatic nerve was exposed the same way and transected proximal to tibio-peroneal bifurcation leaving a 10-mm gap. Proximal and distal stumps were each inserted into a silicone conduit and filled with 10 µL phosphate buffered solution. In SIL/PRP group silicon conduit was filled with 20 µL PRP. Each group was subdivided into three subgroups of five animals each and were studied 4, 8, 12 weeks after surgery.
Results: The animals were comparable regarding the baseline characteristics. Behavioral testing, sciatic nerve functional study and gastrocnemius muscle mass showed earlier regeneration of axons in SIL/PRP than in SIL group. Conclusion: Local administration of PRP combined with silicon grafting could accelerate functional recovery of peripheral nerve.  Easily available growth factors and bioactive proteins present in PRP may have clinical implications for the surgical management of patients after nerve transection.

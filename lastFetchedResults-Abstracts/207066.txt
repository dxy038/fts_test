Introduction: One of the most important subjects in modern biology is to explain the molecular mechanisms by which an organism adapts in response to environmental signals. In this area, the protooncogene c- fos is widely used as a useful marker for tracing stimuli in the nervous system. It is considered as a general transcription factor, which can regulate expression of related target genes.
Objective: The purpose of this research was to study the brain structures involved in seizure using c-fos expression mapping.
Materials and Methods: In this study, we used pentylentetrazole 65mg/kg, i.p, as a kindling inducing drug and approximately two hours after the drug usage, immunohistochemical analysis was performed using immunoperoxidase staining with c-fos antibody, ABC kit and DAB.
Results: Results showed a dramatic and specific induction of c-fos in the nuclei of neurons in dentate gyms, hippocampus, somatosensory cortex and limbic system.
Conclusion: It is possible that FOS, a nuclear protein binding to the regulatory part of some target genes such as proenkephaline which is widely released after seizure can contributes to neural plasticity.
Therefore, finding the relationship of FOS with target genes in forming appropriate response in nervous systems plasticity is of great importance.

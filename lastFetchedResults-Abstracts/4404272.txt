A single phase rectification technique with a new architecture and control scheme is proposed. The new circuit is constructed by connecting a single bidirectional switch and capacitor in parallel to the diode bridge rectifier. The control strategy is carefully designed to ensure the output voltage of the rectifier is above a chosen threshold and to maintain a high input power factor with reduced line current harmonics. Circuit configuration, design parameters, principles of operation and the mathematical analysis are presented. The proposed concept is verified by the experimental results over a range of cases studies. The experimental results are in accordance with the presented theory and confirmed the high input power factor with low harmonics content.

With the objective of monitoring motion within a room, we segment the two-dimensional (2D) floor space into discrete cells and encode each cell with a binary code word generated by a fiber. We design a set of k-neighbor-local codes to localize an extended object and, particularly when k=2, employ a 2D gray code to localize a human by tracking his or her footsteps. Methods for implementing the codes in a fiber web are discussed, and we demonstrate the experimental result with the fiber mat. The observed system performance confirms the theoretical analysis. The space coding technique is a promising low-cost candidate not only for human tracking but also for other applications such as human gait analysis.

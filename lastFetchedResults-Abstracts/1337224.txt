The objective of this clinical study was to report the prevalence of ocular disorders in a large population of horses from the Indian army. Both eyes of 500 horses were examined using a direct ophthalmoscope and by a transillumination procedure. Intraocular pressures were measured in several study horses. Fluorescein dye, Schirmer tear test, and menace testing were performed when indicated. Corneal culture swabs were collected from horses affected with corneal ulcers found on ophthalmoscopic examination. A total of 100 horses were found to be affected with some form of ocular disorder. The eye problems recorded were congenital eye lid disorders (2%) and included a subcutaneous cyst in the lower eye lid and slit in upper eye lid; conjunctivitis (12%); chronic interstitial keratitis (30%); a parasite in the anterior chamber (1%), which was however not removed for genus and species identification; phthisis bulbi (1%); uveitis (24%); glaucoma (13%); cataracts (3%); unilateral retinal hemorrhage (1%); luxation of cataractous lens (3%); posterior synechia (2%); and corneal ulceration (8%). Pseudomonas spp was the most common bacteria identified in horses affected with corneal ulceration. Vision-threatening ocular disorders are high in Indian army horses; this is a cause of major concern for the rider and the horse and, therefore, it is important to include ocular examination in horses as part of a routine and complete physical examination.

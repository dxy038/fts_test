The objective of this research is to monitor the vehicle motion against its external and internal constraints and to remove the existing safety risk, if any, based on the human-machine cooperative vehicle control. We begin by solving the problem of automatic lane following of a vehicle, where a vision system with a single camera installed inside the vehicle is used for identifying the vehicle pose with reference to the lane that the vehicle is following. To perform this task, the road with lanes was modeled by three connected plates. The perception net based method is proposed to identify lane and to estimate vehicle pose under all weather and lighting conditions as well as variations of the road conditions. As a result, the lane to follow under large noise as well as variants embedded in the street images can be identified. The 3D geometric relationship between the lane and the vehicle is also determined

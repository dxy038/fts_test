Results: Data analysis indicates that IBS patients significantly are higher than matched group in fear of publicly observable symptoms (P= 0.032), fear of cardiovascular symptoms (P= 0.01), fear of gastrointestinal symptoms (P= 0.001), fear of dissociative and neurological symptoms (P= 0.018), & general anxiety sensitivity (P= 0.003), and lower in joy (P= 0.005), control (P= 0.008), self- esteem (P= 0.001) calm (P= 0.006) and general happiness (P= 0.001). Although no significant differences were found in life satisfaction (P= 0.083) & efficacy (P= 0.09), fear of respiratory symptoms (P= 0.067), and fear of cognitive control deficiency (p= 0.097)..

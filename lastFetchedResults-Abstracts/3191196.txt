Many electricity utilities are currently orienting their passive distribution grids towards actively controlled networks in order to efficiently host increased levels of distributed energy resources. This development might lead to re-engineering the planning process as well as adding the necessary procedures,methods and tools. The state of this development is still undetermined. This paper presents the results of a worldwide survey conducted as part of Cigre&#769; working group C6.19 activities . on the tools and methods used in utilities for the planning and optimization of the distribution network. The objective of the survey was to determine the state-of-the-art and the required enhancements to the planning process in order to transition to a n active distribution network.

A Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) reconstruction method that uses clustered sparse representation and adaptive patch aggregation is proposed. First, we randomly extract image patch pairs from the training images, and divide these patch pairs into different groups by K-means clustering. Then, we learn an over-complete sub-dictionary pair offline from corresponding group patch pairs. For a given low-resolution patch, we adaptively select one sub-dictionary to reconstruct the high resolution patch online. In addition, nonlocal self-similarity and steering kernel regression constraints are integrated into patch aggregation to improve the quality of the recovered images. Experiments show that the proposed method is able to realize state-of-the-art performance in terms of both objective evaluation and visual perception.

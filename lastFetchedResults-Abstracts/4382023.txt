The objective of this special issue is to contribute to the progress and success of signal processing methods in social networks. We received a large number of submitted manuscripts, out of which seventeen papers were accepted for publication in this issue. These papers can be divided roughly into three categories: modeling of social network dynamics, inference in social networks, and applications. These categories are not disjoint, however, as papers often treat multiple aspects of social network analysis.

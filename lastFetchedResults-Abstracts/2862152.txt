This paper proposes an intelligent control scheme for DC voltage regulationin a DC micro-grid integrating photovoltaic (PV) generation, energy storage and electric loads. The maximum power generation of the PV panel is followed using the incremental conductance (IC) maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm while a high-performance local linear controller (LLC)is developed for the DC voltage control in the micro-grid. The LLC, as a data-driven control strategy, controls the bidirectional converter located between the battery and the DC micro-grid to regulate the micro-grid´s voltage at the specified reference value. In order to validate the controller different simulations including variations in the load and in the solar irradiance are performed. Finally a comparison with PI based controller demonstrates the advantages of the proposed control technique for regulating the DC micro-grid´s voltage.

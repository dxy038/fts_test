The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) to be constructed at ORNL is a collaboration of six laboratories. The beam current monitors for SNS will be used to monitor H-minus and H-plus beams ranging from the 15 mA (tune-up in the Front End and Linac) to over 60 A fully accumulated in the Ring. The time structure of the beams to be measured range from 645 nsec "mini" bunches, at the 1.05 MHz ring revolution rate, to an overall 1 ms long macro pulse. The beam current monitors (BCMs) for SNS have requirements depending upon their location within the system. The development of a general approach to satisfy requirements of various locations with common components is a major design objective. This paper will describe the development of the beam current monitors and electronics

This paper presents multiobjective flow network problem using fuzzy programming technique, which is useful for the planning, modeling and designing of flow network problems like communication networks, oil pipeline systems and power systems. Many authors have treated flow network problem with a single objective function. Practically, this is multiobjective (e.g., capacity, time, cost) problem. The multiobjective flow network problem is transformed to a single objective linear programming problem through a fuzzy membership function and the problem is solved by linear programming algorithm. An algorithm has been developed based on fuzzy linear programming algorithm. Examples are illustrated using the proposed algorithm.

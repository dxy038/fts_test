Milk progesterone (P4) concentrations of 1682 postpartum (PP) dairy cows during 2503 lactations were used to define and quantify the incidence of atypical ovarian patterns and to assess their impact on reproductive performance. A total of 257 animals (10.94%) with their first significant luteal activity after day 44 PP were considered a result of delayed ovulation type I (DOVI). Prolonged luteal activity (P4&gt;3 ng/ml for at least 19 days) observed in 170 (7.3%) and 161 (6.35%) animals during first and subsequent cycles was considered a result of the presence of a persistent corpus luteum (CL), respectively denoted as PCLI and PCLII. Following the demise of an oestrous cycle CL, a total of 322 (12.85%) animals showed a delayed ovulation Type II (DOVII) with P4&lt;3 ng/ml for &gt;12 days. In 238 inseminated animals (9.92%) prolonged luteal activity was followed by the CL demise which may indirectly indicate the incidence of a late embryo to early foetal mortality (LEM). In this study animals during 794 (31.7%) lactations had at least one atypical ovarian pattern before insemination that, in comparison to those with typical P4 patterns, contributed to a delayed conception (88.2 vs. 106.2 days), higher number of services per conception (1.49 vs. 1.8), lower first service conception rate (60.9 vs. 43.7%) and a reduced total conception rate (92.6 vs. 82.1%), all of which were significantly different at P&lt;0.001. The incidence of PCLI and PCLII before insemination resulted in a higher level of LEM. Milk progesterone monitoring offers an accurate and objective measurement of factors associated with PP ovarian activity which will assist in investigating the genetic and environmental factors affecting fertility.

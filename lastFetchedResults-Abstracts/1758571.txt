Objective
ation with tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) is recommended for adults who have close contact with infants aged &lt;12 months to protect young infants from infection due to Bordetella pertussis. This study assessed the acceptance of Tdap vaccination among parents bringing their newborn to a pediatric office during the first month of life.
s
s of all newborns were consecutively approached for participation by a study coordinator who provided written information about the study and a Tdap vaccine information sheet. After obtaining informed consent, a study coordinator reviewed contraindications for Tdap vaccination. Tdap vaccine was given by a clinic nurse, but parents with a history of ever receiving Tdap vaccine or of receiving a tetanus and diphtheria vaccine (Td) within the previous 2 years were excluded.
s
ndred parents were approached for study participation, of whom 40 (20%) were ineligible to receive Tdap vaccine primarily due to receipt of Td vaccine within the previous 2 years (32/40). Of the 160 eligible to receive Tdap vaccine, 82 (51.2%) received a dose. Although nearly 60% of vaccinated parents received Tdap vaccine the first time they were approached, over 40% received Tdap vaccine at a subsequent office visit occurring during the baby's first month of life.
sions
ng Tdap vaccine in the pediatric office increases access to vaccination for both new fathers and mothers. When hospital-based, postpartum Tdap vaccination is not a routine practice, office-based vaccination of parents offers an option for protecting young infants.

We report the suppressed vascular CD34 expression in renal cell carcinoma. This was found by quantitatively analyzing CD34 expression on normal and tumor derived EC by flow cytometry. In vitro studies revealed that culture of umbilical cord or dermis derived microvascular EC with angiogenic factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor induced downregulation of CD34. This angiogenesis-induced downregulated expression of CD34 adhesion molecule may contribute to the tumor mediated escape mechanism from immune surveillance. It is concluded that there are quantitative differences in expression of endothelial CD34 in different compartments of the vasculature, that angiogenic factors affect this expression and that subpopulations of EC exist with differences in EAM expression.

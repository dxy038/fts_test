Recently, researches on radio wave security sensors by using array antenna or MIMO(Multiple-Input Multiple Output) system have been attracting attention. These sensors utilize the property that MIMO channel matrix is sensitive to the propagation environment change in indoor multipath environment. Now the property is used for event detection, such as intrusion, by calculating correlation of MIMO channel matrices. Fundamental study has been performed, however, statistical property, or quantitative detection performance analysis, of the sensor was still remain to be clarified. So, our objective is to derive a probability density function (PDF) of the correlation coefficient and to demonstrate them experimentally. The PDF is a key function to derive detection rate and so on. In the conventional MIMO sensor, correlation coefficient of the channel matrix between with and without an event is used as a measure of events. Therefore, in this report we will derive the PDF of the channel correlation used in the conventional MIMO sensor theoretically and also show the validity by experimental results.

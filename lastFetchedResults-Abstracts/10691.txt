The Tehran metropolitan area is one of the mega cities of the world and has an annual domestic water consumption close to one billion cubic meters. The sewer system mainly consists of traditional absorption wells. Therefore, the return flow from the domestic consumption has been one of the main sources of groundwater recharge. Some part of this sewage is drained into local rivers and drainage channels and partially contaminates the surface runoff and local flows. These polluted surface waters are used in conjunction with groundwater for irrigation purposes in the southern part of the Tehran. In this paper, a systematic approach to surface and groundwater resources modeling in the study area, with its complex system of water supply, groundwater recharge, and discharge, is discussed. A dynamic programming optimization model is developed for conjunctive use planning. The objective function of this model is developed to supply the agricultural water demands, to reduce pumping costs, and to control groundwater table fluctuations. To develop the response function of the aquifers located in the study area, a mathematical model for simulation of the Tehran aquifer water table fluctuations has been developed and calibrated with the available data. Different scenarios are defined to study the long-term impacts of the development projects on conjunctive use policies and water table fluctuations. Comparison of the results showed how significant is the effects of an integrated approach to the surface and groundwater resources allocation in Tehran metropolitan area. The proposed model is a useful tool for irrigation planning in this region.

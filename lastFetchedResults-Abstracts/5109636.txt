Low utilization efficiency of spectrum, which is caused by fixed spectrum allocation scheme, is the bottleneck of wireless communication systems. Cognitive Radio (CR) is proposed to utilize the idle spectrum in an intelligent way while not interfering with primary users. For application of CR, the objective is the optimization of spectrum utilization. In order to achieve this, we propose a multi-channel transmission scheme in CR networks which is based on layered coding scheme. For ensuring QoS of secondary users, we assign the data with different priority to spectrum with different stability. The expectation-utility theory is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme according to supposed spectrum occupation states. Compared with existing data transmission schemes, the proposed scheme not only brings better satisfaction of users but also improves the spectrum utilization.

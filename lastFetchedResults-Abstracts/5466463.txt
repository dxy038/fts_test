This paper aims to study on swing-up control of linear spring-connected double inverted pendulum through establishing a mechanical model of the inverted pendulum with DÂ´alembert Principle. Taking discrete control quantity as design variables and terminal constraint condition as objective function, swing-up control laws are computed by an optimization method. The results of simulating show that swing-up control of linear spring-connected double inverted pendulum is realized successfully by the optimization method and therefore illustrates that this method is effective and feasible.

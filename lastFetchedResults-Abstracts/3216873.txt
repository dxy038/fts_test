Wireless Sensor Network (SENSORNET) is vulnerable to various security threats due to its deployment in open and hostile environment. Fast battery exhaustion of sensor nodes in SENSORNET is a challenging issue because it shortens the normal lifetime of sensor network. Affected nodes give rise to denial of service that resists to get the objective of SENSORNET in real life. In this paper, Battery Exhaustion Anomaly Monitoring System (BEAMS) model based on Absorbing Markov Chain (AMC) is proposed to detect battery exhaustion attack in SENSORNET. A mathematical model is considered to analyze whether SENSORNET is affected by battery exhaustion attack.

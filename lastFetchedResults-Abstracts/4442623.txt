Transmission line transformers (TLTs) have been used in the construction of high voltage pulse generators with great success since they can produce high voltage pulses of the order of hundreds of kilovolts with fast rise times (typically less than 100ns) which would be impossible to achieve using a conventional pulse transformer. These devices, also known as stacked cable transformers, consists basically of equal lengths of transmission line (normally coaxial cables are used) connected in parallel at the input side of the transformer, and in series at the output. The main objective of this paper is to present a simple circuit model for the analysis of the frequency response of such TLT devices, which allows reliable prediction of the frequency performance capabilities of these transformers

Objective: To evaluate the mRNA expression ratio of Bcl-2/Bax both in normal and tumoral
bladder
tissues
of patients with transitional cell
carcinoma
(TCC) of bladder and

investigate
potential correlation between this expression ratio and clinical outcome.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we used real time-PCR to investigate
the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax both in normal and tumoral bladder tissues. The Bcl-2/
Bax expression ratio was determined in tumoral bladder tissues of patients with transitional
cell
carcinoma
of the bladder (n=40)
and correlation between
expression ratios
and
the
emergence of early relapses in a follow-up of 14-30 months was examined.
Results: Relapse-free time in 14/31 patients (45.16%) with Bcl-2/Bax > 1 was shorter than
9 months (range of 2-9 months) with 5.7 months average median while 17/31 patients
(54.84%) with Bcl-2/Bax < 1 are currently relapse-free (14-30 months). Bcl-2 and Bax expression
levels were not solely correlated with clinical outcome
and progression of
carcinogenesis.
Conclusion: The mRNA expression ratio of Bcl-2/Bax in tumoral bladder tissues may
serve as a significant prognostic indicator in predicting the clinical outcome in low grade
non-invasive bladder cancer.

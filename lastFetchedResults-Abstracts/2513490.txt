Abstract
Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the staff empowerment and the organizational health in Youth and Sport General Administration in the province of Hamedan.
Methodology: The method implemented in this research work was descriptive-correlation. The statistical population of this work was the Youth and Sport General Administration staffs in the province of Hamedan (N = 161), and 118 persons were selected according to the Morgan simple random sampling method. The research instruments included the Hoy and Feldman’s (1996) organizational health and the Spreitzer’s (1995) empowerment questionnaires. Validity of the questionnaires was confirmed by the experts, and their reliability was approved based on the Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the staff empowerment questionnaire (? = 0.84) and the organizational health questionnaire (? = 0.92). Descriptive statistics were used to describe the status of the subjects and inferential statistics. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to evaluate the normal distribution of the data, and to examine the research variables, the Pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis test was used.
Results: The results obtained showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the empowerment and all the components of organizational health (the institutional level (r = 0.475, p = 0.001), management level (r = 0.278, p = 0.002), and technical level (r = 0.218, p = 0.019).
Conclusion: Managerial level, as a variable component of the organizational health, can be predicted by the staff empowerment, and the need for managers in this important matter requires a serious planning.

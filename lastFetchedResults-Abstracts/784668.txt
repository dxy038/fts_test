Objective: To examine the associations among health behaviors, healthy body weight, and use of
preventive services of adults 65 years and older using the 2007 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS) as a function of caregiving status. Methods: Participants (N=6,138) residing in the states of Hawaii,
Kansas, and Washington completed questions about caregiving. We examined if there were any associations
among body weight--having a healthy weight (body mass index 18.5–24.9 kg/m2); modifiable health behaviors--
not smoking, consuming ≤1 alcoholic beverage per day, consuming at least five fruits or vegetables daily,
participating in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity during the average week; and using preventive services--
receiving an annual influenza immunization, and ever receiving a pneumococcal immunization. Results: The two
groups did not differ significantly on the modifiable health behaviors of fruit and vegetable consumption,
smoking status, or alcohol consumption, or having a healthy weight. Caregivers were significantly more likely to
meet physical activity recommendations than non-caregivers (54.1%, 42.0%, respectively, p<0.001). No
significant differences were found between caregivers and non-caregivers on receiving influenza and
pneumococcal immunization. Conclusions: Older adults who are caregivers are more likely than other older
adults to meet government recommendations for physical activity; however, they have similar patterns of
engaging in other health behaviors, including health eating and use of preventive services.

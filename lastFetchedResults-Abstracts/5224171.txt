The GRADE (Graphical ATE Desktop Environment) operating shell, some requirements which prompted its design, and future enhancements are discussed. The objective of GRADE is to improve and standardize the user interface with automatic test equipment (ATE) while providing a platform that displays virtual instrumentation and allows paperless maintenance. The problem addressed in its development was how to simultaneously provide a consistent, easy-to-learn interface for the end user (thereby lowering training costs), satisfy the sophisticated text/graphics requirements for paperless technical orders, (multimedia) and virtual instrument front panels, and make only minimal changes to the ATE operating system (a nonintrusive ATE operating system shell)

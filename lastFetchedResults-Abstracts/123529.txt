Objective: This study sought the relationship between burnout syndrome of mothers in nursing professions and behavioral problems of their children. Method: Subjects of this cross-sectional analytical study were married female nurses (having children of 4-16 years of age) working in various wards of Rasoul-a-Akram hospital. The sampling method was convenience sampling. The data were collected using Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results: Of 29 nurses that participated, 16 (55%) had burnout syndrome and 13 (45%) did not. The children of mothers with burnout syndrome differed significantly regarding internalizing, externalizing, and total problems on CBCL. Personal accomplishment score was negatively associated to the child's externalizing problems on CBCL. Conclusion: In regard with the higher internalizing (depression, anxiety), externalizing (lying, fire. setting, and truancy) and total behavioral problems in children of the mothers with burnout syndrome, special measures should be taken to reduce the impact of mother's burnout on their children, for mothers in nursing professions.

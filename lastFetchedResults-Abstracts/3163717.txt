The requirement for fast identification, with accurate and reliable diagnostics for acute myocardial infarction or "Heart Attack" has generated what can be called "Point-of-Care (POC) " devices. This paper will use key engineering platforms developed that can address the need for improved clinical management in cardiology and reduce Health Service delivery costs. Our primary objective is to develop rapid and label-free Point of Care diagnostic tests for cardiac markers based on multi-frequency impedimetric transducers. Impedance testing using micro-scale interdigitated electrodes (&#956;lDE\Â´s) offers a much more rapid response compared to the reaction times of fluorescent label-based systems (~8 minutes). In the case of small gap of IDE impedance, we are seeing stable and predictive trends occurring after one minute. Therefore the overall benefit to the clinician and patient will be true point of care monitoring allowing a blood sample to be rapidly (1-2 minutes) analysed for a range of cardiac enzymes.

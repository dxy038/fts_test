Tritium breeding materials, which have the ability to react with neutrons and produce tritium, are required to fuel fusion reactions. Tritium is produced inside the fusion blanket by neutron irradiation of lithium ceramics (tritium breeders). Using the lithium ceramics in form of pebbles-packed bed is a promising concept for fusion blankets, and worldwide efforts have been dedicated to its R&D. Thermal properties of lithium ceramic pebble beds have a significant impact upon the thermal performance of the fusion blanket. Specifically, the effective thermal conductivity of lithium ceramic pebble beds is important for the design and analysis of fusion blankets. The experimental apparatus of this study was designed and built based on the principles of the steady state and axial heat flow methods in order to conduct the required measurements. The objective of this study is to measure the effective thermal conductivity of a Li2TiO3 pebble bed as a function of the average bed temperature. The pebble bed has pebbles of 1.7–2.0 mm diameter and a packing fraction of 61%. Helium at atmospheric pressure was used as a filling gas. The experimental results showed that the effective thermal conductivity decreased from 1.40 to 0.94 W/m K with the increase of the average bed temperature from 50 to 500 °C. The results presented in this work will help to create a database of the effective thermal conductivity of Li2TiO3 pebble beds which can be used for the design and analysis of fusion blankets.

The overall objective of the paper is to describe the concept of using genetic algorithms (GA) procedures in layout optimization of composite structures. The layout optimization is understood in the sense of stacking sequence, shape and size (material, volume) optimization. The attention is focused on the applicability of genetic algorithms in conjunction with the finite element computation of objective functions. Therefore, the problem of appropriate coding and selection procedures is particularly emphasized. Various numerical examples illustrate the discussed problems and show especially the effects of anisotropic material properties on optimization results.

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of interaction of adenosine and naloxone on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF).
Materials and Methods: Experiment were performed on morphine dependent rats using the Laser doppler flowmetry. Animal morphine dependency and injection of drugs were done through standard protocole.
Results: NaIoxone (3mg/kg,.S.c.) increased rCBF, heart rates and blood pressure significantly in morphine dependent rats (MDR). Adenosine (10-4M) and theophilline (5x10-5M) had no effect on naloxone-induced increase in rCBF. Naloxone (0.s,1.5& 3mg/kg .s.c) alone and co-application of naloxone ( o.5, 1.5 & 3 mg/kg .s.c) and adenosine (10-4M) increased rCBF in MDR that was no significant difference between different doses. Naloxone plus adenosine had stronger effect than naloxone alone on rCBF and the difference was statistically significant for 0.5 mg/kg naloxone plus adenosine.
Conclusion . Our results indicate that adenosine augment naloxone (low dose)- induced increase in rCBF of MDR, while relatively ineffective in high doses of naloxone.

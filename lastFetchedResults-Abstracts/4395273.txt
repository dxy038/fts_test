In this paper, the multi-objective optimal scheduling problem of micro-grid is studied in an uncertain framework. The Probability Density Functions (PDF) and Roulette Wheel Mechanism (RWM) are used to build the scenarios, which can describe the randomness and uncertainty of wind power, photovoltaic power and load demand forecast error. The dual goals of economic and environmental are analyzed with the system constraints. Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to coordinate them. Thus, a multi-objective stochastic optimization scheduling scheme is proposed based on scenario and PSO. Finally, in the simulation, the proposed framework is verified to be more effective compared with the deterministic framework for micro-grid.

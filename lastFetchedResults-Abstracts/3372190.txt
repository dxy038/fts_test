In this paper, next-generation ultralong reach code division multiplexing (CDM) on fiber (COF) passive optical network (COF-PON) based on CDM (multiplexing carried out in electrical domain) presented here. We describe the system configuration, COF transceiver, key merits such as bidirectional transmission (on the same wavelength with single fiber), extending the reach by coding gain, and offering huge bandwidth to large number of subscribers by overlaying on coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM)/wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). We believe our newly proposed ultralong reach COF-PON will help to drastically reduce the Capex and Opex costs by consolidating metro and access networks into one simple network. We demonstrated initial experimental results over 100-km bidirectional COF-PON overlay on 4lambda-CWDM channelsÂ´ transmission without the use of an optical amplifier

This paper focuses on the non-fragile guaranteed cost control
problem for a class of T-S fuzzy time-varying delay systems with local bilinear
models. The objective is to design a non-fragile guaranteed cost state
feedback controller via the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) approach
such that the closed-loop system is delay-dependent asymptotically stable and
the closed-loop performance is no more than a certain upper bound in the
presence of the additive controller gain perturbations. A sufficient condition
for the existence of such non-fragile guaranteed cost controllers is derived via
the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach and the design problem of the
fuzzy controller is formulated in term of LMIs. The simulation examples show
that the proposed approach is effective.

Indian plasma science is known for its deep theoretical insight. The U. S. program meshes with this, bringing experimental and computational techniques. As a result of this workshop, the papers produced are being published in a special issue of the Indian scientific journal, Pram&#194;&#191;n&#194;&#191;a. Also, five cooperative research proposals for future work have been sketched out. The school was covered by the press, and several articles in "The Times of India" have appeared. Finally, two extra days of discussion concerning future programs were held between Drs.

The Hong Kong schools solar education programme brings together Government, its Design and Education sectors, an electricity utility, CLP RI, academic researchers (PV HKU Research Group) and construction professionals to implement a programme that provides hands-on experience, IT skills and problem-based learning opportunities for (all) HK primary and secondary school children. Intended to raise their awareness and real understanding of the contribution of renewable energy technologies to everyday life, the programme has a further objective to expand the experience of local construction professionals in RET installations. At the same time the programme aims to create the start-up market for new industries specialising in related technology components, boosting their commercialisation and reducing costs plus reviving HK's industry sector. It's ultimate goal is to reduce CO2 emissions through setting the school target of 25% energy generation from RET technologies. BIPV installations are the initial technology. These are combined with a specially developed school BEMS and website-based monitoring system from which the first pilot school will be assessed. Mini-installations are to be funded and installed in all HK schools through the HK PV Consortium.

In order to correctly evaluate the safety of e-commerce systems, the use of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, proposed model of e-commerce systems and methods of safety assessment. Firstly, according to the characteristics of e-commerce system security, evaluation index system was constructed, and then describes the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, and identified the fuzzy evaluation matrix and a reasonable weight coefficient sets, the last example is introduced e-commerce application of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation system security assessment of specific steps. Experimental results show that the proposed security model can be applied to complex, versatile e-commerce system security assessment, and can provide scientific and objective evaluation results.

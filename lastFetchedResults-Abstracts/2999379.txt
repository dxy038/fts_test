This paper briefly discusses the concepts of symbiotic information systems (SIS) and their application to human-friendly robots. The objective of SIS is to realize a barrier-free intelligent information system that is accessible by anyone, regardless of his/her educational background. The main focus of this paper is on design and development of an Internet-shared telerobotic system implemented within the SIS framework. The system supports concurrent and collaborative operations of multiple shared robots by multiple remote users, and presents a user-friendly interface by providing high level commands and interacting via a real voice through a character agent

In this paper is analyze the advantages of using different inventory systems in supply chains involving echelons with different intentions in each one. This model is based on a network composed by eight nodes distributed between plants, distribution centers, warehouses and markets .The principal objective is analyze the influence of inventory systems as reorder point, periodic review and s-S inventory in the total cost of system and individual cost every node, through a simulation model development in Arena&#194;&#174; 10.0 with interface in visual BASIC and experiment design with two response variables, the averages of lost sales costs on markets and the average inventory costs on the distribution centers. The different systems of inventory influence in the total and individual cost.

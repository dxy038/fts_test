Urgent logistics is a complicated system, and the support capability evaluation for urgent logistics have a large number of attributes or aspects. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is a simple and effective way for multi-criterion and multi-objective analysis in system analysis and system assessment. In this paper, the meaning of urgent logistics and the general principle of AHP are first introduced. According to the master state plan for rapid response to public emergencies, there are four kinds of emergent public events will lead to urgent logistics. So six factors for urgent logistics are put forward based on the four kinds of emergent public events. A hierarchy model for urgent logistics is made in this paper. Through an example, the evaluation model of the support capability of urgent logistics based on AHP is analyzed. The result proves that the model in this paper is available for the evaluation of the support capability of urgent logistics.

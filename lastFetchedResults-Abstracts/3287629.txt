Energy management for residential homes and/or offices requires both identification and prediction of the future usages or service requests of different appliances present in the buildings. The aim of this work is to identify residential appliances from aggregate reading at the smart meter and to predict their states in order to minimize their energy consumption. For this purpose, our work is divided in two distinct modules: Appliance identification and future usage prediction. Both identification and prediction are based on multi-label learners which takes inter-appliance co-relation into account. The first part of the paper concerns the identification of electrical appliance usages from the smart meter monitoring. The main objective is to be able to identify individual loads from the aggregate power consumption in a non-intrusive manner. In this work, high energy consuming appliances are identified at 1-hour sampling rate using novel set of meta-features for this domain. The second part of the paper concerns future usage prediction. A comparison of algorithms for future appliance usage prediction using identification and direct consumption reading is presented. This work is based on a real residential dataset, called IRISE: 100 houses monitored every 10 minutes to one hour during one year (including weather informations).

An optimised schedule is vital for the operation of an interplanetary space mission. The scheduling problem of a mission with the scientific objective of reaching global coverage with more than one instrument is complex and highly restricted. Evolutionary algorithms can be an efficient method in solving scheduling problems and generating pareto-optimal alternatives. The application of an algorithm combining evolutionary strategy, genetic algorithm and differential evolution is demonstrated for a reference scenario of a low-orbit Moon mapping mission. A reduced set of restrictions is taken into account for creating a master schedule for the operation of three different instruments for the whole mission time. An optimal set of short term operation time lines for one orbit is generated, which can be combined to a complete mission schedule. The results show that more than one year mission time can be saved with an optimised schedule.

Internet communications with paths that include satellite link face some peculiar challenges, due to the presence of a long propagation wireless channel. In this paper, we propose a performance enhancing proxy (PEP) solution, called PEPsal, which is, to the best of the authorsÂ´ knowledge, the first open source TCP splitting solution for the GNU/Linux operating systems. PEPsal improves the performance of a TCP connection over a satellite channel making use of the TCP Hybla, a TCP enhancement for satellite networks developed by the authors. The objective of the paper is to present and evaluate the PEPsal architecture, by comparing it with end to end TCP variants (NewReno, SACK, Hybla), considering both performance and reliability issues. Performance is evaluated by making use of a testbed set up at the University of Bologna, to study advanced transport protocols and architectures for Internet satellite communications

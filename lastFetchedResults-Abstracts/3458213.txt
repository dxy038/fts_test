This paper integrates two existing methodologies-a single-objective dynamic programming method for capacity expansion and the surrogate worth tradeoff (SWT) method for optimizing multiple objectives -into a unified schema. In particular it shows 1) how a multiobjective mixed integer programming formulation representing the multiobjective capacity expansion problem can be translated into a multiobjective dynamic programming formulation, 2) how such DP formulation can be used to generate noninferior solutions, and 3) how tradeoff information can be obtained from solutions in 2). The necessary theoretical machinery for 3) is developed. To demonstrate the computational viability of the proposed schema, an example problem is formulated and solved.

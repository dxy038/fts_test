Three phase PWM boost-buck rectifiers with power regenerating capability are investigated. The converters under consideration are capable of (i) both voltage step-up and step-down, (ii) bidirectional power processing, and (iii) almost unity power factor operation with nearly sinusoidal AC current. Expected advantages are (1) applicability to lower voltage applications e.g. direct retrofit to replace diode or thyristor rectifiers, (2) switching loss reduction in the inverter load, (3) low order harmonic control in the inverter load output voltage, (4) blanking time effect mitigation in the inverter load, and (5) a modest level of voltage sag/swell compensation. In this paper, firstly, a step-by-step power stage derivation process is described. Then, taking the Cuk-Cuk realization as an example, its operating principle and modulation scheme are described. Steady-state model and dynamic model for controller design are also described. Representative results of circuit simulations and hardware experiments are presented. Through these procedures, the feasibility of the presented three phase PWM boost-buck rectifier with power regenerating capability is demonstrated.

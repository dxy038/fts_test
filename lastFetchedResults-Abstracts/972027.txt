
The present study evaluated the effect of Garlic (Allium sativum) and Ginger (Zingiberofficiale) extracts in rats. To achieve this objective,animals were assigned into the following groups as follows: Group 1: Served as control group and received 1ml of distilled water, Group 2: Received 20mg/kg b w of garlic, Group 3: Received 40mg/kg b w of garlic, Group 4: Received 20mg/kg b w of ginger, Group 5: Received 40mg/kg b w of ginger, Group 6: Received garlic 10mg and ginger 10mg/kg b w Group 7: Received garlic 20mg and ginger 20mg/kg b w. All administration was done orally for a period of 28 days. At the end of treatment all animals were sacrificed from all groups and blood samples collected and the serum separated for liver enzymes analysis. The liver tissue was carefully exicised and then subjected to routine histological investigation. The results of  the study showed no statistically significant (p > 0.05) difference on the level of serum ALT and AST in the experimental group fed with single and combined doses of garlic and ginger extract when compared to control group. There was also no significant change (p > 0.05) on serum level of ALP in the group that received 20 and 40 mg/kg b w of garlic respectively when compared to the control group. However, the serum level of ALP was a statistically significant different (p < 0.05) in the groups treated with 20 and 40 mg/kg b w of ginger and its combined doses when compared to their control group. The histological findings showed that the plant extract did not adversely affect the morphology of liver tissues in all groups treated with various doses of garlic and ginger extract at both single and combined doses administered to animals. In conclusion, the observed effect of the extract at both single and combined doses suggests a non toxic and deleterious effect of the plant extract on the liver tissue, hence safe for consumption especially in humans.

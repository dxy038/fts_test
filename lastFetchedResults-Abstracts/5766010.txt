Topology control plays a critical role in the design of wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. It can assign reduced transmit powers to nodes so as to create reduced topologies with certain desired properties. In this paper, we design an energy-efficient localized topology control algorithm. The design objective is to prolong the operational time of networks resulted by the implementation of localized topology controlling at nodes in network. For this purpose, our designed algorithm introduces the strategy of energy criticality avoidance in assigning nodal transmit powers as well as in selecting energy-efficient routes for packet deliveries. Simulation results demonstrate the high performance of our designed algorithm in prolonging the network lifetime as compared with related work.

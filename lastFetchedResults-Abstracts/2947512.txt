RCube is a reconfigurable network switching element that supports any topology and routes data packets of any length. It provides a simple but efficient support for adaptivity. Its architecture is based upon an 8&#215;8 cross-bar with 8 on-chip bidirectional one Gbit/s asynchronous serial links. The serial link technology is developed within the OMI-HIC Esprit Project. It is compliant with the IEEE 1355 standard for one Gbit/s point-to-point asynchronous serial link. RCube has been fabricated in 0.5 &#956;m CMOS process and has a latency of 150 ns

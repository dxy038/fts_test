Background and Objective: Silybum marianum has antioxidant, stabilizes cell membranes and regulate cell permeability properties. The aim of this study was to determining the effect of short-term silymarin supplementation on some of antioxidant (GPx and SOD) and oxidative stress (MDA) indices response in serum active men after one-session exhaustive aerobic exercise.

Materials and Methods: Twenty active male (mean age 25.09±2.11 years, body fat 13.56±1.94% and VO2max 50.5±4.88 ml/kg-1/min) in a quasi-experimental and double-blind design were divided into two homogeneous supplement and placebo groups of 10 subjects: (6 mg.kg-1.day silymarin or dextrose). After 14-days of supplementation, all subjects were participated in exhaustive aerobic exercise protocol (running on the treadmill at the 0% incline with 65-70% HR reserve until exhaustion). Blood samples were taken at four phases (baseline, after supplementation period, immediately and one hour after the exercise). 

Results: The results show that the 14-day silymarin intake had significant effect on the basal antioxidative enzymes (GPx and SOD) capacity (p?0.01). Moreover, exhaustive aerobic exercise in order the significantly reducing antioxidative power (P?0.05) and significantly increased the oxidative stress markers (MDA) (P?0.05). However, increased levels of oxidative stress markers of placebo group was significantly more than in the silymarin group (P?0.01). 

Conclusion: Our results suggest that increased basal antioxidative capacity following silymarin supplementation can cause decrease of the undesirable alterations of exercise-induced oxidative damage in active male.

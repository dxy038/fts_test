The scheduling algorithm is the key technology for the radio resource management. In order to match time-varying network environment, we introduce the conceptions of self-adaptation and multi-objective into the proposed scheduling method. There, Node B uses several parameters to calculate the scheduling priority. At the same time, the genetic algorithm is used to adjust the Weights of multi-objective scheduling algorithm in the background. The system simulation results prove that the scheme improves the system flexibility in time-varying network environment.

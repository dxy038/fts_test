The paper proposes a multi-objective optimization model of distributed generation optimal allocation in distributed network, comprehensively considering system operating cost and environmental benefit. The active network loss sensitivity analysis and voltage analysis is adopted to determine the location of distributed generation. A multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is presented to obtain the capacity of distributed generation. The algorithm incorporates non-dominated sorting and crowding distance to improve the diversity of the Pareto solutions The results in the IEEE-33 bus system application show that the method proposed can get reasonable site and size of distributed generation, greatly improving the economics and environmental protection of the power system.

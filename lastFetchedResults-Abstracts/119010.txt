Condition assessment is a term that is used to describe the process of characterizing the physical condition of constructed systems. This paper summarizes a condition assessment (CA) procedure based on a complete system of field-testing, finite element (FE) modeling, and load rating. Experimental techniques, including both modal testing and truckload testing, are used to collect measurements of the constructed systems. The basic mechanism and procedure of the FE modeling and calibration are presented. Different physical parameters of FE models are adjusted during the calibration process using both static and dynamic responses as criteria to achieve convergence between experimental measurements and analytical results using carefully developed objective functions. Finally, a bridge load rating is completed on the basis of the calibrated model. These developments are described and illustrated using a representative bridge as an example.

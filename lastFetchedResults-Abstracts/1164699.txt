Penicillium expansum is the most important cause of blue mould rot, a major post-harvest disease of apples worldwide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the inoculum size on the germination and growth parameters of P. expansum under different storage conditions in apples. Growth of P. expansum was observed in more than 90% of the inoculations, when the inoculum was equal or higher than 2Ã—104 spores. The use of a low inoculum level resulted in longer lag phases and a larger variability of the estimated lag phase. This indicates that more replications are necessary to estimate the lag phase of the mould in the specified circumstances. At lower temperature, more inoculum was necessary to reduce the variability of the estimated lag phase, showing that this effect is temperature dependent. Moreover, the effect of the inoculum level on the lag phase is even more pronounced for a slower growing strain. These results imply that the inoculum size influences the estimated growth parameters and should be considered in quantitative risk assessments and for the design of challenge tests and experiments to gather data for predictive growth models.

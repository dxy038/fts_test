The paper reports progress in current work at ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Korea) having the objective of verifying a standard test platform (STP) and developing the post-commercial hardware for W-CDMA systems. For many receivers, the single sideband (SSB) phase noise of the signal generator used to produce the interfering signal is a critical spectral characteristic. If the phase noise energy inside the passband of the IF filter is excessive, the receiver may appear to fail the test. So, we focus on the conformance test and results for the blocking characteristics of a receiver in a W-CDMA system based on 3GPP TS 25.141 and suggest some methods for exact measurement of the blocking test.

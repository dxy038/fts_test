Multi-layer backpropagation, like many learning algorithms that can create complex decision surfaces, is prone to overfitting. Softprop is a novel learning approach presented here that is reminiscent of the softmax explore-exploit Q-learning search heuristic. It fits the problem while delaying settling into error minima to achieve better generalization and more robust learning. This is accomplished by blending standard SSE optimization with lazy training, a new objective function well suited to learning classification tasks, to form a more stable learning model. Over several machine learning data sets, softprop reduces classification error by 17.1 percent and the variance in results by 38.6 percent over standard SSE minimization.

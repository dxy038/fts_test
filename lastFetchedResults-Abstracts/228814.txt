 Dry and dense snow avalanches are considered as dry granular flows. Theirinteraction with dams is the main objective of this paper. We studied howvarying the dam height could shorten a granular avalanche run-out thanksto a set of simple laboratory experiments carried out on different scales.Shortening the run-out was expected to depend on two effects: (i) storageof the granular material upstream of the dam, and (ii) local energy dissipations.A scaling law is highlighted. As suggested by dimensional arguments, thecontribution of the local energy dissipation was shown to be more dominantthan the storage effects.

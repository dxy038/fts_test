Starting from the deregulated process of the electric sector, there was the need to attribute responsibilities to several agents and to elaborate appropriate forms of remuneration of the services rendered by the same. One of the services of great importance within this new electric sector is the ancillary services. Among the various types of ancillary services, spinning reserve is a service necessary for maintaining the integrity of the transmission system from either generation interruptions or load variations. This paper uses the application of the economic dispatch theory with the objective of quantifies the availability of spinning reserve supply in hydroelectric plants. The proposed methodology utilizes the generating units as well as their efficiencies so as to attend the total demand with the minimum water discharge. The proposed methodology was tested through the data provided by the Agua Vermelha hydroelectric power plant. These tests permitted the opportunity cost valuation to the spinning reserve supply in hydroelectric plants.

A new line-commutated thyristor phase-controlled voltage source converter (VSC) with bidirectional power flow capability is proposed and studied. The proposed converter has the same structure with the PWM VSC. But, the switching devices are not forced-commutated ones but line-commutated thyristors, and it is operated not with the PWM but with the 6-pulse phase-control. As is the same with the PWM VSC, the output DC voltage can be regulated at its desired value, then the amount and direction of power flow are automatically controlled. The reactive power and harmonics are much smaller than those in the conventional thyristor phase-controlled current source converter. The proposed converter is expected to be useful for the voltage source inverter motor drive system with regenerative braking as the utility interface converter

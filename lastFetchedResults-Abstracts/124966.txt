Background: Hyperalgesia is one of the major symptoms of diabetic neuropathy in some patients and could affect life quality. Regarding treatment of hyperalgesia, there are some evidence for antidiabetic potential of tarragon in traditional medicine.
Objective: To evaluate the analgesic effect of oral administration of tarragon in streptozotocin-induced diabetic male rats.
Methods: This was an experimental study in which 40 rats were randomly divided into control, tarragon-treated control, salicylate-treated control, diabetic, and tarragon-treated diabetic groups. All treatment periods continued for one month. At the end of the experiment, nociceptive response was evaluated in both acute and chronic phases of the standard formalin test.
Findings: The results showed that there was an increase in the pain scores in both phases of the test and in diabetic rats (P<0.05), and administration of tarragon for one month did produce a significant reduction in nociceptive scores for both phases, especially in the chronic phase of the formalin test (P<0.05). In contrast, sodium salicylate as positive control only reduced pain scores in the chronic phase (P<0.05).
Conclusion: Oral administration of tarragon for one month has a significant analgesic effect in diabetic rats and this maybe considered as a potential treatment for diabetic neuropathy.

In order to improve the material supply capacity and the time efficiency of emergency relief system when bio-terrorism attacks happen, combining with the laws of dangerous source diffusion and considering the coordination relationship between national and city level repository of rescue network with supply base preparation system, this paper studied the problem of optimal model of emergency relief supplies distribution in anti-bioterrorism system and thus established the model of rescue materials distribution with supply base preparation system, whose optimal objective is minimization of rescue economic costs and decision-making costs. Through the numerical simulation by computer, the model with supply base preparation system has been proved that it not only has a much better distribution strategy but also can improve the efficiency of rescue work and lower the economic costs.

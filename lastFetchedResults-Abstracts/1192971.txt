Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate changes of anger scores in female karate athletes during 18 months, and to compare anger scores in adolescents who continue or stop training karate.
Method: The sample consisted of 18 female elite karate athletes, practicing modern style of karate. To measure anger and its subscales, participants were asked to complete “Adolescent Anger Rating Scale” (AARS) questionnaire in both stages of the study. Athletes were divided in to two groups of “stayer” (n=12) and “quitter” (n=6) if they continued practicing karate or stopped it, respectively. In order to study the changes of anger score with time, paired T test was used.
Results: In analysis of changes in anger scores with time, there was a statistically significant increase in instrumental anger (p=0.001) and non-significant increase in other anger scores among 14-year-old girls who continued practicing karate.
Conclusion:  Increased instrumental anger in female karate athletes could be due to the impact of participation in a combative sport. However, the results should be interpreted cautiously due to limitations of the study.

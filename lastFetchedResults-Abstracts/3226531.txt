The main objective of Load Frequency Control (LFC) is to maintain reasonably uniform frequency, to divide the load between generators, and to control the tie-line interchange schedules. The LFC is one of the most important issues in power system operation and control for supplying sufficient power of good quality with certain reliability. The control strategies guarantee that the steady state error of frequencies maintained in a given tolerance limit. This paper presents an artificial neural network based on Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMNN) for load frequency control of a power system. A comparison of the efficiency of the proposed ANN based corrective action planning with the conventional integral controller shows the superiority of proposed approach for different loading conditions in wide range.

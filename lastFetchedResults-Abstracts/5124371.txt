In the development of sensory prosthetic devices based on intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) an important objective is to optimize the stimulus waveform. However, because of the large design space such optimization is an imposing challenge. This study highlights the ability of individual rats, trained using a conditioned avoidance paradigm and performing an adaptive task, to generate highly consistent and significant data. Three experiments on the effects of phase delay, stimulus pulse rate, and waveform asymmetry were completed and revealed detailed and significant results. These results, consisting of 244 individual thresholds, were generated by one rat in 19 days.

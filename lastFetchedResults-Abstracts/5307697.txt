In order to realize the aircraft attitude measurement, The paper advances electro-optical theodolite methods of measuring the aircraft attitude by using the spatial cosines relationship the single station theodolite and how to use intersection of the multi-station theodolite. The single station theodolite was introduced in a measured distance from the aircraft posture information. An exhaustive approach was used to access to the aircraft axis of the feature points and the location in the space was used to obtain space posture parameters. The multi-station theodolite was introduced to get the information of the aircraft flight attitude by method of using planes to the intersection. Two-dimensional image to obtain objective axis by fitting algorithm using Hough transform. And then, Calculate the vertical distance of the origin to the target of the central axis and the origin to the target of the central axis of the angle between the normal and the X-axis obtaining the linear equation in the two-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional axis of the target image and the camera system´s optical center only identified a space plane. The aircraft yaw axis angle and pitch angle can be obtained by getting the space axis using plains to the intersection method. Experimental results show that attitude angle error of the single station theodolite is less than 1&#176; when its distance is less than 6000m and attitude angle error of the multi-station theodolite is less than 0.6&#176; when its intersection angle is between 30&#176; and 150&#176;. In this paper, according to test result of precision comparing the mathematical model is correct and the algorithm is reasonable in extracting effective parameters of the aircraft´s attitude.

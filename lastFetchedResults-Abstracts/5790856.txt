Risk evaluation of technology innovation is a complex issue, involving many factors. It is affected directly by the evaluatorsÂ´ knowledge, cognitive abilities and personal preferences, and hardly completely gets rid of bias caused by human. A comprehensive, systematic risk evaluation of technology innovation indicator system is established. Reference on AHP, the principal component analytic method, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, BP neural network method, using information fusion technology and the complicated, subjective evaluation of technology innovation risk is transformed into a deterministic decision problem. Present a comprehensive, objective risk evaluation of technology innovation.

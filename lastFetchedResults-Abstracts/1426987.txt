Objective
pare the efficacy and safety of adjunctive treatment with paroxetine or amitriptyline in patients with bipolar disorder who relapsed into a depressive episode during lithium maintenance therapy.
s
rom a randomized, double-blind trial comparing paroxetine (N = 18) or amitriptyline (N = 22) as adjunctive treatment for an episode of depression during lithium maintenance therapy were reanalyzed. Only patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder were included. The primary endpoint was the change in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D21) from randomization to study end (week 6).
s
was a significant reduction of HAM-D21 total score from randomization to study end in both treatment groups. The mean change in HAM-D21 score in the paroxetine and amitriptyline groups at study end was − 14.9 and − 15.5 (p = 0.798), and the mean HAM-D21 at study end was 8.2 vs. 9.9 (p = 0.420), respectively. The patients treated with paroxetine showed a more rapid improvement with lower HAM-D21 scores between weeks 3 and 5. Tolerability was similar in both groups.
tions
cebo comparator group and relatively small study sample size.
sions
tive treatment with either paroxetine or amitriptyline is a viable option for breakthrough depression during lithium maintenance therapy.

Based on the current model of a phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC) system, the electrolyte concentration is optimised. New analytical expressions for the power output and efficiency of the PAFC system are derived by considering the effects of multi-irreversibilities resulting from the activation overpotential, concentration overpotential, ohmic overpotential, and leakage resistance on the performance of the PAFC system. These parameters are used to evaluate the general performance characteristics of the PAFC system. Accordingly, the upper and lower limits of the optimised values for some main parameters, such as the current density, power output, and efficiency, are determined. Moreover, a multi-objective function, including both the power output and efficiency, is introduced and used to further subdivide the parametric optimum regions according to different requirements. In addition, a general formula for the load of the system is derived. The relations between the power output and efficiency of the system and the load are discussed in detail, and the optimum matching conditions of the load are obtained.

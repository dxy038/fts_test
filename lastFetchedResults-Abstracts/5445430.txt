This paper proposes the application of a new binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) method to feature selection problems. Two enhanced versions of binary particle swarm optimization, designed to cope with premature convergence of the BPSO algorithm, are proposed. These methods control the swarm variability using the velocity and the similarity between best swarm solutions. The proposed PSO methods use neural networks, fuzzy models and support vector machines in a wrapper approach, and are tested in a benchmark database. It was shown that the proposed BPSO approaches require an inferior simulation time, less selected features and increase accuracy. The best BPSO is then compared with genetic algorithms (GA) and applied to a real medical application, a sepsis patient database. The objective is to predict the outcome (survived or deceased) of the sepsis patients. It was shown that the proposed BPSO approaches are similar in terms of model accuracy when compared to GA, while requiring an inferior simulation time and less selected features.

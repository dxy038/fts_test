Secondary nasal correction of cleft patients is acknowledged to be a difficult problem. There are many different operations but few objective assessments of their results. We have evaluated the results of a modified Tajima operation by use of the Bristol computer technique. Eighteen patients were followed up for a mean of 33 months (range 10â€“56). Measures of asymmetry were obtained for different photographic views, preoperatively and at later postoperative visits.

In all views there was a significant improvement in shape in the early postoperative photos. This same improvement was also seen when comparing preoperative to late postoperative results i.e. this initial improvement is maintained over time. There was no significant difference between the early and late postoperative views.

In this small series the modified Tajima technique has given statistically significant lasting improvement. However, few other operations have been objectively assessed and hence comparison is difficult. We advocate the use of the computer technique for other procedures to allow meaningful comparisons between them.

Compared to bolted flange coupling systems, the force transmission is relatively complicated and the strength is relatively weak in the joint zone of the wedged-ring connection structure, therefore it is necessary to analyze parametric sensitivity and design optimization of the joint zone in order to increase connection strength and rigidity. Recent years, for a wedged-ring connection structure with two wedged-strips, the effects of geometrical, material and contact state parameters in the joint zone on connection strength and rigidity have been studied and some optimum results have been obtained: The effects of change of either contact state or geometrical parameters in the joint zone on structural equivalent stress are more than 10% the effect of material module is much smaller; under a certain tensional force, the maximum equivalent stress of the structure decreases by 21.1% through single-objective optimization, and the maximum equivalent stress decreases by 13.8% and the mass by 12.5% through multi-objective optimization. In this paper, parametric sensitivity analysis and optimization design of a wedged-ring joint structure are carried out, and meanwhile, the pertinent studies at home and abroad are briefly reviewed, it is mentioned that the present researches are still 2D axisymmetric and need to be developed to 3D cases in order to take 3D geometry of the structur- and 3D loadings into consideration more practically.

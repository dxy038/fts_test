We present in this paper a new  nite element formulation of geometrically exact rod models in the threedimensional
dynamic elastic range. The proposed formulation leads to an objective (or frame-indi erent
under superposed rigid body motions) approximation of the strain measures of the rod involving  nite
rotations of the director frame, in contrast with some existing formulations. This goal is accomplished
through a direct  nite element interpolation of the director  elds de ning the motion of the rod’s crosssection.
Furthermore, the proposed framework allows the development of time-stepping algorithms that
preserve the conservation laws of the underlying continuum Hamiltonian system. The conservation laws
of linear and angular momenta are inherited by construction, leading to an improved approximation of
the rod’s dynamics. Several numerical simulations are presented illustrating these properties

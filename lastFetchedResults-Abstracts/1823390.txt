Objective
endometrium has enormous regenerative capacity due to the presence of endometrial stem cells. The present study sought to assess the possibility of differentiation of these cells into odontoblast-like cells by in vitro induction.
s
trial stem-like cells were obtained using enzymatic digestion of the biopsy samples of the endometrium after hysterectomy and cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) which contained dentine non-collagenous proteins (dNCPs). The results were evaluated using the following assays: analysis of morphology, enzymatic assay for measuring alkaline phosphatase activity, Alizarin Red staining to detect in vitro formation of mineralized nodules, immunofluorescence for detection of dentine sialoprotein (DSP) and dentine-matrix protein (DMP1), and Western blotting for DMP1 expression.
s
ing induction, endometrial stem-like cells demonstrated high alkaline phosphatase activity, and expression of DSP and DMP1 confirmed the odontoblast phenotype. DMP1 level increased in samples treated with dNCPs.
sions
results indicated that odontoblastic differentiation of endometrial stem cells can be induced by extracellular matrix proteins (e.g. dNCPs). The capacity of endometrial stem-like cells to differentiate into odontoblast-like cells under specific conditions gives new insights into the mechanism of odontogenesis and highlights the potential of such approaches for further research on dental tissue regeneration.

The intelligent optimization method for designing Proportional Fractional Order Integral-Proportional Derivative (PI<sup>&#945;</sup>-PD) controller based on Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is presented in this paper. The proposed fractional order PI<sup>&#945;</sup>-PD controller is a generalization of the regular PI-PD controller. Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm offers optimal solution to multidimensional rough objective functions. The optimization design process based on Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is analyzed in detail in this paper, in which the optimization performance target is the integral time absolute error. The Simulation results show the proposed fractional order PI<sup>&#945;</sup>-PD controller is highly effective compared to the regular PI-PD controller.

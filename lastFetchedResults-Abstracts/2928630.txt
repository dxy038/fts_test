The objective of this paper is to indicate how digital higher-order spectral analysis may be used to determine linear and cubic radar cross sections given time series data representing the transmitted and received signals. The approach utilizes an orthogonal Volterra-like model. In this case, the absolute value squared of the linear and cubic frequency-domain &#8220;orthogonal&#8221; kernels can be directly related to the linear and cubic radar cross sections, respectively. Of note is the fact that the approach makes no assumptions concerning the statistics of the transmitted signal

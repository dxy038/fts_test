The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of the expression profile of E-cadherin and N-cadherin in newly diagnosed non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) on the probability of intravesical recurrence in patients undergoing transurethral resection (TUR). This study included 115 consecutive patients diagnosed as having NMIBC following TUR. Expression levels of E-cadherin and N-cadherin in TUR specimens from these patients were measured by immunohistochemical staining. In this series, intravesical recurrence occurred in 35 of 115 patients (30.4%). Immunohistochemical study showed that positive expression of E-cadherin and N-cadherin were noted in 62 (53.9%) and 48 (41.7%) specimens, respectively. Intravesical recurrence was detected in only 7 of 62 patients (11.3%) with positive E-cadherin expression, while 33 of 48 patients (68.8%) with positive N-cadherin expression developed intravesical recurrence. When patients were divided into 4 groups according to the positivities of E-cadherin and N-cadherin expression, intravesical recurrence was detected in 27 of 30 patients (90.0%) with negative E-cadherin as well as positive N-cadherin expression, and the intravesical recurrence-free survival of this group was significantly poorer than those of the remaining 3 groups. Furthermore, negative E-cadherin as well as positive N-cadherin expression was identified as the most powerful independent predictor for intravesical recurrence following TUR on multivariate analysis. These findings suggest that the loss of E-cadherin and gain of N-cadherin expression in on NMIBC appeared to be significantly associated with postoperative recurrence; therefore, the switch from E-cadherin to N-cadherin expression might be involved in the mechanism underlying intravesical recurrence of on NMIBC.

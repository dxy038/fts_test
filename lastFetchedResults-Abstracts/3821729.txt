This paper is used to investigate the optimal multiobjective planning of large-scale passive harmonic filters for a multibus system under abundant harmonic current sources using the hybrid differential evolution (HDE) method. The migrant and accelerating operations embedded in HDE are used to overcome traps of local optimal solutions and problems of time consumption. The design purposes are to minimize the total demand distortion of harmonic currents and total harmonic distortion of voltages at each bus. Filters loss, fundamental reactive power compensation, and constraints of individual harmonics are also considered. The search for the global optimal solution is applied to the harmonic problems in a steel plant, where both ac and dc arc furnaces are used and a static var compensator is installed. Three design schemes are compared to demonstrate the performance of HDE. Finally, expectations of objective function are used to present the effects of filter parameter detuning and furnace loading uncertainty.

Background and objective:Tuberculosis (TB) constitutes a major public health problem in most developing countries of the world. About one third of the world's population is infected with the disease, 95% of which are in the developing countries and 98% of all TB related deaths occur in these regions.The aim of this study was to assess beliefs of tuberculosis patients regarding tuberculosis disease and its treatment via on Health Belief Model (HBM) in referring to anti-TB center Zabolcity in 2011.
Material and methods: Adescriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on all thetuberculosis patients (110 people), referred to anti-TB center Zabol. Sampling method was non probability. Data were collected through a questionnaire which was designed based on HBM and included some additional information such as demographic variables and practice checklist. SPSS software
(Version 18) was used for statistical analysis.
Results: In this study 66 female (60%) and 44 men (40%)participated. The mean age ofparticipants was 55.7Â±18.6.Tuberculosis smear positive (SP) and smear negative (SN) incidence rate was 50% and 39% respectively. Statistically significant relationships were found between treatment behavior and self-efficacy (r=0.45, p < 0.01); perceived benefit (r=0.40, p < 0.05), perceived barriers(r=0.39, p < 0.05), perceived susceptibility(r=0.38, p < 0.05), and perceived severity (r=0.34, p < 0.01).
Conclusion: An overwhelming majority of the patients had poor knowledge and misconceptions concerning Tuberculosis,so our study highlights the need to changepatient'sattitudes about TB via HBM.

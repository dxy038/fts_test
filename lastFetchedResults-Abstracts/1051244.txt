Background and Objective: The somatosensory system plays an important role in balance control and age-related decline in somatosensory function has been implicated in falls incidence. Textured surfaces may provide an inexpensive and accessible means to enhance somatosensory input. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of somatosensory exercise on balance of elderly.

Materials and Methods: A total of 16 healthy elderly men volunteered for this study and were divided into two groups of somatosensory and control. In the pre and post subjects tests (limit of stability) of Biodex system was the difficulty level of 8. Exercises for both groups were performed 3 weeks, 5 sessions per week. Training session time was 1 hour of exercise which was described by Suzuki with the exception that somatosensory group exercises on the textured surface and control group exercises performed on a flat surface. 

Results: Results of repeated measures ANOVA showed that exercise walking on textured surfaces affects the balance (F =22.567, p=0.0001). There was also a significant difference between the control and somatosensory groups (F=3.329, p=0.048).

Conclusion: According to these research findings, walking practice on textured surfaces may stimulate pressure receptors in the feet and increase sensory input from the plantar that leads to improved balance in the elderly.

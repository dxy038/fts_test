Ultra Wide Band Short Range Radar (UWB-SRR) has attracted considerable attention in automobile applications. Detection performance of UWB-SRR depends on the echo signal from the target, which often contains unwanted echoes called as clutter. Since, the road clutter resembles to weibull clutter. The objective of this paper is to optimize the design parameters of proposed detector such as number of coherent integration and non-coherent integration for weibull clutter environment in automobile applications. Finally, the detection performance of the proposed UWB-SRR for various clutter power is analyzed and simulation has been done in order to verify it.

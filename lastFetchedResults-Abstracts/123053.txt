Objective (s): To determine the reasons why pregnant women refuse to attend government-run prenatal care facilities.
Methods: Subjects were 300 pregnant women who did not regularly attend prenatal care facilities in the city of Sari. Using a standard questionnaire, using a standard questionnaire, data were collected on demographic characteristics as well as attitude and satisfaction regarding state-run clinics.
Results: Fifty-four women (18%) attended both government and private care facilities. The remaining 164 subjects (55%) only visited private clinics.
The most important causes of refusal to attend public-sector facilities were: desire to be cared for by a specialist (32%), limited knowledge of State facilities (13%), and dissatisfaction with staff behavior in the public sector (11 %).
Conclusion: Lack of standardization in instruments, buildings and providers' skills seems to be the main reasons why pregnant women refuse to attend public-sector clinics.
To increase attendance rates, we suggest that state-run centers enhance the quality of their services and promote physical standards as well as providers' skills.

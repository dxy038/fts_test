A bidirectional, 16-bit data bus, which forms an extension of a "mini"-computer I-O bus, has been designed, including a controller for the bus, which allows individual control of up to 512 digital devices. One such device, a dual, programmable, 100 MHz, 16-bit scaler has also been designed and coupled to the bus. The circuits for the controller, bus, and scaler circuits are constructed of readily available TTL integrated circuits; therefore, this system could be adapted to most small computers.

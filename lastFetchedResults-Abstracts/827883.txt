It is commonly required that steam generator tubes wall-thinned in excess of 40% should be plugged. However, the plugging criterion is known to be too conservative for some locations and types of defects and its application is confined to a single crack. In the previous study, the conservatism of the present plugging criterion of steam generator tubes was reviewed and a crack coalescence model applicable to steam generator tubes with two collinear axial through-wall cracks was proposed. Since parallel axial cracks are more frequently detected during in-service inspections than collinear axial cracks, the studies on parallel axial cracks spaced in circumferential direction are necessary. The objective of this paper is to investigate the interaction effect between two parallel axial through-wall cracks existing in a steam generator tube. Finite element analyses were performed and a new failure model of the steam generator tube with these types of cracks is suggested. Interaction effects between two adjacent cracks were investigated to explain the deformation behavior of cracked tubes.

The objective of the learning factory is to integrate a practice-based engineering curriculum that balances analytical and theoretical knowledge with physical facilities for product realization in an industrial-like setting. The learning factory model emphasizes practical experience and consequently, all programs that stress hands-on experiences for students are well suited to implementing the model. This paper describes a project whose goal is to adapt the model for implementation in regular academic programs without having to build an actual factory. This was accomplished by modifying five carefully selected courses, leading to the use of coordinated projects across those courses. The projects focus on the making of functional model engines. In these courses, students generate engineering drawings of engine components, produce process plans for and make the components, and assemble and test the engines. This affords students practical experience and understanding of the full range of issues involved in product design, manufacturing planning, fabrication, assembly and testing of functional products.

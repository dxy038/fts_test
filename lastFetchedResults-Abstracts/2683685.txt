Objective: The study strived to investigate the effectiveness of “EMG biofeedback with relaxation training” on psychological symptoms in migraine patients in Isfahan.
Methods: To this end, two patients suffering chronic migraine were selected using purposeful sampling. This investigation used a single subject with A-B design. Intervention was started after determining the base-line. The “EMG biofeedback” was taught to each single participant for 24 sessions of 45-minute intervention sessions, and one month after the intervention period, the follow-up test was performed. The instrument used was “Stress, Anxiety and Depression Scales (DASS-21)”.
Findings: Based on that, the results revealed that during the visual analysis of data graphs for“EMG biofeedback” on psychological symptoms, the intervention was significantly effective for both participants.
Conclusion: This study showed that “EMG biofeedback with relaxation training” could reduce psychological symptoms (stress, anxiety) in migraine patients. As other studies have concluded, besides this treatment, taking medication could lead to improvement of common psychological symptoms in patients with chronic migraine and also prolong the time interval between attacks.

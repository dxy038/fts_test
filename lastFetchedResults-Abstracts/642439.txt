Objective
Homocystinemia is an important independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. Inflammatory cytokines play key roles in the development of atherogenesis. This study investigated the effect of homocysteine on inflammatory cytokine expression.
Methods

Human monocytes were treated in vitro with a variety of dl-homocysteine concentrations that ranged from physiologic concentration to higher than pathophysiologic concentration, and we analyzed their expressions of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-12, and migration inhibitory factor.
Results

dl-homocysteine at a marginal physiologic concentration of 2 μg/mL (15 μM) activated monocytes. In addition, dl-homocysteine at the pathophysiologic dose of 25 μg/mL (185 μM) induced mRNA and protein expressions of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and interleukin-12. Moreover, at the larger dose of 50 μg/mL (370 μM) dl-homocysteine decreased expression of migration inhibitory factor at the mRNA and protein levels.
Conclusion

These findings suggest that homocysteine may contribute to the initiation and progression of vascular disease by activating monocytes, resulting in the secretion of cytokines that amplify the inflammatory response.

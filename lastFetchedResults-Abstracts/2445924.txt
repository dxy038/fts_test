<p><strong>Objective:</strong>To determine the impact of a national intervention program on some pregnancy complications in Iran.<br /><strong>Materials and methods: </strong>this multicenter study was conducted in governmental sector in 14 provinces in Iran between 2003 and 2005. Intervention included education of all maternal health care providers including gynecologists, general physicians, and midwifes in the governmental sector. Time interval between the pre- (of 3,978 and 3,958 pregnancies) and post- (3,958 pregnancies) measurements were 18 months. Self reported data on pregnancy complications were registered. Interviews were conducted by trained personnel. Participants were interviewed when admitted for delivery or at the time attending for vaccination of their 2 month infants.<br /><strong>Results:</strong>The following pregnancy complications were reduced significantly as compared to before intervention: 1) bleeding or spotting, 2) urinary tract complications, 3) blurred vision and severe headache, 4) premature labor pain, 5) anemia, 6) severe vomiting, 7) inappropriate weight gain, 8) endometritis, 9) urinary incontinence, 10) breast abscess or mastitis, 11) wound infection, and 12) bleeding was significantly reduced after intervention, compared to before intervention. Premature rupture of membrane showed a significant increase. These complications did not show a significant change: 1) hypertension, 2) fever and chills, 3) convulsion, shock, and loss of consciousness, and 4) obstetric fistula.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong>National programs may be proved to be largely effective by decreasing some of the pregnancy complications in developing countries.</p>

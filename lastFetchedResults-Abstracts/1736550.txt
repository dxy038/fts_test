The general objective of this in vitro study was to examine the secretory activity (insulin-like growth factor I, IGF-I) of porcine ovarian granulosa cells after Ag addition and to outline the potential intracellular mediators (cyclin B1 and caspase-3) of its effects. Ovarian granulosa cells were incubated with silver nitrate (AgNO3) at the doses 0.09, 0.17, 0.33, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/mL for 18 h and compared to the control group without metal addition. The release of IGF-I by granulosa cells was assessed by RIA and expression of cyclin B1 and caspase-3 immunocytochemistry. Our observations show that IGF-I release by granulosa cells was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) stimulated by AgNO3 addition at the doses (0.09–1.0 mg/mL). Similarly to IGF-I the cyclin B1 and caspase-3 expression in ovarian granulosa cells was stimulated by Ag addition (0.09–1.0 mg/mL). In conclusion, the present results indicate, a direct effect of Ag on (1) secretion of growth factor IGF-I, (2) expression of markers of proliferation (cyclin B1) and apoptosis (caspase-3) of porcine ovarian granulosa cells and (3) that the effect of Ag on ovarian cell proliferation could be mediated by IGF-I and cyclin B1. Obtained data indicate the interference of Ag in the pathways of proliferation and apoptosis of porcine ovarian granulosa cells through hormonal and intracellular peptides such as are cyclin B1 and caspase-3.

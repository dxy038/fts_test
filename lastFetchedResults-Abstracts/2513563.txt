Scholars of rhetoric have long been regarding artistic aspects and the specific exquisite creation of, and in a word, beauty of the Quran and have expressed it in different forms. Today, perhaps the word “image” can be replace with all those views so that we can understand the secret of immortality of the Quran and its deep influence in the heart of audience in a simple language and without the use of rhetoric complicated terms. To conform the rule of “image” on the Meccan and medina chapters separately (in this case two chapters Mudathir and Munafiqun) will bring us considerable results that its outcome is the profound and precise attention of the verses of the Quran to the typology of the audience, the situation of place and time and finally proving its being a miracle. Meccan verses seek to establish the thought and in subsequence seek to penetrate a belief at the heart, so its backing must be terms with exquisite, effective and wonderful images with an overwhelming and explicit tone. In contrast, Medina verses seek to influence for pragmatism; fulfilling on the base of that established thought of audience; so, its backing must be terms with images; this time the images are less and with detailed, peaceful and widespread manner. The main objective of the present study is addressing this issue, studying its qualification and finally reaching the conclusion that it was mentioned briefly.
Keywords: Image, Artistic imagery, Seyyed Qutb, Munafiqun chapter, Mudathir chapter.

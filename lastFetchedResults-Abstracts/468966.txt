Objective
The purpose of this study was to compare wound healing by human amnion epithelial and mesenchymal cells from preterm and term placenta with the use of an in vitro lesion repair assay.
Study design
Lesions were created in confluent monolayers of amnion epithelial and mesenchymal cells from preterm and term placentas. The repair was monitored by the measurement of the lesion area and the response to potential stimulants (platelet-derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, fibrinogen, and phorbol myristate acetate). Cell proliferation was detected with 5-bromodeoxyuridine staining.
Results
Lesion repair was complete within 40 hours in control epithelial cultures from preterm and term placenta but incomplete in mesenchymal cultures (preterm cells, 80%; term cells, 40%). Platelet-derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, fibrinogen, and phorbol myristate acetate did not accelerate repair in either cell type.
Conclusion
An in vitro lesion repair assay revealed the differences in lesion repair capacity between amnion epithelial and mesenchymal cells and between mesenchymal cells from preterm and term placenta.

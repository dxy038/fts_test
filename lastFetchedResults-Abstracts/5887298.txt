The objective of this study is to create a wheel-type anthropomorphic robot to support those who are unable to eat independently. The constructed robot comprises mainly an omni-directional base, a fixed torso mounted on the base, two seven-degrees-of-freedom arms, two robot hands and a head equipped with a panoramic camera and a pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ) camera. For feeding tasks, a vision-guided control strategy is proposed to determine the poses of the meal tray and the human mouth by using the uncalibrated PTZ camera. Additionally, an intelligent coordination control scheme is proposed to drive two robot arms to carry the meal tray.

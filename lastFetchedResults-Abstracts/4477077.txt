This paper presents a preliminary study of the existing MDT-based taxi dispatch system at Blue Bird Taxi, the leading taxi service provider in Indonesia. The aim of Global Positioning System (GPS)-based Mobile Data Transfer (MDT) system implementation in Blue Bird Taxi is to address passenger waiting time reduction, taxi dispatch time reduction, and increase passenger satisfaction. Although numerous evaluations on GPS-based system in taxi service have been implemented in many countries, little has been said on the implementation of the taxi dispatch system based on positioning system such as MDT in Indonesia. The general objective of this research is to assess: (i) perceived benefit of existing MDT system, (ii) usage level of existing MDT system, and (iii) driver loyalty on using MDT. The particular objective of this research is to consider the importance of knowledge on existing MDT functionalities. The result of this research is expected to give contribution to improve service quality of taxi service delivery, particularly in the Blue Bird Taxi.

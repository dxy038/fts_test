An analytical design model is presented for a salient hybrid synchronous machine topology that utilizes both a field winding and permanent magnets (PMs). The model is designed to be used in a multi-objective design process to establish the trade-off between mass and loss. Within the model, the field distribution as well as qd-axis model parameters are established from design data, containing material properties, stator and rotor geometries, and winding layout. The calculated parameters include resistances, inductances, and the back-emf of the machine. The model is validated by comparing predicted results with those obtained using finite element analysis (FEA).

Background: Control of the medium osmolarity and temperature during long or short time sperm manipulation is essential.
Objective: The objectives of the present study were to find the effects of different osmolarities of modified Tyrode's solution and milk on the bull sperm during incubation at above zero temperatures.
Materials and Methods: Semen samples were collected twice from five Najdi bull. Centrifuged and most parts of seminal plasma were removed. First experiment: The concentrated semen were splited into nine aliquots to incubate in three different osmolarities (200, 300 and 400 mOsm) at three temperatures (5, 25 and 39°C) for 15 and 60 min of incubation. Second experiment: The semen samples were splited, mixed with the same volume of whole cow milk (5 and 25°C) and milk with 7% glycerol (5°C) and incubated for 15 and 60 min. 
Results: Sperm motility severely affected (p<0.05) by incubation at low ionic tension (200 mOsm/l) especially at low temperature (5°C). The impact of low osmolarity on sperm viability can reduce by increasing the incubation temperature to 39°C. The decreased sperm motility, which was induced by lowering osmolarity, was not improved (p>0.05) by increasing temperature during 1 h of incubation. Milk can protect the sperm viability and motility at cool conditions and there is no beneficial effect of glycerol in combination of milk on sperm incubation at above zero temperatures (p<0.05).
Conclusion: Iso- and hyper-osmotic solutions protect bull sperm motility and viability at 25 and 39°C, while milk can be used for protecting sperm at 5°C.

Introduction & Objective: To evaluate the risk factors associated with morbidity from gallstones in diabetic patients.
Materials & Methods: We analyzed data from 669 cholecystectomies performed between March 2002 and December 2003.
Results: Among 669 patients, 116 had complications. Complications included 68 adhesions, 26 gangrenes of the gallbladder, 14 pancreatitis, 20 hydropses, and 5 perforations. In univariate analysis, age, diabetes, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease were significantly associated with increased risk of complications. In multivariate analysis, only diabetes caused a significant increase in complications, with odds ratio (OR) of 6.1 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 3.8-9.9). Diabetes was also significantly associated with an increased risk of adhesion (OR = 59; 95% CI: 3.3-10.5), gangrene (OR = 7.6; 95% CI: 3.1-18.5) and pancreatitis (OR = 4.5; 95% CI: 1.3-15.8).
Conclusions: Although this study does not directory support prophylactic cholecystectomy, increased morbidity in the diabetics with gallstone, mention that we should pay more attention to diabetic care in symptomatic either non symptomatic patients.

The response of a spacecraft to a surface electrostatic discharge was predicted using lumped-element modeling. Current-injection testing on an actual satellite verified the predications and characterized the transient pulses coupled into electronics boxes. These tests duplicated, very closely, and ESD (electrostatic discharge) stimulus on one of the solar panels. This work makes extensive use of STARSAT SGEMP methodology. Its ultimate objective is to develop a spacecraft-level test for engineering development of spacecraft systems and for qualification tests on fully assembled spacecraft

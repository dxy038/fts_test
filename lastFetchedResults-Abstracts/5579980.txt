The objective of this paper is to present an optimal design methodology to determine the best firing strategy, energy store sizing, energy store spacing and maximum system efficiency for a distributed energy store (DES) railgun. System simulations/designs are based on the assumption that switching of the energy storage units is accomplished using solid-state devices. Candidate semiconductor technologies are promising in relation to solving the high energy, low weight requirements of a railgun system and other pulsed power systems requiring high energy, compact switching. A simulation code has been developed and used to produce nondimensional data files that are then scaled to physical railgun values based on input parameters. Capacitive in nature with diodes to prevent negative currents and crowbar diodes to prevent voltage reversal of the capacitors. The main thrust of this simulation effort is to produce a DES design that optimizes the efficiency of the conversion of stored electrical energy to projectile kinetic energy, while also considering the abilities of near term solid-state switching devices.

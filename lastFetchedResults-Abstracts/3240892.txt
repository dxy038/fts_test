A reactive power optimization method for distribution network based on power loss sensitivity analysis is proposed. Take the minimized sum of power loss and the investment of reactive power compensation devices as objective function to build the mathematical model for optimization. According to the features of distribution network, i.e., numerous nodes, complicated structures and generous amount of calculation, sensitivity analysis method is used and appropriate improvement is made on it. Both of the network structure and load distribution are considered and through matrix calculation to get the sensitivity indexes .The compensation capacity at the installation buses is decided by the Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA). The test results on IEEE28-bus system demonstrate the validity with fast calculation, lower energy loss and higher voltages.

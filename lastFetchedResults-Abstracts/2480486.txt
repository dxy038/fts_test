ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Oxidative stress is the most common effect of diazinon on living organisms, which leads to the dysfunction and destruction of pancreatic tissues. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Salvia officinalis extracts and optional exercise on histological changes of the pancreas in rats poisoned by diazinon.
METHODS: In this laboratory study, 35 male Wistar rats were divided into five groups, each consisting of seven rats: control, diazinon, diazinon-extract, exercise-extract and exercise-extract-diazinon groups. The exercise groups practiced on a spinning wheel for four weeks. The rats in the experimental groups received 200 mg of diazinon intraperitoneally once during the intervention. In addition, they received 100 mg of the extract for four weeks (five days a week). The rats were sacrificed 24 hours after the final injection. Pancreatic tissue sections were prepared for microscopic studies.  
FINDINGS: The number (4.32±0.67) and diameter (15.84±1.01) of the islets of Langerhans and the number of acinar cells (47.32±4.01) in the diazinon group showed a significant reduction, compared to the control group (6.44±1.38, 16.17±1.2 and 50±7.06, respectively) (p < 0.05). However, a significant increase was observed in the evaluated parameters in diazinon-extract, exercise-extract and exercise-extract-diazinon groups, compared to the diazinon group (p < 0.05). 
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicated that Salvia officinalis extracts and optional exercise could reduce pancreatic tissue damages, induced by diazinon injection.

Emerging high volume low power variable speed AC motor drives have the stringent requirements of low cost and compactness. Most low power, low performance applications use two phase induction motors. Operation of the inverter for a two phase induction motor is investigated in this paper employing a square fed delta modulation scheme. The objective of the work is to provide a cost effective inverter which can induce a change from constant speed to variable speed operation in the low power range

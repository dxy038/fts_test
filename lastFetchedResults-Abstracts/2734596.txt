The paper aims at describing the nature of numerical models used in EMC studies and their inherent assumptions and limitations. The ultimate objective is to elucidate the manner in which, together with measurements, they can be used to get a better understanding of EMC phenomena and assist in the design of EMC compliant systems. Part I of the paper covers the more general generic aspects of numerical modeling and some more specific technical areas. Part II will address the remaining important technical aspects of EMC modeling.

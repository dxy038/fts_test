Computerized analysis of lung sounds can play a very important role in management of patients with a variety of medical conditions, particularly those who are seriously ill. While single-channel devices can play an important role in making auscultation more objective, multi-channel instruments greatly improve the efficiency of data collection. This has a particular advantage in the rapid assessments of patients who are in acute distress from cardiopulmonary conditions. As noted, it has the distinct advantage of being noninvasive. This is a particular advantage in the case of children and pregnant women. A number of other groups are currently working with multichannel devices, but have not yet reported their findings. The future will likely see improved acoustic instruments useful in diagnosis and management of medical conditions

Background: Despite the fact that recent studies suggest a narrowing in access to mammography, Black women are much more likely to die from breast cancer than White women. Data at the community level regarding mammography screening can help explain health disparities and inform plans for improved screening efforts. Methods: In 2002–2003, a comprehensive household health survey in English or Spanish was conducted in six community areas with 1700 households. The module on mammography was based on a state-based nationwide health survey and included questions on frequency of mammography, repeat screenings, and several demographic variables. Results: The proportion of women ≥40 years (n = 482) who received a mammogram in the past 2 years ranged from 74% to 90% across the six communities. The community with the highest screening proportion was predominantly Mexican and included recent immigrants. The screening proportion in the poorest community area, which was all Black, was 77%. Women with health insurance, higher income, and more education were more likely to receive a mammogram. Proportions for women ≥50 years (n = 286) were slightly higher but similar. Repeat screening, which is recommended, occurred at lower levels. Conclusions: Access to and utilization of mammography have grown in recent years so that even these vulnerable communities had screening proportions at or even higher than the national average and the Healthy People Year 2010 objective. Nonetheless, repeat screening sequences were lower and may require attention if mammography screening efforts are to have a greater impact on female breast cancer mortality.

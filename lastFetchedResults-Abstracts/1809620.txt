Background: Primary and secondary infertility are the most common presenting symptom in patients with pelvic tuberculosis (PT). Endometriosis is commonly associated with an increased risk of infertility.
Case: Here, we report a rare case of coexisting PT and endometriosis in a 30-year- old woman, and the effects of controlled ovarian stimulation on reactivation of pathogen.
Conclusion: Coexisting endometriosis and tuberculosis of fallopian tube and ovary, as in present case, may alter clinical and radiological features, leading to difficulty in diagnosis. Early diagnosis with surgical exploration and adequate treatment can improve the chances of conception and also minimize morbidity

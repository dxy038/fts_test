A new algorithm for effectively removing impulsive noise in digital images is proposed. The computationally efficient algorithm presented first classifies corrupted pixels and then performs median filtering for them only. New efficiency factors are introduced to compare the performance of the noise detection algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than existing methods in terms of both objective and subjective evaluations

Constitutive modelling of metal powder compaction processes is a challenge in view of realistic simulations. To this end, the article under consideration has two objectives: the first goal is to present a new unique and convex single surface yield function for pressure dependent materials, which is also applicable to other areas of granular materials such as soils or concrete. The flexibility is shown at various materials. The yield function is based on a log-interpolation of two known simple yield functions. A convexity proof of the new yield function is provided. The second objective is to propose a new rate-independent finite strain plasticity model for metal powder compaction, which is based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into an elastic and a plastic part with evolution equations for internal variables representing the basic behaviour of powder materials under compaction conditions. These variables are used for the evolution of the yield function in order to represent the compressible hardening behaviour of powder materials. On the basis of the constitutive model, the material parameters are identified at experimental data of copper powder.

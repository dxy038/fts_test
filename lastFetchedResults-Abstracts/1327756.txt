In this research, novel information technology and advances in communication and machine control systems were combined into a method intensifying construction control. Changes in the operation environment of constructors have revealed a clear need for more efficient process management. The objective of this research was to improve process management through more effective information integration, processing, and exploitation, leading to an intensified infrastructure building process with more effective process control and reaction to process status changes. Based on requirements gathered through interviews with domain professionals, the developed method exploits ontology-based information formulation to integrate design and as-build data with the help of advanced communication and machine control applications. In addition to actual construction process control, the use of the developed method potentially intensifies operations before and after the project, enhancing process efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and eco-efficiency. The results of the presented development phase will be verified in the following practical implementation phase.

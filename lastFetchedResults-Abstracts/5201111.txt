This research focuses on a contribution to high quality video and audio transport system using network infrastructure. Our objective is to enhance the realization of higher communication environment using easy high quality transport application. Basic structure of DVTS (Digital Video Transport System) is based on transporting DV (Digital Video) through the Internet. DVTS realizes cost effective solution using DV, to perform high quality audio and video communications. Our research goal of this year is to enhance usability of DVTS by implementing multiple audio transmission system, portability enhancement to DVTS, Multi point, real time editing capability, and implementation of MPEG2-TS. We established a new communication model using DVTS as a base of communication method.

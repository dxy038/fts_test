In this paper, we present a physical validation of global illumination algorithms based on measurements from a
simple experimental setup. The validation methodology emphasizes tractability and error minimization. To this end,
we discuss issues such as the acquisition and accurate simulation of material bidirectional reflection distribution
functions (BRDFs) and the light source distribution, as well as error analysis. In addition, we present a nearestneighbor
resampling technique for BRDFs and a simple method for extracting the light source distribution from
digitized high dynamic range (HDR) images. Finally, we compare the measurements to a forward and backward
raytracing solution (photon map and RADIANCE, respectively) in a set of case studies.

This paper presents the results of the feasibility study of a millimeter-wave system-on-chip Dicke radiometer for space-based detection of solar flares, operating at a frequency of 36.8 GHz and expected to be implemented in a 0.25 &#956;m SiGe BiCMOS technology by IHP, under Space evaluations. System analysis and circuit simulations are presented and discussed. The results show a resolution of 0.7 K for an integration time of 0.04 s. These results support the objective targeted with the first implementation of a SoC radiometer for space-based detection of solar flares.

Cell selection in current LTE-Advanced depend on reference signal received power or reference signal received quality which results to low user association probability. Therefore, we propose an aggregate objective cell selection technique based on enhanced inter-cell interference coordination technique developed by 3GPP in Rel-10 known as almost blank subframe. We also adopt the use of cell range expansion technique as means to encourage offloading. Cell range expansion was introduced in LTE-advanced, it encourages user equipment to select a small cell with a weakest signal as thier serving cell by adding a positive bias in cell selection process. Simulation shows that the proposed scheme results to high user association probability, while giving superior performance in average throughput compared to conventional single objective base cell selection for cell range expansion.

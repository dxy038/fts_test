Negative interactions between earthworms may arise from high earthworm population densities. Under high populations in the field, niche separation or migration away from competitive pressure may help to regulate a multi-species population to a given level. This may not be possible in laboratory experiments, leading to an increase in competitive interactions which may alter earthworm growth rates and affect decomposition and nutrient mineralization processes. The objective of this experiment was to determine how growth rates of the endogeic earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa Sav. and the anecic earthworm Lumbricus terrestris L. are affected by increasing population density and container size in both single- and multi-species cultures. Earthworm growth responses were compared in 1-L cylindrical pots containing disturbed soil and in 2.3-L PVC cores containing undisturbed soil. The relationship describing intra- and inter-specific competition was not affected by container type for both species. Nonetheless, decreasing the container size restricted the growth of L. terrestris in both single- and multi-species cultures, but only restricted the growth of A. caliginosa in multi-species cultures. For both species, a population density greater than one individual per litre reduced earthworm growth rates significantly, while weight loss in monocultures occurred when there were more than 10 A. caliginosa, and more than three L. terrestris per litre. Growth rates of both species were restricted in all population density treatments including the lowest of 0.9 individuals per litre. Further work is needed to find the population density at which growth rates are not affected and which may be used as an appropriate population in laboratory pot experiments to measure the effects of earthworms on soil processes and plant growth.

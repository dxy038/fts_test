This paper presents an innovative way of using the two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier transform for speech enhancement. The blocking and windowing of the speech data for the 2-D Fourier transform are explained in detail. Several techniques of filtering in the 2-D Fourier transform domain are also proposed. They include magnitude spectral subtraction, 2-D Wiener filtering as well as a hybrid filter which effectively combines the one-dimensional (1-D) Wiener filter with the 2-D Wiener filter. The proposed hybrid filter compares favorably against other techniques using an objective test.

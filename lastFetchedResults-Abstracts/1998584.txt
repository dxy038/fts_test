Our objective was to determine if the phycobiliproteins of Arthrospira (Spirulina) maxima protect renal cells against mercury-caused oxidative stress and cellular damage in the kidney. We used 40 male mice that were assigned into eight groups: (1) a control group that received 100 mM phosphate buffer (PB) ig and 0.9% saline ip, (2) PB + HgCl2 (5 mg/kg ip), (3) PB plus phycobiliproteins (100 mg/kg ig), (4) PB plus C-phycocyanin (100 mg/kg ig), and four groups receiving HgCl2 + phycobiliproteins or C-phycocyanin (50, and 100 mg/kg ig). The left kidneys were used to determine lipid peroxidation, quantification of reactive oxygen species, and reduced glutathione and oxidised content. The right kidneys were processed for histology. The HgCl2 caused oxidative stress and cellular damage. All doses of phycobiliproteins or C-phycocyanin prevented enhancement of oxidative markers and they protected against HgCl2-caused cellular damage.

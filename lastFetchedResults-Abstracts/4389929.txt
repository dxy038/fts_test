This paper addresses the development of an integrated navigation system based on MEMS inertial sensors and GPS for model aircraft. The objective of this paper is to propose a loosely coupled GPS/INS integration approach using Extended Kalman filter to estimate aircraftÂ´s position, velocity, and attitude. Special attention is paid to the computational performance of the algorithm and the handling of GPS outages. The simulation results based on a typical high dynamic flight trajectory validate that the proposed filter is applicable to flight navigation.

Cold roll forming is a kind of high production but complex metal forming process under coupled effects with multi factors. Due to the fact that cold roll forming is still being developed empirically, no generalized methods have been obtained to perform theoretical or optimization design of roll profiles. This paper studies on the optimization design of cold roll forming based on the response surface method. The mathematical models that represent the effect of forming angle increment, roll radius on springback angle and maximum edge membrane longitudinal strains are established respectively by response surface method. The optimization process is performed, with the springback angle as the objective function and maximum edge membrane longitudinal strains as constrain condition so as to assure the high forming accuracy and minimum roll stands for efficiency, and also eliminate the edge wave defects of products.

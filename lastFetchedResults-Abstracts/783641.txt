Objective To evaluate discrepancies
between parent and child reports on youth’s emotional
and behavioral problems in a representative, community
based sample of Greek 18-year-olds, and to identify
associated factors. Methods A total of 2,927 completed
pairs of parent-child questionnaires were studied,
including the child behavior checklist (CBCL) and the
youth self-report (YSR). Linear regression analysis was
used to identify both child and parental characteristics
significantly associated with parent/child disagreement
on scores for youth’s Internalising, Externalising and
Total problems scales for both genders separately. Results
Although there was a strong correlation between
scores on the YSR and CBCL corresponding scales,
parent/child discrepancies were more likely to occur
when the later: had good academic performance, were
dissatisfied from their self-image or their life. Parental
factors that influence discrepancies in parent/child
scale scores were: low paternal education for both
genders, father being the informant for boys, and
maternal stress and lack of awareness of leisure activities
for girls. Conclusion The associations found
highlight the contributions of both parents and children
to the discrepancies on emotional and behavioral
problems in adolescence. This study may facilitate
constructive parenting practices through generations

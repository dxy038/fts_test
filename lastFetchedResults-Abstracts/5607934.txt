Frequent occurrences of meteorological disasters (MD) in recent years have revealed the deficiencies of traditional transmission network planning (TNP) methods, which fail to establish mathematical relationship between the MD and the transmission line outage rate (TLOR) when calculating the vulnerability index of transmission network. As a result, the planning schemes are usually unable to determine the critical lines that should be guaranteed in the event of MDs, which is against the basic principles of economy and reliability. In this paper, a differentiation based method to TNP is proposed to optimize the fortification standard levels of different transmission lines for improving the anti-disaster ability. A three-state meteorological model is firstly developed to evaluate the effect of MD on TLOR; then a multi-objective TNP model is built considering economy and vulnerability objectives. Results show the TNP method can determine the fortification standard level of each transmission line for improving the anti-disaster ability while minimize the construction cost as much as possible, which is of significant reference value to the TNP under the meteorological disaster-prone environment.

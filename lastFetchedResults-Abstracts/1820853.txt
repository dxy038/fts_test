Objective
m of this study was to investigate possible gender differences in salivary metabolism of two alcohols, ethanol and 2-propanol. Ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde may play important roles in tumour development, especially in the upper digestive tract. 2-Propanol is tested to elucidate our previous findings, where gender-specific differences in salivary acetone levels were seen after exposure to this alcohol.

 was collected from 25 females and 22 males for in vitro exposure to 2-propanol. In the experiments with ethanol, saliva samples were collected from 17 females and 18 males. The saliva was exposed in vitro to 2-propanol or ethanol. The metabolites acetone, derived from 2-propanol, and acetaldehyde, derived from ethanol, together with the maternal substance were analysed by headspace gas chromatography.
s
ferences related to gender, age, medication or tobacco intake in the acetone concentration in the saliva samples were found. Gender, age or tobacco intake did not result in difference in the production of acetaldehyde in saliva. However, in the pre-exposure samples the men had a significantly higher concentration of acetaldehyde compared to the women (p = 0.04). Also, there was a tendency (p = 0.05) to higher concentrations of acetaldehyde in the samples (at 1 mM ethanol exposure) from subjects who take medications.
sion
der difference in the metabolism of 2-propanol and ethanol in human saliva in vitro were found.

This work proposes the use of a hyperbaric chamber in order to verify and validate the calibration in a marine geophone sensor before and after the pressure underwater laboratory test. The focused objective is the behavior respect to frequency of coupling between the geophone and the sediment to characterize its transfer function. The calibration of the 3 axes of the geophone up on the sediment box are made with a shaker table. We can observe the variations of coupling sensibility of the sensors of the geophone work through the sediment after the test inside the hyperbaric chamber at 20 atmospheres of water pressure.

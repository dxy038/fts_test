This paper presents a new approach for realistic modeling of antenna. The presented method is applied for UWB antenna. The objective is to derive an equivalent and complete model of the antenna which can be straightaway integrated into a simulation system. The developed model is a parametric one and takes into account the complex gain (amplitude and phase) of the antenna. Its determination can be obtained from measurements or from full wave electromagnetic simulation

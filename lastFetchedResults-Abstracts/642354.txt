Objective
Misplacement of subclavian vein catheters has been reported. We assessed the rate of misplacement of a subclavian vein catheter with and without a novel stylet.
Methods

A prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted between September 2001 and June 2003 in a university hospital. Two hundred sixteen adult patients were enrolled to receive subclavian vein catheterization under non-emergency conditions. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo right subclavian vein catheterization with the stylet (n = 109, stylet group) or without the stylet (n = 107, control group). The rate of subclavian vein catheter misplacement was determined and risk factors for failure and complications were analyzed.
Results

There was no incidence of catheter misplacement in the stylet group, but this occurred in 12 patients in the control group in whom the catheter was misplaced into the ipsilateral internal jugular vein (0% versus 11.2%, P = 0.0003). In multivariate analyses, use of the stylet (odds ratio = 0.062, 95% confidence interval = 0.008 to 0.495, P = 0.009) and a close to average body mass index (odds ratio = 0.73, 95% confidence interval = 0.54 to 0.98, P = 0.038) were associated with low risks of complications and failure, respectively.
Conclusions

This stylet is useful for decreasing the incidence of misplacement of subclavian vein catheters. Body mass index is predictive of failed vein puncture.

In this paper, we present the Smart City Architecture developed in the context of the ARTEMIS JU SP3 SOFIA project. It is an Event Driven Architecture that allows the management and cooperation of heterogeneous sensors for monitoring public spaces. The main components of the architecture are implemented in a testbed on a subway scenario with the objective to demonstrate that our proposed solution, can enhance the detection of anomalous events and simplify both the operators tasks and the communications to passengers in case of emergency.

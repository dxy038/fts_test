In this paper, field coverage generated by antenna locating in rectangular tunnel is studied. Ray tracing method is utilized to simulate the wave propagation in tunnel environment, the correctness of the method is validated by FDTD method and measurement. After verification, the influence of antenna position, beam direction and beam width on the field distribution is analyzed and discussed. The effect mechanism of antenna pattern on the field distribution in tunnel is studied. A hybrid approach which contains ray tracing method and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed to optimize the antenna radiation pattern, orientation and location in the tunnel environment, the objective is to generate uniform field coverage in the tunnel.

In this study we give a new representation of fuzzy numbers with bounded supports and also we show that fuzzy number means a bounded continuous curve in the two-dimensional metric space. We consider definitions of the addition, subtraction and product which are defined by the extensions principle due to Zadeh and many other theoreticians of fuzzy logic as well as we show parametric representation of the operations between fuzzy numbers. Our aim of this research is to establish solving fuzzy optimization problems which consist of nonlinear or linear objective functions and constraints including fuzzyness. We have two important problems. One is to deal with some order relation, which are linear or the other. The other is to get criterion for the optimal solutions,by considering saddle points of the Lagrangian functions

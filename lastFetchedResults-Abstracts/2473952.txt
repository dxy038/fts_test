<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To study maternal and neonatal outcomes, the nulliparous women submitted to a training program in third trimester.<br /><strong>Materials and methods:</strong> This randomized controlled trial was carried out on 64 nulliparous pregnant women divided into two groups according to their participation including; training group; n=34 or not; n=34. The program consisted of 8 meetings (between the 28 th and the 40 th gestational week) during which educational activities were developed. The control group received the standard care. Maternal and neonatal outcomes also were recorded. Data were analyzed by SPSS 16, and P&lt;0.05 wasconsidered significant.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> There was no significant difference in age and body mass index in both groups, but a significant difference was found in both the gestational age based on last menstrual period (LMP), and ultrasonography, as well as in the cervix dilatation at the time the women arrived for delivery in both groups (P&lt;0.05).The difference was also significant in the reasons of admission in hospital (P=0.04), oxytocin induction (P=0.01), mode of delivery (P=0.01), and gestational age of infants based on physical examination in both groups. Birth outcomes were also similar in both groups and no adverse effects of the interaction were found.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Antenatal training program in nulliparous women was associated with arriving at maternity ward in active labor, decreasing oxytocin induction, and cesarean section and increasing the gestational age of infants based on physical examination, Training program offered to pregnant women by midwives, is an important low-technology health promotion tool, and may be performed at low cost in most settings . Whether these results also apply to multiparous women or not, requires additional studies.</p>

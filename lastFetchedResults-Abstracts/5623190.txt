This paper is aimed to solve the multi-facility location problems of distribution centers by multi-objective decision method. After analyzing the requirements and characteristics of distribution time, it put forward a multi-facility location model in which the distribution cost was taken as decision objective and the distribution time was changed to a group of constrains. It designed a bi-step heuristics to solve the model based on conventional iterative algorithms of center-of-gravity approach and MATLAB optimization function. The study indicates that it generally only increases limited costs when the distribution time is considered in solving the location problems, and the bi-step heuristics is effective to deal with the multi-facility location problems with timeliness constrains.

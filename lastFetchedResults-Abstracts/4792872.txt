Adapting a software system to the changing requirements and demands of the users is a big challenge in the area of software evolution. Representing these requirements in a high-level abstraction seems to be an optimal target. Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is one of the techniques that support this objective. Model transformation (automated and semi-automated), being the core mechanism in Model Driven Architecture (MDA), is considered to be the key factor in producing various software artifacts from all levels of modeling. Recently, the application of MDA to Web services has received considerable attention. This article introduces an approach of developing Web services by using model driven techniques, combined with the tools available on the market. We also present a view from a higher level of abstraction, describing particularly meta-model transformation using Kermeta.

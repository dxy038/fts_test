The BIOMASS mission is designed to map the full range of the worldÂ´s above-ground forest biomass, for the needs of national scale inventory and global carbon flux calculations. This objective is achieved with advanced P-band SAR techniques. The P-band biomass measurement concept was based on previous work over the past two decades. During the preparatory phase, new campaigns have been conducted to address critical issues on the biomass retrieval algorithms, over tropical and boreal forests. The collected datasets comprise accurate and complete sets of in situ data and advanced P-band SAR data. This paper presents the retrieval algorithms developed using the collected datasets.

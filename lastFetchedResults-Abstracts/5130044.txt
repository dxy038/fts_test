The adoption of conflict management methods in many software engineering activities indicates a trend towards a consistency orientation for designing the end product. In this context, the objective of this work is twofold: (a) to demonstrate how to check the feasibility of the design solutions and (b) to provide a framework for guiding the consistency restoration process by providing conflict resolution schemes. To achieve this objective, a new approach the Goal-based Scenario Analysis (GBSA) approach has been developed. GBSA investigates all kinds of goal-originated inconsistencies and errors and their impact to the ways that goals are operationalised, leading to alternative scenarios

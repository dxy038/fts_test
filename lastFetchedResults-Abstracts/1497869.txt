The objective of this paper is to give an overview of the programs, projects and technologies related to the use of biofuels in Brazil. An evaluation of the biomass availability and electricity generation potential for different industrial and agricultural sectors is also presented. As a result an estimation of the overall technical potential for electricity generation based on biofuels in Brazil is presented as well. In addition, the state-of-the-art of different biomass electricity conversing technologies is discussed. A diagram is presented about the organization links and funding of biomass energy research activities in Brazil. Main development and research activities being carried out in this area at the Excellence Group in Thermal Power and Distributed Generation - NEST at the Mechanical Engineering Institute of the Federal University of Itajubل - UNIFEI, located in the city of Itajubل, Brazil are presented.

An optimun pre-emphasis network for the transmission of a FM television signal which is received at or near threshold is described. Objective and subjective measurements of video signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) versus received carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) for an optimum and CCIR pre-emphasis network are given. The results show that there is an improvement of about 2 dB in SNR using the optimum pre-emphasis network over that achieved with the CCIR network. Subjective tests also show a preference for use of the optimum pre-emphasis network. These results are useful in the design of low cost earth terminals to receive higher quality television signals from a satellite transmitter.

Background and Objective: In radiotherapy, measurement of the output factor in the air is one of the input parameters for Implementation of treatment planning systems and beam modeling. The aim of this study is to design a mini-phantom and select the appropriate detector for measuring the output factor.
Subjects and Methods: In-air output factor was measured for Siemens linear accelerator 6MV energy and field sizes of 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 2 cm irradiated by 200MU. Measurements were performed using a Gafchromic film EBT2 and 0.6cc Farmer ion chamber and then the results were compared with Report of AAPM Therapy Physics Committee Task Group74. For lateral electron equilibrium and electron contamination removal, two top of the water and Cerrobend were designed for film dosimetry and plexiglass buildup cap for Farmer chamber was applied. 
Results: The output factor increases with field size, and this increase in Cerrobend top is less than water top and Farmer dosimeter. In comparison between the results reported by TG74 and this study shows that film dosimetry with water top and Farmer chamber have  0.35 and 0.68 mean percentage differences with TG74 respectively and meanwhile the film dosimetry with Cerrobend top presents 1.48 mean percentage differences. 
Conclusion:  EBT2 film with mini phantom made of water as a good alternative to ion chamber dosimeters known as a standard dosimeter especially the film can be used for a wider range of field sizes.

The influence of the aggregate size on the fracture energy, tensile strength and elasticity modulus in different types of concrete are analyzed. For this purpose, nine simple cement-based composites have been designed, manufactured and tested, with one objective to provide experimental results that can be used as a benchmark for checking numerical models of concrete fracture, as this simple composite (a matrix, spherical aggregates of the same radius, and two types of matrixâ€“aggregate interface) is amenable to modelling. All in all, 44 specimens were tested. From notched beam tests, values of the fracture energy and modulus of elasticity were obtained. The tensile stress was deduced from indirect standard tensile test. Data for bilinear softening functions extracted from the experimental measurements are also provided. Comparison with available experimental data is also included and discussed.

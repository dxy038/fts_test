OBJECTIVE: The present study was performed to investigate the role of 5-HT, A receptors in dorsal and median rapbe motel on the withdrawal syndrome of morphine and acceleration the restraint of opioides. 111710 16t Experiments were performed on adult male wiatar rats weighing between 225 and 275 g. The control group (nab) had 9 days s.c. injections of morphine (5, 10, 10. 15, 15, 20.20.25. 25mg/kg1/2h) and the last day, 60 minutes after fuss injection of morphine. 5mg/kg oaloxone was injected (i.p.) and signs of withdrawal syndrome were recorded will 60 minutes. In the shim and test groups following induction anesthesia, rats were secured in a sterectaxic frame with ear and incisor bars. Than a guide caumula was implanted into the DRN and MRN in the separated groups (nom). After five days recovery of animals, injections of morphine began and the 9th day, 55 minutes after first s.c. injection of morphine, 1 miu l/2min of 1-(2-metbaypheanyl)-4-(4-(2 pthalimido) butyllp4aazi-s hydrobromide (NAN-190) vehicle was injected into the nuclei in the sham group. But in the test groups, 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 pg/plrmin of NAN-190 (antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors) was injected into the nuclei, and then oaloxone was injected (i.p.). RESULTS: Data signs were analyzed by one way ANOVA and Tukey post test The results of this study showed a significant decease in some of the recorded morphine withdrawal signs (jumping p<0.05, writhing p<0.01 and wet-dog shakes p<0.001) in test groups in comparison with the control getup. CONCLUSION: The results confirmed the impartial hole of 5-HT1A receptors in raphe nucleuses cm some of the morphine withdrawal signs and may dissolve problems of opiades addiction.

An efficient method for the synthesis of 3,5-branched octaarabinoside, which is a dimer of the tetrasaccharide present in motif B of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall, has been developed by using 2,3,5-tri-O-benzoyl-(alpha)-D-arabinofuranosyl trichloroacetimidate,   5-O-acetyl-2,3-di-(O-benzoyl-(alpha)-D-arabinofuranosyl trichloroacetimidate, 1,2-O-isopropylidene-5-O-trityl-(beta)D-arabinofuranose, dodecyl 2.3-di-(O- benzoyl-(alpha)-D-arabinofuranoside and phenyl 2,3-di-O-benzoyl-l-thio-(alpha)-D-arabinofuranoside as synthons.

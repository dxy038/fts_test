Stereoscopic Quality of Experience (QoE) is the result of a complex combination of different influencing factors. Previously we had investigated the effect of factors such as scene content, camera baseline, screen size and viewing position on stereoscopic QoE using subjective tests. In this paper, we propose two objective metrics for predicting stereoscopic QoE using bottom-up and top-down approaches, respectively. Specifically, the bottom-up metric is based on characterizing the significant factors of QoE directly, which are scene content, camera baseline, screen size and crosstalk level. While the top-down metric interprets QoE from its perceptual attributes, including crosstalk perception and perceived depth. These perceptual attributes are modeled by their individual relationship with the significant factors and then combined linearly to build the top-down metric. Both proposed metrics have been validated against our own database and a publicly available database, showing a high correlation (over 86%) with the subjective scores of stereoscopic QoE.

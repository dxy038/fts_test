Objective
This study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of transvaginal ultrasound-guided ovarian interstitial laser-coagulation treatment in anovulatory women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Study design
Nineteen anovulatory women with clomiphene citrate-resistant PCOS underwent ultrasound-guided transvaginal ovarian interstitial YAG-laser treatment. In this study, serum hormonal level, spontaneous ovulation rate, and pregnancy rate were assessed.
Results
With a spontaneous ovulation rate of 84.2%, 16 of 19 cases ovulated regularly during the 6-month postoperative period. The mean serums luteinizing hormone and serum testosterone levels in the second, fourth, and sixth postoperative months were significantly lower than preoperative levels: 5.87 ± 2.04 IU/L versus 13.17 ± 3.03 IU/L (P< .001) and 2.98 ± 1.79 nmol/L versus 5.49 ± 3.23 nmol/L (P< .001), respectively. The mean luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone ratio was also significantly lower postoperatively at 1.09 ± 0.30 compared with the preoperative 2.85 ± 1.14 (P< .001). There was a cumulative pregnancy rate at 6 months of 32.3% (6/19) among the subjects. No significant operative complications were encountered.
Conclusion
The ultrasound-guided transvaginal ovarian interstitial laser treatment may be an effective new method to manage anovulation in PCOS patients.

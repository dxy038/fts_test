Textile industries consume large amounts of water and generate highly dye-contaminated effluents. Textile wastewaters have to be treated in order to be recycled in the process or to meet legislative requirements before being discharged. The objective of the present study was to examine the potential use of the vacuum membrane distillation process for the treatment of dyed solutions. Methylene blue (MB) was used as a model dye. Batch experiments were conducted on dilute MB-water mixtures using a tubular polypropylene membrane module. The concentration of MB dye within the feed reservoir was monitored over time. The impact of operating variables such as feed temperature, flow rate and initial dye concentration was investigated. A mathematical model incorporating temperature and concentration polarization effects was developed and validated on the experimental data.

Scalable and diagnosable are the two most crucial needs for voice call quality assessment in mobile networks. However, while these two requirements are widely accepted by mobile carriers, they do not receive enough attention during the development. Current related research mainly focuses on audio feature analysis, which is costly, sensitive to language and tones, and infeasible to be applied to large-scale mobile networks. In this paper, we revisit this problem, and for the first time explore wireless network, the causal factor that directly impacts the mobile voice quality but yet lacks attention for decades. We design CrowdMi, a wireless analytical tool that model the mobile voice quality by crowdsourcing and mining the network indicators of cellphones. CrowdMi mines hundreds of network indicators to build a causal relationship between voice quality and network conditions, and carefully calibrates the model according to the widely accepted perceptual objective listening quality assessment (POLQA) voice assessment standard. We implement a light-load CrowdMi Client App in Android smartphones, which automatically collects data through user crowdsourcing and outputs to the CrowdMi Server in our data center that runs the mining algorithm. We conduct a pilot trial in VoLTE network in different geographical areas and network coverages. The trial shows that the CrowdMi does not require any additional hardware or human effort, and has very high model accuracy and strong diagnosability.

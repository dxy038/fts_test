A mobile device retrieving objects from parallel air channels has to optimize multiple objectives: (1) reduce the response time for object retrieval, and (2) reduce power consumption in the device. This multi-objective optimization becomes even more difficult when the same object is broadcast multiple times over the parallel air channels to increase availability. In this work, several heuristic algorithms - branch and bound, greedy, random, and first-choice have been proposed for efficient object retrieval from parallel air channels in the presence of replicated objects. Empirical evaluation of the algorithms shows that the greedy algorithm produces near-optimal-response time with minimum overhead in terms of energy consumption. The runtime of the greedy algorithm is significantly faster than that of the optimal branch and bound algorithm, and is similar to the firstchoice and random algorithms.

ECO-RUBBER is a project aimed to implement a real industrialization of an eco-friendly tyre recycling and rubber sintering production system to place on the market high-quality recycled-rubber urban products. To reach this main objective, the optimization of the existing grinding and sintering lines is being carried out in order to enhance mechanical properties. Furthermore, functional and emotional criteria have been taken into account to prepare an initial design of the bollard, the selected urban furniture to demonstrate the advantages of an application made of recycled rubber. Then, finite element analyses have been implemented in order to optimize the design and minimize the amount of material to be used. Further work is yet to be done: a first prototype will be sintered and tested. Moreover, in order to enhance the perceived quality of sintered tyre rubber crumb products, an eco-label will be proposed.

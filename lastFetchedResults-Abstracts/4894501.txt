Because of the revolution of power system structure nowadays, operation and control of generating units must be modified. Energy price becomes an important parameter to make a decision in this restructured system. Unit commitment (UC) in such a competitive environment is no longer the same as the traditional one. The objective of UC is not to minimize production cost as before but to find the solution that produces a maximum profit for generation company (GENCO). This paper presents a new profit-based UC formulation under competitive environment considering both power and reserve generation. A hybrid method between Lagrange relaxation (LR) and evolutionary programming (EP) is applied to solve this new UC problem. The proposed approach is applied to a test system. Simulation results are compared with those obtained from traditional UC.

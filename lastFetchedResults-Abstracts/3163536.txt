The reactive power optimal control is a multi-objective optimization problem with discrete variables in nature. The conventional control schemes are usually &#8220;time-based&#8221; which lack the flexibility for online control. Based on &#8220;event-driven&#8221; strategy, a hybrid control approach is proposed. The principle of hybrid control, system design ideas and implementation methods are introduced. The application results in Songjiang District of Shanghai City show that the proposed system can effectively eliminate all kinds of events to achieve near-optimal system state while ensuring the reliability and quality of distribution power supply and coordinating with higher-level control center.

The objective of this study was to examine the energy use patterns and cost of production in greenhouse and open-field grape
production. Data used in the study were obtained from the experiment conducted at the Akdeniz university research field. In the study,
energy values were calculated by multiplying the amount of inputs and outputs by the related energy conversion factors. The results
indicated that total input energy use in greenhouse and open-field production was found to be 24513.0 and 23640.9 MJ/ha, respectively.
However, the output energy of greenhouse grapes (73396.0 MJ/ha) was lower than open-field grapes (120596 MJ/ha). The outputâ€“input
ratio for greenhouse and open-field grape production was found to be 2.99 and 5.10, respectively. The economic analysis revealed that
production costs for greenhouse grapes were higher than open-field grapes but greenhouse grapes were more profitable than open-field
due to premium prices for greenhouse grapes.

In this paper, we discuss the use of computational grids to solve stochastic optimization problems. These problems are generally difficult to solve and are often characterized by a high number of variables and constraints. Furthermore, for some applications, it is required to achieve a real-time solution. Obtaining reasonable results is a difficult objective without the use of high-performance computing. We present a grid-enabled path-following algorithm and we discuss some experimental results

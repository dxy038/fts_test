Kidney cancer in the elderly patient is a real challenge for the oncologic urologist. With the aging population, we will face more patients with renal cell carcinoma in senior adults. There is evidence that elderly patients with RCC have more aggressive disease and lower cancer-specific survival. Proper assessment of the general status and comorbidity of the patient is essential for treatment planning. Most patients can be operated on by surgery or by minimally invasive techniques and methods. Elderly patients with metastatic kidney cancer can benefit from systemic therapy; however, they should be closely monitored for serious adverse events.

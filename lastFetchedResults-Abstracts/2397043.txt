With respect to the important role of clinical examination in breast lesion diagnosis, training of Clinical Breast Examination (CBE) to medical students is very crucial. Despite the various methods of physical examination, current methods like using patients especially about breast arenâ€™t accepted because of various reasons. Review studies about the optimum method of CBE have not been  performed yet. The objective of this study was to survey advantages and disadvantages of the existing methods and finally choose the best one. A computer search was performed in Google Scholar site by the following key words: education, clinical examination, and breast. 11 studies published in 2000-2011, were selected for survey of CBE method. There are 6 methods of clinical examination, including 1) naturally physical examination in small groups by exercising each other 2) Compact disk (CD) and multimedia 3) Use of live patients 4) Use of simulators 5) Electronic Palpation Imaging (EPI) and 6) Combination of the above methods. The combination approach makes active and deep learning easy. With respect to our investigation, formal education by using video and simulators as a combined method is suggested for CBE training.

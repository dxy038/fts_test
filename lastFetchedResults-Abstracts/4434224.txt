In this paper, we provide a new method, named dynamic software evolution method, for component based software evolution and this method is consisted of a collection of algorithms. Each algorithm achieve one software evolution objective, and all theses algorithm is meaningful for software evolution strategy design and better understanding component based software evolution process.

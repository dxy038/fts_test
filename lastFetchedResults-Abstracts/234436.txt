Creating suitable thermal conditions for satisfying human desires for thermal-comfort has been recognized to be an essential requirement of the indoor environment. Undesirable thermal conditions can lead to occupant dissatisfaction which, in turn, has an adverse effect on their productivity, performance. Therefore, it is essential that thermal-comfort problems in buildings be given serious, urgent consideration when they arise. In most modern buildings, thermal-comfort is achieved through complex HVAC systems, raising the possibility of the occurrence of thermal-comfort problems during the day-to-day operations of the building. Thermal-comfort problems are diverse, can be difficult to identify and solve since they can be caused by one or more factors, including malfunctioning of the HVAC system, alteration of building operational and physical characteristics and occupant behavior and interference. In order to deal efficiently with thermal-comfort problems in buildings, a systematic approach is needed. The objective of this paper is to introduce an approach through which thermal-comfort problems can be assessed, identified, treated in a systematic way without utilizing unnecessary resources or time. The approach can be helpful to buildingsâ€™ operators, facility managers when dealing with thermal-comfort problems.

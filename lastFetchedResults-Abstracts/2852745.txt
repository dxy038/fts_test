Traditional safety analysis of the avionics systems covers two aspects, i.e., the safety of the process and the safety of the current state. The mandatory analysis methodologies are the process safety analysis and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), which meets the requirement of the Function Hazard Analysis (FHA). However, in the Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) and Distributed Integrated Modular Avionics (DIMA), especially the networked IMA, the safety analysis method evolves into the Zachman framework analysis. Due to the increased complexity of the IMA and DIMA, the optimization algorithms should be developed. In this paper, based on the Cyber-Physical System (CPS), two optimization algorithms are revealed. One is the utility optimization algorithm subject to the safety requirement, another one is the direct optimization algorithm with the objective function of the safety. The proposed optimization schemes consolidate the methodology of the safety analysis and design of the avionics systems, especially in the IMA, DIMA, and the networked IMA.

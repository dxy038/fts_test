This paper describes a design approach of Ambisonic reproduction system based on dynamic gain parameters (DGP). In the conventional approaches, the fixed gain parameters are often optimized to minimize the overall objective function for whole 360&#176; sound stage. The proposed approach has an advantage that the gain parameters vary with angles of source objects. The problem of optimization tradeoff among different angles is overcome by DGP, which achieves an optimal solution in each position. Source localizations of the B-Format signals were estimated in frequency bands in order to match the corresponding gain parameters. For the synthesized signals, the process was simplified by the given spatial information. Using the head-related transfer function (HRTF) analysis, the proposed approach was found to be significantly better than reference approaches in interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD).

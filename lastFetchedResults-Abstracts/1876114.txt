Objective: The goal of this study was to determine nurses' knowledge of heart failure (HF) self-management education principles. Design: The study was exploratory and descriptive and included a convenience sample. Setting: Research took place in a large midwestern health care system that included a university-based hospital, community hospitals, and home or palliative care. Subjects: Subjects included 300 nurses who provide care to patients with HF. Outcome Measure: The outcome measures included overall and topic specific perceptions of basic information important to HF self-management. Topics included diet, fluids or weight, signs or symptoms of worsening condition, medications, and exercise. Intervention: A 20-item, true or false written survey was administered between February 2000 and April 2000. Results: Of the 300 nurses surveyed, 92% were registered nurses and 8% were licensed practical nurses; 38% worked in a large university-based hospital; 44% were employed at 5 community hospitals; and 18% worked in home or hospice-palliative care. Mean HF self-management knowledge score was 15.2 ± 2.0. Registered nurses scored significantly higher than licensed practical nurses (15.3 vs 14.1; P =.004). Individual questions with overall scores &lt;30% were related to dry or ideal weight in daily weight monitoring (24%), nonsymptomatic, low blood pressure (26%), and short-term dizziness when rising (19%). Individual question scores &gt;30% and ≤75% were related to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory inhibitor use (49%), potassium-based salt substitute use (52%), rest vs activity (72%), and lean delicatessen meat use in a low sodium diet (75%). In questions with scores &lt;30%, nurses requested more information only 5% to 8% of the time. Overall analysis of variance indicated differences by work experience. HF nurses (primary population) scored higher than critical-care, medical-surgical, or telemetry floor nurses (16.2 ± 1.7; 15.1 ± 1.8; and 14.7 ± 2.0, respectively; P &lt;.001); home care nurses scored higher than hospital or palliative care nurses (15.9 ± 1.5; 15.1 ± 2.0; and 14.0 ± 1.5, respectively; P =.006). Conclusion: Nurses may not be properly educated in HF self-management principles and must be provided with the right information so they can improve the quality and amount of information they offer to patients. Nurses who are better prepared to educate patients with HF may be more likely to carry out this nursing function as a part of their daily job role. (Heart Lung® 2002;31:102-12.)

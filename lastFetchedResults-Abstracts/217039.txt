The aim of this work is to present a technique to identify elastic parameters of composite materials. The identification is based on the adjustment of coefficients in an optimization process in which the objective function is defined by the difference between the analytical natural frequencies and the measured ones. Such analytical natural frequencies are obtained by the finite element method (FEM) while the experimental ones are determined by ordinary modal tests. The proposed approach uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve
the optimization problem. A few examples are presented to identify the
indirect (Non-Destructive) prediction of mechanical properties of homogeneous isotropic, orthotropic, and anisotropic plates for showing the ability, capability, reliability, modeling and performance of this technique.

Toxoplasma gondii is one of the most common causes of latent infections in humans worldwide. Detecting anti-Toxoplasma antibodies in serum using serological tests is a common method to diagnose toxoplasmosis. In the present study, an indigenous ELISA kit was prepared using tachyzoites from the RH strain of T. gondii, and its sensitivity and specificity were compared with those of commercial kits. To produce antigens, 0.02 mL of locally isolated T. gondii RH strain parasites along with 109 tachyzoites were injected into the peritoneal cavities of 50 laboratory mice (BALB/C). Parasites were collected after 4 days. After filtering and washing, the concentration of protein in sonicated tachyzoites was calculated using the Lowry protein assay. The dilution of antigen, serum and alkaline phosphatase conjugate was assessed in designing an indigenous ELISA method; then ELISA was performed based on these dilutions, and its sensitivity was determined using 200 serum samples. In addition, the specificity of the assay was evaluated using 40 serum samples from patients with tuberculosis, leukemia or hydatid cyst. Indigenous ELISA was used to examine 100 serum samples containing anti-T. gondii IgG, with a sensitivity of 98% (commercial kits: 100%). Another 100 serum samples containing anti-T. gondii IgM were also tested, with a sensitivity of 99% (commercial kits: 100%). When 40 serum samples from patients with leukemia, hydatid cyst or tuberculosis were examined using anti-T. gondii IgG, the specificity was 100%, identical to commercial kits. However, the specificity of a similar test with anti-T. gondii IgM was just 28.6% for serum samples from leukemia patients, 21.4% for hydatid cyst  and 16.7% for tuberculosis. We found that purified locally isolated soluble crude antigens of the RH strain of T. gondii from the peritoneal cavity of mice may be one of the most promising antigens for detection of human toxoplasmosis in routine screening.

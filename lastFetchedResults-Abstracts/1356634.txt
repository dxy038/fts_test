Generation Expansion Planning (GEP) is one
of the most important decision-making activities to
determine the optimal strategy to plan the construction of
new generation plants. Originally, GEP was faced by
vertically integrated utilities with the aim of minimizing
production and capital costs. After deregulation,
generation companies were forced to consider GEP from
the viewpoint of market shares and financial risk. In
recent years, increasing concern for environmental
protection has driven many countries all over the world to
promote energy generation from renewable sources.
Multifarious incentive-based support schemes have been
designed to promote the investment in power generation
exploiting renewable resources. In this paper, regarding
the environmental issues, the impact of one of the most
popular incentive systems, namely feed-in-tariff, on
generation planning is considered, thus obtaining a
comprehensive GEP model with a suitably modified
objective function and additional constraints. The
resulting problem is solved by gravitational search
algorithm based on the Newtonâ€™s law of gravity and mass
interactions. Analysis reveals that the implementation of
incentive policies has remarkable impacts on investment
decisions of generation companies in renewable resources
and environmental issues.

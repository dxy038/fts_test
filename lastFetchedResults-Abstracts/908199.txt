The objective of this study was to determine the correlation between intake of snacks, sweets, fruit, vegetables, and energy in low-income mother–child dyads. This was a secondary analysis of data collected from Head Start centers in Houston, Texas and Birmingham, Alabama. Twenty four hour dietary recalls for one weekend day were collected from mother (mean 31.8 yrs [range: 20.1–72.4 yrs])-child (mean 4.4 yrs [range 2.8–5.8 yrs]) dyads (N = 650). Means ± SD were calculated for intake of food categories and energy. Pearson’s partial correlation coefficients were used to detect associations between the intakes of the dyads. Main outcome measures were the correlations between the intake of snacks, sweets, fruit, vegetables, and energy in the mother–child dyads. Partial correlations showed that children’s intake of snacks, sweets, fruit, vegetables, and energy were all correlated with the mother’s intake of these foods/energy (all p < 0.001). Children’s intake of fruit was correlated with the mother’s intake of vegetables (p < 0.001); children’s energy intake was correlated with mother’s intake of sweets, fruit, and vegetables (all p < 0.001). It is important that food and nutrition professionals provide the guidance needed that encourages intake of nutrient-dense snacks and fruit and vegetables in mothers so they can model healthier food consumption behaviors for their children.

The authors develop an approach which reuses queries from a well known domain called the base domain in an unfamiliar one called the target domain. The objective is to model the behavior of naive users who often adapt queries from documentation examples to the problem at hand. They rely on a weak form of derivational analogy-traces of a planner operating in the base domain are used to derive a target domain queryÂ´s implementation in SQL from its specification. The very simple planner used builds in the base domain plans that result in particularly simple, prototypical queries. Queries are specified in a high level subset of a natural language

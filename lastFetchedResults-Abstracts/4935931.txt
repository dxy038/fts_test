This paper is divided into two parts. In the present Part I, our main objective is to analyse Mamdani-type fuzzy control systems in logical terms, with special emphasis on the fuzzy inference process. To that end, we provide our own inference procedure, cast in the language of standard many-valued logics. We give an ample discussion of the logical meaning of our procedure. We eventually show how to fully recover Mamdani-type fuzzy inference from the latter. In this sense, then, our proposal may be regarded as a logical interpretation of Mamdani-type fuzzy inference. In Part II of this paper, we report on the results of an experiment on the technical analysis of the financial markets based on fuzzy techniques. The core algorithm implements the inference procedure described in this first part of the paper. In Part II, we will argue that the experimental results support the claim that our present theoretical analysis provides a sound interpretation of Mamdani-type fuzzy inference.

In this paper, we propose a new scene change detection method using multiple histograms. The proposed method produces multiple histograms of split blocks for consecutive frames. Then, it computes the optimal threshold value using automatic thresholding based on the Otsu method and decides whether the scene change occurs or not using the difference between threshold values in successive frames. In the experiments for the subjective evaluation, the proposed method correctly identified the scene change, thereby preventing interpolated frames with poor image quality due to block artifacts. In the objective evaluation using the F1 score, the proposed method improved the accuracy of the scene change detection by up to 0.461 compared with the benchmark methods.

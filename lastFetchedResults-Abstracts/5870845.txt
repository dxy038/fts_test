The incorporation of the rank transformation with an existing multivariate method of global optimization is presented. By transforming the objective function evaluations into ranks and applying StuckmanÂ´s multi-univariate method of global optimization to the ranked data, the resulting method gains the same benefits as the nonparametric method. The method is applied to a standard set of test functions. The application of the rank transformation is shown to significantly reduce the number of function evaluations needed for convergence within a specified tolerance.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

This paper addresses the problem of multivew video-plus-depth (MVD) decoding with corrupted depth maps due to transmission errors. A method for spatial error concealment of depth maps in MVD is proposed to efficiently recover lost blocks. The proposed method relies on the colour image and geometric curve fitting for accurate reconstruction of the lost contour segments in the corresponding depth map areas. Such reconstructed depth map contours are then used as boundaries at different depth planes to recover the missing depth values through weighted interpolation. The method performance is evaluated by the objective quality (PSNR) of the synthesised views. Images decoded with the reconstructed depth maps are compared with those of a reference method based on bidirectional interpolation. The proposed method exhibits PSNR gains up to 1.66dB higher than the reference one and better performance is consistently achieved for different visual content.

Objective
The signaling pathways induced by promegapoietin (PMP), a family of chimeric growth factors that activate the human IL-3 and c-Mpl receptors, were investigated.
Methods
The biological activity of PMP was examined by receptor binding, cell proliferation, ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic progenitor cells, and in vivo production of platelets. The activation of signaling pathways was examined by Western blot and Northern blot analyses.
Results
Two PMP molecules, PMP-1 and PMP-1a, induced proliferation of cells expressing the IL-3 receptor, c-Mpl, or both receptors and bound to the IL-3 receptor and c-Mpl with high affinity. Ex vivo expansion assays using human bone marrow CD34+ cells suggested that PMP-1 induced greater total cellular expansion as well as expansion of CD41+ megakaryocytic precursor cells than IL-3 or c-Mpl ligand alone. Subcutaneous administration of 50 μg/kg of PMP-1 for 10 days to rhesus monkeys resulted in increased platelet production in vivo from a baseline of 357 ± 45 × 103 cells/mL to 1376 ± 151 × 103 cell/mL. PMP-1 induced phosphorylation of the βc subunit of IL-3 receptor and c-Mpl, JAK2, and STAT5b, but not STAT3. PMP-1 induced greater expression of Pim-1, c-Myc, and cyclin D2 than did either an IL-3 receptor agonist or c-Mpl receptor agonist alone. The magnitude of induction of early response genes was similar for PMP and the coaddition of IL-3 receptor agonist and c-Mpl receptor agonist.
Conclusion
PMP combines the biological activities of IL-3 and c-Mpl ligand in a single molecule that can simultaneously activate signaling pathways induced by both these ligands.

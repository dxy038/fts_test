This paper presented a current control using the synchronous reference frame for single-phase ac to dc converter. The control method transforms an orthogonal current by the actual single-phase input current and a e<sup>-sT/4</sup> delay current, from a stationary to a rotating frame. The steady state current components become direct current instead of alternating current values. The advantage of this method is zero steady state error and easily for power calculation. A full bridge single-phase converter is implemented for bidirectional power flow in hybrid microgrid. The results consist of simulation result in Matlab/Simulink and converter experiment result controlled with DS1104 interface card.

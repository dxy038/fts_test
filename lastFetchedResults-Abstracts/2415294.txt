Objective
 Headaches are common neurologic problems for children and adolescents. They
are divided into two types: primary and secondary. Primary headaches include
migraines and tension-type as well as comprise the majority of headaches. We
detect the causes of headaches and their associations with demographic variables
among children and adolescents.
Materials & Methods
This cross-sectional study was performed on 5â€“15 year-old children with
headaches from March 2010 to April 2012 who presented at a pediatric neurology
clinic in Kashan, Iran. Diagnosis of headaches was done in accordance with the
International Classification of Headache Disorders. Data regarding the type of
headache, age, gender, pain severity, aura, family history, and sleep disorder
were collected.
Results
One hundred fourteen children (44 male and 70 female) with headaches were
enrolled in the study. The types of headaches were comprised as follows:
67 cases of migraines, 38 cases of tension-type headaches, 2 cases of cluster
headaches, and 7 cases of secondary headaches. Pulsating headaches, family
history of headaches, insomnia, and pain severity had higher prevalence in
migrainous patients.
Conclusion
Physicians should extend their information gathering about primary and
secondary headaches. Sleep disturbances and a family history of headaches
were the most important factors associated with migraine headaches.

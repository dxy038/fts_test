This paper evaluates the controllers performance on AU Self-balancing Bicycle (AUSB). The gyroscope is used to sense the balanced position of the bicycle while an encoder is used to sense the position of the flywheel. The Single loop uses a gyroscope sensor and an additional encoder sensor is used in the Double loop. The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate the improvement in the performance of the AUSB. In the Single loop control, the bicycle can balance within a certain flywheel angle, and then the bicycle will fall. In the Double loop control, bicycle´s leaning angle and the flywheel´s position are controlled to be horizontal to the ground plane which give a better performance to the AUSB.

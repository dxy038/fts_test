In this paper, we address the problem of designing practical codes for the broadcast phase in the two-way relay channel. The paper provides guidelines for the use of well-developed single-user codes in the bidirectional broadcast channel, with the goal of achieving or closely approaching the performance bounds. In case of finite alphabet channels with the channel distortion being independent of the channel input, the performance of our coding scheme only depends on the performance of the base codes on the corresponding single-user channels. If the involved single-user codes provides the best possible performance, so also does the proposed coding scheme for the bidirectional broadcast channel.

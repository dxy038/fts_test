The 2D/3D converting industry and its accompanying researches are rapidly growing. However, some of the converted 3D contents are low-quality and may be not viable for consumers. Quality Measure (QM) factors of the 2D/3D converted contents are depth perception, visual comfort and erroneousness. In this paper, we particularly focus on evaluating visual comfort among stereo quality measure factors. For this evaluation, we identify 8 factors to capture spatiotemporal characteristics of disparity. The final prediction of visual comfort is determined by linearly combining the 8 factors. According to experimental results, our objective prediction is highly correlated with subjective evaluation.

Track access time is an important parameter for high-performance hard disk drives (HDDs). Presently, the resonances of the head actuator caused by the pivot-bearing stiffness are an even more urgent problem, since these resonances have become the main design factor that limits further reduction of track access time and improvement of the servo control bandwidth in HDDs. Our objective in this paper is to investigate, from a mechanics and dynamics viewpoint, the influence of the driving force waveforms on residual vibrations and to identify the characteristics of the waveform, which will lead to zero or very low residual vibrations. Using a simplified model of a head actuator assembly and finite-element simulation, we show that the residual vibration of the head actuator assembly depends strongly on the waveform and the time duration of the driving impulse force. If suitable waveform and time duration of the seeking impulse force are appropriately chosen, very low track seeking residual vibrations and quick track access can be achieved

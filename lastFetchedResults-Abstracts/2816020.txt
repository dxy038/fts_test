The objective of this study is to estimate the spatial distribution of rice crop damage all over the Cambodia during rainy season from July to November. The combined data consisting of MODIS, land use and DEM are expected to play an important role in emergency response efforts for high-risk flood areas in the Cambodian floodplain. The integrated GIS-based approach is applied to detect and monitor floodwater area with flood depth and duration for near real-time rice crop damage in the flood-prone by using MODIS time series in 2011. The rice crop damage map shows areas of different levels indicated to flood duration and floodwater depth; 50% (8 days, over 1.5 m) and 100% (16 days, over 1.5 m) damage. The proposed map was validated to largely consistent (91.6%) with the government census based on field scale investigation and survey.

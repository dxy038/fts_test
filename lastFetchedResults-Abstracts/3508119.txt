An optimal parameter selection model of cancer chemotherapy in which two system parameters are unknown is formulated as a worst-case optimal parameter selection model. The model assumes that the unknown parameters lie within a known set. The system constraints must be satisfied over this entire set, and the objective function minimized in the worst case. The continuous dependence of the objective function and the system constraints upon the unknown parameters can be removed, making a numerical solution tractable. For the data considered it is proven that a cure is impossible no matter what the values of the unknown parameters in the parameter set. The optimal policy is shown to be relatively low dose intensity for the majority of the treatment, with remaining drug delivered towards the end of the treatment interval.

A novel zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) phase-shift isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter is proposed. It is composed of two symmetrical active-clamped circuits, one on each side of an isolation transformer. The converter can achieve full ZVS in both forward and backward modes even under no-load condition. The converter also has a fast response. The operation principle and low-frequency model of the converter are explained. Experimental results are presented

Popularity of Mobile Wireless Sensor Network (MWSN) has increased tremendously due to the ability to connect the physical world with the virtual world. In MWSN, Sensor nodes move freely in a target area without the need of any special infrastructure. MWSN has attracted many researchers as it has introduced unique challenges in aspects like resource management, coverage, routing protocols, security in many applications such as target tracking in military applications, detection of catastrophic events, environment monitoring, health applications etc. Due to mobility, routing process in MWSN has become more complicated as connections in the network can change dynamically. This paper proposes a Mobility-Aware Multi-Objective Hybrid Routing Algorithm (MMOHRA) for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). MMOHRA selects the best route and forwards the data packets from source to sink using multiple metrics such as Average Energy consumption, Control Overhead, Reaction Time, LQI, and HOP Count. Performance of MMOHRA is compared with Simple Hybrid Routing Protocol (SHRP) and Dynamic Multi-objective Routing Algorithm (DyMORA) using metrics such as Average Energy Consumption, Packet Delivery Ratio, and Jitter. MMOHRA improves the Average Energy Consumption (AEC) by a factor of 14.1% as compared with SHRP and 8.13 % as compared to DyMORA. MMOHRA outperformed SHRP and DyMORA in terms of packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) by 10.17 % and 9.83 % respectively.

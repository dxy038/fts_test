Infections of domestic and wild animals that are transmitted directly or by an arthropod vector to humans are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and particularly in Nigeria. With a population of over 100 million and the need for improved health care delivery, Nigerians are at considerable risk considering the seriousness of these infections. Zoonotic infections that are endemic in Nigeria include tuberculosis, trypanosomiasis, toxoplasmosis, taeniasis, rabies, lassa fever and yellow fever. Zoonotic food-borne infections (caused by Campylobacter, Salmonella and Escherichia coli O157:H7) and cryptosporidiosis are emerging. Sporadic cases such as strongyloidiasis, ascariasis, leptospirosis, scabies, pentastomiasis and African histoplasmosis have been reported. There is a need to determine the prevalence of tick-borne zoonoses. Prevention and control of zoonoses in humans is by vaccination, treatment and health education. As a first measure to improve control, the link between veterinary and medical officers, which is presently very weak, needs to be strengthened. Furthermore, regional multidisciplinary approaches to the control of zoonotic infections should be adopted in West Africa, which take into consideration the huge inter-border traffic.

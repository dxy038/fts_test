Background
The site of cannulation for repair of ascending aortic dissection remains controversial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence and management of intraoperative malperfusion syndrome using femoral cannulation for repair of acute type A aortic dissection.
Methods

Between May 2002 and February 2007, 107 patients with initial femoral artery cannulation for the repair of type A aortic dissection were enrolled in this study. The mean age was 63.7 Â± 11.8 years; 51 patients were female. Preoperative findings indicated malperfusion in 16 patients. Intraoperative malperfusion syndrome was diagnosed by both radial arterial pressure measurements and transesophageal echocardiography. Clinical outcomes, including specific operative procedures and complications related to the cannulation, were assessed.
Results

The ascending aorta was replaced in 59 patients, hemiarch in 16, and total aortic arch in 32. Intraoperative malperfusion syndrome was noted in 3 patients (lowering of radial pressure in 2, obstruction of the true lumen in 1) at the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. After immediately switching to transventricular cannulation, the surgical replacement was successfully performed. The remaining 104 patients underwent surgery during femoral artery bypass without perfusion abnormalities. There was 1 in-hospital death (0.9%), but no deaths among the malperfusion patients. Cerebrovascular deficit occurred in 7 patients (6.5%). One vascular and 3 wound complications occurred related to the femoral cannulation.
Conclusions

During the repair of acute ascending aortic dissection, malperfusion syndrome related to femoral artery cannulation has an acceptable incidence, and can be managed under appropriate intraoperative monitoring, particularly at the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass.

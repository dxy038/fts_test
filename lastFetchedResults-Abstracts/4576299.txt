Radio Spectrum is an essential raw material for most promising industries of the future. Many new emerging technologies as well as existing services require spectrum for their growth. This has put a great pressure on radio frequency spectrum regulator for its efficient use. It is commonly believed that there is a crisis of spectrum availability but studies have shown that not all the spectrum is in use for all of the time i.e. there is no shortage of radio spectrum only lack of efficient management. The traditional command and control method of spectrum management does not lead to efficient spectrum management. There are several challenges before spectrum regulator to meet the future demands of spectrum like interference Management, international coordination, Technology Neutrality etc. To overcome these challenges, instead of rigid, a flexible spectrum management is essentially required. The objective of new spectrum management should be designed in such a way that it should meet the above challenges as well as it should be economically, technically efficient and at the same time protect the public interest also.

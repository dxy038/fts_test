A two-dimensional monolithic array has been developed that gives the elevation and azimuth of point source targets. The array is an arrangement of rows and columns of antennas and bismuth bolometer detectors on a fused quartz substrate. Energy is focused onto the array through a lens placed on the back side of the substrate. At 1.38 mm with a 50 mm diameter objective lens, the array has demonstrated a positioning accuracy of 26 arcmin. In a differential mode this precision improves to 9 arcsec, limited by the mechanics of the rotating stage. This tracking could be automated to a fast two-step procedure where a source is first located to the nearest row and column, and then precisely located by scanning. With signal processing the array should be able to track multiple sources.

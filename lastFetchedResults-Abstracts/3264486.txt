This project is to present the transient recovery voltage on circuit breaker in power system network. The transient recovery voltage is a characteristic in power system and will found just only microsecond in the power system network. The objective of this project is to simulate and analysis the transient recovery voltage on circuit breaker. It is to investigate the transient recovery voltage before and after the circuit breaker interrupts and also the transient recovery voltage under the fault. The method used in this project is by simulating the circuit using the PSCAD software. This software will simulate the circuit model and collect some data to give more understanding about transient recovery voltage. This project will continue by analyzing the result based on the data collected. The simulation results are same with the expected results and thus, it show that the simulation results are correct and pre theoretical. In conclusion, the transient recovery voltage affects the breaking capacity of the circuit breaker operation and also affects the power system network operation.

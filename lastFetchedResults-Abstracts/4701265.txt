This paper describes two experiences: The first experiment, called International Direct Digital Election (ID2E), is made for testing the viability for the international voting by mobiles using SMS protocol, using Web 2.0 tools to facilitate discussions about the election main theme. The second experiment is the construction of a voting prototype using Android platform smart phones, with applications and vote collecting databases available on dynamic web pages, trying to simulate de Identical Ballot Boxes strategy described in two papers of Alefragis, Lounis, Triantafillou and Voros. The two experiments are part of a proposed e-Voting methodology, and were made with the final objective of surveying scenarios about international voting processes, to give some experimental base for future e-Voting projects at international level.

Objective As a result of ongoing political
tensions within Tibetan regions of the People’s
Republic of China, several thousand Tibetans escape
across the Himalayas every year to seek refuge in India
and Nepal. Prior studies have found a high prevalence
of depressive and anxiety symptoms in these refugees,
many of whom are young and have been exposed to
significant trauma. However, it is not known whether
depressive and anxiety symptoms are more prevalent
in these refugees than in ethnic Tibetans born and
raised in the relative political and social stability of exile
communities in North India and Nepal. Methods We
conducted a cross-sectional survey of a convenience
sample of 319 students attending school at the Tibetan
Children’s Villages in Northern India to test the a priori
hypothesis that adolescents and young adults who escaped
from Tibet to India would demonstrate increased
depressive and anxiety symptoms when compared
to ethnic Tibetans born and raised in exile. The
Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) was used to
measure depressive and anxiety symptoms. In addition,
demographic information on age, sex, country of
birth and frequency of family contact was collected.
Results Students born in Tibet had higher mean HSCL-
25 depressive and anxiety symptom scores than did
ethnic Tibetans born in exile. Female students demonstrated
higher depressive and anxiety scores, as did
those with limited contact with immediate family. After
adjusting for sex, age and frequency of family contact,
being born in Tibet was associated with increased
HSCL-25 depressive and anxiety symptom scores
(depression: F[2, 316] = 29.96, P < 0.0001; anxiety:
F[4, 316] = 43.57, P < 0.0001). Conclusions The experience
of being raised in Tibet and escaping to India
appears to be a risk factor for increased depressive and
anxiety symptoms when compared to being born and
raised within an exile community in India or Nepal.

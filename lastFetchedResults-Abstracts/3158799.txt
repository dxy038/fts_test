With respect to the multiplicative complementary judgement matrix, n groups of approximate weight vectors are given by considering the judgement informations in detail provided by decision makers (DMs) in this paper. And some information aggregation operators are used to aggregate these approximate weight vectors according to the credibility degree of alternatives into judgements defined in this paper, then two ranking methods with credibility degree based on aggregation operators are obtained. Furthermore, some existing ranking methods are certified as their special circumstances, and a method is proposed to obtain the objective weight of credibility. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed method.

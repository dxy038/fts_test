In order to promote the production and use of electricity generated from renewable energy sources, support schemes such as the Renewables Portfolio Standard and various green power programs have been implemented. When evaluating the costs and benefits associated with those schemes, people need accurate information about the characteristics of renewable generation. The objective of the present paper is to identify the kind of information to be provided to lay people in Japan in order to enhance their understanding of biomass generation. We used the two-stage “mental model” method to conduct open-ended interviews and a questionnaire survey to reveal people’s beliefs about biomass generation. From the survey results, it was identified that the information to be provided should include the following: (a) definitions of biomass and biomass generation, (b) specific generation technologies, (c) the carbon neutral concept of biomass, (d) non-use of energy food crops in Japan, (e) sustainable availability of resources under certain conditions, and (f) high generation costs with their causes, such as collection costs of resources.

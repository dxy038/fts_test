Objective
To estimate the influence of therapy with amlodipine (A) or lacidipine (L) on heart rate variability (HRV) time and frequency domain parameters in hypertensive patients with stable angina pectoris and isolated left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Methods

After a 1-week washout period, the patients were randomized to receive amlodipine 10 mg (30 patients) or lacidipine 6 mg (30 patients) once-daily for 4 weeks. HRV parameters were determined over a period of 24 h, echocardiography and exercise test were performed before and after treatment.
Results

All HRV time domain parameters after applying amlodipine did not change significantly. A reliable decrease only of the root mean square of differences between adjacent normal-to-normal intervals (RMSSD)—32.9±13 vs. 27.5±9—was noticed after treatment with lacidipine. In the lacidipine group, the change of RMSSD negatively correlated with the extent of ST segment depression during exercise testing (R=−0.43; P<0.05). Both drugs reduced total power (A, 2234±1270 vs. 1813±889; L, 2205±1151 vs. 1825±896; P<0.01), very low (A, 1451±733 vs. 1143±534; L, 1413±759 vs. 1213±616; P<0.05), and low frequency power (A, 610±459 vs. 447±321; L, 569±323 vs. 442±241; P<0.01). After amlodipine, high frequency power remained unchanged, whereas low–high frequency ratio decreased (4.54±1.72 vs. 3.77±1.73; P<0.05). After lacidipine, high frequency power decreased (178.8±153.2 vs. 132.1±79.3; P<0.05), whereas the ratio of low frequency to high frequency did not change.
Conclusions

Amlodipine and lacidipine reduce the influence of humoral control and sympathetic autonomic nervous system activity. The autonomic balance becomes shifted toward the increased vagal activity only by amlodipine.

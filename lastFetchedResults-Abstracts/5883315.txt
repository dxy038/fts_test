With shrinking technology, the timing variation of a digital circuit is becoming the most important factor while designing a functionally reliable circuit. Gate sizing has emerged as one of the efficient way to subside the yield deterioration due to manufacturing variations. In the past single-objective optimization techniques have been used to optimize the timing variation whereas on the other hand multi-objective optimization techniques can provide a more promising approach to design the circuit. We propose a new algorithm called YOGA, based on multi-objective optimization technique called non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA). YOGA optimizes a circuit in multi domains and provides the user with Pareto-optimal set of solutions which are distributed all over the optimal design spectrum, giving users the flexibility to choose the best fitting solution for their requirements. YOGA overcomes the disadvantages of traditional optimization techniques, while even providing solutions in very stringent bounds

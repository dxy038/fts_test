Effective preventive healthcare services have a significant role in reducing
fatality and medical expenses in all human societies and the level of accessibility
of customers to these services can be considered as a measure of their efficiency
and effectiveness. The main purpose of this paper is to develop a service network
design model of preventive healthcare facilities with the principal objective of
maximizing participation in the offered services. While considering utility
constraints and incorporating demand elasticity of customers due to travel
distance and congestion delays, optimal number, locations and capacities of
facilities as well as customer assignment o facilities are determined. First, the
primary nonlinear integer program is transformed, and then the linearized model
is solved by developing an exact algorithm. Computational results show that
large-sized instances can be solved in a reasonable amount of time. An illustrative
case study of network of hospitals in Shiraz, Iran, is used to demonstrate the
model and the managerial insights are discussed.

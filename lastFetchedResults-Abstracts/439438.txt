We herein report the successful surgical treatment of 2 cases of chronic expanding hematoma in the chest. The first patient, who had undergone thoracoplasty 42 years earlier due to tuberculosis, became aware of a slowly growing mass protruding in the lateral thoracic wall. The second patient, who had tuberculous pleurisy 36 years earlier, was referred to our department because of a slowly expanding intrathoracic mass revealed by a roentgenogram. The tumors, which were encapsulated chronic hematomas, were both surgically resected. These cases are rare because of the development of a very large mass after undergoing treatment for tuberculosis more than 30 years previously.

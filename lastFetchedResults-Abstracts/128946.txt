Objective: In this research the role of adenosine At receptors of the entorhinal cortex on piriform cortex- kindled seizures was investigated.
Materials and Methods: Animals were kindled by daily electrical stimulation of the piriform cortex. Then N6-Cyclohexyladenosine (CHA), an adenosine A, receptor agonise, at concentrations of 1,10 and 100 miuM and I,3-dimethyl-8 cyclopenthylxanthine (CPT), an adenosine Al receptor antagonist, at concentrations of 50 and 100 miuM were injected into the entorhinal cortex. Animals were stimulated 5 min after drug injection and seizure parameters were recorded. Also in another group of animals, CPT (50 miuM) was injected 5 min before CIIA (100 miuM).
Results: CIIA at a concentration of 100 miuM decreased the afterdischarge duration (ADD), stage 5 duration (S5D), and seizure duration (SD), and increased the latency to stage 4 of the seizure (S4L) significantly. CHA at a concentration of 10 miuM decreased only SD and increased S41_ significantly. On the other hand bilateral microinjection of CPT into the entorhinal cortex at a concentration of 100 ÂµM increased ADD, S5D, and SD, and reduced S4L significantly. Pretreatment of animals with CPT (50 miuM), 5 min before CHA (100 miuM), reduced the effect of CHA on seizure parameters.
Conclusion: These results suggest that adenosine A, receptors activity in the entorhinal cortex reduces piriform cortex kindled seizures.

Numerical modeling of compressible two-phase flow is a challenging and important subject in practical cases and research problems. In these problems, mutual effect of shock wave interaction creates a discontinuity in the fluid properties and interface of two fluids as a second discontinuity lead to some difficulties in the numerical approximations and estimating an accurate interface during the hydro-dynamical capturing process. The main objective of this research is accurate capturing of the interface and numerical study of shock wave during gas-gas and gas-liquid interface of two-phase flows. For these purposes , HLLC Riemann solver and Godunov numerical method was used for a hyperbolic two-pressure two-fluid model where programming was conducted in two-space dimensional with the second order accuracy. Various one and two-dimensional problems were simulated such as compression and expansion shock tubes, shock wave interaction with R22/air bubble, underwater explosion and hypersonic shock with M=6 interaction with a cylindrical water column.  The numerical results obtained from this attempt exhibit very good agreement with the experimental results, as well as the previous numerical results presented by the other researchers based on the other numerical methods.

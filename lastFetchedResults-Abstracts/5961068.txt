Objective: To investigate and seek the special biomarkers of the salivary protein expression profile for the discrimination diagnosis between gastric cancer and chronic gastritis. Method: The saliva collected were detected by applying WCX magnetic beads and using MALDI-TOF-MS technique. Corresponding peptide mass fingerprint was obtained and differential diagnostic cast was developed. Result: Differences in 77 protein peaks were observed from chronic gastritis and gastric cancer patients. One protein peak among them presented statistical significant difference (p &lt; 0.05). Predictive model for discrimination of gastric cancer and chronic gastritis was developed. Its identification rate was 83.54%, and its capability of predication was 60.23%. Conclusion: The protein expression profile of saliva collected from gastric cancer and chronic gastritis patients was preliminarily obtained. The diagnostic cast for discrimination of the two diseases was classified by the expression of molecular weight 6021.72 Da protein.

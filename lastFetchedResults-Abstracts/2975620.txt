In this paper we define a call admission control (CAC) strategy, based on the MINBLOCK problem for wireless networks using soft-handover. According to this approach, the call admission controller, decides whether to accept new-calls or not, respecting a hard constraint over the handover drop probability and a hard constraint over the admission waiting time of the handover requests, with the objective of minimizing the mean waiting time for the new-call admission requests. An analytical Markov-based model is proposed to achieve the solution of this problem, that is, to calculate the parameters of the admission controller

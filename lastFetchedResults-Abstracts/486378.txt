Background: The use of regenerated plants provides a new era in herbal medicine production. 
Objective: In this study, the analgesic effect of aqueous extracts from aerial part of regenerated Drosera spatulata (Droseraceae) was examined on Sprague Dawley rats by formalin test. 
Methods: The D. spatulata cultured on hormone-free solid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 3% (w/v) sucrose and 0.7% (w/v) agar for 3 months. The aqueous extract prepared from aerial part of regenerated plant. 
Results: The extract (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly (p<0.05) and in a dose-dependent 
(0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) manner reduced rat flinching responses. Sodium salicylate (300 mg/kg) was used as a positive control. Sodium salicylate (300 mg/kg, i.p.) and extract (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.) alleviated rats nociception in the second phases, while in the first phase, only the extract caused an anti-nociceptive effect (p<0.05).
Conclusion: The results suggested that analgesic effect of D. Spatulata extract may be dependent on central and peripheral analgesic mechanisms. Our results indicate analgesic effect of regenerated plant extract was effective as sodium salicylate effective dose.

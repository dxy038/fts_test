We introduce an idealized dynamically reconfigurable computing model that is suitable for applications in video processing applications. Dynamically reconfigurable computing is characterized by a dynamic data path which has been made possible with the partial reconfiguration feature available in modern FPGA devices. Dynamically reconfigurable computing design leads to a multi-objective optimization model with constraints on power, performance and resources. We provide a review of recent reconfigurable computing applications reported by different groups and propose a new model for dynamically reconfigurable video processing applications. We provide model measurements for reconfiguration time overhead, static and reconfiguration power consumption.

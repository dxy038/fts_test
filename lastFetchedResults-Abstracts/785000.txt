the objective of this study was to evaluate functional effects of margarine supplemented
with individual cla isomers trans-10, cis-12 and cis-9, trans-11 in apoE/ldlR -/- mice. Design: in long
experiment (long), two-month old mice with no atherosclerosis were assigned to experimental groups and fed
for the next 4 months. in shoRt experiment (shoRt), four-month old mice, with pre-established
atherosclerosis, were assigned to experimental groups and fed for the next 2 months. the experimental diets
were: ain-93g (margarine), ain-93g + 0.5% trans-10, cis-12 cla (t10c12), and ain-93g + 0.5% cis-9, trans-
11 cla (c9t11). Results: in both experiments (long and shoRt), liver weight was significantly (p<0.05)
increased in mice fed t10c12 cla. hepatic steatosis was found in animals fed t10c12 diet and no signs of the
steatosis was observed in mice fed c9t11 cla. dietary treatments with t10c12 cla significantly increased total
plasma cholesterol and plasma triacylglycerols. there were no isomer-specific effects of cla isomers on area of
atherosclerotic plaque in aortic root. Conclusion: in conclusion, t10c12 cla significantly increased liver weight
in mice in long and shoRt experiments. our results do not support the notion that cla isomer
supplementation to the margarine possess anti-atheroclerotic effect. therefore, no isomer-specific effects of cla
on development of atherosclerosis were observed

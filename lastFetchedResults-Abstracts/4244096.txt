A method based on the concept of fuzzy relation theory and the technique of cluster analysis is presented for the study of area decomposition in power systems. Based on fuzzy relation theory, the decomposition measures computed for each generator are used to construct a fuzzy relation matrix to represent the degree of association among system units. Hierarchical cluster analysis is then performed on the constructed fuzzy relation matrix, and a hierarchy of generator clusters can be obtained. Such a hierarchical clustering structure indicates objective area decomposing schemes for the study system at different levels of association among system generators. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by application to a sample power system

This paper presents a novel sensorless nonlinear speed control method for the induction machine. The derived controller is based on a special case of exact feedback linearization which uses calculated state derivatives as feedback variables. This paperÂ´s objective is to present the applicability of established sensorless speed estimation algorithms to the derived nonlinear control scheme. Some of the advantages of the present sensorless control method are: the good dynamic performance, even at low speeds, the absence of tuning need for the speed and flux loops, and implementation simplicity. Experimental results are presented in this paper, in order to validate the theoretical control scheme.

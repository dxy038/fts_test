Three regular meshed topologies are compared in light of their possible use for the implementation of large all-optical wavelength-routing communication networks (or interconnection systems). These systems provide all source-destination pairs with end-to-end transparent channels that are identified through a wavelength and a physical path. The considered topologies are the K-dimensional bidirectional square lattice, the twin shuffle, and the de Bruijn graph. The comparison is based on the maximum and average distance between source and destination (number of traversed nodes), on the degree of connectivity for each node (number of input and output fibers), and on the minimum number of wavelengths in the WDM comb necessary to discriminate all source-destination pairs

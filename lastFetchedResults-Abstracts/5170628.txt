The analysis of loading effects on Synchronous Rectifier Buck Converter (SRBC) performance using fixed Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technique is presented in this paper. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the effects of load variations on switching loss, conduction loss and body-diode conduction loss in SRBC circuit. There are three load conditions: critical load, light load and heavy load where PWM is commonly preferred from mid to heavy loads. The simulation analysis is carried out to determine the optimized load value for the best performance of the converter. It is found that towards heavy loads the switching loss decreases thus eventually improves the switching power loss savings.

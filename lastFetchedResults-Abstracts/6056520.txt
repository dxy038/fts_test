This paper presents a control design methodology for n-dimensional nonholonomic systems. The main idea is that, given a nonholonomic system subject to &#954; Pfaffian constraints, one can define a smooth, N-dimensional reference vector field F, which is nonsingular everywhere except for a submanifold containing the origin. The dimension N &#8804; n of F depends on the structure of the constraint equations, which induces a foliation of the configuration space. This foliation, together with the objective of having the system vector field aligned with F, suggests a choice of Lyapunov-like functions V. The proposed approach recasts the original nonholonomic control problem into a lower-dimensional output regulation problem, which although nontrivial, can more easily be tackled with existing design and analysis tools. The methodology applies to a wide class of nonholonomic systems, and its efficacy is demonstrated through numerical simulations for the cases of the unicycle and the n-dimensional chained systems, for n = 3, 4.

In this paper a new zero voltage switching bidirectional dc-dc converter is introduced. This converter consists of flyback and forward transformers and only one main switch in primary side and one main switch in secondary side of transformers. Auxiliary circuits in this converter consist of a switch and one clamp capacitor. These circuits not only absorb spikes across the switches but also provide soft switching condition for all semiconductor devices. This converter controlled by PWM signal and therefore implementation of control circuits is easy. Also this converter operates over a wide input voltage range. Computer simulation and experimental results verify the converter analysis.

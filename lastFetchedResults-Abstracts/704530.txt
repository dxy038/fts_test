A case of intestinal infection by Cryptosporidium parvum and another of intestinal Isospora belli infection, both in AIDS patients, are described. The two patients presented pulmonary tuberculosis symptoms and watery diarrhoea. Modified Ziehlâ€“Neelsen stain of stools gave a definitive diagnosis in both cases. They are the first reports of intestinal coccidia infections in AIDS patients described in Mozambique.

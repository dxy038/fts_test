For QoS-guaranteed realtime multimedia differentiated services provisioning across multiple AS (autonomous system) domain network, session configuration with SIP/SDP and bidirectional connection establishment using UNI &amp; NNI signaling (i.e., RSVP-TE) are essential. Also, a scalable transit networking scheme must be provided so as to configure scalable per-class-type QoS-guaranteed packet processing and to provide scalable connection admission control (CAC). In this paper, we analyze the functional architecture of session &amp; connection management with SIP/SDP, RSVP-TE, COPS (common open policy service)-based CAC and QoS-guaranteed virtual overlay networking. We also evaluate the overall interaction procedure among functional modules for scalable QoS-guaranteed DiffServ provisioning across multiple autonomous system (AS) domain networks.

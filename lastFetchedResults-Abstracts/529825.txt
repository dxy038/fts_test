Current situation of Afghanistan above all is a reflex of two facts. The failure in enacting projects of State-making and Modernization from above make this country to move toward civil war and face with foreign intervention. From 1748 onward there have been many attempts to make a powerful sovereign State. First an ethnic approach applied that was unsuccessful, and then an institutional approach applied but this one has not any success too. Afghani leaders have been seeking modernization project from the very beginning of the 20th century. Modernization mainly with social reformism aim has applied but resulted in mass rebels. In subsequent years the main focus was economic sphere, and this one has not any positive result too. Development project with double objective in social and economic spheres resulted in the appearance of Mujahidin. In general, failed historical experiences of State-making and modernization have weak State and backwardness as their aftermath.

An artificial insemination dose for mares consisting of 500 million progressively motile spermatozoa is considered “standard” by most clinicians. However, little information is available directly comparing pregnancy outcome among methods of evaluating and selecting spermatozoa for insemination. The objective of this study was to determine if the method of spermatozoal evaluation and selection influences fertility as measured by pregnancy outcome. Mares were inseminated with 100 or 500 million spermatozoa that were selected for progressive motility, normal morphology, hypoosmotic swelling or absolute number regardless for evaluation method or quality. Thirty-two breeding cycles were tested for each treatment group and at each spermatozoal dose. Pregnancy outcomes were 44 and 41%, 55 and 41%, 39 and 31%, and 45 and 41%, for the 100 and 500 million progressively motile, morphologically normal, hypoosmotic swelling positive and absolute number treatment groups, respectively. Pregnancy outcome did not differ among methods of spermatozoal evaluation and selection for artificial insemination in the 100 (P=0.52) or 500 (P=0.78) million spermatozoa groups. Also the total number of spermatozoa and the absolute number of progressively motile, morphologically normal or hypoosmotic swelling positive spermatozoa inseminated, were not closely associated with pregnancy outcome in the 100 (P=0.24, 0.29, 0.33 and 0.38, respectively) or 500 (P=0.20, 0.84, 0.50 and 0.74, respectively) million spermatozoa groups. In this study, we found that the method of spermatozoal evaluation did not offer an advantage for pregnancy when used to select spermatozoa for insemination at the doses tested. These results were surprising, as we expected there would be differences among the evaluation methods. Instead, we found that evaluating spermatozoa offered no advantage for pregnancy over simply inseminating with a specified number of spermatozoa not selected for any particular characteristic under the conditions of our experiment.

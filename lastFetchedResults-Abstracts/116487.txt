The objective of this study was to obtain annual odor emission profiles from different swine production buildings. Odor emissions were measured from two gestation, two farrowing, four nursery, and three finishing rooms. The measurements were taken monthly from March to November 2003 and in January and March 2004. The results showed that odor concentrations from all types of swine barns varied over the year (P < 0.05); the odor concentrations were high in winter and low in summer and were related to ambient temperature (P < 0.01). Odor emission rates also varied significantly throughout the year (P < 0.05) but did not show a seasonal pattern and were not affected by ambient temperature (P > 0.05). Odor concentration was highest in the nursery rooms, followed by the finishing, farrowing, and gestation rooms. Odor emission rates were highest from the finishing rooms, followed by the nursery, farrowing, and gestation rooms. Odor concentrations could be predicted by regression equations using ambient and room temperatures and animal units (r2 = 0.58 to 0.67), except for the nursery rooms. Animal density (kg/m2) in the nursery and finishing rooms had no significant effect on odor concentrations and emission rates (P > 0.05).

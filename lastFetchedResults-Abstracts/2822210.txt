The paper deals with a measurement of the spontaneous ultra-weak photon emission from wild type cells of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae during their growth. The objective of the work was to obtain a temporal development of optical signals from yeast samples utilizing two photomultiplier tubes with different properties.

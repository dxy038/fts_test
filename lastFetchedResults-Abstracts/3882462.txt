This study introduces a novel visual servo controller that is designed to control the pose of the camera to keep multiple objects in the field of view (FOV) of a mobile camera. In contrast with other visual servo methods, the control objective is not formulated in terms of a goal pose or a goal image. Rather, a set of underdetermined task functions are developed to regulate the mean and variance of a set of image features. Regulating these task functions inhibits feature points from leaving the camera FOV. An additional task function is used to maintain a high level of motion perceptibility, which ensures that desired feature point velocities can be achieved. These task functions are mapped to camera velocity, which serves as the system input. A proof of stability is presented for tracking three or fewer targets. Experiments of tracking eight or more targets have verified the performance of the proposed method.

We present the results of the first-ever subjective evaluation of true 3D images performed on a light field display. Given the ever-increasing volume of true 3D image content being created and consumed, it is imperative to construct a systematic framework for the subjective evaluation of such content. We first describe our experimental setup and propose a methodology for subjective evaluation on the setup. We then describe the dataset used for our study. Subjective evaluation results are reported for 20 subjects. In addition to subjective results, we also report results of popular full-reference objective 2D image quality assessment methods applied on a per view basis.

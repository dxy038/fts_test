This paper describes an automatic multi-objective adjustment system for optical axes using genetic algorithms. It is difficult for conventional systems to automatically adjust optical axes, because it requires high-precision positioning and angle setting with &#956;m resolution. Moreover, multiple goals that have a trade-off relation must be satisfied simultaneously by the adjustment. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a multi-objective adjustment system using genetic algorithms. In experiments, simultaneous alignment for the positioning and the angles (parallelism) of optical axes, which is difficult with conventional methods, could be realized within three hours.

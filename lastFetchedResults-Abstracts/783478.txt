Objective Prevalence of behavioural and
emotional problems in primary school children was
examined 4 years after a baseline survey at preschool
age. The scope of symptoms was investigated. Due to
anonymity of data only group differences between the
two measurements were reported. Method A representative
sample of 1,481 children in fourth year
primary school was assessed with the Child Behaviour
Checklist (CBCL). In addition to the CBCL broadband
groups of internalizing (INT) and externalizing
symptoms (EXT) a third group of combined internalizing
and externalizing symptoms (COM) was defined.
Results The 6 month prevalence of child
mental health problems at second wave was 18%â€”a
significant increase on the previous baseline rate of
12.4%. Of those 18% of children with child mental
health problems 27.3% had exclusively internalizing,
6.0% externalizing symptoms and 52.4% had combined
symptoms of INT and EXT. Conclusion The
increasing prevalence was associated with an increase
of symptoms of the broadband groups INT and COM
but not EXT. The results also highlight an age and
gender specific vulnerability of boys, both at preschool
and primary school

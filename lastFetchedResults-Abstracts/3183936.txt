Hysteresis pulse width modulation has different application because of its unmatched dynamic response and wide command tracking bandwidth. The various hysteresis modulation schemes are available in literature for multilevel inverter. The techniques are desired and compare the reference signal to obtain the adequate switching frequency, excellent dynamic response and high accuracy in steady state operation. By using the hysteresis modulation modulator, the advantages of using several accessible DC potentials in a multilevel inverter have been rectified. All of these techniques are tested for tracking a current reference when applied to a five level inverter. And also compare the hysteresis techniques for the literature review and study the result also. The main objective of this paper is to control switching modulation using hysteresis PWM of multilevel inverter. In FCMI, Using MHM algorithm (Time based method) is proposed. To improve maximum allowable switching frequency and give better performance. The software implementation of proposed time based method is obtained using simulation of MATLAB version 7.0.

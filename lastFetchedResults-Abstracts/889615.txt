ABSTRACT: This is a paper on realistic elements in Harold Pinter’s The Room (1983). According to the most eminent critics, this contemporary play belongs to the post modern era. There are some characteristics of the Realist School that make the text clear for the reader to match it to the contemporary man’s life and manner and somehow make it more understandable. In this play, the middle class of the society is challenged from different aspects, but from the Realistic viewpoint the plot, the setting, the characterization and the character’s dialogues are discussed. In fact, they are the ways that the Realistic factors are clarified in an objective way. Pinter in this play shows the reality of the society as clear as it is. It is a cut of the man’s real life that he himself must judge it. It is a kind of play that Pinter is looking for the truth in the common man’s life. The setting of the play is completely touchable for the reader. He can match the atmosphere of the play to the characters’ behaviors, beliefs and their dialogues. The characters’ situations and their reactions toward each other are clearly discussed from the Realistic viewpoint.

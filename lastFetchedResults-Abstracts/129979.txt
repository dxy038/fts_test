Introduction & Objective: The prevalence of urolithiasis, due to different epidemiologic factors such as hypercalcuria and hyperuricosuria, was reported to be 3% to 4%. This study was performed to determine the prevalence of hypercalauria and hyperuricosuri in patients with urolithiasis and to recommend a suitable diet and treatment to reduce stone formation.
Materials &Methods: This is a descriptive, cross - sectional study performed on 120 patients who referred to the urologist at Shahid Mofatteh Clinic and Shahid Beheshti Hospital. The data were collected from selected patients using a questionnaire and also lab data such as 24 hr urine calcium and uric acid and urine culture. Then they were analyzed by spss software.
Results: Prevalence of hypercalcuria and hyperuricosuria in patients was found to be 20.8% and 10.8%, respectively. The synchronized prevalence of these abnormalities was 4.2%. Also 25% of hypercalciuric and 15.4% of hyperuricosuric patients have urinary tract infection. The most common age of patients with hypercalciuria and hypreuricosuria was in the range of 20-30 year,..
Discussion: Prevalence of hypercalciuria in the subjects was significantly lower than that in patients of other studies (p<.05) but making any decisive conclusion calls for further studies especially for other metabolic abnormalities that are common in urolithiasis patients.

In this paper, the authors demonstrate how holographic optical tweezers (HOT) can be used to control multiple nanocontainers with hitherto unknown precision and flexibility. For this purpose, the wave front of a 2.5 watts Nd:YVO<sub>4</sub> continuous wave laser (&#955;=1064 nm) is structured in such a way that it creates multiple, independent optical traps when focussed by the high numerical aperture objective of a commercial inverted microscope. Tailoring of the wave front is realized with a computer-controlled phase-only spatial light modulator, which displays a series of holograms, calculated in real-time, and thus allows for interactive, dynamic control of all created traps.

Nowadays, often picture of sharing data is: different organizations on different levels host its own GIS. Each of them uses software and a data model which best meet their needs with centralized storage and metadata interoperability, using appropriate tool for the job while eliminating complicated data transfers and multiple copies of the same data throughout the enterprise or department. Spatial Object Model enable using any combination of commercial or open-source GIS tools to work together with same database using triggers and storage processes. This paper demonstrates usage of IT infrastructure which is wide recognized by local governments or enterprises as platform for three-tier structure solution: spatial data server, application server and application client. Based on application server it is possible to produce different OGC Web Services for use spatial data in background application or expose via GIS portal. Any client can request the server if it accords with OGC specification. Objective of this paper is studies of very demanding integration and interoperability task from real-world: data server for storing terabytes of data, application server for creating web services which enable distribution this amount of data and simultaneously different GIS clients and WebGIS portal.

Majority of the fluid flows in nature and industries are turbulent flows. Due to their complexity, modeling 
and simulation of turbulent flows are still among the top research topics in the field of fluid mechanics. 
The objective of this work is to consider the turbulence effects at the interface. The presence of interface 
affects  the  turbulence  structures  and  they  become  anisotropic  near  the  interface.  In this  work,  the  main 
objective is to consider the fluctuations of the interface topology and their effects on the volume fraction 
and  the  surface  tension  force  at  the  interface.  These  effects  are  important  under  some  circumstances 
especially when the shape of the interface changes rapidly and abruptly. The surface tension forces and the 
volume fraction-velocity fluctuation correlation have also important impact on the interface topology and 
its  complicated  features  such  as  coalescence  and  breakup.  Different  new  models  are  presented  and  the 
impacts  of  those  parameters  on  the  flow  at  the  interface  are  presented  in  this  work.  In  developing  the 
models for  mean velocity-volume  fraction fluctuations  the  inhomogeneity  of  the  flow  at  the  interface  is 
taken  into  account.    Both  Reynolds Averaged  Navier-Stokes  Equations  and  the  Large  Eddy  Simulation 
Techniques were used to simulate turbulent interfacial flows and implement the novel models introduced 
in this work. The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, two-dimensional and three dimensional jets, and water/oil 
phase separation were simulated numerically and the results were compared with corresponding valid data 
and the accuracy of the models was examined.

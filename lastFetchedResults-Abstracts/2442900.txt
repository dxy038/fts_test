Background & Objective: Textile effluents contain significant amounts of toxic and organic pollutants. Due to health risks such as carcinogenic and mutagenic effects, discharge of this kind wastewater to water resources can lead to health impacts. The aim of this study was to survey the efficiency of Chitosan derivative in removal of basic dyes violet16 from aqueous solutions.
 
Materials & Methods: In this study the influence of different parameters including contact time, initial dye concentration, adsorbent concentration, and PH, was studied. Residual of dye concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer set in 545 nm wavelength. Adsorption data was described by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and kinetic reactions.
 
Results: The results showed that increasing contact time and adsorbent dose enhances dye removal rates for this adsorbent. By decreasing initial concentration of dye, removal rates increased. In optimal conditions, Chitosan derivatives were able to remove dye 68 percent respectively. For this adsorbents optimum pH was obtained 10. According to the results, adsorption process for both adsorbents was determined by Freundlich isotherm by R2 > 0.98. Dye absorption kinetic of both adsorbents followed pseudo second degree by R2 > 0.98.
 
Conclusion: the results showed that Chitosan derivative can be applied as an efficient adsorbent for removal basic violet 16 dye from aqueous solutions.

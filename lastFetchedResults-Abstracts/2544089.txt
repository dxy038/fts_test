Introduction: Dental microbial plaque is recognized as the most important factor in pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. The early prevention and training is considered as the most effective tool for reducing the dental and periodontal diseases and improvement of oral health. The main objective of this study  is to determine the effect of standardized student training method on reduction of dental plaque.

Methods: In this QuasiExperimental study, 62 students were randomly divided into two cases and control groups, in which practical training of oral and dental health by a standardized student (31 sles) and facetoface training were offered. Plaque index, which is indeed is the patientsrsquo  performance assessment index, is measured by the examiner and based on the Orsquo Leary plaque index. The plaque index before and after training , were recorded. A team was created for studentsrsquo  standardization. Then three onehour sessions held for studentsrsquo  practical training  and performance of students evaluated by the team members, and feedbacks were provided. In order to analyze related data for dental plaque index, descriptive and analytical statistics were used SPSS software Ver.21.0.

Results: The results showed a 25.62% drop in plaque index of patients in case group (trained by standardized student) and a 15.13% drop in control group (trained by facetoface learning), which are significant for both groups based on the independent sle test and the obtained confidence level (p = 0.000).

Conclusion: It can be concluded that training of standardized students, as it simulates an experienced mentor, can play a key role in reduced dental plaque and serve as an efficient technique for teaching the care service materials to patients.

The emergence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, coupled with the increasing overlap of the AIDS and tuberculosis pandemics has brought tuberculosis to the forefront as a major worldwide health concern. In an attempt to find new inhibitors of the enzymes in the essential rhamnose biosynthetic pathway, a virtual library of 2,3,5 trisubstituted-4-thiazolidinones was created. These compounds were then docked into the active site cavity of 6′hydroxyl; dTDP-6-deoxy- -xylo-4-hexulose 3,5-epimerase (RmlC) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The resulting docked conformations were consensus scored and the top 5% were slated for synthesis. Thus far, 94 compounds have been successfully synthesized and initially tested. Of those, 30 (32%) have ≥50% inhibitory activity (at 20 μM) in the coupled rhamnose synthetic assay with seven of the 30 also having modest activity against whole-cell M. tuberculosis.

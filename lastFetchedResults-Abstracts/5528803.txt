The profile of the service users in telecommunication networks shows a continuous growth in the interest towards real-time applications (streaming and interactive video, web conferences, voice over IP). In order to assure the optimal parameters for this kind of transmissions, the implementation of mechanisms that provide service quality support is mandatory. One way of assuring the QoS support in IEEE 802.11 networks is to enable the HCCA mechanism. This paper provides an objective analysis of the performances of the HCCA mechanism regarding voice and video applications by means of the evaluation of specific QoS/QoE parameters: delay, jitter and MOS.

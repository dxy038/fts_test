This paper evaluates the optimal design of the main inductor for LCL filter in a three phase active front end (AFE) rectifier. The objective is to evaluate the optimal inductance of the main inductance and its cost under various switching frequency, air flow speed, and inductance. The paper presents a detailed step by step optimization procedure to optimize main inductor with lamination materials. Then, the optimized designs under various conditions are compared and evaluated. In the end, one optimal sample is built up and tested to prove the effectiveness of the design concept.

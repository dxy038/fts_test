This work proposed a novel optical pickup head with tracking and focusing system in a monolithic device. The device was fabricated by poly-Si trench-refilled technology and used UV polymer droplet as objective lens. In-plane (tracking) and out-of-plane (focusing) motion were decoupled by springs, gimbal structure, and actuators. In results, we successfully demonstrate the proposed device included single tracking system, single focusing, and integrated system. The resonant frequency of tacking and focusing systems are 9.6 kHz and 4.2 kHz respectively

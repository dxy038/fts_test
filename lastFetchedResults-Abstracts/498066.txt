Background and objective: Host genetic and environmental factors are viewed as common basis of the different outcomes of HBV infection. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) can influence the host reactions to HBV infection. In this study, we aimed to determine the association between HBV infection and HLA-A, B and DRB1 alleles.

Materials and methods: HLA-A, B and DRB1 alleles in 33 patients with chronic hepatitis B(CHB) and 31 healthy carriers collapsed as persistent group, and 30 subjects who had spontaneously recovered from HBV infection were analyzed by using PCR-sequence specific primer (PCR-SSP) technique.

Results: The frequency of HLA-A*33 allele was higher in persistent group than recovered group (10.16% vs. 0%, P < 0.008); the frequency of DRB1*13 allele was lower in persistent group than in recovered group (3.13% vs. 11.67%, P < 0.03).

Conclusion: HLA-A*33 are related with susceptibility to persistence and HLA-DRB1*13 are related with protection against persistency of hepatitis B infection. These findings emphasized that host HLA is an important factor to determining the outcome of HBV infection.

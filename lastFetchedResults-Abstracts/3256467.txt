This paper proposes an optimization approach for dimensioning and procuring frequency control reserves in one integrated manner by TSOs in self-scheduling markets. The optimization approach considers procurement costs of frequency control reserves in the objective function while accommodating a hybrid probabilistic/deterministic system security metric in the constraints for frequency control reserves provision. The beginning of the decision period is at the beginning of the week when the prices of the daily market are not available and are therefore modeled by a set of scenarios. We formulate this two-stage decision making problem under uncertainty in the framework of stochastic programming, where the constraints are fulfilled for any scenarios. The simulation of real data derived from the Swiss ancillary services market illustrates that the new approach is computationally tractable, technically optimal, and economically beneficial. Therefore, the practical implementation of the proposed approach is planned on the Swiss ancillary services market in 2013.

In this paper, new numerical techniques are developed for the optimisation of steady and non-steady forming processes. These techniques consider the inverse problem formulation together with evolutionary search schemes. The solutions are obtained using numerical algorithms based on a genetic search supported by an elitist strategy. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the inverse evolutionary search, two specific cases are considered. The first case involves the optimisation of the process parameters aiming for a prescribed pressure distribution at the exit of the extrusion chamber. In the second case, the optimisation objective aims at the reduction of the difference between the realised and the prescribed final forged shape under minimal energy consumption.

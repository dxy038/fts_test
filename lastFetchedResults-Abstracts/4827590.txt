This paper presents a new approach for optimal operation of distribution networks with regard to distributed generators (DGs). The objective function in this problem includes cost of active and reactive electrical energy generated by DGs, electrical energy markets and capacitors. Also, this paper presents both application and comparison of the metaheuristic techniques such as the genetic algorithm (GA), differential evolution, ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), tabu search, to optimal operation of distribution networks. These methods are tested on two examples distribution network containing an IEEE 34 distribution test feeders and a practical distribution system.

Given a point p and a set of points S, the kNN operation finds the k closest points to p in S. It is a computational intensive task with a large range of applications such as knowledge discovery or data mining. However, as the volume and the dimension of data increase, only distributed approaches can perform such costly operation in a reasonable time. Recent works have focused on implementing efficient solutions using the MapReduce programming model because it is suitable for large scale data processing. Also, it can easily be executed in a distributed environment. Although these works provide different solutions to the same problem, each one has particular constraints and properties. There is no readily available comparison to help users choose the one most appropriate for their needs. This is the problem we address in this work. Firstly, we show that all kNN implementations go through a common workflow, which we use as a basis for classification. Secondly, we describe precisely the different techniques published so far. And lastly, we provide a set of objective criteria that can be used to make informed decisions.

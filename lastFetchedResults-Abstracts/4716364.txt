To preserve the controlled antegrade pulmonary blood flow (APBF) is one of contentious issues in the procedure of bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis (BCPA) for the treatment of single-ventricle physiology. Here, we reported our patient-specific researches of the controlled APBF on local hemodynamics of pulmonary artery by using the techniques of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Computer-aided design was employed to create a vascular model without the APBF based on the three-dimensional pulmonary geometry of a patient. We defined several indexes to quantitatively evaluate the effects of the APBF. The results show an obvious elevation of local static pressure, WSS and energy loss. This indicates the local hemodynamics is greatly influenced by the pulsatile blood flow. The controlled APBF may benefit subsequent Fontan procedure.

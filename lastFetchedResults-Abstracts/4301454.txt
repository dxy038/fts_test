The objective of this paper is to provide a comparison among permanent magnet (PM) wind generators of different topologies. Seven configurations are chosen for the comparison, consisting of both radial-flux and axial-flux machines. The comparison is done at seven power levels ranging from 1 kW to 200 kW. The basis for the comparison is discussed and implemented in detail in the design procedure. The criteria used for comparison are considered to be critical for the efficient deployment of PM wind generators. The design data are optimized and verified by finite element analysis and commercial generator test results. For a given application, the results provide an indication of the best-suited machine.

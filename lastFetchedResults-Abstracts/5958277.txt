In mobile robotics, environment modeling is an essential element of a navigation system. It must take into account all sources of uncertainties and represent their repercussions with a suitable formalism for the user processes. A general approach for environment modeling, dealing with position uncertainty, is described. The suitability of the approximate transformations for this objective is shown and applications of this environment model for several navigation tasks are analysed, along with simulation results.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

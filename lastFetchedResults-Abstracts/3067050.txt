Integration of RF power amplifier in silicon technology is a new challenge. RF lateral DMOS is one of the main candidates to achieve this objective. In this paper, the integration and optimization of an alternative RF N-type lateral DMOSFET in an advanced 0.25&#956;m RF BiCMOS technology are presented. The main optimization steps on DC and RF parameters are described. Linear characteristics and dynamic performances achieved are equivalent to the standard LDMOS architecture.

This paper presents a systematic approach to perform an on-line global design of look up table (LUT) controllers. This paper uses Vertex Placement Principle to design a controller for an initially unknown objective plant (P) based on a desired plant (DP) model. Both the desired plant and the objective plant are approximated with piecewise bilinear (PB) models. After the on-line identification of the initially unknown plant (P), the LUT-controller (C) is designed so as to make the closed loop plant (CP) behave like a desired plant.

This paper describes the model-based control algorithm developed for a hydrothermal oxidation reactor at the Pantex Department of Energy facility in Amarillo, Texas. The combination of base hydrolysis and hydrothermal oxidation is used for the disposal of PBX 9404 high explosive at Pantex. The reactor oxidizes the organic compounds in the hydrolysate solutions obtained from the base hydrolysis process. The objective of the model predictive controller is to minimize the total aqueous nitrogen compounds in the effluent of the reactor. The controller also maintains a desired excess oxygen concentration in the reactor effluent to ensure the complete destruction of the organic carbon compounds in the hydrolysate

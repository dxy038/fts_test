Cloud computing has emerged as a new paradigm, which is the long-held dream of computing as utility, customer get it on an on-demand model. When discuss about performance requirement and QoS (Quality of Service) of service, it is hard to tackle these problem in a round consideration. In this work we propose an SLA-aware (Service Level Agreement aware) framework cloud service provider (CSP) for cloud service (cloud infrastructure) delivery, and making allowance for the benefit of stakeholder of cloud service provider and service consumer. By using our proposed system and hierarchy SLA monitoring model we reached our win-win objective which is maximum revenue of cloud provider and minimum SLA violation.

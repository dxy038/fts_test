Our objective was to assess the effects of lactate enhancement in combination with different packaging systems on beef longissimus lumborum and psoas major steak color. Strip loins and tenderloins (n = 16) were assigned to one of four injection treatments (non-injected control, water-injected control, 1.25%, and 2.5% lactate in the finished product). Steaks were individually packaged in either vacuum, high-oxygen (80% O2/20% CO2), or 0.4% CO (30% CO2/69.6% N2) and stored for either 0, 5, or 9 days at 1 °C. The L∗ and a∗ values of both the longissimus and psoas responded similarly to lactate, which at 2.5% darkened steaks (P &lt; 0.05) packaged in all atmospheres and improved (P &lt; 0.05) the redness of steaks packaged in high-oxygen. Packaging steaks in CO did not counteract the darkening effects of lactate. Nevertheless, CO improved (P &lt; 0.05) color stability compared with high-oxygen packaging.

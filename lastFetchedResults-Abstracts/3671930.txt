A model is developed that assigns primary and secondary (backup) concentrator coverage to each terminal site. The objective is to minimize communications costs as well as costs for setting up and operating the concentrators subject to capacity constraints. A relaxation of the problem is studied, and an effective solution procedure that makes the use of this relaxation is developed. Experimental results over a wide range of problem structures show that this solution procedure is very effective. It is also found to be significantly faster than a state-of-the-art commercial integer programming package

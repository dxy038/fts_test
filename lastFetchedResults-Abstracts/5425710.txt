The authors propose an optimal force distribution method, called weak point force minimization, which minimizes linear, one-norm, or infinite-norm objective functions. A weak point is a generalized one which can be any point in multiple robots as well as a joint and/or an end-effector. To solve the weak point force minimization, the weak point forces are converted to the contact forces of end-effectors so as to reduce the computational burden. Then, the contact forces are obtained by using linear programming. The proposed method is applicable to diverse areas such as a long object, weakly connected assembly parts long links and weak joints in cooperating multiple robots. The method is also applicable to the multilegged vehicle and the multifingered hand

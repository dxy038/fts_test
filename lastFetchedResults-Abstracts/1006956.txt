In the present work, a new shell-and-tube heat exchanger optimization design approach is developed, wherein the dimensionless entropy generation rate obtained by scaling the entropy generation on the ratio of the heat transfer rate to the inlet temperature of cold fluid is employed as the objective function, some geometrical parameters of the shell-and-tube heat exchanger are taken as the design variables and the genetic algorithm is applied to solve the associated optimization problem. It is shown that for the case that the heat duty is given, not only can the optimization design increase the heat exchanger effectiveness significantly, but also decrease the pumping power dramatically. In the case that the heat transfer area is fixed, the benefit from the increase of the heat exchanger effectiveness is much more than the increasing cost of the pumping power.

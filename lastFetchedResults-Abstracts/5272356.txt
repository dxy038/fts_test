The authors study the bidirectional associative memory (BAM) model from the matched-filtering viewpoint, getting an intuitive understanding of its information processing mechanism. They analyze the problem of stability and attractivity, in BAM and propose some sufficient conditions. The shortcomings of BAM, that is, low memory capacity and weak attractivity, are pointed out. A revised BAM model is proposed by taking an exponential function operating on the related correlations between a probing vector and its neighbor library pattern vectors. From the analysis, it was found that stability and attractivity in the modified model are much better than in the original BAM if all the conditions are the same

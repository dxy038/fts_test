Objective
ly, cells from the apical papilla of retained human third molars (dental neural crest-derived progenitor cells, dNC-PCs) have been isolated and characterised as multipotent progenitor cells. Nonetheless, molecular processes during differentiation into mineralising cells are still unknown. This study evaluated the osteogenic/odontogenic differentiation of dNC-PCs under in vitro conditions and compared these cells with already known odontoblast precursor cells (dental stem cells from exfoliated human deciduous teeth, SHED).
s
fferentiation of dNC-PCs and SHED under in vitro conditions was verified by Alizarin red staining (mineralisation), alkaline phosphatase activity and the expression of osteogenic/odontogenic markers (RT-PCRs). The genome wide expression-profiles were investigated with Affymetrix DNA-microarrays and the cell migration with a gel spot cell migration assay.
s
 study dNC-PCs differentiated like SHED in mineralising cells. The expression of odontoblast markers suggested that dNC-PCs and SHED differentiated into different types of odontoblasts. This supposition was supported by genome wide gene expression profiles of dNC-PCs and SHED after cell differentiation. Typical biological processes of undifferentiated cells, for example “mitosis”, were regulated in dNC-PCs. In SHED biological processes like “response to wounding” or “cell migration” were regulated, which are associated with replacement odontoblasts and their precursors. Moreover, a gel-spot assay revealed that SHED migrated faster than dNC-PCs.
sion
sults suggest that dNC-PCs are precursors for primary odontoblasts, whereas SHED differentiate into replacement odontoblasts. These different odontogenic differentiation potentials of dNC-PCs and SHED have to be considered for cellular therapies and tissue engineering approaches in the future.

Methodology: This hospital based cross-sectional comparative study was conducted in Pediatrics Unit, PGMI/LRH, Peshawar All the patients were divided into two groups. In group 1, 100 vaccinated and in group 2, 100 non-vaccinated children were included. Both groups were compared for complications of measles. Results: In group 1, majority (51%) cases were in age range of 1-3 years and in group 2, majority (59%) cases were also in age range of 1-3 years. In group 1, male were 55 (55%) and 45 (45%) were female. In group 2, male were 53 (53%) and 47 (47%) female.

In group 2, bronchopneumonia in 51 (51%), diarrhea in 50 (50%), upper respiratory tract infection in 24 (24%), oral ulcer in 22 (22%), dehydration in 20 (20%), otitis media in 17 (17%), malnutrition in 12 (12%), and encephalitis in 11 (11%) patients.

Limited resources and requirement of regular maintenance of equipment in traditional laboratory supports idea of Web-accessible laboratories which provides facility of online experimentation on real processes. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the real-time web-based laboratory experiment conduction by accessing the laboratory setup from a remote location and measure the experimental parameters by generating the control commands at a distant client. This architecture is developed to demonstrate the remote learning process using graphical programming tool LabVIEW&#8482;10. The principle behind the implementation of remote laboratory session is to deliver the image of the control panel of the virtual Instruments to the remote client. The experimental hardware is linked to the webserver by Data acquisition (DAQ) interface card. The proof of concept has been demonstrated by controlling the speed of DC motor using Ward-Leonard method and recording the measurements using Virtual Instruments.

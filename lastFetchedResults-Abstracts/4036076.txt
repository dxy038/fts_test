Interface states play an important role in the performance of MOSFETs, and previous works only addressed the states within band gap. The implicit assumption is that the states beyond band gap (SBBs) are negligible, but there is no experimental evidence supporting it. Because of a lack of techniques for characterizing SBBs, there is hardly any information available. The central objective of this paper is to develop a technique for evaluating SBBs and to show the impact of SBBs on mobility evaluation. For the first time, the pulse capacitance-voltage has been used to extract SBBs quantitatively. It is found that SBBs can reach the order of 10<sup>13</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>&#183;eV<sup>-1</sup> beyond both conduction- and valence-band edges on a fresh MOSFET. The conventional split <i>C</i>-<i>V</i> technique ignores the SBBs, and this can lead to an underestimation of carrier mobility over 30%. Using the newly developed technique as a tool, the impact of nitridation of Hf-based dielectric stacks on carrier mobility is assessed. As nitrogen density increases, the apparent reduction of carrier mobility observed by early works originates from the higher SBBs. Once SBBs are taken into account, nitridation does not degrade carrier mobility. The SBBs are sensitive to process conditions, and this paper opens the way for their minimization.

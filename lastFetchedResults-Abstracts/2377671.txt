Background and Objective: There are evidences for the beneficial effects of probiotic products on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of probiotic yogurt consumption compared to conventional yogurt on enzymes and ecogenisity of liver in patients with NAFLD. 
Materials and Methods: This study was conducted on 72 patients with NAFLD. Subjects were randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group (n=36, in each group) and consumed 300 g of probiotic yogurt or 300 g of conventional yogurt everyday for 8 weeks, respectively. Dietary intakes, anthropometric parameters, liver ultrasonography, serum levels of liver enzymes were measured at the beginning and the end of the study. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software and chi-square test, independent sample t-tests, analysis of covariance and paired t-tests.
Results: There were not any significant differences in baseline characteristics at the beginning of the study.  Probiotic yogurt consumption caused 13.6% decrease in Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT) compared with the control group and reduced Aspartate Amino Transferase (AST) by 13.87%  (P  < 0.02 and P  < 0.005, respectively). No significant changes were seen in AST to ALT ratio between the groups after the trial (P-value  > 0.05). Results of liver ultrasonography showed significant improvement in intervention group versus control group (P-value  < 0.02).  
Conclusion: Probiotic yogurt consumption lowered serum ALT and AST concentrations in our subjects and improved liver ecogenisity. Nevertheless, it might have a role in the improvment of NAFLD.

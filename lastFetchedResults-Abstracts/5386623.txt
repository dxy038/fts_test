The hierarchical voltage control has been proved to be an effective method to ensure the security, stability and economy operation in power systems. The secondary voltage control is represented by the multiple objective linear programming with sensitive analysis in this paper. Several control objectives are considered. The first objective is that the pilot node voltage should be close enough to the setting value updated by the tertiary voltage control. The second one is that the reactive power output of the control generators should be adjusted to gain more reactive power margin. And the third one is that the error between the important bus voltage and its setting value should be least. This problem is solved by an extension of the simplex known as goal programming simplex by ranking the priority of the control objectives. Some simulation results of the secondary voltage control of Zouxian power plant zone in Shandong Power System in China demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method

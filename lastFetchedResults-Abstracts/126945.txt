Background : Matricaria chamomilla L has a particular position as analgesic, anxiolitic and carminative in traditional medicine.
Objective : To evaluate the analgesic and ulcerogenic effect of methanolic extract of matricaria chamomdla L.
Methods : This plant was extracted by suxhlet and percolation methods by methanol 80%. The extract was then concentrated and the weight of direct extract was determined and dissolved in normal satin to produce a different desired concentration . The analgesic effect was evaluated by,formalin and hot-plate test in mice and the ulcerogenic effect was studied in rats.
Findings : The results indicated that the analgesic effect of percolation extract is higher than the suxhlet extract (P< 0.01). The percolation extract with dose â€žf 200 mg kg which was injected intra-peritoneally to mice and its analgestic effect evaluated by hot - plate test revealed a significant effect to normal satin (P<0.05). The extract did not induce gusteric ulcer.
Conclusion : The results showed that the analgesic effect of the extract wasnot mediated via opiate system and probably meditated via its anti-inflammatory effect.

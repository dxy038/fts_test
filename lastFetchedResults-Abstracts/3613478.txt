Coupling between edge finite elements, nodal finite elements, and boundary elements for the calculation of 3-D eddy currents is presented. The objective is to allow an adequate treatment of different formulations using scalar and vector variables. Three kinds of first order edge elements are studied: tetrahedron, hexahedron, and prism. The hexahedron is the most interesting element: its shape functions are bilinear for each edge. The prism is interesting too: its shape functions are bilinear for its horizontal edges whereas they are linear for its vertical edges. The tetrahedron is the least interesting element as far as accuracy is concerned: its shape functions are all linear

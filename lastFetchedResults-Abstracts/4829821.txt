Objective of this paper is to analyze positioning performance in critical scenarios for global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs). For instance, in urban canyons GNSSs can fail due to too many blocked satellites. In these situations we propose to use measurements from a cellular system which can compensate the missing satellites by providing time difference of arrival measurements. All measurements are integrated in a hybrid data fusion and tracking engine based on extended Kalman filtering. Simulations are performed fairly realistic by application of raytracing simulations. The results show the potential of a future 3GPP-LTE system for complementary support of GNSS in these critical environments to improve positioning accuracy and coverage.

This paper proposes Genetic Algorithm (GA)
and Imperialism Competitive Algorithm (ICA) for
solving optimal distributed generation (DG) location and
capacity. The objective is to minimize network power
loss and improve the voltage stability index within the
frame-work of system operation and security constraints
in radial distribution systems. A detailed performance
analysis is carried out on 33 bus system to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Two
different objective functions are considered in this study:
(1) minimization of active power loss (2) maximization
of improve the voltage stability index. The goal is to
optimize each objective function. The site and size of DG
units are assumed as design variables. The results are
discussed and compared with those of traditional
distribution planning and also with GA and ICA.

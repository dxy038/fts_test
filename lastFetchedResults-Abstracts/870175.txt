In this paper, we consider the minmax product rate variation problem (PRVP), which consists in sequencing copies of different products on an assembly line in such a way that the maximum value of a discrepancy function between actual and ideal productions is minimum. One means of solving this problem lies in its reduction to a bottleneck assignment problem with a matrix of a special structure. To solve it, three different approaches have been adopted. These approaches exploit specific minmax PRVP matrix properties. This paper presents a computational experiment with symmetric and asymmetric objective functions and offers conclusions about the most efficient way to find optimal solutions.

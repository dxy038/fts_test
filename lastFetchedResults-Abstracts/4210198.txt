CCD spectrometer has commonly used to measure light color, but the survey in object color is not making much progress. This paper introduces an objects color measurement system composed by CCD spectrometer with illumination and observation in the condition of d/0. The system adopts light source to incidence the integrating sphere, after diffuse fully, the light illuminate the object. The object is imaged by objective lens in vertical direction on a reflector with holes, the light pass through the hole into a miniature integrating sphere, the mixed light enter CCD spectrometer. This color measurement system has advantages with point aim function, multi-field angle, viewable, etc.

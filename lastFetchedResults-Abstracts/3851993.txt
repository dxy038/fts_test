Bio-implantable sensors using radio-frequency telemetry links that enable the continuous monitoring and recording of physiological data are receiving a great deal of attention. The objective of this paper is to study the feasibility of an implantable sensor for tissue characterization. This has been done by querying an LC sensor surrounded by dispersive tissues by an external antenna. The resonant frequency of the sensor is monitored by measuring the input impedance of the antenna, and correlated to the desired quantities. Using an equivalent circuit model of the sensor that accounts for the properties of the encapsulating tissue, analytical expressions have been developed for the extraction of the tissue permittivity and conductivity. Finally, experimental validation has been performed with a telemetry link that consists of a loop antenna and a fabricated LC sensor immersed in single and multiple dispersive phantom materials.

The main objective of the paper is to describe asymptotic behaviour of Fourier–Haar coefficients of functions from Marcinkiewicz spaces. We also discuss the Cesàro summability and the almost convergence of sequences related to Fourier–Haar coefficients and generalise a result from [17]. Some analogues of Mercer's theorem for Fourier coefficients are proved.

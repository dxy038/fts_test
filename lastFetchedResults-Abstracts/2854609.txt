The paper presents the local voltage control of a power transformer as a function integrated in a numerical protection system. Because of this modern integration, the voltage control takes advantage of all the benefits that the numerical technology brings: flexibility, adaptive capability, access to data base interface, self monitoring abilities, logical and mathematical abilities etc. The main objective of the paper is to propose an adaptive functionality of the voltage control function, depending on the topology of the substation in which it is operating. For a certain topology a specific reference value of the voltage control function is set.

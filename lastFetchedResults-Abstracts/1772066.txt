The objective of the study was to investigate the influence of long-term storage (up to 1 year) and coating on the variation of micro-mechanical properties of four conventional restorative glass ionomer cements (GICs) within 3.5 mm deep class I cavities. Four commercially available GICs (Riva Self Cure (SDI), ChemFil Rock (Dentsply), Fuji IX Fast and Fuji IX GP Extra/Equia (GC)) were applied to 100 teeth. In each tooth, two similar 3.5 mm deep class I cavities were prepared and filled with the GICs, with and without resin coating. The samples were stored in artificial saliva at 37 °C for 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. The variation in mechanical properties (indentation modulus (E) and Vickers hardness (HV)) were determined in 100 μm steps starting from the filling surface, through the intermediate layer in between dentine and GIC, and ending 100 μm in dentin. HV and E were strongly influenced by the material (P &lt; 0.05, partial eta-squared ηP2 = 0.31 and 0.23) but less by aging duration (P &lt; 0.05, ηP2 = 0.02 and 0.12) and resin coating (P &lt; 0.05, ηP2 = 0.02 and 0.03). The depth of measurement (0–2 mm) has no influence on HV (P = 0.789). HV shows a gentle increase over the 1 year storage period (P = 0.002). A ∼300 μm GIC zone at the areas close to dentin with weaker properties as those measured in dentin or GIC was identified in all fillings, irrespective of the presence of coating, and at all storage periods. The thickness of this zone is more strongly influenced by storage (P &lt; 0.05, ηP2 = 0.081) than by material type (P &lt; 0.05, ηP2 = 0.056), while coating showed no influence (P = 0.869). Filler morphology and dimension were similar to upper parts of the GIC filling; however, the amount of low cations was higher. We concluded that the development of an intermediate layer in between dentine and GIC with lower mechanical properties might be responsible for the bond quality of GIC to dentine. Moreover, class I GIC restorations are unlikely to feature constant mechanical properties throughout the cavity, regardless of conditions such as aging and coating.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensory and physical characteristics of pork chops from loins enhanced to 110% of original weight with either (1) potassium lactate, potassium diacetate, phosphate and salt, (2) sodium lactate, phosphate and salt, (3) potassium lactate, phosphate and salt, (4) sodium acetate, phosphate and salt, or (5) phosphate and salt. A trained sensory panel evaluated pork flavor, saltiness, bitterness, soapy flavor, acid flavor, juiciness and tenderness of cooked chops. Visual color of raw chops was also evaluated. After 96 h in display, chops enhanced with lactate/diacetate had significantly lower (P&lt;0.01) aerobic plate counts than control (unpumped) chops, or those pumped with other solutions. Lactate/diacetate-enhanced chops maintained higher a* and b* values during display, and had less visual discoloration after 96 h display. Chops pumped with lactate, acetate or the lactate/diacetate mixture were more tender and juicy, and had more pork flavor than controls or those pumped with phosphate/salt only. There appears to be a significant advantage to using a lactate/diacetate enhancement solution over either lactate or acetate alone.

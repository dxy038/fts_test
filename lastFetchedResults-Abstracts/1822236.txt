Objective
al of the present study was to evaluate the histopathologic and morphometric effects of systemic boric acid in a rat periodontitis model.

-four Wistar rats were divided into three groups of eight animals each: non-ligated (NL), ligature only (LO), and ligature and treated with boric acid (BA) (3 mg/kg per day for 11 days). A 4/0 silk suture was placed in a subgingival position around the mandibular first molars; after 11 days the rats were sacrificed, and changes in alveolar bone levels were measured clinically and tissues were histopathologically examined to assess the differences amongst the study groups.
s
tio of presence of inflammatory cell infiltration (ICI) and osteoclast number in the LO group was significantly higher than that of the NL and BA groups (p &lt; 0.05). The ratio of presence of osteoblastic activity in the LO group was significantly lower than that of the NL and BA groups (p &lt; 0.05). Alveolar bone loss was also significantly higher in the LO group compared to the BA and NL groups (p &lt; 005).
sions
tudy has demonstrated that systemic administration of boric acid reduced periodontal inflammation and alveolar bone loss in periodontal disease in rats.

Abstract - In this work, the effect of secondary service
optimal power allocation on cognitive radio systems has been
investigated. We have formulated and solved an optimization
problem with the objective of maximizing the secondary
serviceâ€™s capacity. We have also investigated the effect of
having optimal power allocation against constant power
allocation on secondary service capacity and the primary
service outage probability degradation

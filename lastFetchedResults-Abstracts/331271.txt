Objective
The aim of this study was to compare three fracture toughness test methods, using four commercial dental porcelains.
Materials and methods

The fracture toughness test techniques involved were: the single-edge-notched beam (SENB), the indentation strength method (IS), and a rather convenient ASTM standard for advanced ceramics, which is still rarely used in dental ceramic research, the Chevron-notched beam method (CN). Duceram, Duceram LFC, Sintagon Zx and Carrara Vincent were chosen for study. Data was analyzed by two-way and paired ANOVA.
Result

No statistical difference was found between the CN and SENB methods with four dental porcelains, but IS was not always in statistical agreement with SENB or CN. Statistical agreement among all three methods occurred only with Duceram LFC.
Conclusion

The different test methods did not always lead to the same ranking or values of fracture toughness. Yet the toughness results of the SENB method were comparable to those of the CN method for all the four dental porcelains tested in this study.

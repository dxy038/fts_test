The authors present a new phase determination method that begins with the same preprocessing by an inverse filter as G.M. Giannakis and J.M. MendelÂ´s (1986) MP-AP (minimum phase-all pass) decomposition-based methods and then identifies the all-pass filter by maximizing the objective function <e1>J</e1> given by J.M. Mendel (see Proc. IEEE, vol.79, no.3, p.278, 1991), which only involves a single <e1>M</e1>th-order (<e1>M</e1>&#10878;3) cumulant of the output signal of the all-pass system considered. Two phase searching algorithms, PSA1 and PSA2, are presented for finding the maximum of <e1>J</e1>. The former uses exhaustive search and the latter iterative search. PSA2 is preferred to PSA1 since it not only has a much simpler parallel processing structure but is also faster than PSA1. Some simulation results for the case of <e1>M</e1>=3 with noise-free synthetic data are provided to support the validity of the method

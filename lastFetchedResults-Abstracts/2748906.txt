Minimizing latency and energy consumption is the prime objective of the design of data aggregation in battery-powered wireless networks. A tradeoff exists between the aggregation latency and the energy consumption, which has been widely studied under the protocol interference model. There has been, however, no investigation of the tradeoff under the physical interference model that is known to capture more accurately the characteristics of wireless interferences. When coupled with the technique of successive interference cancellation, by which a receiver may recover signals from multiple simultaneous senders, the model can lead to much reduced latency but increased energy usage. In this paper, we investigate the latency-energy tradeoff for data aggregation in wireless sensor networks under the physical interference model and using successive interference cancellation. We present theoretical lower bounds on both latency and energy as well as their tradeoff, and give an efficient approximation algorithm that can achieve the asymptotical optimum in both aggregation latency and latency-energy tradeoff. We show that our algorithm can significantly reduce the aggregation latency, for which the energy consumption is kept at its lowest possible level.

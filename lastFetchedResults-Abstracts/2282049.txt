The objective of two experiments was to evaluate non-protein N supplementation with protected urea sources in terms of rumen fermentation products, nutrient digestibility, and N balance in ruminally fistulated beef steers (initial bodyweight 239 ± 18 kg) fed switchgrass hay. Experiment 1 compared urea with Optigen II®, and Experiment 2 compared urea with RumaPro®. In both experiments, supplements (400 g/kg of daily dietary dry matter) were fed once daily or every 2 h in a balanced design. Supplements contained soybean hulls, corn grain, vitamins, and minerals as well as non-protein N sources. Non-protein N provided 0.18 g/g of dietary N. Switchgrass hay was fed once daily, at the same time as the supplement in the once-daily treatments. Dry matter intake (4.1 kg/d in Experiment 1, 4.5 kg/d in Experiment 2), dry matter digestibility (P&lt;0.25, 0.58 ± 0.014 g/g in Experiment 1, 0.58 ± 0.010 g/g in Experiment 2), N balance (P&lt;0.83, 11.3 ± 1.9 g/d in Experiment 1, 11.8 ± 3.6 g/d in Experiment 2), ruminal ammonia concentrations (P&lt;0.29, 15.2 ± 1.4 mM in Experiment 1, 11.8 ± 0.6 mM in Experiment 2), and ruminal short-chain fatty acid concentrations (P&lt;0.13, 77.7 ± 3.0 mM in Experiment 1, 75.4 ± 3.0 mM in Experiment 2) were not affected by feeding protected urea sources. Providing a steady supply of ruminally degradable N by feeding supplement every 2 h vs once daily decreased ruminal ammonia concentrations by approximately one-half by 4 h after feeding hay (P&lt;0.01 in both experiments) and increased (P&lt;0.02 in Experiment 1, P&lt;0.08) in Experiment 2) apparent digestibility of dry matter (0.58–0.62 in Experiment 1, 0.56–0.61 in Experiment 2) and dietary fiber components.

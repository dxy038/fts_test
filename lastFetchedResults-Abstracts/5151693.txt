The aim of this project is to design and optimize the existing automobile radiator. The entire analysis is carried out using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) with FLUENT (6.0.) as software. The main objective is to design the automobile radiator with surface area density (SAD) greater than 1000 m<sup>2/</sup>/m<sup>3</sup> with increased heat transfer coefficient, rate of Heat transfer, reduced cost and reduced weight using CFD. Suitable modifications are to be incorporated depending on the requirements.

This paper presents a terminal sliding mode control strategy that provides faster tracking error convergence than the existing methods. The main objective is to find a feedback control law such that the manipulator output tracks the desired trajectory in finite time. The Lyapunov stability theory is used to establish the reaching law condition for the Terminal Sliding Mode. A two-link robot manipulator is considered to study the effectiveness of the proposed method and simulation results show that the present technique provides faster tracking and lesser Chattering effects than the existing results.

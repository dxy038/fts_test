In this paper, we presented two prototype systems to analyze the role of touch in AR system. One was an AR evaluation prototype system used to design the aircraft cockpit. In this system, the pilots can touch the virtual buttons and meters to test the ergonomics performance of design results. The other was a touchable AR girl prototype system used to treat heterosexual-social anxiety. In this system, patients can touch and feel a virtual girl. We designed a series of subjective and objective experiments to prove the importance of &#8220;touchable&#8221; to enhancing the user experience in AR system.

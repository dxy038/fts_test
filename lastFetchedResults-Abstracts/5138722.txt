We present a simulation model of the operations in the emergency department (ED) at The Cooper Health System. Due to the large amount of variability that can take place within an ED, Cooper Health System sought the use of simulation to help evaluate their operations and possible solutions to their problems. The objective of the model was for Rockwell automation to create a model which depicts the current operations and evaluate possible alternatives to reduce the length of stay. For construction of the model, data was gathered 24 hours a day over a seven-day period. Every operation performed in the ED was evaluated. The model has yielded results that have saved the hospital considerable time as well as helped to avoid tremendous costs.

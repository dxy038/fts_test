This paper presents an open-source framework for developing guitar-based games using gesture interaction. The goal of this work was to develop a robust platform capable of providing seamless real time interaction, intuitive playability and coherent sound output. Each part of the proposed architecture is detailed and a case study is performed to exemplify its easiness of use. Some tests are also performed in order to validate the proposed platform. The results showed to be successful: all tested subjects could reach the objective of playing a simple song during a small amount of time and the most important, they were satisfied with the experience.

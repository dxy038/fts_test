Objective: The aim of this research was to assess the levels of reading literacy perception in 4th grade primary school students with visual impairment and comparing it  with  normal peer students.
Methods: The current research was a survey study and was performed by the use of PIRLS (2006) international standardized booklets as instrument. Twenty seven   4th graders of  three  primary exceptional schools in three different cities  ( Tehran, Rey and Qom)  were selected  by means of non-convenient sampling and compared with the equal  size  of students of matched adjacent normal  schools. The independent t-student test was used for the statistical analysis.
Results: There were significant differences in the levels of interpretation and modulation of data and ideas between students with visual impairment and normal sighted students, but there wasn't any significant difference in other reading literacy perception levels (p < 0.05).
Conclusion and recommendations: It is necessary to pay special attention to students with visual impairments and review their reading programs both in normal schools and also in the visual impairment specific schools. It is recommended that teachers and authorities provide more texts in brail for blind children and in addition to early intervention to educate and provide facilities, helping them to achieve deeper levels of reading literacy perception.

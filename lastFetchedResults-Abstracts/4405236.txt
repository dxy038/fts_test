Transducers based on dielectric electroactive polymers (DEAP) use the electrostatic pressure to convert electrical into mechanical energy or vice versa. Since the achieved actuation or energy gain depends on the applied electric field, the authors present a model-based voltage control of a DEAP transducer driven by a Dual Active Bridge (DAB) with bidirectional energy flow. Therefore, first of all a model of the electric behavior of the DEAP is derived. Afterwards the DAB is described as an appropriate high voltage DC-DC converter topology to feed DEAPs. Based on the models of these two components, a discrete voltage controller is presented that ensures an operation with high dynamic and accuracy. Finally, the developed controller is validated by measurements feeding the DEAP transducer with the proposed DAB.

One of the important aspects in learning foreign languages is considering differences between languages and their effects on the learning process. Number of objects is one general phenomenon, which is shown in different ways in different languages. There are many different ways to represent the number of objects in Russian and Persian languages, especially in morph-syntactic level. So learning and using numeral phrases (number + noun, number + adjective + noun) correctly in the nominative and objective cases in Russian is one of the difficult problems for Iranian students. In Russian language, this structure changes according to such criteria as grammatical case, number, animacy and inanimacy, and all of these structures are in contrast with similar structures in Persian. The purpose of this paper is to compare these structures between Russian and Persian languages. We further study and analysis the mistakes of Iranian students in learning and using numeral phrases in nominative and objective forms, and resolve them.

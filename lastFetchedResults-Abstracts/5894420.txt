In this paper proposes an addition of a variable step-size modified memoryless nonlinear gradient (MNG) algorithm for a second-order adaptive IIR notch filter for detection of sinusoids in noise environment. The structure of the adaptive IIR notch filter is based on direct form structure and lattice form structure. The objective of variable step-size (VSS) algorithm is to optimize the filter coefficient. The computer simulation results are shown that the proposed algorithm provides fast convergence speed, low mean square error, low variance of filter coefficients and high impulsive noise robustness.

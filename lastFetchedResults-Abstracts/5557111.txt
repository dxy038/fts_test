Construction is one of the most dangerous and risky businesses and building construction projects appear to have higher accident rates. In this paper, a new construction projects accident risk model was developed based on the unascertained number algorithm and the synthesis weights. According to human-machine engineering, the multi-index and hierarchical system of accident risk in construction projects was built and the method determining the synthesis weights of indexes including both subjective favoritism and objective information was described. Thus, qualitative knowledge and quantitative data can be integrated and quantitative change and qualitative change were to be reflected in the assessment results of accident risk in construction projects. Finally, the improved unascertained assessment approach model was constructed to assess accident risk in construction projects by combining qualitative and quantitative information over conventional or other subjective methods and was verified by a case study.

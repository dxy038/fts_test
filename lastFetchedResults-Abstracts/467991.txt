OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate whether inserting prostaglandin E2 gel at the time of scheduled nonstress tests in patients with postdate pregnancies can decrease rates of intervention.
STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter pilot study enrolled women with postdate pregnancies with Bishop score â‰¤6 who were undergoing antepartum fetal heart rate testing. Patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either a prostaglandin E2 intracervical gel (Prepidil) or a placebo gel after each of their scheduled nonstress tests.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the number of antepartum tests, labor inductions, or cesarean sections, the maximum oxytocin dosage, or the interval from admission to delivery in the prostaglandin E2 gel and placebo gel groups (n = 90). In the subset of patients with a Bishop score between 3 and 6 (63 patients), there were fewer inductions in the prostaglandin E2 group (30% vs 55%, P< .05).
CONCLUSION: Application of prostaglandin E2 gel at the time of scheduled antepartum testing in patients with postdate pregnancies with unfavorable cervices decreased the induction rate only among patients with intermediate Bishop scores. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:453-8.)

The variability of soil erodibility factor or soil resistance against to themotion of particles is a major component ofSoil Loss Equation Model. The aim of this study isto characterize the spatial variability of soil erodibility factor in part of the Zayandeh-Rood watershed in ChaharmahalvaBakhtiariprovince. A total of 71 samples from the 0-30 cm of soil depth in a semi-systematic grid (200*200 m)were collected in order to provide the requireddata. Soil structure, organic matter percent, permeability, coarse sand percent, and very fine sand+ silt percent were measured in the samples. Spatial variability of soil erodibility was investigated using semi-variance and the ratio of nugget variance to total variance. Krigingmethod havebeen used to create map of the required data. The validation of the maps was evaluated using mean error (ME) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results showed that the experimental variogram of soil erodibility factor fit with a spherical model and 2 to 2.3 km radius was determined for spatial range in these soil erodibility factor and silt percent parameters. All of the parameters were moderately spatially correlated. Spatial variability of soil erodibility factor is a fundamental element of soil erosion management. The objective dependent based on these results, spatial patterns of soil erodibility factor are linked to parent materials and soil types. Variance maps of these parameters showed that soil erodibility factor and silt percent arelargely increased by sampling region in neighboring line and in lower sample density of region.

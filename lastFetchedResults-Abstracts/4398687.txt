The location selection of ESS (energy storage system) is based on specific indexes, but the indexes selection should take into account the abilities whether energy storage system will provide the grid with fast active, reactive power, and voltage stability etc. Therefore, this paper establishes the index evaluation model from three aspects of security, stability and economy, to evaluate and make a reasonable location selection. In order to optimize the ESS capacity, this paper constructed a multi-objective optimal power flow model for the target to maximize the comprehensive benefit, and optimize the configuration of ESS. Finally, building the wind power and ESS simulation models based on the Power System Analysis Software Package (PSASP), to configure the location and capacity of the ESS. The experimental result shows that the model can effectively guide the ESS for the location and capacity optimization configuration, and can effectively evaluate the effect of ESS on large-scale wind power operation performance.

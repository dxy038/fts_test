This paper provide a brief idea about the modeling of solar photovoltaic grid connected system. Moreover the paper tries to explain the curve fitting technique adopted by the different modeling scheme and their related characteristics. The main objective of this paper is to provide a strong idea about the different methods modeling a solar photovoltaic system and finding the best model which can be useful for the engineers. The data provided by the manufacturer is used to calculate the nonlinear diode parameter at three different points such as at zero current point, zero voltage point and maximum point of the current voltage characteristics. The simulation is carried out with a mono crystalline solar cell for simplicity and then compared with the different modeling scheme to compare its accuracy with other model. The first part of the paper will give a review on the PV structure and the non linear parameters to be extracted from the curve by different iteration techniques.

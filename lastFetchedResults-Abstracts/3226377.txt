This paper proposes a behavioural competency framework for software development organizations. Examples of behavioural competencies are Leadership, Team-working, Client-Focus and Communication skills. The proposed competency framework will consist of clusters of related behavioural competencies, each having one or more competencies, which in turn will have specific behavioural indicators or descriptors as the basic unit of the model. The framework will form the underlying basis or template, for the systems, processes and assessment tools devised by the organization in each of the HRM areas, and enable them to be objective, measurable, reliable and valid, in their use as instruments for evaluating, managing and promoting effective job performance.

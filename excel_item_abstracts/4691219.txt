This paper addresses the problem of stabilizing a class of stochastic fuzzy systems with time delay using an impulsive fuzzy controller. We develop a systematic technique based on Lyapunov-Razumikhin method to obtain delay-independent fuzzy impulsive controller which guarantees the impulsive stochastic fuzzy control system with time delay to be globally exponentially stable in mean square. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed impulsive fuzzy controller.

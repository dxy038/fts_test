A World Wide Web (WWW) based client/server system has been developed which allows server-side process independent layout generators to generate the design rule correct geometry of analogue components such as resistors, capacitors and transistors for a design system running on a local workstation. The complete system is based on the bidirectional interface between a WWW browser and a VLSI design system, with layout generators running remotely on a WWW server

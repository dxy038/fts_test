The micro and nanomanipulation is one of the main challenges in our days. One approach is based on the use of a limited cluster of microrobots working in a cooperative way. For the development of the activity each robot of the cluster has assigned a different task. This implies that each robot has a different specialization. Our objective is to present in this paper the design of the electronics developed for these robots, taking into account the important challenges regarding the available area, and that the robot should possess enough autonomy. The most versatile solution is pursued because a particular electronics is not to be developed for each specialized robot. In function of the robotÂ´s specialty it will receive the necessary orders, being permeable the electronics to any case. In this paper is presented in a general way these different specializations.

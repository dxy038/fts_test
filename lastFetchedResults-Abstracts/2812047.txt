The service restoration of medium voltage distribution networks considering load reallocation in the substation areas that are topological neighbors to de-energized area is presented in this paper. The heuristic graph-based approach based on PrimÂ´s algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree logic is implemented in the service restoration application. Primary objective of the proposed service restoration application is the minimization of the unsupplied load to consumers in de-energised area. Secondary objective is the reduction of the number of switching operations. The approach for the reduction of the number of switching operations is based on the assignment of the weighting coefficient to branches in a de-energized area. Key improvement with the proposed algorithm is achieved by the introduction of the load reallocation consideration during service restoration calculations. The load reallocation significantly improves the fulfilling of the primary objective i.e. the number of consumers in de-energised area that shall have restored service shall be significantly increased.

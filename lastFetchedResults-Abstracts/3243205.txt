In this paper an analysis of hybrid architecture with a two-converters parallel configuration for electrical vehicle is presented. Then, two designed energy management strategies (EMS) are discussed: first, The EMS uses a power frequency splitting allowing a natural frequency decomposition of the power loads and secondly the EMS uses the optimal control theory, based on the Pontryagin´s minimum principle, which has as objective to minimize hydrogen consumption and simultaneously protect the fuel cell health. Thus, the application of these two different strategies for energy management will provide as a mean of comparison. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the control strategy based on pontryagin´s minimum principle in term of the improvement of the fuel consumption.

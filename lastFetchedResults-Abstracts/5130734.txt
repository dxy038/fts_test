It is most spectacular that non-conventional forms of energy i.e. renewable sources of energy has very vital &amp; promising role on our whole civilization. No doubt our rich cultural heritage and very extraordinary scientific development was some cumulative and exhaustive manipulations in each and every fact of our lives. Nowadays we have to be very efficient and able to use all these abundant sources of renewable energy to harness our economical and social growth without earning any ecological imbalances and concern to our unique planet Earth looking after each and every kind of life human, animal, plants as well as organisms. The Solar Power Satellites were used for collecting the solar power and then that energy is sent to Earth using Microwaves from the small antenna on the satellite to the very large area on the ground known as Rectenna. These SPSs delivers the power without disturbing Life-Cycle, environmental balance and Pollution level. SPSs receives the solar energy in intense form, Moreover Space is free from the day-night Cycles and changing Weather Problems. There can be various orientations for these SPSs like Geosynchronous, L1, L2, L3 Earth sun Lagrange Point which is specially used for the Scientific Purposes. SPSs need an enormous antenna and the ground station an ever larger Rectenna due to phenomenon of Diffraction. Energy from SPSs are reliable and better than the Wind, geothermal, Ground Based Solar Systems, Biomass and Nuclear Energy since it supplies Energy on large scale at Low cost and there are no associated problems like flooding, radiation, terrorism, waste Matter, acid rain, Carbon Di-Oxide and other GHGs etc. Since this form of Energy is transported by Power Lines, hence there is no fuel consumption and Thus It is clean form of energy too. So viewing all these benefits we could very well guess how profitable and futuristic it can be to achieve our objective to meet our Energy challenges without any concern over the Planet earth.

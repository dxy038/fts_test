The paper is focused on power adaptation algorithm based on frame utilization of femtocells. To decrease its computational complexity and to minimize generated signaling overhead, adaptation interval should be prolonged. The problem of existing power adaptation algorithm is an increase of the number of mobility events with extension of adaptation interval length. Thus, the main objective is to propose a new adaptation algorithm able to cope with this problem. The possible disadvantage of new algorithm consists in longer interval of femtocell´s overloading. We suggest mitigating this drawback by appropriate selection of target frame utilization, which is also contemplated in this paper. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed in terms of number of generated mobility events and femtocell´s overloading time. The results show that the proposed adaptation algorithm outperforms the existing one for longer adaptation periods.

In this paper, new optimization approaches are proposed to improve the conversion efficiency of the organic solar cells. The double exponential solar cell model is used to formulate the objective functions, which are the prerequisite of genetic algorithm computation, to improve the conversion efficiency. The problem is then presented as a multi-objective optimization one where the electrical parameters are considered simultaneously. Therefore, the developed approach is used to search of the optimal electrical parameters to obtain better conversion efficiency of the organic solar cells. The proposed approach may provide a theoretical basis and physical insights for organic solar cells design.

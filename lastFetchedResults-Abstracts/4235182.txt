In this paper, a voltage control strategy of a large wind farms integrated region is proposed. The strategy regulates the network voltage by coordinating the reactive power among wind farms. When the voltage control point of the region is selected, then the steady state voltage without disturbance is selected as the control objective. Firstly, the reactive power/loss sensitivity is used to choose wind farms that will participate the voltage control; secondly, the voltage/reactive power sensitivity of the region is used to calculate the relationship between the voltage variation and the reactive power adjustment of the wind farms; finally, the reactive power adjustment of each wind farm is determined by primal-dual interior point method which considers the reactive power capacity of the wind farm and the voltage constraints of each point in the region. Application of the control strategy to a network of China testified its validity.

This paper analyzes laws of disaster evolution and characteristics of disaster situation information and divides the problem into two phases. Under the background of two phases and multi kinds of warehouses, this paper studies how to distribute relief supplies in an effectively and fairly manner to meet the needs of disaster victims and reduce the loss. In black decision phase, without the determining probabilities of scenes, this paper proposes a robust decision model with the objective of arriving time, fulfill rate and balance. Under that, the problem of the location of distribution center and the relief distribution among warehouse, distribution center and affected areas in the first phase can be solved. In grey distribution phase, with the determining probabilities of scenes, a stochastic decision model is proposed. These models play an effective role in solving relief distribution problems caused by disaster situation information in practical relief. In the end, the validity of this model was verified through numerical experiments. This work would provide practical decision methods in disaster relief distribution problem.

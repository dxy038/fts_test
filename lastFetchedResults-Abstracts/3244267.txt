Smart environments are physical places that are richly and invisibly populated with sensors, actuators and computational elements. The objective of such environments is to adapt themselves to its users in order to increase their comfort and usefulness. This paper proposes a platform, named APOLLO, capable of inferring behaviour rules from a smart environment and apply them to provide an intelligent space. The APOLLO platform is built upon a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), in which collected context information is used to infer behaviour rules though statistical and machine learning techniques. The proposed platform is to be deployed in a home automation scenario.

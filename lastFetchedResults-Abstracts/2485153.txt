Nanoparticles have widespread application in all aspects of modern life because of unique features of them as small size and high surface area. Several studies have been done to explore the probable detrimental effects of nano-particles on human reproduction. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of zinc oxide nanoparticles on LH, FSH and testosterone hormones in adult male mice. In the present study, 30 NMRI mice were divided into 5 groups. Single injection with different doses of zinc oxide nano particles were applied intraperitoneally (250, 500 and 700 mg/kg). Then serum level of LH, FSH and testosterone hormones were measured using ELISA method. The results were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey test. The results showed that zinc oxide nanoparticles in 250 and 700 mg/kg doses caused a significant increase in FSH and testosterone level in blood serum respectively compared with control group. This study showed that effects of nano zinc oxide is dose-dependent and Causes increase in Testosterone and FSH hormones while caused no significant change in LH hormone level.

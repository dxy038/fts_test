Abstract
Introduction: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is defined as a set of physical and psychological symptoms that occur during the Luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Among this complaint, anxiety is more common and aversive. 
Objective: This study was designed to reduce anxiety through comparison of the effectiveness of group cognitive behavioral therapy and group cognitive hypnotism in women with premenstrual syndrome. 
Materials and Methods: The study was done using semi-experimental method on women and girls who were referred to 12 Health centers of Rasht city in 2013. Available sampling was used and 30 women with premenstrual syndrome were selected and divided into 3 groups of 2 experimental groups and 1 control group randomly. The first experimental group, received 8-week group cognitive behavioral therapy, and the second group received hypnosis cognitive therapy group. The third group received no special treatment: 8 item Premenstrual syndrome inventory and the Beck’s questionnaires anxiety were used in pre-test and Post- test. Data were analysed using covariance analysis and Tukey. 
Results: The results show both therapies were effective on reducing anxiety in women with PMS (p < 0/001). Also, CBGT, in comparison with hypnotism group was not different in reducing anxiety signtificantly in women with PMS. 
Conclusion: The results showed that psychological therapies were effective for Premenstrual syndrome and given their fewer complications, such therapies are more recommended than the medication treatment. In addition, considering similar effectiveness of CBGT and hypnotherapy, using the latter as a substitute for CBGT is recommended, especially in women’s diseases.

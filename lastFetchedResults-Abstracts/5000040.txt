RF MEMS (radio frequency micro electro mechanical systems) technology holds great promise for wireless communication and sensor systems. Excellent MEMS switching devices have recently been developed, but because of packaging problems, no commercial integrated product exists. The objective of the ongoing work at CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC) and Morgan Research Corporation (MORGAN) is to develop novel packaging concepts, design tools, and demonstrated RF MEMS packaged devices for high frequency applications

Objective
s primarily involved in the protection of epithelial surfaces. Decreases in oral mucosal defence can be a predisposing factor for the development of oral mucosal diseases in the elderly. The aim of this study was to compare MUC1 expression level in oral mucosal epithelial cells of the elderly with that of young adults.

 elderly (mean age, 71.1 ± 4.6 years) and thirty young (mean age, 26.4 ± 2.4 years) adults (15 men and 15 women in each group) were included. Oral examination, including tooth, periodontal, and oral mucosal status, was performed and whole saliva samples were collected along with flow rate measurements. Precipitates of stimulated whole saliva were used for the evaluation of MUC1 expression using real-time PCR. Clarified supernatants were used for the measurement of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α.
s
was a significant decrease in the amounts of MUC1 transcripts in elderly subjects compared with those of young subjects, a result seen in both men (0.589-fold) and women (0.547-fold). The MUC1 expression level was not correlated with salivary cytokine level but did show a significant positive correlation with the level of periodontal inflammation (rs = 0.505, P &lt; 0.01) in the elderly group.
sions
ucosal defence provided by MUC1 was decreased in the elderly; this decrease may play a role in the development of oral mucosal diseases in the aged population.

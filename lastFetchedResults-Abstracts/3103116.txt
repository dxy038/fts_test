In this paper, we present a new spatial error concealment algorithm with optimized directional decision and extrapolation. First, we employ the Sobel operator and a Hessian matrix to determine the exact direction in the cases of existing both step edges and line edges in the image. Then, with the accurately estimated direction, lost MBs are recovered by directional extrapolation pixel-by-pixel. From experimental results, the proposed spatial error concealment method provides both subjective and objective quality improvement of concealment especially for images with more lines.

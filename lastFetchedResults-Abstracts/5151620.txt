An interactive procedure will be derived to facilitate a designer in choosing proper actuators and their locations and optimal dimensions on each component in a robot so that the robot has the same time constant for any direction of motion and less nonlinear effects. An integrated solution of the following problems will be sought for to derive the procedure. A data structure to represent a robot in a data-base should be created. A proper objective function, which represents the dynamic characteristics of robots (i.e., time constants and nonlinear effects), has to be defined. A method of computing the objective function from a set of optimization variables should be derived. As a case study, a five degree of freedom RHINO robot will be optimized. This paper is an extended abstract because the project is still on the way.

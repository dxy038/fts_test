Abstract
Background and objectives: Identification and monitoring of multidrugresistant
Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains (MDR) is highlighted by the
high risk of their spreading in different areas. Prevalence of these strains
was evaluated in Golestan province in northeast of Iran.
Material and Methods: Drug susceptibility testing to Isoniazid and
rifampin was carried out for 148 clinical samples that had grown in
Mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) system, according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Becton-Dickinson, USA). The association of
drug resistance frequency with demographic characteristics and growth
time were investigated. The appropriate statistical tests, X2 and student Ttest
were performed for comparison of these variants. A p value > 0.05 was
considered significant in all cases.
Results: The turnaround time required for growth of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis in MGIT system was between 2 to 55 days (mean 16.3Â±10.4
days). Of all samples studied, 17.6% and 3.4% were resistant to Isoniazid
and rifampin, respectively, and 3.4% (5 samples) were MDR (CI 95%; 1-
6%). The turnaround time required for determining MDR cases was 9.6
days. No statistically significant association was found between the
resistance to the drugs and none of the factors including sex, age, type of
clinical sample, and positivity of the smear.
Conclusion: The prevalence of MDR in the studied region was determined
to be 3.4% which is similar to the country-wide evaluations. The
turnaround time for Mycobacterium growth and anti drug susceptibility
result can be shortened by MGIT method.

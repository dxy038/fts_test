This paper presents a novel multi-objective mathematical model for a capacitated single-allocation hub location problem. There is a vehicle capacity constraint considered in this model. Additionally, our model balances the amount of the incoming flow to the hubs. Moreover, there is a set of available capacities for each potential hub, among which one can be chosen. The multiple objectives are to minimize the total cost of the networks regarding minimizing the maximum travel time between nodes. Due to the NP-hard property of this problem, the model is solved by a multi-objective imperialist competitive algorithm (MOICA). To prove its efficiency, the related results are compared with the results obtained by the well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, namely NSGA-II. The results confirm the efficiency and the effectiveness of our proposed MOICA to provide good solutions, especially for medium and large-sized problems. Finally, we conclude that the proposed MOICA finds quality solutions rather than the solutions obtained by the NSGA-II algorithm.

An improved NSGA-II algorithm is applied to the optimization of inverse planning in intensity modulated radiation treatment (IMRT). The test example of irregular field under the condition of water phantom is used to test the inverse planning process of IMRT. The objective functions of PTV (planning target volume) and NT (normal tissue) are based on the average dose distribution. The result of inverse planning shows that the algorithm has clearly advantages on convergence speed and Pareto front distribution.

The objective of this research was to study genotype x environment interaction and to evaluate stability analysis of grain yield in chickpea genotypes under rainfed condition. Experimental material was comprised of 17 genotypes with the experiments carried out in RCBD of four replications at Kermanshah, Lorestan, Ilam, Gachsaran and Gorgan Research Stations during the two years of 2003-2004. The results of combined analysis showed that yearx location, genotypesx location and yearx location x genotypes were significant. Different stability analysis methods employed for assessing yield stability. Using environmental coefficient of variation, it was (CVO indicated that genotypes no. 1,7, 13, 15 and 17 with high yielding and less variations may be identified as stable genotypes. Through Rank Sum of Method (RSM) it was found that genotypes number 7, 13 and 5 were the most stable lines. In addition, results of stability analysis on grain yield (using simultaneous selection for yield and stability as well as Shokla variance (c*i2)) showed that genotype no. 13 was the most stable genotype. Stability analysis determined through AMMI stability value (ASV) method showed that genotype no. 13 (FLIP 97- 114) was the most stable one. All in all and based on different stability analysis methods it was shown that genotype no. 13 was the most stable genotype. The results of different stability parameters were found to be similar for the selected genotypes. But AMMI stability value (ASV) was found to be a more valuable and practical approach to stability analysis in compare to others, for ASV parameter explained %76 of the genotype * environment sum of squares.

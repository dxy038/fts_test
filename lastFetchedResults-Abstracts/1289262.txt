Vitamin E (VE) is a generic term that represents a family of compounds composed of various tocopherol and tocotrienol isoforms. Tocotrienols display potent anti-angiogenic and antiproliferative activities. Redox-silent tocotrienol analogues also display potent anticancer activity. The ultimate objective of this study was to develop semisynthetically C-6-modified redox-silent tocotrienol analogues with enhanced antiproliferative and anti-invasive activities as compared to their parent compound. Examples of these are carbamate and ether analogues of α-, γ-, and δ-tocotrienols (1–3). Various aliphatic, olefinic, and aromatic substituents were used. Steric limitation, electrostatic, hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) properties were varied at this position and the biological activities of these derivatives were tested. Three-dimensional quantitative structure–activity relationship (3D QSAR) studies were performed using Comparative Molecular Field (CoMFA) and Comparative Molecular Similarity Indices Analyses (CoMSIA) to better understand the structural basis for biological activity and guide the future design of more potent VE analogues.

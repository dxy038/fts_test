Objectives This study aims to examine competing
explanations of the relationship between religious and
political ideology commitment with posttraumatic growth.
Method Subjects were Israeli youth who were exposed to
terror (n = 2,999) aged 13â€“15. Measures included: posttraumatic
growth inventory, religious orientation, ideological
commitment, objective and subjective exposure to terror.
Results Both religiosity and political ideology mediated
the effects of exposure and fear on growth. Political ideology
but not religiosity, had a moderating effect, such that
subjective fear was positively associated with growth only
among those with stronger ideologies.
Conclusion Results support the contention of Terror
Management Theory that cultural beliefs have beneficial
effects on well being in the face of adversity and emphasize
the role of cultural world as effecting growth, beyond
trauma.

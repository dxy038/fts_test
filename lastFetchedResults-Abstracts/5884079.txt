Web services are new forms of Internet software that can be universally deployed and invoked using standard protocol. Services from different providers can be integrated to provide composite services. In this paper, we study the end-to-end QoS issues of composite service by utilizing a QoS broker that is responsible for coordinating the individual service component to meet the quality constraint. We design the service selection algorithms used by QoS brokers to meet end-to-end QoS constraints. The objective of the algorithms is to maximize the user-defined utility while meeting the end-to-end delay constraint. We model the problem as the multiple choice knapsack problem (MCKP) and provide efficient solutions. The algorithms are tested for their performance.

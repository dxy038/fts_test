An advanced adaptive transversal filter using 0.5 /spl mu/m MMICs has been developed and its performance fully evaluated at X-band frequencies. The design objective of the filter was to provide rapid frequency tuning, response programmability, and low phase distortion. The 48 tap filter was composed of 96 MMIC chips assembled in a MIC environment. Bandpass, bandstop, and all-pass filter characteristics were successfully obtained by adjusting the tap weight.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

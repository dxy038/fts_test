Objective
rpose of this secondary analysis was to describe medication use and examine the relationship between medications and postoperative symptoms/problems in the first 3 months after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABS).
s
mple consisted of older (≥65 years) men and women (n = 232) who had undergone CABS. Medication data were collected through self-report 3 and 6 weeks and 3 months after surgery.
s
atients reported taking aspirin (88.2%–85.7%), statins or cholesterol-lowering drugs (88.6%–87%), and beta-blockers (68%–55.6%). No significant differences were found between the proportion of patients taking and not taking beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics, cholesterol-lowering drugs, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medications for common medication-specific symptoms/problems.
sion
ts experience symptoms after surgery, but these symptoms did not seem to be side effects from medications. Nursing assessments and interventions targeting postoperative symptoms, symptom management, and medication side effects can enhance recovery and reinforce medication adherence.

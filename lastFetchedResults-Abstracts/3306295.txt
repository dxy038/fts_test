This article deals with the definition of a unified framework for the simultaneous handling of both industrial objectives declaration and performance expressions. Subscribing to continuous improvement process, previous works have been separately focused, on the one hand, on the objective quantification and, on the other hand, on the performance expression mechanism. This mechanism was based on a formal distinction between the elementary performances and the overall one. Overall performance is associated to the overall considered objective while elementary performances correspond to the elementary objectives, namely the objectives which are provided by the overall objective break-down. Looking now to unifying, into a methodological framework, the different steps that are involved in a performance expression process, this study focuses on the objective break-down step. In this sense, it is proposed to consider, according to the industrial practice, that this breakdown is no more than the corollary of the associated action plan. Structural break-down, with the variable central point, and temporal break-down are highlighted, and illustrated by industrial examples.

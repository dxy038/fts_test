Objective
The objective of the study was to determine the amniotic fluid soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 concentrations in women with preterm labor in relation to intra-amniotic infection.
Study design
Amniotic fluids from 125 women with preterm labor (78 with preterm delivery and 47 with term deliveries) were examined for both soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 concentrations and intra-amniotic infection with Ureaplasma species. A Ï‡2 test, or Fisher's exact test, when appropriate, was used for statistical analysis.
Results
In the preterm delivery group, 45% (35 of 78) had intra-amniotic infection with Ureaplasma species, compared with 19% (9 of 47) in the term delivery group (P = .004). In women with intra-amniotic infection, 26% (9 of 38) had soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 levels above 1290 ng/ml. Only 2.3% (1 of 43) in the preterm delivery group without intra-amniotic infection attained this diagnostic level (P = .004). In contrast, there was no significant difference in soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 levels between those with or without intra-amniotic infection in the term delivery group.
Conclusion
Amniotic fluid soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 concentrations exceeding 1290 ng/ml can be used as a marker for intra-amniotic infection with Ureaplasma in patients with preterm labor.

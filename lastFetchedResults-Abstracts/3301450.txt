The main objective of the PECES project is the development of system software to enable the communication among heterogeneous devices across multiple smart spaces, breaking the traditional barrier of &#8220;smart islands&#8221; where only the services offered in a nearby spatial area can be used easily. PECES development tools help the application developer to build and test the PECES middleware based applications. This paper presents a set of tools, namely Peces Project, Peces Device Definition, Peces Ontology Instantiation, Peces Service Definition and Peces Role Specification Definition which enable application developers to build the PECES middleware based application using the novel concepts such as role assignment context ontologies and heterogeneous communication technologies. Furthermore, this paper proposes new tools which enable to model and simulate the smart space applications.

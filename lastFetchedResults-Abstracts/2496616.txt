The objective of this research was to evaluate yield parameters (gained weight, weight percentage, survival, feed conversion factor (FCR), feed conversion efficiency (FCE), condition factor (K), specific growth rate (SGR) and hepatosomatic index (HSI) of trouts fed with experimental diets elaborated with bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) flour instead of fishmeal with 15, 30 and 45% (BF15, BF30 and BF45, respectively) for 32 days, as well as a control diet (CD). The greatest weight gain was presented by fish fed with BF15 and BF30 (14.48 and 14.14 g, respectively) with no significant differences (p > 0.05) and an approximate increase of 50% of their initial weight. FCR did not show significant differences (p > 0.05) among CD, BF15 and BF30 diets with an average value of 2.05. FCE did not show significant differences (p > 0.05) between diets BF15 and BF30 with an average value of 46.70%. SGR did not show significant differences (p > 0.05) between BF15 and BF30 diets with an average value of 1.25. It is concluded that 30% is the maximum substitution without causing a decrease in yield and nutritional parameters in rainbow trout under the experiment conditions, although further research is suggested.

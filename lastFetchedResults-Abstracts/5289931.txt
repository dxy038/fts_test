This paper explores the use of genetic algorithms in the field of fractals generation. Recently in addition to conventional schemes of the fractal generation new technique for generating the fractals has been initiated. This paper mainly focuses on handling and manipulating the points in 2D space based upon the principles of genetics to search for apparent or hidden similarities among the data points. The use of such techniques is targeted for exploring the ldquosimilarrdquo pattern among the points in 2D so that a self similar or fractal structure may be obtained. The novelty lies in the fact that the proposed scheme does not use objective function of the any of the fractals.

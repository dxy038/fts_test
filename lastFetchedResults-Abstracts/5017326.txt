In deep-submicron technology (DSM), minimizing the propagation delay and power dissipation on buses is the most important design objective in system-on-chip (SOC) design. In particular, the coupling effects between wires on the bus that can cause serious problems such as cross-talk delay, noise and power dissipation. Most of the researchers have concentrated either on minimizing the power dissipation or minimizing crosstalk delay. In this paper, the authors propose a technique for energy efficient data transmission for on-chip buses and evaluate the effectiveness of our technique by using SPEC 95 benchmarks suit. The authors show that our technique achieves 35% of energy savings over the un-encoded data transmission on the data bus

Endurance of trunk and pelvic girdle muscles are important for good posture. The Matthiass' arm-rising test is used to assess posture and postural related muscle performance. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between score of Matthiass arm raising test with endurance of trunk muscles. For this purpose, 118 boys with the mean age of 10.21±0.86 years, weight of 36.38±10.18 kg and height of 140.11±7.54 cm were selected. Matthiass Test was recorded using digital camera and their compensatory movements were analyzed by computer. Subjects were classified in three groups according to compensatory movements; normal, weak and poor. The endurance of trunk flexor muscles was measured by modified Sorenson test. Back extensor muscles were measured by McGill endurance test. A lateral trunk flexor muscle was measured by McGill side bridge endurance test. The results indicated a significant relationship between the score of Matthiass Test and endurance of trunk muscles. According to the outcome of the current study, it can’t be concluded that Matthiass test has significant relationship with endurance of trunk muscles. However, it is suggested for screening of schoolchildren in large-scale studies. However, further studies with substation subjects are needed to help definite conclusion.

Objective To evaluate the adsorbing effect of montmorillonite on uric acid and montmorillonite decreasing the level of uric acid in the serum. Methods The adsorbing effect of montmorillonite was observed in vitro and the effect of decreasing the serum concentration of uric acid of acute hyperuricemia model mice. The concentration of uric acid was measured by a method of uric acid enzyme and enzymatic peroxides. Results In the simulated intestinal solution, montmorillonite could adsorb uric acid potently with an obvious concentration -effect relationship. The adsorptive effect was more potent than medicinal carbon. Montmorillonite of 20 g/L showed less different adsorptive rate on different concentration uric acid. The adsorbent time-effect curve of montmorillonite on uric acid showed that the adsorbing effect of montmorillonite was fast. The absorbed rate of montmorillonite on uric acid was more than 60 % within half an hour and reached the balance after 1 hour. The adsorptive rate was high in acid environment (pH 2~6), while it was low in alkaline environment (pH 8~10). Montmorillonite could decrease the concentration of uric acid in serum and in intestinal tract of mice orally given uric acid, which suggests that montmorillonite block the adsorption of uric acid in intestinal tract. An acute hyperuricemia model was prepared by injecting uric acid intraperitoneally. Montmorillonite decreased the uric acid level of hyperuricemia mice obviously, suggesting that montmorillonite promotes diffussion of uric acid from blood vessel to the intestinal tract. The effect was stronger than medicinal carbon. Conclusion Montmorillonite can adsorb uric acid and reduce the level of uric acid of acute hyperuricemia model mice obviously.

This study addresses deflagration initiation of lean and stoichiometric hydrogen–air mixtures by the sudden discharge of a hot jet of their adiabatic combustion products. The objective is to compute the minimum jet radius required for ignition, a relevant quantity of interest for safety and technological applications. For sufficiently small discharge velocities, the numerical solution of the problem requires integration of the axisymmetric Navier–Stokes equations for chemically reacting ideal-gas mixtures, supplemented by standard descriptions of the molecular transport terms and a suitably reduced chemical-kinetic mechanism for the chemistry description. The computations provide the variation of the critical radius for hot-jet ignition with both the jet velocity and the equivalence ratio of the mixture, giving values that vary between a few tens microns to a few hundred microns in the range of conditions explored. For a given equivalence ratio, the critical radius is found to increase with increasing injection velocities, although the increase is only moderately large. On the other hand, for a given injection velocity, the smallest critical radius is found at stoichiometric conditions.

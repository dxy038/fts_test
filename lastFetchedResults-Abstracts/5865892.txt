We present a distributed path selection procedure which has the objective of balancing the load in the network. It is used here in a connection oriented framework and is based on selecting, at each hop along a partially computed path, any one of the available routes to the destination. As far as we know, our approach is the first distributed multipath routing algorithm guaranteed to be loop-free after convergence, while at the same time basing its route computation on the actual load on the links of the network, as opposed to using some administrative, static, metrics

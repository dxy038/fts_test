For high light sensitivity, new CFA designs use panchromatic pixels, aka white pixels, that no visible spectrum energy is filtered. KodakÂ´s CFA2.0 has 50% white pixels, but the demosaicking performance is not good. We present in this work a set of new color filter arrays (CFA) of high light sensitivity and high demosaicking performance which were obtained by using a CFA design methodology in the frequency domain. The new patterns are of size 5&#215;5 and come from the same frequency structure, which has one luma in the base band at (0, 0) and four chromas (two conjugate pairs) placed at (4&#960;/5, 2&#960;/5), (- 4&#960;/5, - 2&#960;/5), (2&#960;/5, - 4&#960;/5) and (- 2&#960;/5, 4&#960;/5), respectively. The new patterns are optimized to have only white (panchromatic) and three primary color pixels and the pixels are found to be 40% white, 20% red, 20% green and 20% blue by pixel color constrained optimization. Our demosaicking experiments show that our new CFA patterns outperform Kodak CFA2.0 in both objective and subjective quality.

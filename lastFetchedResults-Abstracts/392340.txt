Objective: To evaluate Cisplatin (CP) induced ototoxicity and the effects of vitamin B treatment on ototoxicity in guinea pigs by using the Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission (TEOAE) technique. Methods: Eleven guinea pigs were divided into two groups and they were tested by TEOAE before and after the experiment. A TEOAE response was regarded as positive when all of the following criteria were met: 1. The mean amplitude of the cochlear response in dB pe SPL should be greater than that of the noise in the external auditory canal; 2. The reproducibility rate of the response should be greater than 50%; 3. The stimulus stability rate should be greater than 65%; 4. The signal to noise ratio of the response in 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 kHz band frequencies should be greater than 3 dB pe SPL in at least two bands. The first group included five animals that had only CP injections. Six animals in the second group received additional 0.2 ml/kg combined vitamin B preparations for 7 consecutive days. Thereafter, the right and left ears of all animals in both groups were tested by TEOAE. Results: TEOAE responses recorded from 22 ears of 11 guinea pigs before drug administrations showed that the responses with maximum amplitude were originated from the mid-frequency region. Positive TEOAE responses were significantly reduced after CP administrations in both groups when compared with their respective pretreatment results (P<0.01). However, vitamin B injections, in addition to a single large dose of CP, resulted in significantly better TEOAE responses than those obtained after only CP injections (P<0.05). Conclusions: The routine use of TEOAE monitoring is recommended in clinical CP treatment protocols for the early detection and follow up of ototoxicity. Also, prospective clinical trials are needed in order to validate the protective effects of vitamin B treatment against ototoxicity.

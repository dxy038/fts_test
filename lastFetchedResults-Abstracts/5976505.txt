Take support structure as the object, studied the multi-objective optimization of optimization layout of structural materials and maximize natural frequency under multiple load cases. Based on the SIMP (solid isotropic material with penalization) method, compromise programming method was adopted to define objectives of multi-objective topology optimization. With the supporting structure for the study, established a topology optimization model, conducted the multiobjective topology optimization, the layout has been optimized, and raised the natural frequency. The results of analysis show that the topology optimization process is solution to the optimization of plate and shell structures.

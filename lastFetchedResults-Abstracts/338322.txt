Objective
To test the hypothesis that hematopoietic growth factors may influence lineage choice in pluripotent progenitor cells, we investigated the effects of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) on erythroid and myeloid potentials of multipotent EML cells ectopically expressing M-CSF receptor (M-CSFR).
Materials and Methods

EML cells are stem cell factor (SCF)-dependent murine cells that give rise spontaneously to pre-B cells, burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E), and colony-forming unit granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM). We determined BFU-E and CFU-GM frequencies among EML cells transduced with murine M-CSFR, human M-CSFR, or chimeric receptors, and cultivated in the presence of SCF, M-CSF, or both growth factors. Effects of specific inhibitors of signaling molecules were investigated.
Results

EML cells transduced with murine M-CSFR proliferated in response to M-CSF but also exhibited a sharp and rapid decrease in BFU-E frequency associated with an increase in CFU-GM frequency. In contrast, EML cells expressing human M-CSFR proliferated in response to M-CSF without any changes in erythroid or myeloid potential. Using chimeric receptors between human and murine M-CSFR, we showed that the effects of M-CSF on EML cell differentiation potential are mediated by a large region in the intracellular domain of murine M-CSFR. Furthermore, phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122 interfered with the negative effects of ligand-activated murine M-CSFR on EML cell erythroid potential.
Conclusion

We propose that signaling pathways activated by tyrosine kinase receptors may regulate erythroid potential and commitment decisions in multipotent progenitor cells and that PLC may play a key role in this process.

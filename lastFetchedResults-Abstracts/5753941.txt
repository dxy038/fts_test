This paper is a summary of our research on applying neural network based signal processing to array antenna problems which we call neural beamforming. The objective is to train the network at certain training angles within the antenna field of view so that it can perform the desired antenna function with arrays which cost less to manufacture. We are also concerned with array operation in adverse environments (e.g., near field scattering). Our research has experimentally demonstrated the proof of concept for neural beamforming by implementing three antenna functions: direction finding (DF); radar detection; and, beamsteering.

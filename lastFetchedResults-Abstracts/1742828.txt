This paper investigates the multi objective optimization of 6-degree of freedom cable-driven parallel robots by using the evolutionary optimization algorithm. In this regard, the determination of cable-driven parallel robots workspace is reviewed as the most important challenge in the design of space cable-driven parallel robots and among various definitions, controllable workspace is selected as a general definition of the cable-driven parallel robots workspace, in which the robot cables remain in tension for any applied forces and wrenches to the end-effector. In order to evaluate the dexterity of the under study robot, the condition number index is used as an effective criterion to measure the distance from singularity. Moreover, the worst kinematic sensitivity is introduced as a presentable accuracy index. Furthermore, by taking the advantages of multi-objective optimization methods such as the non-sorting genetic algorithm, the optimal pareto front for the design parameters of the robot is obtained such that simultaneously, all of the robot designâ€™s objectives are satisfied.

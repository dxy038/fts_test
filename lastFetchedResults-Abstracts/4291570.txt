A methodology for modeling and simulating kinetic-electronic systems using artificial intelligence techniques is outlined. The methodology involves the coupling of numeric and semantic representations. The objective is to separate the simulation model responsible for the numeric computing from the knowledge system responsible for the semantic process. The semantic knowledge is processed by a Prolog module and all mathematical knowledge is processed using Fortran. The advantages of the proposed approach are demonstrated on a simple circuit example

The EndoTOFPET-US collaboration is developing a multi-modal imaging tool combining Ultrasound with Time-Of-Flight Positron Emission Tomography into an endoscopic imaging device. The objective of the project is to obtain a coincidence time resolution of about 200ps FWHM and to achieve ~1mm spatial resolution for the PET head, while integrating all the components in a very compact detector suitable for endoscopic use. This scanner aims to be exploited for diagnostic and surgical oncology, as well as being instrumental in the clinical test of new biomarkers especially targeted for prostate and pancreatic cancer. The current status of the project is presented in this paper.

The 11th International Workshop on Web Semantics and Information Processing (WebS 2012) continues a series of successful workshops dedicated to this topic. Its main objective is to bring together researchers, developers, and practitioners to discuss research issues and experiences in developing and deploying semantic Web concepts, applications, and solutions by establishing an international forum for the presentation of both theoretical and applicative results. We received 16 papers from 11 countries, and the WebS 2012 program committee finally selected 10 papers for presentation at the workshop.

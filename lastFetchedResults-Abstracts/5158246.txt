The National Inspection Council for Electrical Installation Contracting (NICEIC) is an independent consumer safety organisation. Registered as a charity, the Council acts as the electrical contracting industry´s voluntary regulatory body. The Council´s sole objective is to protect users of electricity against unsafe and unsound electrical installation work. The NICEIC achieves this by maintaining a list of electrical contractors throughout the UK that it´s assessed and approved. The work of the NICEIC is briefly described covering qualifying managers, training schemes, annual assessment, electrical installation certificates, approved contractors inspection, NICEIC action plans, complaints investigation, and periodic inspection reporting

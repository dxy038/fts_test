Previous studies from our laboratory on tumor cells suggest that phytosterols stimulate ceramide production, which was associated with cell growth inhibition and stimulation of apoptosis. The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of phytosterols on ceramide metabolism in small intestinal cells that represent the first cells in contact with dietary phytosterols. Caco2 cells, an accepted model for human intestinal epithelial cells, were used in this study. Ceramide and ceramide-containing lipids were examined by labeling the ceramide pool with 3H-serine. Cells were supplemented with 16 μM of sterols (cholesterol, β-sitosterol or campesterol) for 16 days postconfluence and continued to differentiate. Of the two phytosterols, β-sitosterol, but not campesterol, induced more than double the serine labeling when compared with cholesterol. This increase was uniform in sphingomyelin (SM), ceramide and sphingosine labeling. Sterols had no effect on SM concentration in the cells. In addition, sterol had no effect on the activity of SM synthase or sphingomyelinases. There was an inhibition of ceramidases with campesterol supplementation. These data suggest that the observed increases in SM and sphingosine labeling were due to an increase in ceramide turnover. The increase in ceramide turnover with β-sitosterol supplementation was not associated with growth inhibition but was with increases in ceramide glycosylation products such as cerebrosides and gangliosides. It was concluded that β-sitosterol has no effect on differential Caco2, a model of normal small intestinal cells. The increase in the glycosylated ceramide products may offer a means to protect the cells from the harmful effect of ceramide by excreting them with lipoproteins.

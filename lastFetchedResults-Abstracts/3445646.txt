The design is presented of a digital proportional-plus-integral current controller for a nonlinear electromagnetic actuator using an online parameter optimization approach. The minimization algorithm of J.A. Nelder and R. Mead (1965) is used to calculate the proportional and integral controller gain such that a design objective function is minimized. At each iteration of the minimization procedure, the objective function is calculated by sampling the actual current and voltage signals of the actuator

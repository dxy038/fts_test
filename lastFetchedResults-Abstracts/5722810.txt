The control of manufacturing systems is a problem due to its complexity and conflicting goals within the different production objective. In this article, in order to cope with some of these difficulties, we introduce a two-level fuzzy logic-based control structure, allowing the division of the complex control problem into elementary production modules. The proposed approach is characterized by two hierarchical levels. On the lower level of the hierarchy, each production module is designed as an adaptive fuzzy controller which acts independently from the others to regulate the flow of the material into a system, and on the upper level, a supervisor adjusts the parameters of the sub-controllers in order to improve the overall performance and restrict the system to the admissible domain. This leads to hierarchical and distributed control structure.

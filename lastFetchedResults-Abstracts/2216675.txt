Despite many researches on dissimilar joint between steel and aluminum with friction stir welding process, study on the new scientific and economically priced joints to help various industries seems necessary. The objective of the present work is to investigate the efficacy of heat generation on the mechanical properties and material flow in AA1100 aluminum and A441AISI joint. In this study, tool offset, plunge depth, welding linear speed and tool rotational speed were chosen as variable parameters that have direct effects on heat generation. Comprehensive analysis using the experimental results showed that the strongest joint was obtained at 1.3 mm tool offset and 0.2 mm plunge depth when the offset tool rotational speed and linear speed were 800rpm and 63mm/min respectively. At the mentioned parameters, the optimal frictional heat generation and material mixing were created. Fracture locations in tensile test at all samples were in aluminum sides. Internal defects that caused lower tool rotational speed were removed by increasing the revolving due to more heat generation and, with growing trend in linear speed due to the greater forging force, the surface defects abated. The maximum strength of welded joints with selected parameters was 90% aluminum base metal. In this research, microhardness of joint interface ascended with increasing rotational speed. This phenomenon is due to formation of thick intermetallic layers in abutting edges of sheets.

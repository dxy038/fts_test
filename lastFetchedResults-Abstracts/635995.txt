A large-sample test for testing the equality of two effect sizes is presented. The null and
non-null distributions of the proposed test statistic are derived. Further, the problem of estimating
the effect size is considered when it is a priori suspected that two effect sizes may be close to each
other. The combined data from all the samples leads to more efficient estimator of the effect size. We
propose a basis for optimally combining estimation problems when there is uncertainty concerning
the appropriate statistical model-estimator to use in representing the sampling process. The
objective here is to produce natural adaptive estimators with some good statistical properties. In
the context of two bivariate statistical models, the expressions for the asymptotic mean squared
error of the proposed estimators are derived and compared with the parallel expressions for the
benchmark estimators. We demonstrate that the suggested preliminary test estimator has superior
asymptotic mean squared error performance relative to the benchmark and pooled estimators. A
simulation study and application of the methodology to real data are presented

A Perceptual Constrained Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (PCGSVD)-based approach is proposed here for the enhancement of speech corrupted by colored noise. The proposed approach, called the PCGSVD-SDCE, uses the Spectral Domain Constrained (SDC) estimation method. Very carefully performed objective evaluations and subjective tests show that the PCGSVD-SDCE approach proposed here can offer improved speech quality and intelligibility, especially when the additive noise is nonwhite.

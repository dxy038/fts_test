Road Transport is one of the most common methods for transporting passengers and goods. The issue of road safety, with regards to improving safety and reducing the accident rate, is one of the most important issues for experts and specialists in the transportation and traffic fields; discussion of which has been underway for many years. One of the most common solutions to this problem is the application of road safety management tools and also the use of the road safety inspection approach. Moreover, a seven-step risk engineering model (risk assessment) can be applied in order to achieve this objective. The proposed model utilizes a systematic and scientific process to evaluate the safety level of the system and identify measures to reduce risk to an acceptable level. Therefore, this thesis will attempt to initially identify problems and technical defects in a section ofa high-accident location on a freeway as a case study, and then apply the risk engineering model to calculate quantitatively the risk and its economic cost. Ultimately, recommended actions should be carried out by examining various options and providing alternative strategies according to the risk level of each risk factor identified. In addition, to validate this model, implementation will be carried out at another high accident location on this freeway.

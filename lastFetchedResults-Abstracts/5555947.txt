This paper presents the GSA method is used to determine the optimal locations and ratings of TCPST. TCPST is the equipment used to regulate and improve the power flow on the power system. TCPST is implemented on the Java-Bali 500kV power system. The objective function of this study is to minimize the active power losses on transmission line of Java-Bali 500kV power system. The active power losses on transmission line of the Java-Bali 500kV power system before optimization using Newton Raphson method is 297.607MW. While the active power losses results after optimization using the GSA method with 4-TCPST is 234.885MW.

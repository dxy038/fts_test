Polypyrrole is one of the most useful conductive polymers, but green synthesis of this polymer has been restricted until now. The objective of the present study is green synthesis of nano polypyrrole (PPy) by oxidative polymerization using urea-hydrogen peroxide. It was found that conductivity and morphology of polypyrrole are highly dependent on the reaction conditions such as the molar ratio of oxidized to monomer, temperature, reaction time, kind of solvents, the presence of a catalyst such as p-toluene sulfonic acid, and specially concentration and addition time of hydrochloric acid. After understanding the relationship between these factors, we turned this enormous variability into improved polypyrrole properties.

In this paper, we study model reduction for multiscale problems in heterogeneous high-contrast media. Our objective is to combine local model reduction techniques that are based on recently introduced spectral multiscale finite element methods (see [19]) with global model reduction methods such as balanced truncation approaches implemented on a coarse grid. Local multiscale methods considered in this paper use special eigenvalue problems in a local domain to systematically identify important features of the solution. In particular, our local approaches are capable of homogenizing localized features and representing them with one basis function per coarse node that are used in constructing a weight function for the local eigenvalue problem. Global model reduction based on balanced truncation methods is used to identify important global coarse-scale modes. This provides a substantial CPU savings as Lyapunov equations are solved for the coarse system. Typical local multiscale methods are designed to find an approximation of the solution for any given coarse-level inputs. In many practical applications, a goal is to find a reduced basis when the input space belongs to a smaller dimensional subspace of coarse-level inputs. The proposed approaches provide efficient model reduction tools in this direction. Our numerical results show that, only with a careful choice of the number of degrees of freedom for local multiscale spaces and global modes, one can achieve a balanced and optimal result.

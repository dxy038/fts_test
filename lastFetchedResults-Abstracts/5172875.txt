In this paper, the finite-time control method is proposed to achieve synchronization based on bidirectional coupled chaotic systems. The stability criteria is presented for error system based on Lyapunov method. Compared to other results, the proposed controller is simpler and the new nonlinear system is considered which is consisted of the chaos system and the finite time controller. The Wolf method is used to calculate the largest Lyapunov exponent which shows that the controlled chaos system remains chaotic features. Simulation results for Lorenz system are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the finite-time synchronization control scheme.

Objective: We sought to develop a model of chronic intrauterine and fetal infection with Gardnerella vaginalis.Study Design: The uterine horns of pregnant New Zealand White rabbits were inoculated on day 21 of gestation with either 107 colony-forming units (cfu) of G vaginalis or saline solution. At necropsy, cultures were taken from blood, uterus, amniotic fluid, and fetal tissues. Amniotic fluid was assayed for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α by bioassay. Maternal and fetal tissue samples were evaluated using the histologic index score. A P value <.05 was considered significant. Results: Compared with saline solution–inoculated animals, the G vaginalis group had significantly more positive cultures from uterus, amniotic fluid, and fetal brain and lung (P = .02 to <.01). For the G vaginalis group, mean TNF-α levels and fetal brain scores increased significantly over time (P < .001 for both). Conclusion: Chronic intrauterine and fetal infection with G vaginalis is accompanied by progressive increases in amniotic fluid TNF-α concentrations and fetal brain histologic index scores.

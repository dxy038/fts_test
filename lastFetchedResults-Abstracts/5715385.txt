Blue-Green Laser Communication is the &#8220;game-changer&#8221; in Undersea Dominance, connecting the Undersea Network. The objective of this paper is to address the issues that impact both the scope of performance that is possible (e.g., data rate and range), as well as address relevant engineering considerations (e.g., size, weight, and power) for a variety of architectures that support critical undersea scenarios.

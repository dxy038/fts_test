The objective of this paper is a redefinition of the robot control problem, based on (1) realistic models for the industrial robot as a controlled plant, (2) end-effector trajectories consistent with manufacturing applications, and (3) the need for end-effector sensing to compensate for uncertainties inherent to most robotic manufacturing applications. Based on extensive analytical and experimental studies, robot dynamic models are presented that have been validated over the frequency range 0 to 50 Hz. These models exhibit a strong influence of drive system flexibility, producing lightly damped poles in the neighborhood of 8 Hz, 14 Hz, and 40 Hz, all unmodeled by the conventional rigid-body multiple-link robot dynamic approach. The models presented also quantify the significance of non-linearities in the drive system, in addition to those well known in the linkage itself. Simulations of robot dynamics and motion controls demonstrate that existing controls coupled with effective path planning produce dynamic path errors that are acceptable for most manufacturing applications. Major benefits are projected, with examples cited, for use of end-effector sensors for position, force, and process control.

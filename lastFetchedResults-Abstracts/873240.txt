In this paper, a class of generalized convexity is introduced and a unified higher-order dual model
for nondifferentiable multiobjective programs is described, where every component of the objective
function contains a term involving the support function of a compact convex set. Weak duality theorems
are established under generalized convexity conditions. The well-known case of the support
function in the form of square root of a positive semidefinite quadratic form and other special cases
can be readily derived from our results.

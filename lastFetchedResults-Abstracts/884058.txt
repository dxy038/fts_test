It can be said that almost each movement is a kind of perceptual-motor skill. The main objective of this research
is to investigate the effect of selected perceptual-motor activities on eye-hand coordination of 6-7 years old
children. The research is a field research and is conducted in a quasi-experimental manner. Statistical population
of this research consist of 1368 boys of 6-7 ages who were studying in pre-elementary and first grade of
elementary schools in Torbat-e Heydarieh in academic year of 2012-2013. The statistical method of the research
is quasi-experimental. As a result, descriptive statistics is used for determining the mean, standard deviation and
drawing tables and diagrams. In inference section, the hypotheses of the research are tested by independent
sample t test and dependent sample t test. There is a meaningful difference between the results of posttests
which was given to our two groups of 6 years old and 7 years old children. This difference is more significant in
the group of 6 years old children compared to the other group of 7 year old children. However, there was no
meaningful difference in the pretests of the two groups.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Early diagnosis of preeclampsia could make early intervention and on time delivery possible and decrease the risk of progressing into severe preeclampsia, pulmonary edema, eclampsia, stroke, and even death. Factor V Leiden (FVL) during pregnancy could lead to placental clotting events and fetal and maternal complications such as preeclampsia and recurrent miscarriage. This study was designed and conducted to investigate the association of FVL deficiency with preeclampsia and eclampsia in pregnant women.
METHODS: In this case-control study, 142 pregnant women with preeclampsia (since the 20th week of pregnancy onwards) referring Maternal Clinic of Hajar Hospital, Shahrekord were selected as control group after clinical, laboratory examinations and according to specialist viewpoint and 142 pregnant women with normal blood pressure were selected as control group. After obtaining consent and completing relevant questionnaire, 4cc blood was taken from patients and FVL rate was measured. The patients after six months were followed up in view of blood pressure.
FINDINGS: The rate of FVL deficiency in the pregnant women with preeclampsia was 5(3.5%) cases while no case was observed in healthy pregnant women group (p=0.03). In case group compared to control group, preeclampsia history contributed to development of current preeclampsia (p=0.001). In addition, in case group the prepregnancy BMI was significantly higher compared to control group (p=0.001). 
CONCLUSION: In view of significant difference of FVL deficiency between pregnant women with preeclampsia and healthy women in the region under study, it seems that measurement of this factor help unpleasant complications of vascular disorders derived from this factor deficiency during pregnancy decrease.

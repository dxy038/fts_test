We propose a new algorithm of noise reduction in color images. The new technique of multichannel image enhancement is capable of reducing impulse and Gaussian noise and it outperforms the basic methods based on vector median used for noise reduction in color images. A new smoothing operator, based on a random walk model and on a fuzzy similarity measure between pixels connected by a digital geodesic path is introduced. The efficiency of the proposed method was tested on the standard color images using the widely used objective image quality

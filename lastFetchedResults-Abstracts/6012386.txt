Changes in real power affect mainly the system frequency. The integration of fuel cell when coupled with change in load will result into a change in real power. The integration will result into change of frequency of synchronous machines. Possibility of control actions related for PEMFC and/or external disturbances occurring in one sub system may be transmitted, via the interconnection, to neighboring sub systems, thereby producing undesirable effects. Therefore, the need to design a control scheme in order to keep the system in the steady state. In this paper we propose a LFC scheme using DAC. A DAC controller by which maximum utilization of DR output to achieve the control objective more efficiently is designed. The performance of the controller designed is compared with linear classical methods such as PI control.

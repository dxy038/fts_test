With due consideration to the increase of traffic, CENA (French ATC R &amp; D) has developed an helping tool for arrival management in airports nammed MAESTRO (Means to Aid Expedition and Sequencing of Traffic with Research of Optimization. The main goal of MAESTRO, which is based on estimated time computation and sequencing criterias consideration, is to provide a proposal for arrivals flight sequencing as well as indications for actions leading to the propose sequence. The overall philosophy of MAESTRO is "Computation and proposal made by machine, actions and decision made by controllers". The objective of the tool are: - to garanty the optimal feeding of the airport; - to improve the interface between Tracon and ACC; - to lead to a better use of the control system capacity; - to optimize the delay management process in all centre.

This paper demonstrates the use of simulation in an evaluative study for the technology of liver transplantation from the cost-effectiveness point of view. This study is conducted in the United Kingdom where there are no explicit guidelines for the prioritization of patients waiting for transplantation. Another objective of the model is to enable health economists to understand the technology of liver transplantation and evaluate alternative policies for prioritizing patients in the waiting list. The paper shows the construction of a tailor-made package (LiverSim) and provides an example of how this package is used by the stakeholders to assist in the evaluation process. Some final lessons are drawn that simulation helps in exploring more issues outside the boundaries of quantitative results

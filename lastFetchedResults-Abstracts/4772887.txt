The system is specialized for pulmonary physicians focusing on tuberculosis and for patients already diagnosed with tuberculosis. The main focus for the development of the system is on the architecture and algorithm used to find the probable class of tuberculosis a patient may have. The class of tuberculosis is determined by using a rule base populated by rules made for the different classes of tuberculosis. The clinical decision support system integrated with Fuzzy Logic and Rule-based method that generates classes of tuberculosis suits the needs of pulmonary physicians and lessens the time consumed in generating diagnosis.

Sustainability of Georgetown as world heritage site is a primary objective and urgent problem to be address by The State Government in Penang. The aims are to develop Web GIS solution and 3D visualization for sustainability of Georgetown as World Heritage Site. The objective of this research is to study concept and principles sustainable development and to construct the Web GIS solution with 3D visualization of Georgetown. Methodology used to generate 3D building from building footprints that have actual height and produce a virtual 3D city model environment. Through the web based, the users enable to visualize the present and for future of urban development. With the advanced Geographic Information data which were made accessible on the Internet by Web GIS solution technology offered an effective medium for public participation. For Web GIS solution each of building have information about category of building, section, architecture style, road name, building name and building number. This web based also provides or demonstrates the capacity to view, manipulate and distribute geographic data via WWW in an effective, organized user friendly manner. The platform can be used by a public and many agencies to access and acquired geospatial data and information. As the final outcome from Web GIS solution will enable user to interact with GIS data and maps on the Web without have to own GIS software. Planners, architects, urban designers, and land use planners are able to visualize the impact of urban design projects and proposed land use and zoning changes or predict the results of smart growth initiatives towards sustainability of Georgetown as world heritage site.

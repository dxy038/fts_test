Ceruloplasmin is a serum ferroxidase that carries more than 90% of the copper in plasma and has documented roles in iron homeostasis as well as antioxidative functions. In our previous studies, it has been shown that the ceruloplasmin gene is strongly up-regulated in catfish during challenge with Edwardsiella ictaluri. However, little is known about the function of this gene in teleost fish. The objective of this study,Â therefore, was to characterize the ceruloplasmin gene from channel catfish, determine its genomic organization, profile its patterns of tissue expression, and establish its potential for physiological antioxidant responses in catfish after bacterial infection with E. ictaluri and iron treatment. The genomic organization suggested that the catfish ceruloplasmin gene had 20 exons and 19 introns, encoding 1074 amino acids. Exon sizes of the catfish ceruloplasmin gene were close to or identical with mammalian and zebrafish homologs. Further phylogenetic analyses suggested that the gene was highly conserved through evolution. The catfish ceruloplasmin gene was mapped to both the catfish physical map and linkage map. The catfish ceruloplasmin gene was mainly expressed in liver with limited expression in other tissues, and it was significantly up-regulated in the liver after bacterial infection alone or after co-injection with bacteria and iron-dextran, while expression was not significantly induced with iron-dextran treatment alone.

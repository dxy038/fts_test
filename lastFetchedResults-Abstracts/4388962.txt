In this paper, a real-time optimal appliance usage strategy is proposed based on binary particle swarm algorithm, participated by both energy suppliers and end users. Under the multi end-users and time-of-use electricity prices circumstances, the total electricity bills can be generated with different appliance usage pattern: random, single optimal objective and double optimal objectives, resulting in different load curves. Considering the characteristics of the appliances and living habits, the appliances are classified into three categories. Matlab is used as the simulation tool to perform the experiments to prove that the load shifting, energy saving and energy supply efficiency enhancement can be achieved with multi-objectives with particle swarm optimization.

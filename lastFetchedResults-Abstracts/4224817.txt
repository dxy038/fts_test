This paper further refines the architecture and design, introduced in a previous work on the management and control, of the IEEE 802.16/WiMAX access in a multi-domain chain of IP core networks. The high level objective is to manage end-to-end connectivity services in an integrated way, at overlay level, assuring guaranteed QoS for multimedia delivery over networks with heterogeneous access. Flexible solutions are proposed for integration of the WiMAX service flows management and control within an integrated management system (EIMS) developed in the ENTHRONE FP6 project.

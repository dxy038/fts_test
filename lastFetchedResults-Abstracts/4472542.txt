Improving avionics hardware reliability through the use of durability analysis is a primary objective of the U.S. Air Force Aeronautical Systems Division´s Avionics Integrity Program (AVIP). Embedding this process into an integrated product development (IPD) approach provides a design solution tailored to the equipment´s operational environment. This enables improved hardware reliability and availability at reduced life cycle cost due to the reduction or elimination of unscheduled maintenance events. Identifying and correcting potential deficiencies and optimizing the equipment design to the usage environment and defining manufacturing processes in the development phase of the program are the ultimate objectives of IPD and AVIP

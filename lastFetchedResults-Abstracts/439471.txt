Background. The objective of this study was to determine whether serum lactate levels predict mortality in children less than 1 year of age who have undergone cardiopulmonary bypass and operations for complex congenital heart disease.

Methods. The initial lactate, maximum lactate, and lactate levels at 4 to 6 hours after operation were analyzed for each of 48 children less than 12 months of age who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass.

Results. Data were analyzed for the 6 patients who died and the 42 patients who survived. For the patients who died, the initial postoperative serum lactate, maximum lactate, and 4- to 6-hour lactate levels were significantly higher than those in the patients who survived. All patients with an initial lactate less than 7 mmol/L, a maximum lactate less than 9 mmol/L, or a 4- to 6-hour lactate level less than 4 mmol/L survived to hospital discharge.

Conclusions. Serum lactate levels may be a useful predictor of mortality in children less than 1 year of age who have undergone cardiopulmonary bypass. An elevation in serum lactate level after a complex operation for congenital heart disease should be taken as a serious indicator of potential mortality.

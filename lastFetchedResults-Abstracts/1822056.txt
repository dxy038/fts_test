Objective
m of this study was to evaluate whether fluconazole (FLZ) could affect the bioactivity and cellular structure of Candida albicans or Candida glabrata biofilms grown in the presence of FLZ.
als and methods
 were fabricated using poly(methylmethacrylate) resin (PMMA) in a hot water bath. Salivary pellicles were formed on the PMMA surface, and biofilms of a reference strain and two clinical isolates of C. albicans (ATCC 90028, P01 and P34) and C. glabrata (ATCC 2001, P11 and P31) were developed for a period of 48 h. Control and experimental groups were formed. FLZ at the bioavailable concentration in saliva (2.56 Î¼g/mL) was added to the medium of the experimental group. The culture mediums of the control and experimental groups were changed after 24 h. The bioactivities of the biofilms were evaluated using an XTT reduction colorimetric assay. The cellular structure was analysed by confocal scanning laser microscopy and by transmission electron microscopy. The data were analysed by the independent sample Student's t-test, with the significance level set at 5%.
s
esence of FLZ decreased the bioactivity of all C. albicans biofilms (p &lt; 0.001), however, it did not change the cellular structure of C. albicans P34. Regarding the C. glabrata biofilm bioactivity and structure, no statistically significant differences were found between the control and experimental groups.
sion
t the bioavailable concentration present in saliva, interferes with the development of C. albicans biofilms, but does not interfere with the development of C. glabrata biofilms.

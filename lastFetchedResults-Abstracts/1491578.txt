This paper presents a finite element formulation of Koiter's initial post-buckling theory using a multi-mode approach. Initial post-buckling theory provides direct information about the imperfection sensitivity of a structure under compressive loading, and is also the basis of a nonlinear reduced order model. The objective of the present work is to illustrate the capability of the implementation for buckling analysis of shell structures including modal interaction. A coupled mode initial post-buckling analysis for a composite cylindrical shell under axial compression, including the effect of a nonlinear pre-buckling state, has been carried out using a small number of representative modes. For small imperfection amplitudes the limit-point buckling loads obtained with the reduced order model compare reasonably well with full model nonlinear analysis, illustrating that a fast prediction of the coupled mode response of imperfect shells is possible using the approach proposed.

Background & Objective: During pregnancy, Hb and Hct are reduced, because of increase in maternal plasma volume. Pregnant women need more iron, because of the increase in blood volume, blood cells, the growth of fetus and placenta, iron supplementation is performed. This study, measured blood index after different doses of iron supplement prescribed in healthy pregnant women in order to prevent excessive iron intake.
Methods: In this cross-sectional analytical study, 150 healthy pregnant women were selected who were divided in to two groups. One group took daily (as control) and the other intermittent (as case=3 times in week) iron supplement from the second trimester. Blood samples of all cases in the first second an third trimester were analysed for complete blood counts (CBC). The Data were analysed by SPSS.
Results: The reduction of Hb, HcT and RBC at second trimester was significant compared to the first (p<0.05). This difference was not significant among two groups concerning the blood index.
Conclusion: Since there was no significant difference in blood index among the case and control groups, so, to prevent the side effects of iron over load, it's recommended, to use intermittent iron supplement in healthy pregnant women

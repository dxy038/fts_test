Standard H<sub>&#8734;</sub> optimization cannot handle specifications or constraints on the time response of a closed-loop system exactly. In this paper, the problem of H<sub>&#8734;</sub> optimization subject to time-domain constraints over a finite horizon is considered. More specifically, given a set of fixed inputs w<sup>i</sup>, it is required to find a controller such that a closed-loop transfer matrix has an H<sub>&#8734;</sub>-norm less than one, and the time responses y<sup>i</sup> to the signals w<sup>i</sup> belong to some prespecified sets &#937;<sup>i</sup>. First, the one-block constrained H<sub>&#8734;</sub> optimal control problem is reduced to a finite dimensional, convex minimization problem and a standard H<sub>&#8734;</sub> optimization problem. Then, the general four-block H<sub>&#8734;</sub> optimal control problem is solved by reduction to the one-block case. The objective function is constructed via state-space methods, and some properties of H<sub>&#8734;</sub> optimal constrained controllers are given. It is shown how satisfaction of the constraints over a finite horizon can imply good behavior overall. An efficient computational procedure based on the ellipsoid algorithm is also discussed

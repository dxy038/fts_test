Abstract
Introduction: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the second most common cause of infection in human. Meanwhile, E.coli is the most common cause of UTI. Increasing antibiotic resistance E.coli leads to treatment failure. Given the difference in antibiotic resistance patterns of isolated Escherichia coli, investigation into antibiotic resistance of this bacterium in each region is necessary.
Objective: The present study was designed to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of E.coli isolated from urine culture of patients admitted to several hospitals in Rasht.
Materials and Method: In a descriptive study in 2014 in Rasht, 980 urine samples were analyzed. E.coli was isolated from the samples of hospitalized patients with UTI who had not received antibiotics and then, antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed. Combined disk method was used to detect ESBLs producing E.coli. All data were analyzed using SPSS version 19.
Results: From 195 isolated E.coli, 76.93% and 23.07% of strains were from women and men, respectively. In this study, the most effective antibiotic was Imipenem. The most antibiotic resistance rates among Penicillins belonged to Oxacillin and Ampicillin and in Cephalosporins belonged to Cephalotin. Also, Cefoxitin had the least resistance rate. Among quinolones, the highest resistance rate belonged to Nalidixic acid. Furthermore, resistance to Gentamycin, Nitrofurantoin and Tetracycline was 8.2%, 8.71% and 11.79%, respectively. Among 195 strains of E.coli, 36.92% were ESBL producers.
Conclusion: According to the results, antibiogram test using proper antibiotic disks, rational prescription and no indiscriminate use of antibiotics and no use of unprescribed antibiotics seem necessary.

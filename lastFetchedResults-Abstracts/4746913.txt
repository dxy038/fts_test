The work presents application of genetic algorithm to solving optimization problem of material consumption and the cost of the energy loss in construction of rectangular three-phase power busways with permanent insulation. The relationships describing the basic electrodynamic phenomena are provided. The calculation was carried out with the use of integral equations method. Objective function was formulated and converted into an adaptation function, according to genetic algorithm purposes. Some modifications of the basic genetic algorithm are proposed.

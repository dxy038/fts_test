A comprehensive market survey and laboratory evaluation was conducted for the Ohio Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration to identify the most promising sensors and data-acquisition systems for infrastructure application. A pilot system for highway bridge monitoring was implemented on a typical steel-stringer bridge in Cincinnati for high-speed traffic and long-term environmental monitoring. Static tests were performed with known truck loads to confirm monitoring results and to calibrate finite-element and section analysis models of the bridge. A complete and accurate characterization of the as-is structural condition has been related to the structural capacities and reliability. This multi-disciplinary research improves understanding of the actual loading environment and the corresponding bridge responses. Instrumented monitoring is expected to complement inspection methods, provide an objective measure of the state-of-health, and alert officials to bridge deterioration or failure

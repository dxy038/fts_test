The objective of the project is to develop a highly manoeuvrable mobile base suitable for operation in a hazardous environment. The base utilizes Omni wheels whose unique motion properties allow for three complete degrees of freedom: two translation degrees and one rotational. Phase I of the project, construction of the Omnibot mobile base is already complete. The mobile base provided the testbed for going into phase II of the project. The main emphasis is to incorporate a vision system, and hazardous gas detectors to the mobile base. The Omnibot mobile system consists of two main components: the mobile base and the command base. Issues concerning the mobile base and the command base design and implementation for phase II are detailed.

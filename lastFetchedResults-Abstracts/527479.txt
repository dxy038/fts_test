On one hand the prevalence of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) ranges from 4 to 12 percent in the community; on the other hand, Celiac disease is prevalent in 4% of the IBS patients. Regarding the fact that cereals containing gluten are routinely used in Iran, diagnosing celiac disease in IBS patients is important for conducting the treatments. The objective of this study was to assess the frequency of Celiac in IBS patients.This study was designed as a case control prospective study. Eighty six subjects were enrolled in this study according to Rome II Criteria. The control group included healthy subjects that were checked up on a routine base. The evaluation of Celiac was done through serology exams such as Anti Gliadin and Anti Transglutaminase (IgG and IgA).Thirty eight male and 48 female patients suffering from IBS with a mean age of 34Â±11.7 years were enrolled in this study. The case and control groups were not significantly different in terms of sex and age. Flatulence, excessive gas passing and mucus passage were the most frequent symptoms in IBS patients. Night symptoms and weight loss (alarm signs) were observed in 37% and 32%, respectively. Elevated Antigliadin Titer was evident in 22 subjects (25%) which suggests a significantly higher rate for the case group as compared to the control group (t=4.67,P=0.0001). Elevated IgG Anti Transglutaminase Titer was observed in 2 cases (2.3%) while IgA Anti Transglutaminase was not elevated in any of the IBS subjects, neither in the control group nor in the case group.

Background and Objective: Immobility has unfavorable effects on our body physiology, including the respiratory system. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of physical training course on pulmonary function during the course of one semester, using respiratory function indices by the spirometric test in female students at Zanjan University of Medical Sciences (ZUMS). 
Materials and Methods: This study was conducted on 141 ZUMS female students who had entered the university and took the first physical training course in September 2009.  All participants underwent a systematic exercise training program during the full course of the semester.  In the last session of the physical training course and prior to any physical activity, the spirometric test based on FEF25-75%, FEV1/FVC, FVC, PEFR, and FEV1 indices was carried out three times per capita in the same manner as it was done at beginning of the semester.  Finally, the spirometric test results of the beginning and end periods were compared by paired t-test.
Results: Passing a course of physical training led to a significant increase in all of the pulmonary function indices (P < 0.0001).  The maximum and minimum mean differences among indices were attributed to PEF/PPEF and FEV1/FCV, respectively. 
Conclusion: Considering the prolonged periods of immobility due to intensive study for the university entrance exam, a course of physical training had a remarkably positive impact on the outcome of pulmonary function in female students of ZUMS.

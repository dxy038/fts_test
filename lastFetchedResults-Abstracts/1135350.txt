This paper deals with the prediction of fatigue crack growth at high temperatures in the N18 nickel base superalloy, which is employed by Snecma for turbine disc applications. This material and other nickel base superalloys were widely studied in the past under isothermal conditions and constant amplitude fatigue. Dwell time effects are observed which are attributed, in this material, to grain boundary oxidation. The main objective of this research is to use this knowledge to model the fatigue crack growth rate in the N18 nickel base superalloy when complex “missions” are encountered. This implies variable amplitude and non-isothermal loading conditions (450–650 °C). For this purpose, an incremental fatigue crack growth model which was originally developed for isothermal variable amplitude loading conditions was extended so as to be applicable to non-isothermal loading conditions. In addition, the incremental form of the fatigue crack growth law in this model is very useful to account for the coupling effect between fatigue and time-dependent phenomena such as creep or oxidation. In the present case, the effect of the environment was modelled as a competition between two phenomena: a detrimental effect of grain boundary oxidation ahead of the crack tip and a beneficial effect of the growth of a passivation layer of oxides on the freshly created crack surfaces. The model was used to simulate fatigue crack growth under complex cycles at high temperature and the comparisons with experimental results are satisfactory.

The well-known and ever-present time-varying and non-stationary nature of waveforms in power systems requires a comprehensive and precise analytical basis that needs to be incorporated in the system studies and analyses. This time-varying behavior is due to continuous changes in system configurations, linear load levels and operating modes of nonlinear load / equipment and thus present conceptual and practical challenges. The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive bibliographical survey of the proposed techniques to deal with time-varying and non-stationary waveforms in power systems.

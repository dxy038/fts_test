Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of magnetic resonance imaging and gestational age in the setting of fetuses with suspected abnormalities of the central nervous system that were detected by ultrasound scanning. Study design: Multiplanar magnetic resonance studies were performed in fetuses with suspected central nervous system abnormalities on ultrasound scanning. Magnetic resonance imaging was evaluated for its ability to provide additional information, change the diagnosis, or impact obstetric treatment. Patients were grouped by gestational age at the time of magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Magnetic resonance imaging provided additional information in 46 of 72 pregnancies (64%), changed the diagnosis in 20 of 72 pregnancies (28%), and potentially altered the timing or mode of delivery in 8 of 72 pregnancies (11%). Additional information increased with increasing gestational age groups (P = .03). Conclusion: Magnetic resonance imaging provided additional information in two thirds of the fetuses with central nervous system abnormalities, which was significantly increased with increasing gestation. Antenatal treatment was influenced by magnetic resonance imaging in 11% of the cases. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:492-6.)

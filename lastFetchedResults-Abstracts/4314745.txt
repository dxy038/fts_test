This paper presents a new intelligent control scheme which utilizes genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for off-line tuning of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for the twin rotor multi-input multi-output system (TRMS). The control objective is to make the beam of the TRMS move quickly and accurately to the desired attitudes. The TRMS exhibits MIMO characteristics, high order non-linearity, significant cross coupling and inaccessibility of some of its states and outputs for measurements. PSO Algorithm is successfully implemented to this problem. Experimental and simulated results of the developed PID controller for a twin rotor system are given to demonstrate its effectiveness. Satisfactory results are anticipated in the experimental as well as in the simulation results. In an attempt to evaluate the performance of the developed controller an experimental and simulated comparative assessments with the conventionally PID tuned method (Ziegler-Nichols method) has been conducted. The results of the PID controller based PSO reveals better performances indices than GA method and the ZN method.

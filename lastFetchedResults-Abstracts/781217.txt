The objective of the study was to determine the effect of flunixin meglumine (FM; a non-steroid antiflammatory drug) on the
length of the estrous cycle and luteal phase, with the aim of increasing lambing rate and prolificacy in Pelibuey ewes. Two groups
of females under a natural mating system were allotted to two groups: a FM-2 group, with ewes (n = 46) treated with 2.2 mg/kg
of FM twice a day (06:00 and 18:00 h); a control group, with ewes (n = 50) given a placebo once a day (06:00 h). Both groups
were treated for 8 days, starting at day 11 following mating. Blood samples from 10 ewes per group were collected every 3rd
day, and from day 15 (mating = day 0) blood samples were taken daily, until ewes showed estrus or until day 21, whichever was
first. The lambing rate was 58.0% and 56.5% for the control and FM-2 group respectively, while the length of the estrous cycle
(19.4±0.8 days) and luteal phase (15.3±0.4 days) was longer (P < 0.05) in the FM-2 group, compared to the control group
(17.6±0.7 and 12.2±0.3 days, respectively). The treatment with FM lengthened the luteal phase and estrous cycle in the ewes,
however, it had no effect on lambing rate and prolificacy.

In present times software reengineering has become an important domain of research to increase the shelf life of legacy system. The major objective for reengineering revolves around reducing the cost of investment in Information Technology (IT) infrastructure by reducing the maintenance cost and capitalizing on the current existing IT infrastructure. This can be achieved by making it more adaptable to the changing requirements. The decision for reengineering system is quite challenging as one has to select from the available option of investing in new system or legacy system. Further cost of reengineering is not a true decisive parameter for taking up reengineering. A better approach is finding out return on investment (ROI). ROI of reengineering a system is difficult to calculate as one has to assume the cost of project and the project also depends on the requirement of reengineering. This paper gives a generalized approach towards decision making for reengineering the legacy system. This paper presents a requirement specific approach of cost estimation and proposes ROI computation for the assessment of reengineering.

The objective of this study was to investigate the immunity against rubella in the obstetric population in Kuwait by testing 600 pregnant women at a prenatal clinic, using the haemagglutination inhibition technique. In addition, a comparison was made between this study and one done in 1978 at the same clinic; its relation to the vaccination programme is also discussed. 7.7% of the population under study were non-immune. Statistically significant effect was demonstrated for maternal age but not for parity and nationality. Though it has been almost 20 years since an intense rubella vaccination programme was implemented, the percentage of non-immune pregnant women has not decreased. In Kuwait, termination of pregnancy for congenital rubella syndrome is prohibited. As a result, it is recommended that women be screened and vaccinated at the time of marriage.

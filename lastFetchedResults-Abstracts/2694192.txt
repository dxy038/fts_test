The depth-image-based-rendering is a key technique to realize free viewpoint television. However, one critical problem in these systems is filling the disocclusion due to the 3-D warping process. This paper exploits the temporal correlation of texture and depth information to generate a background reference image. This is then used to fill the holes associated with the dynamic parts of the scene, whereas for static parts the traditional inpainting method is used. To generate the background reference image, the Gaussian mixture model is employed on the texture information, whereas, depth maps information are used to detect moving objects so as to enhance the background reference image. The proposed holes filling approach is particularly useful for the single-view-plus-depth format, where, contrary to the multi-view-plus-depth format, only information of one view could be used for this task. The experimental results show that objective and subjective gains can be achieved, and the gain ranges from 1 to 3 dB over the inpainting method.

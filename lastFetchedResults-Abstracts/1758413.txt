Objective
Out and Read (ROR) is a primary careâ€“based intervention supported by considerable evidence regarding its efficacy. Implementation of ROR, however, varies across participating sites. The objective of this study was to identify practice attributes associated with variability in ROR implementation.
s
 primary care providers and 70 support staff from 7 clinics in Baltimore, Maryland, participated in semistructured interviews. Sites were purposefully selected on the basis of the perceived success of their ROR program implementation. All interviews were transcribed and inductively analyzed to identify themes. Themes were compared to predictors postulated by a conceptual model for team effectiveness across a variety of workplace settings.
s
ne theme (integration of ROR procedures) addressed the design of ROR implementation within clinics. Nearly all other themes identified group processes and group psychosocial traits broadly reflective of clinic culture. At struggling sites, staff found their jobs burdensome and communication lacking. They demonstrated disrespect for patients and families. In this context, they experienced difficulty integrating ROR into their daily routines. Staff at successful sites worked as a team and expressed strong commitments to their communities. Integration of ROR at these sites tended to occur smoothly. Providers from all sites reported strong pressures to increase productivity, and thought that these pressures impaired their ability to deliver high-quality primary care.
sions
 culture influences the implementation of an efficacious primary care intervention. Characteristics of clinic culture therefore need to be identified and taken into account in future efforts to improve its implementation.

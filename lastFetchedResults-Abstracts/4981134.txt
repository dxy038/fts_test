The objective of this project was to develop an identification system for moving vehicles using radio frequency, with the aim of recording the times in which buses belonging to the urban transport system of passengers make their pass by a set of checkpoints located over their routes. The identification system was designed and implemented using XBee &#174; modules, which allows assigning a unique number for each car to identify it wirelessly to 30 m away. The information collected by the system, like the time of detection of vehicles is transmitted to a database located on a remote server, in order to obtain statistics and reports of the frequency of transport routes at any instant of time. The transmission of information is performed by an embedded Linux system using an Internet connection, which also uses one of its USARTs to manage the communication with RF modules. This project achieved an application to monitor the path and performance of urban transport routes ensuring the reliability and integrity of the data collected.

With the increase of digital technology in video production, several types of complex video special effects editing have begun to appear in video clips. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed for fade-in, fade-out, dissolve and wipe video editing operations in MPEG-2 compressed domain without full frame decompression and motion reestimation. The results show that both the objective and subjective quality of the edited video in the compressed domain closely follows the quality of the edited video in uncompressed video at the same bit rate.

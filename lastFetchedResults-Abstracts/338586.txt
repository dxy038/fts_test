Objective
We previously demonstrated that a combination of mild total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) with selective depletion of the host's donor-reactive cells allows for stable and graft-vs-host disease (GVHD)-free engraftment of allogeneic bone marrow (BM). In this study, we investigated the efficacy of this nonmyeloablative strategy for BM transplantation (BMT) as immunotherapy for minimal residual disease.
Materials and methods
BALB/c mice inoculated with leukemia (BCL1) or breast carcinoma (4T1) cells were conditioned for BMT with TLI (200 cGy) followed by priming with donor (C57BL/6) BM cells on day 1, and by injection with 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide on day 2. After conditioning (day 3), recipients were transplanted with BM cells from the same donor. Treated animals were monitored for 230 days for survival, development of leukemia/solid tumor, and GVHD.
Results
BMT converted the mice to complete chimeras and prevented development of leukemia in 90% of recipients and locally growing breast carcinoma in 40% of the mice. Immunization of donors of the second BM with 4T1 cells prevented development of breast carcinoma in 80% of 4T1 inoculated mice. Fewer animals treated for malignancy by nonmyeloablative BMT died of GVHD than those treated by myeloablative BMT. However, late GVHD-related mortality in mice treated for leukemia was higher than after nonmyeloablative BMT to naive recipients (p < 0.00001). Infusion of host-type anti-donor immune lymphocytes 8 days after BMT improved the survival of recipients treated for leukemia without affecting engraftment and the graft-vs-leukemia potential of donor BM.
Conclusions
Effective eradication of malignant cells can be achieved following allogeneic BMT after nonmyeloablative conditioning.

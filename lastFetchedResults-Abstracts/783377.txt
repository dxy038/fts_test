Objective Despite research in Western
countries finding high levels of psychological morbidity
in medical students and doctors, little is
known about difficulties faced by medical staff in
the Middle East. The aim of the present study was
to assess emotional disturbance and interpersonal
attitudes in a representative sample of Iranian
medical students and practitioners. Method A total
of 82 medical students, 92 interns and 89 general
practitioners (GPs) participated in the study. Participants
rated the 28-item version of the General
Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) and a measure of
interpersonal attitudes. Results A total of 44% of
participants scored above the threshold of the GHQ-
28, indicating probable psychiatric disorder. The
GHQ-28 scores were higher in students than interns
or GPs and in women compared with men. Medical
students and doctors had high levels of indifference
and cynicism. Conclusions This study suggests that
psychological morbidity was common in Iranian
medical students and practitioners, particularly
women. Women were at particular risk. A high
prevalence of emotional disturbance among health
care practitioners is likely to compound existing
problems of health care provision

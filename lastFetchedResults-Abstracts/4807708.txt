This paper presents partial solution for measuring voice quality objectively. Currently signal strength, bit error rate, signal to noise ratio, mean square error, and interchannel interference are used to characterize the quality of cellular telephone communications and test equipment is available to cell site operators to make such measurements in the field. However, the goal is to measure the voice quality which is now measured subjectively. Thus to make this measurement, engineering parameters are useful in correlation with voice quality. Using a cellular mobile test equipment set designed by ZK-Celltest, we have identified objective parameters that correlate with voice quality. By this approach, we are able to give more meaningful data to cell site operators. Our results shows that we can use voice quality related parameters such as signal to noise ratio for the control of cell operations and characterizing the communication system

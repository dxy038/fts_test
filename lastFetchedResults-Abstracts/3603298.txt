Tree networks of communicating processors are examined with the objective of solving a computational problem in a minimal amount of time. The processors in the networks may be equipped either with or without front-end processors for communicating of loading. The determination of the optimal division of processing load is discussed for the network with and the network without front-end processors. The inclusion of solution time, the time taken for sensors to report the solution back to originator, is discussed

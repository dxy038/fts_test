Scientific knowledge of carbon and nitrogen dynamics incorporated into soil organic matter (SOM) dynamic simulation models can be tested using experimental data from decomposition experiments. This possibility is particularly interesting for liquid animal manures, which are very heterogeneous materials. CN-SIM is a SOM model that was successfully applied for the short- and long-term simulation of C and N dynamics in the soil. The objective of this research was to test this model using results of a 180-d laboratory incubation of five liquid dairy manures in three soils. Initial sensitivity analysis indicated that model parameters that mostly impact net CO2 and soil mineral nitrogen concentration (SMN) are those that allocate manure C and N to model pools, their decomposition constants and soil parameters that describe microbial biomass and its residues. Automatic parameter optimisation was carried out with the downhill simplex method separately for 15 manure by soil combinations. After optimisation, CO2 respiration was well simulated for the entire period, while SMN was overestimated after day 40. Simulations overestimated the remineralisation of immobilised N in the first weeks. Simulated initial microbial immobilisation was the only possibility for the model to match the experimental decrease of SMN, while simulated N remineralisation after day 40 was necessary to enable a good simulation of respired CO2. Further work is needed to test whether these simulations can be improved by adding SMN sinks (such as denitrified N and clay-fixed ammonium).

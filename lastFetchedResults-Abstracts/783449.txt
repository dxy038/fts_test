Objective To determine the point prevalence,
incidence, and remission over a 2-year period
of psychosis in adults with intellectual disabilities,
and to investigate demographic and clinical factors
hypothesised to be associated with psychosis. Method
A population-based cohort of adults with intellectual
disabilities (n = 1,023) was longitudinally
studied. Comprehensive face-to-face mental health
assessments to detect psychosis, plus review of family
physician, psychiatric, and psychology case notes
were undertaken at two time points, 2 years apart.
Results Point prevalence is 2.6% (95% CI = 1.8–
3.8%) to 4.4% (95% CI = 3.2–5.8%), dependant upon
the diagnostic criteria employed. Two-year incidence
is 1.4% (95% CI = 0.6–2.6), and for first episode is
0.5% (95% CI = 0.1–1.3). Compared with the general
population, the standardised incidence ratio for first
episode psychosis is 10.0 (95% CI = 2.1–29.3). Full
remission after 2 years is 14.3%. Visual impairment,
previous long-stay hospital residence, smoking, and
not having epilepsy were independently associated
with psychosis, whereas other factors relevant to the
general population were not. Conclusions The study
of psychosis in persons with intellectual disabilities
benefits the population with intellectual disabilities,
and advances the understanding of psychosis for the
general population. Mental health professionals need
adequate knowledge in order to address the high rates
of psychosis in this population

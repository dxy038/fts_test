The main objective of this study is to determine the optimum tuning of temperature process control for overdamped process response. The Ziegler Nichols tuning was used to determine the optimum setting of temperature process control in 30degC - 50degC by varying the PB and I term. The performance of the response is evaluated based on integral absolute error (IAE), settling time (Ts), and rise time (Tr), first overshoot and undershoot.

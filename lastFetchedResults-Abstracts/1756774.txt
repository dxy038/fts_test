Objective
ive models have identified a number of factors that maintain sleep disturbance. It is unknown whether similar factors lead to initial onset. This study tested whether three cognitive-behavioural factors: ruminative style, somatic sensitivity, and behavioural avoidance predicted sleep disturbance onset at four-year follow-up.
s
ipants (n = 4,042) were assessed using a) a composite measure of Somatic Sensitivity, b) the Ruminative Style Scale, c) the Behavioural Inhibition Scale of the BISBAS and d) sleep-related items from the Goldberg Depression and Anxiety Scale.
s
disturbance at 4 years was significantly predicted by all three cognitive-behavioural factors – somatic sensitivity, ruminative style and behavioural avoidance – and, in the final analysis, was independently predicted by somatic sensitivity (OR = 1.427, p &lt; 0.001) and ruminative style (OR = 1.035, p = 0.002).
sion
tudy tested whether three cognitive-behavioural factors: ruminative style, somatic sensitivity, and behavioural avoidance were predictive of the onset of sleep disturbance after 4 years. Although all three factors were significantly associated with the onset of sleep disturbance, only ruminative style and somatic sensitivity were found to independently predict sleep disturbance, supporting these constructs as predisposing cognitive-behavioural risk factors.

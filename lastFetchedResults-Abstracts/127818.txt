Objective: A vast number of people in Iran suffer from hepatitis and 3% of the population are carriers. The aim of this study is to assess of HBsAg seropositivity among pregnant women whose husbands had military and a history of battlefield injury and blood transfusion.
Materials and Methods: We studied HBs Ag level-using Elisa is all pregnant women who came to clinic. Mean age, number of pregnancy, number of children, history of abortion, icterus, history of vaccination, husband job (military or non military), history of battlefield injury and history of blood transfussion was recorded.
The results were analyzed using t-Test and Chi-Square.
Results: In this study 1198 cases were studied. Twenty-two mothers (1.8%) were HBsAg positive. Mean age, number of pregnancies, and number of children in two groups (HBsAg .positive and HBs Ag negative) were significantly different.
(PV= 0.006, PV= 0.014, PV= 0.005). Their husbands job (military or non military) had a significant effect on HBsAg positivity (2.3% vs 0.8% respectively) (P=0.07). History of battlefield injury also made a difference (5.7% vs 1.8% respectively) (P=0.026). Also, history of blood transfusion because of battlefield injuries had significant effect (7.8% vs 1.4%) respectively (PV=0.002).
Conclusion: HBs Ag is more probable in armed forces, therefore, special training is essential.

Automated distribution systems offer new opportunities for improved control of voltage and reactive power at the distribution substation and feeder level. Digital processor algorithms which can have the objective functions of controlling voltage and reactive power and minimizing feeder losses in an integrated fashion according to specified priorities are described. Simulation results using a representative simplified distribution feeder configuration are presented based on the algorithms developed in connection with the PROBE [1] substation and feeder automation research project. This work is being advanced as a part of the development of the Integrated Distribution Control and Protection System engineering prototype for EPRI in Project RP 1472-1.

This paper introduces a multi-objective optimization based Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy for damping inter-area oscillations in power systems. The previous MPC control strategies presented in the power system literature have been based on single-objective optimization, but this paper extends the approach to multi-objective optimization. The controller is designed using a linear discrete time state space model and calculates control signals in centralized fashion for local control devices. The optimal control sequence is calculated as a solution to a multi-objective optimization problem with two objective functions. The controller is combined with a Kalman filter state estimator using voltage angle measurements. The performance of the proposed multi-objective optimization based MPC controller is compared against a single-objective optimization based MPC controller using New England New York test system model.

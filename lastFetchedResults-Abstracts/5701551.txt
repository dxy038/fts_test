To evaluate visually-induced motion sickness, we integrated subjective and objective responses in terms of autonomic nervous regulation. Twenty-seven subjects viewed a 2-min-long first-person-view video section five times (total 10 min) continuously. Measured biosignals, the RR interval, respiration, and blood pressure, were used to estimate the indices related to autonomic nervous activity (ANA). Then we determined the trigger points and some sensation sections based on the time-varying behavior of ANA-related indices. We found that there was a suitable combination of biosignals to present the symptoms of visually-induced motion sickness. Based on the suitable combination, integrating trigger points and subjective scores allowed us to represent the time-distribution of subjective responses during visual exposure, and helps us to understand what types of camera motions will cause visually-induced motion sickness.

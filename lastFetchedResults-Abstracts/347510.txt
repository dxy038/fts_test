Objective: The aim of this study is to confirm the effectiveness of auditory brain-stem responses (ABRs) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in the diagnosis of brain death (BD).
Methods: ABRs and SEPs were recorded at the same session in 130 BD patients (age range 8–77 years, 81 male and 49 female). Twenty-four cases were submitted to serial recordings from preterminal conditions through BD.
Results: ABRs were absent in 92 cases (70.8%), only waves I or I–II were present in 32 cases (24.6%), while in the remaining 6 patients (4.6%) waves V and/or III were still present, excluding the death of the brain-stem. In 4 cases (3.1%) SEPs showed the absence of all components following the cervical N9, preventing the diagnosis of BD. Among 126 cases (96.9%) with preserved cervical N9–N13 SEPs confirmed the absence of brain-stem activity in 122 cases (93.7%), in whom no waves following P11 or P13 were recordable. SEPs excluded the diagnosis of BD in the remaining 4 cases (3.2%) showing preserved P14 and/or N18. In all pre terminal patients the far-field P14–N18 were present, and their disappearance was closely related to the onset of BD.
Conclusions: The combined us of ABRs and SEPs was able to confirm BD in almost all patients, providing an objective confirmation of the diagnosis, and to exclude it in 7 cases, thus improving the reliability of diagnosis

Aiming at the problem that the steering tires were seriously wore on a 8&#215;8 in-wheel motor driven vehicle, a model of McPherson suspension and double-front axle steering system was established by ADAMS. Considering the influences on steering errors caused by wheel jump and using parametric analysis method, the error accumulation between theoretical value and actual value of steering angle, and the sum of variation of toe-in angle were added up for forming the objective optimization function. The simulation and optimization results indicate that this design improves the steering performance and reduces the motion interference between the suspension and steering linkage.

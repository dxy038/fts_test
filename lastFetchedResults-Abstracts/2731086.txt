This paper devises an augmented active surface model for the recovery of small structures in a low resolution and high noise setting, where the role of regularization is especially important. The emphasis here is on evaluating performance using real clinical computed tomography (CT) data with comparisons made to an objective ground truth acquired using micro-CT. In this paper, we show that the application of conventional active contour methods to small objects leads to non-optimal results because of the inherent properties of the energy terms and their interactions with one another. We show that the blind use of a gradient magnitude based energy performs poorly at these object scales and that the point spread function (PSF) is a critical factor that needs to be accounted for. We propose a new model that augments the external energy with prior knowledge by incorporating the PSF and the assumption of reasonably constant underlying CT numbers.

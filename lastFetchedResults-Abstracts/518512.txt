Introduction: According to World Health Organization reports, the esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) is most frequent in north-east of Iran. Infiltration of inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils, may play an important role in biologic behaviors of tumors.

Objective: Survey the association between tissue eosinophil counts and prognosti c factors of esophageal SCC.

Materials and Methods: This analytical cross-sectional study was conducted applying a convenience sampling. The archive of pathology department of Imam-Reza Hospital, Mashhad. between 2005-2007 was used. Number of eosinophils, and also mastocytes, surrounding the tumoral cells was estimated using the standard method of Tumor-Associated Tissue Eosinophilia. Mean numbers of eosinophils and mastocytes between different groups of prevascular or preneural invasion, lymph node metastases, tissue differentiation status and depth of invasion were tested statistically.

Results: Twenty-five (61.0%) men and 16 (39.0%) women with a mean (Standard Deviation, SD) age of 53.6 (±14.78) were studied. Mean (SD) number of eosinophils and mastocytes were 115.4 (±88.16) and 30.7 (±26.03) respectively. Mean number of eosinophils was higher in patients with prevascular invasion (183.2 vs. 86.9)(p =0.002). No other statistically significant association was found.

Conclusion: Excess number of tissue eosinophils indicates the tendency towards more prevascular invasion. It is recommended to follow these patients intensively.

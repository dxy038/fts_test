In this paper is presented a controller design methodology for a PFC regulator. Traditionally, the controller design on switching converters is based on linear theory; here the dynamic equations are linearized, then linear techniques are applied to determine the controller parameters. This approach restricts the capabilities of the switching converters. The main contribution of this work is to study further properties of linear control and to derive a systematic tuning procedure from the analysis of the nonlinear closed-loop system equations. The multiloop control design under the proposed methodology is applied on PFC regulator, where the objective is to achieve a high power factor. It is important to point out that PFC regulator presents a reduced redundant power processing as result of the interconnection of two basic converters on noncascading structure, which improve the efficiency.

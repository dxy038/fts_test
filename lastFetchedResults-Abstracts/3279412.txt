Vector circular array (VCA) is a relatively new array configuration for signal direction and polarization estimations. The objective of this study is to find a more accurate and robust DOA and polarization estimation approach for VCA. Fourth-order cumulants based MUSIC (FOC-MUSIC) method is attractive for possible high resolution in both white and colored Gaussian noise. This paper presents a study by comparing the FOC-MUSIC with conventional MUSIC for both white and colored Gaussian noise. Through stochastic simulation and error analysis, it is found that the adopted FOC-MUSIC can achieve more accurate estimations of direction and polarization in both white and colored Gaussian noise, especially for low SNR scenarios.

The capacity of optical network increases sharply as the development of WDM technology, and reliability turns into a important issue; How to provide differentiated service to meet different requirements of customers is the development objective of optical network which data service is being the mainstream today. This paper addresses shared-path protection design problem with differentiated reliability. Based on FIR, make it possess the characteristic of load balance through weighting design, and bring in the concept of differentiated reliability (DiR) to have it provide different reliability level services to different customers. Simulation result shows this algorithm not only efficiently satisfies the user-specific requirement, but also effectively decreases the network-blocking ratio.

In Thailand, fossil and coal fuel energies are normally used for electrical generation and the tendency of used fossil and coal fuel energy is continuously increasing. There are about 1300-1500 mm rainfall and 1467 reservoirs in Mun river basin, which covers 71,071 square kilometers in lower northeastern of Thailand. Then, micro-hydropower is of interest as a renewable energy form of mankind for providing electricity for rural community. The purpose of this paper is to assess the potential micro-hydropower sites of more than 50 kW but not over than 10 MW. Reservoir type is considered for potential micro-hydropower assessment. The discharge in reservoir and the head in dam are considered to generate electricity. The main objective of the reservoir is not affected from the electrical production. Also, a large flooding is not occurs from this installation. The result revealed that there are 24 reservoirs in irrigation projects where both discharge and head are suitable for electricity generation. However, stream flow during dry season is very low therefore electricity can be produced in rainy season. The maximum power load is 3.15 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> kW in a year and installed generator is 6000 kW. If the electricity is produced, it will be used by these 24 irrigation projects. Then, stakeholders will able to earn this benefit. The potential micro-hydropower sites from this research should be continuously evaluated for the feasibility study to build and operate the micro-hydropower plant.

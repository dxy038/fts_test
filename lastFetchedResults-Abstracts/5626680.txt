In this paper, the most suitable time to replace to the damaged element in open-loop and closed-loop control for the fault-tolerant induction motor drive system is presented, with a previous stage of fault-diagnostic to detect a short-circuit or open-circuit failure in the power device. The technique is based on the connection of bidirectional switches to isolate electrically the damaged element by mean of fuse blown corresponding, to activate another bidirectional switch to replace only the damaged device by another healthful one. Simulation and experimental results are obtained in order to validate the technique proposed which is based on replacing the damaged element at the most suitable moment in order to decrease the tracking error of the motor current during the fault transient.

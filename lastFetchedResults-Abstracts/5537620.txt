Color variation in medical images degrades the classification performance of computer aided diagnosis systems. Traditionally, color segmentation algorithms mitigate this variability and improve performance. However, consistent and robust segmentation remains an open research problem. In this study, we avoid the tenuous phase of color segmentation by adapting a bag-of-features approach using scale invariant features for classification of renal cell carcinoma subtypes. Previous work shows that features from each subtype match those from expertly chosen template images. In this paper, we show that the performance of this match-based methodology greatly depends on the quality of the template images. To avoid this uncertainty, we propose a bag-of-features approach that does not require expert knowledge and instead learns a &#8220;vocabulary&#8221; of morphological characteristics from training data. We build a support vector machine using feature histograms and evaluate this method using 40 iterations of 3-fold cross validation. We achieve classification accuracy above 90% for a heterogeneous dataset labeled by an expert pathologist, showing its potential for future clinical applications.

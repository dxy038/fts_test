Objective
A potent stretch reflex originates in muscle spindle secondary endings and is mediated by group II muscle afferents. Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve could also induce group II facilitation, as found in single motor unit recordings for various nerve–muscle combinations in man. The aim of the present investigation was to use surface electromyogram (EMG) to record and to quantify heteronymous excitation of semitendinosus (ST) motoneurones by group II afferents of the tibial nerve.
Methods
This study included 20 healthy subjects. The conditioning stimulation of the tibial nerve was delivered at the popliteal fossa at two intensity levels and for two levels of ST contraction. EMG activity was recorded by surface electrodes placed over the ST muscle, and the averaged and rectified ST EMG signal was analyzed.
Results
We observed 4 periods of interest: a first period of prestimulus background EMG activity; a second period of early reinforcement of ST EMG activity starting 30 ms poststimulus and lasting for 35–45 ms; a third period of relative inhibition of ST contraction; a fourth period of late reinforcement of poststimulus ST EMG activity.
Conclusions
We hypothesized that the early period of facilitation was mainly related to heteronymous excitation of ST motoneurones by group II afferents on the basis of the following observations: (i) the amount of facilitation increased for a high stimulus intensity level, which was suitable for group II recruitment; (ii) the onset latency of this facilitation was consistent with the theoretically calculated latency of a group II-mediated reflex.
Significance
Surface EMG recording offers various advantages compared to single motor unit recording to study group II facilitation in the ST muscle. This technique could be applied in the future to confirm that heteronymous reflex excitation by group II afferents is enhanced in spastics and plays an important role in the development of lower limb spasticity.

The ability to establish an objective comparison between high-performance TCP variants under diverse networking conditions and to obtain a quantitative assessment of their impact on the global network traffic is essential to a community-wide understanding of various design approaches. Small-scale experiments are insufficient for a comprehensive study of these TCP variants. We propose a TCP performance evaluation testbed, called SVEET, on which real implementations of the TCP variants can be accurately evaluated under diverse network configurations and workloads in large-scale network settings. This testbed combines real-time immersive simulation, emulation, machine and time virtualization techniques. We validate the testbed via extensive experiments and assess its capabilities through case studies involving real web services.

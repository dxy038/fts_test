This paper presents an efficient optimization strategy which employs adaptive Taylor Kriging and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In this method, the objective function of electromagnetic problem is interpolated by using adaptive Taylor Kriging, in which the covariance parameter is obtained by Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). And then, PSO is used to search for optimal solutions of electromagnetic problem. The proposed algorithm is verified its validity by analytic functions and TEAM (Testing of Electromagnetic Analysis Method) problem 22.

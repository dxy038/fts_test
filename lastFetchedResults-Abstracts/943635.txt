Background and Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of albumin in hematom volume after hemorrhagic stroke.
Subjects and Methods: The study was conducted in a randomized clinical trial; patients with hemorrhagic stroke in 24 hours of onset were included. Patients were divided into two groups, the first group was treated with intravenous albumin (1 g/Kg) and second group treated similarly with normal saline as placebo. Hematom volume was calculated before and at the end of treatment. Analyzes of data was made using Chi square and T-Test. Level of disability at baseline and end of treatment were compared with the NIHSS.
Results: From 61 patients were studied; 31 patients treated with albumin and 30 patients received placebo. Patients were matched for age, sex and risk factors. Mean changes in hematoma volume in the control group was 2.88(SD=1.42)ml and in the placebo group was 1.75(SD=1.27) ml. The differences observed between the two groups was statistically significant (P= 0.002). In the control group the mean change in NIHSS was 2.83(SD=1.26) and the median change was 3 and in the case group the mean change in NIHSS was 1.59(SD=1.21) and the median changes was 1. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P  < 0.001).
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the use of intravenous albumin in patients with hemorrhagic stroke can further reducing the size of the hematoma and the patient's neurological deficits with possible better outcomes.

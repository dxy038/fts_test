Background and Objective: Amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea are the most common disorders in gynecologic diseases at reproductive age. Oral hormonal therapies are often used for treatment that have lots of side effects . Today the world is moving toward integrating Complementary and Alternative medicine (CAM) into mainstream medicine. Traditional Iranian Medicine (TIM) is one of the richest branches of complementary medicine. It uses the term "Ehtebas-e Tams" for both diseases.Dystemperment (Sou-e-mezaj) is one of the major causes of diseases known in Traditional Iranian Medicine and treatment is based on it. In this article, we studied  the frequency of symptoms of dystemperments in patients suffering from amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea.

Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was prepared including dystemperment symptoms based on Traditional Iranian Medicine textbooks. The samples included 69 women (15 to 45 years old)  suffering from amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea.

Results: In this study, the frequency of each symptom is separately mentioned. Camparison between simple dystemperments, cold, and also dry dystemperments were seen more in the patients. Between humoral dystemperments, phlegmatic and melancholic dystemperments were more frequent. 
Conclusion: In Traditional Iranian Medicine textbooks, the dystemperments responsible for these diseases are exactly the same as listed in the results. This may show that coldness and dryness can be related to retention of mense and also it shows that we can use and trust these texts as a reliable source in our studies and remedies.

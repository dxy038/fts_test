The performance of a system is determined by its characteristics as well as by the composition of the load being processed. Hence, its quantitative description is a fundamental part of all performance evaluation studies. Several methodologies for the construction of workload models, which are functions of the objective of the study, of the architecture of the system to be analyzed, and of the techniques adopted, are presented. A survey of a few applications of these methodologies to various types of systems (i.e., batch, interactive, database, network-based, parallel, supercomputer), is given

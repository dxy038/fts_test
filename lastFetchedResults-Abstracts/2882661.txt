The main objective of this paper is to present realistic energy consumption models to evaluate the energy consumption including both the transmission energy and the circuit energy at the transmitter when using Minimum Energy coding (ME-coding) On-Off Keying (OOK) scheme, we consider a simple communication link between sensor nodes. We present two energy models with a specific circuit (MAX1472) and we consider also the limitations, introduced by a practical circuit, in terms of symbol bit rate and output power. The results with the first model demonstrate that the total energy consumption of ME- Coding OOK is lower than that of the uncoded OOK, but the optimal choice of the code must take into account the limitations of the circuit. The second model with MAX1472 shutdown mode brings a reduction of the total energy consumption compared with the first model but is limited in the symbol rate. Due to this limitation, the optimal choice is finally the first model with a larger bit rate.

The objective of this research is to investigate the effects of studying spiritual-epical books on middle school girls' Islamic-Iranian values and moral behavior. The single-subject and multiple baselines project of experimental method were employed for the purpose of this study. In the first step, without any intervention, the moral behavior and Islamic-Iranian values of the subjects were examined and then in twenty-day intervals and in five stages, the selected books were given to the subjects and the possible changes in their behaviors and values were examined. The sample included four girl students of a middle school in the city of Mashhad who were selected through targeted sampling method. The tools to evaluate the variables under study included a checklist for observation of any change in their moral behavior and a questionnaire for assessment of their attitude towards Islamic-Iranian values. The findings of the research indicate that studying the biographies of spiritual-epical figures strengthened the positive attitude of the subjects towards Islamic-Iranian values and considerably decreased their immoral behaviors. The recommendations of this study included introduction of programs to study such books and encouragement of the youth to study the life and manners of the martyrs and the heroes of the Islamic Revolution and the Sacred Defense which is compatible with the introduction of role-models and epitomes in principles of the Islamic education.

Additives are often effectively used in enhancing heat transfer by creating a surface tension gradient on the surface of a condensate film to induce Marangoni driven “dropwise-like” condensation. The objective of the current study is to use the Maximum Bubble Pressure Method (MBPM) to evaluate dynamic behavior of the surface tension of solutions of three different additives (2-ethoxy ethanol, isobutylamine, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol) of varying concentrations with water. It was shown that the effects of 2-ethoxy ethanol on surface tension was primarily dependent on solute concentration and showed little dependence on time (i.e. surface age of bubble). While both isobutylamine and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol showed strong dependence on both concentration and time, the effects of the later were far more dramatic. The results for all solutions are presented as functions of concentration and time (i.e. surface age of bubble).

In this paper, we set forth a procedure to perform detailed inductor designs using population-based optimization methods. We chose inductor designs on the basis of design inputs, i.e., the inductor geometry and core material. The method incorporates recent research in magnetic materials characterization, advanced inductor modeling, and hysteresis loss modeling. We present several case studies for both single- and multi-objective optimizations.

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) be a large scale network with thousands of tiny sensors moreover is of utmost importance as it is used in real time applications. Currently WSN is required for up-to-the-minute applications which include Internet of Things (IOT), Smart Card, Smart Grid, Smart Phone and Smart City. However the greatest issue in sensor network is secure communication for which key management is the primary objective. Existing key management techniques have many limitations such as prior deployment knowledge, transmission range, insecure communication and node captured by the adversary. The proposed novel Track-Sector Clustering (TSC) and Hyper Elliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) provides better transmission range and secure communication. In TSC, the overall network is separated into circular tracks and triangular sectors. Power Aware Routing Protocol (PARP) was used for routing of data in TSC, which reduces the delay with increased packet delivery ratio. Further for secure routing HECC was implemented with 80 bits key size, which reduces the memory space and computational overhead than the existing Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) key management scheme.

The performance measurement revolution started in the late 1970s with the dissatisfaction of traditional
backward looking accounting systems. Since then the literature in this field is emerging. Most of the focus
was on designing performance measurement system (PMS), with few studies illustrating the issues in
implementing and using PMS. Although Management Information Systems (MIS) and change management
are important enablers of PMS, their role is not very well understood. Hence the objective of this
paper is to review literature on the role of MIS and change management throughout the lifecycle of
performance measurement, i.e. design, implementation and use stages. This paper not only discusses
the role of MIS and change management throughout PMS lifecycle but also discusses PMS in the context
of emerging business environment such as globalization, servitization, and networking in the context of
multi-cultural environment. Finally it identifies research challenges for PMS in the emerging business
environment.

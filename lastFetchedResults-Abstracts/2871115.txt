The trajectory optimization problems of maximum impact angle about gun-launched missile which beam-riding guidance and homing guidance composite guidance program was used were studied in this paper. The flight trajectory of the missile was divided into four main phases: the climb phase, the turning phase, the search phase, the terminal guidance phase. Maximum impact angle was set as the optimization objective, the horizontal distance of the climb phase and the trajectory inclination angle of the search phase as well as engine ignition timing were set as optimization variables, the angle between the beam centerline and the receiver and overload were set as the main constraints. Whole trajectory optimization with the given range was executed under the sequential quadratic programming. The simulation results show that the optimized trajectory is smooth and the impact angle is large enough to meet the need of top strike attack.

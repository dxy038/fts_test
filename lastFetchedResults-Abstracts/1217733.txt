Background and Objective: Anxiety and fear are the major children’s emotional responses to hospitalization. In this regard, the use of non-pharmacological techniques to relieve anxiety is of paramount importance. The present research was conducted aiming to determine the impact of storytelling on physiological anxiety, concerns, and social anxiety of 7 to 10-year-old hospitalized children.
Materials and Method: This clinical trial was conducted on sixty four 7 to 10-year-old children hospitalized in Ali Ebn Abi Taleb Hospital in Zahedan, Iran in 2013. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups. In the intervention group, the storytelling program was conducted. The control group received the routine measures in the ward. Anxiety was measured in the two groups on the first and sixth day of hospitalization. The data were collected through the Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). Eventually, the data were analyzed using Chi-square and t-test.  
Results: Mean comparison of anxiety subscales in the control group showed that the physiological anxiety, anxiety and social anxiety had no statistically significant differences between the first and sixth day (P  >  0.05). However, comparison of the subscales in the intervention group showed statistically significant differences between the first and sixth day (P  <  0.001).
Conclusion: The results showed high levels of anxiety in all the subscales during hospitalization in the control group. Storytelling could reduce all the aspects of physiological anxiety, worry anxiety and social anxiety subscales. Therefore, storytelling is recommended to be used as a non-pharmacological, easy, affordable, accessible and children’s favorite method. This research can introduce storytelling as a creative and new approach into the care and treatment arena in pediatric wards.

This paper provides the maintenance schedule of a Generating Company (GenCo) in a deregulated power system. It is shown that the goal of maintenance plan in the new structure is different from the traditional centralized power system. The modeling of maintenance scheduling problem in a competitive environment is demonstrated by taking into account that the main purpose of GenCos is selling electricity as much as possible and making higher profit. The paper consists of these parts. At first, the new structure of power system is explained. Then, the GenCo´s model is demonstrated. The model consists of an objective function and a complete set of constraints, i.e. maintenance window, generation capacity, load, fuel consumption and heat rate. In a case study, Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) will be applied to obtain the optimum maintenance schedule of two GenCos which are derived from the IEEE-RTS bench mark with 32 generating units. Two scenarios are considered. In case of rejection of any GenCo´s schedule by Independent System Operator (ISO), it has to prepare another schedule until ISO approves it. Assuming that the first schedule of each Genco are not accepted, they will prepare and propose another near optimum schedule.

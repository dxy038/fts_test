Siltation is a serious problem occurred in riverine harbors and estuaries. To overcome this problem and navigation control, continuous dredging is needed. To date, many approaches have been developed to reducing siltation in harbors.The objective of the current research study is to intoduce an cost effective structural method to control the siltation in riverine and tidal harbors. This method which is based on the flow pattern control at the entance of the harbor, is implementation of a current deflecting wall (CDW) at the harbor entrance. 
In the current study, the efficiency of the CDW was investigated for reducing sedimentation in reverine harbours and also the influence of geometrical specification of CDW on the hydrodynamic condition inside the harbor have been investigated. In the first step of the study, the hydrodynamic model was calibrated against experimental measurements cited in the literature. Then the model was applied to various alternatives of CDW shape, apex angle, length and location. Results obtained through numerical modeling experiments showed that around 30 percent reduction in harbor siltation could be achieved.

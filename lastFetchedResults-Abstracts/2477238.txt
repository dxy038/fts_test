It is expected that the estimated production in 2030 will be 150 to 160 million tones but estimated demand will be 183 million tons. Processing of fish especially (cultured fish) is one of the way attentions of people to fish and fishery products. Fish Finger, Fish Berger, Cracker, Fish Ball are the most important of fishery products.  In this study was studied production of fish cheese from Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) from sarcoplasmic proteins. The aim objective of this study (2010) was extraction and precipitation of sarcoplasmic protein of silver carps and using in the formulation of products similar to the cheese.
   Materials and Methods: Ten samples of Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) were prepared from local market from Sari city in Mazandaran province. After removing the abdominal contents, rinsed with water and were cleaned fish. Fillet was prepared from fish without of head and tail. The amount of waste in this process was between 45-55%. After rinsing of fillets, bone removal was done using deboner. The loss (bone and skin) was between 25-20% of total fillet. After preparing minced fish without bones and skin, was used from the drinking water containing sodium chloride (0.01and 0.04 M), the ratio 1 to 1 of water to fish, for rising of mince. TBH Quinone, EDTA and sodium ascorbate were used as antioxidant. Water temperature of about 10 ° C and the time required for the washing was 15 minutes. Washing process was repeated 3 times. For sedimentation of soluble proteins was used acetic acid (5% and 8%) and the samples were stored at 4 ° C for 24 hours. Samples were centrifuged in 5000 rpm for 15 minutes for full sedimentation of proteins. Formulation and packaging: To produce of fish cheese were used from different percentages of sarcoplasmic protein, additives, filler materials, salt, water, plants oil, spices. Minced meat without bones, sarcoplasmic protein concentrated and fish cheeses were evaluated for proximate factors (protein, fat, ash, moisture and carbohydrates). In addition, samples of fish cheese were examined for microbiological (Total Viable Count) and chemical factors (Total Volatile Nitrogen and Peroxide Value). Examinations of chemical and microbial factors were performed using AOAC standard. Measurement of crude protein using Kjeldahl method, Soxhlet method for crude fat, the moisture using oven at a temperature of 105 ° C for 24 hours and ash content using the electric oven at 550 ° C for 4 hours was performed. In microbial counts, from fish fillets sample were prepared dilution, samples were cultured to incubated for 12-72 hours and then were counted.
   Results and Discussion: The results indicated that mean of lipid, ash, moisture and protein in minced silver carp were %2.71, %79.44, , %0.91, %16.90 and in sarcoplasmic protein concentrated were %16.90, %1.16, %81.97, %0.42 and in fish cheese were %16.41, %28.01, %48.41, %3.46, %17/50  respectively. The best formula was treatment of 15 with %22/26 of protein. Mean of TVN and PV in minced fish, primary protein paste and fish cheese were, 11.32 mg/100, 1.51 meqo/kg and 13.63 mg/100, 3.65 meqo/kg and 15.03 mg/100, 5.38 meqo/kg respectively. The results indicated that mean total bacteria count was in minced meat 7.2 × 104per grams was the lowest (1.1×103) and highest (5.4 ×104), respectively. The mean total count of bacteria in fish protein concentrated sarcoplasmic 3.1 × 104 g, which is the lowest number (1.8×103), and the highest number (5.2 ×104), respectively. The mean total count of bacteria in cheese, fish 8/1 × 103 per gram was the lowest number (5.8×103), and the highest number of (4×104). Total count of bacteria in three of the treatments showed that the number of bacteria in the range of 4 logs, and the final product slightly decreased (in some treatments). Changes in the number of microbes in the products depend on two factors such as time - temperature and the temperature are lower and therefore faster processing time will count as standard.
   Conclusion: According to the results, the product production of sarcoplasmic proteins silver carp namely fish cheese the quality parameters, indicators of chemical and microbial spoilage in a range of reference standards can be used as a new product made silver fish with different formulations, in the diet However supplemental tests including organoleptic criteria for the evaluation of the physical properties of the product is necessary.

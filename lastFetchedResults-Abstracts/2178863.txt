Increasing in production and welfare of rural household along with soil erosion mitigation ‎are the most important objects of a watershed management program. Land use ‎optimization is an efficient approach that leads to a sustainable development plan. In this ‎research, the land use optimization was applied using a two-objective linear programing ‎model and geographic information systems by Lingo 11.0 software in Adineh-Masjed ‎Shahzand watershed of Markazi province, Iran. The model was defined with three ‎scenarios of current conditions, applying management conditions, and standard conditions ‎for two objectives of maximizing net benefits and minimizing soil erosion. Results ‎showed that the annual soil erosion decreased by 1.27, 18.69 and 26.93% in current land ‎use, land use management, and standard land use conditions, respectively. Also annual ‎net income decreased by 18.56% in current land use; but increased by 48.01 and 220.07% ‎in land use management and standard land use conditions, respectively. Considering ‎weighting value of decreased soil erosion of 1.27% that is less than weighting value of ‎decreased net income in current conditions, land use optimization with no management ‎practices or land standardization is not justifiable.‎

In this paper, we consider the resource-constrained multi-project scheduling problem (RCMPSP) and makespan minimization as objective. We present a new particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach to solve this problem. The particle representation is based on priority rules. The potential solution to the RCMPSP is, i.e., a sequence of priority rules deciding the order of scheduling the non-dummy activities, is represented by the multidimensional particle position. Hence PSO is applied to search the optimal schedule for the RCMPSP, in which a serial schedule generate scheme is adopted to transform the particle-represented priority rule to a schedule. Computational analyses are represented to verify the effective of the proposed methodology.

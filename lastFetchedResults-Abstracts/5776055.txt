The main objective of this study is to create a better understanding of farmersÂ´ awareness and performance in the promotion of environmental protection in rural China. We have chosen Panjiazhuang(Pan) Village as the research object. The data and information used in this paper were collected by distributing questionnaires randomly in Pan Village and interviewing 120 respondents. The results indicate that the residents have limited awareness and poor understanding about rural environmental protection, and there is some space for changing their behaviors related to energy use, garbage disposal and fertile use in planting to be more environmental friendly.

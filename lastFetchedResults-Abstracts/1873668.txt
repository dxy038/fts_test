Terrorist acts are of the actions that threatens the security and safety of
army and security headquarters. Occurrence of these threats is a kind
of security instability and impairs the performance of important military
and security units. This study considers this problem and with the objective
of “developing a checklist for evaluating design method,” examines
the significant threats and design solutions in each sector of a military
administration building. The study is functional and its method is descriptive-
analytical. The study results shows that we can develop a checklist
for evaluation of the building design method in form of criteria including:
“structure, plan, vents, doorways, circulation of different parts, classes,
materials, facades, roofs, facilities, security control furniture”. Adaption
of developed checklist to a military administrative building condition, as
case study, showed that the developed building is invulnerable to security
and safety threats.

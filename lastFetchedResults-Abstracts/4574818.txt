This paper proposes a multi-objective planning algorithm to accommodate high penetration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in distribution networks. The proposed algorithm is based on allocating different distributed generation (DG) units to minimize system costs and emissions. A Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NDSGA) based approach is utilized for the planning problem of determining the optimal PEV penetration, location, and sizes of DG units. The problem is defined as multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming. The proposed methodology can help the local distribution companies (LDCs) to better assess the PEV impacts on their systems and mitigate them. Moreover, the proposed methodology can help the LDCs to better assess the DG connections proposals to their networks.

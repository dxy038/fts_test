We propose two new methods for wideband array signal imaging for targets situated in unknown random media. First, a normalized coherent interferometric (N-CINT) imaging algorithm is developed based on coherent interferometric (CINT) imaging theory, yielding improved imaging performance with experimental data. Second, a phase-difference analysis (PDA) method is proposed to significantly reduce computation time and to improve imaging quality. The parameters in the two methods are determined adaptively by optimizing an objective function. Experiments are carried out for electromagnetic scattering using a linear antenna array, providing a demonstration of these methods.

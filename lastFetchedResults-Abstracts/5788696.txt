In this paper, we present a machine to machine (M2M) communication scheme, where the source communicates with the corresponding destination node with the help of one or more relay nodes. The objective is to minimize the total consumed power at the relays under specific performance constraints, while also considering the individual power limitations of each relay. In order to solve the original problem, we transform into an equivalent convex optimization problem. Simulations results are provided to validate the theoretical analysis and to illustrate the desired tradeoff between error performance and total energy consumption.

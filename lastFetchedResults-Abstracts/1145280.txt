The work within this paper focuses on the application and validation of numerical methods for predicting the acoustic and structural NVH behaviour of trimmed body components in an automotive context. In particular, the level of modelling refinement and accuracy necessary to establish a reliable finite element analysis model for comparative purposes in the development of alternative designs is investigated.

Specifically, the roof structure of a passenger car was investigated from various performance aspects, using both structural and acoustic excitation. The roof was initially tested in situ, with and without interior lining, to provide a reference for subsequent component tests. It was then detached from the car, mounted in a stiff frame and tested in a transmission window using both acoustic and structural excitation.

A finite element model of the detached component was developed using shell and solid elements for the structure and solid elements for the interior lining. Predictions were carried out to evaluate the STL as well as the vibrational frequency response due to a force applied to the structure. Special attention was given to the modelling of the headliner as well as the air gap separating the headliner from the outer sheet metal. A sensitivity study of various headliner properties was performed in addition to a comparison between solutions calculated using standard Nastran elements and augmented poro-elastic elements via the software package CDH/EXEL.

The main objective of the current work has been to establish a datum reference for alternative designs. From this aspect, the validation of the numerical modelling methodology, in particular the level of detail and accuracy used, was a crucial step. It was found that the predictions agreed very well with the measured data. As an additional, very interesting result, it was also found that the in situ testing correlated well with the transmission suite testing.

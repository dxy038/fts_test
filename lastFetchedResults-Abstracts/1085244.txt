This paper presents the system design and mathematical modeling on Multi-Effect Evaporation Forward-Feed (MEE-FF) seawater desalination system using hybrid Renewable Energy Sources (solar and wind) in Turkey. It will serve as a feasibility study on multi-effect evaporation seawater desalination system in 18 stations locating at on-shore regions of Turkey. This study illustrates the formulations developed for the mathematical modeling of MEE-FF seawater desalinating system, flat-plate collector and wind turbine. The system model includes the basic thermodynamic laws, continuity equation, heat transfer equations and the thermodynamic relations which are applied to each sub-system. A simulation program was built with Visual Basic programming language in order to achieve the objective. Hourly values of solar radiation flux on horizontal surface, ambient temperatures, wind velocities and seawater temperatures which have been measured for ten years (1999 to 2009) used for 18 stations to obtain more reliable and realistic simulation results. A system was designed and the design criteria for all sub-systems were developed to provide the interconnection among them. Simulation results of the developed mathematical models were compared with the literature, accordingly the yielded satisfactory results make feasible to compare the stations from the point of renewable energy potential.

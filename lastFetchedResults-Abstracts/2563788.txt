Introduction:Paraquat is a common agricultural herbicide that is a strong stimulus in superoxide anions foundation. This radical is very toxic and may cause serious damages to different organs. Given the adverse effects of the free radicals, the anti oxidant compounds seem necessary. Anthocyanin in Saffron is a natural anti oxidant with active anti-tumor effects, antioxidants and removing free radicals, anti-pain and inflammation, and lowering blood pressure.
Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant effect of saffron on changes in kidney tissues in mice that were treated with paraquat.
Materials and Methods:: 30 male mice were assigned into 6 groups.group1 received normal food,water and corn oil. Two groups of mice were treated at a dose of 40,20mg/kg paraquat.one of these groups received Saffron at a dose of 80mg/kg.Two groups of mice were treated with paraquat and Saffron orally per day. At the end of 30 days, the mice were anesthetized and blood samples were prepared for measurement of serum parameters and kidneys were dissected out for measurment of MDA concentration and half of kidney was transferred into formalin for histological study. All data were analyzed by SPSS software.P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
Results:Kidney sections showed acute tubular necrosis and atrophy of glomerular capillaries in the mice treated with paraquat .Moreover, the rate of serum creatinine, urea and MDA concentration significantly increased in mice treated with Paraquat. While in kidney tissues of the mice treated with saffron these indicators were improved.
Conclusion:The results suggest that saffron treats renal dysfunction in rats treated with paraquat.
Conflict of interest:None declared.

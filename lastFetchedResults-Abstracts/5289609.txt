The objective of the work is to propose a Trusted Fault Tolerant (TFT) model incorporating user recovery features in mobile Ad Hoc networking using Location Aided Routing (LAR) protocol. The LAR protocol in mobile Ad Hoc network is challenged by a complicated interaction of contention, congestion and mobility. The fault model addressed here covers the link faults that occur in the packet transmission due to the high mobility of the nodes and the node congestion occurs when there is no capacity for the buffers at the nodes to hold the incoming packets. The location fault occurs when the node moves away from the source to an unreachable location after having received the packets. The implementation model focuses on nodes which do not actively participate in a network that are considered as selfish or misbehaving nodes. The performance of the model is improvised using location awareness feature and node trust levels based on which the recovery of the lost packets is achieved.

Self-supply consists on turning the electrical consumers in prosumers; they produce a part or all the energy that they consume. In Spain, the regulatory frame that affects these kind of facilities has not been published yet. This regulatory gap causes different law interpretations that lead to misunderstandings between prosumers and electrical companies. This paper tries to explain in an objective way the present regulation as well as all royal decree drafts related to self-supply developed until now. Two cases of study will be analyzed to evaluate how the regulation will affect to the taxes that the consumers must pay.

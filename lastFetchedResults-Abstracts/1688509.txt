Shape analysis is presented as a new approach towards optimization of polymer injection molding. Taking in consideration shape parameters such as optimal centering and skeleton transformation, the objective is to estimate the best location of the injection points to obtain lowest injection pressure and balanced filling of the mold. This paper concerns recent progress in the formulation of this problem.

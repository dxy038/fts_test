An image quality objective assessment method of wavelet domain structure similarity (WDSSIM) is proposed by considering human visual features for some deficiencies of spatial structural similarity (SSIM) assessment method while measuring the quality of geometric distorted images and noise polluted images. The method includes three steps: a) decomposing the reference image and the distorted image into sub-band images with different scales and frequencies by wavelet transform, and acquiring human visual in-band sensitivity and inter-band sensitivity according to human visual JND model; b) measuring the structural similarity between the same scale and frequency sub-band images of the reference image and distorted image respectively using in-band sensitivity as weights; c) obtaining structural similarity of the whole image by averaging the weighted SSIM of each pair sub-band images using inter-band sensitivity as weights. Experimental results show that WDSSIM method is agree with human visual features and its objective results are more consistent with the subjective assessment results than traditional methods.

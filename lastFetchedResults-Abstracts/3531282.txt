This is a report by the Subcommittee on Transmission and Transmission Paths of the Ad Hoc Committee for Color Television study, established by the Joint Committee for Intersociety Coordinators (JCIC). It presents an objective analysis, based on tests made in Chicago, of video transmission characteristics related to color performance. The study finds significant departures from perfect performance in this segment of the overall system, makes recommendations for tighter tolerances on several current FCC signal specifications, and suggests the addition of other characteristics not now specified.

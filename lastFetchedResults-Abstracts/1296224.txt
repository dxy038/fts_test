In todayâ€™s competitive environment, increasing of supply chain efficiency
has considerable importance in the success of firms. Various factors limit
this increase, which are referred as supply chain complexities. Identification
of these complexities and dealing with the is essential. This paper attempts to
introduce and apply an efficient and effective method for dealing with the
complexity of supply chain. This method is based on systemic principles of
the Theory of Constraints. This research shows how a manager can use
logical tools of theory of the constraints thinking processes (TOCTP) to
identify and deal with the root causes of supply chain complexity. This
approach was implemented partially in a paper manufacturing firm in Iran.
Data were gathered by questionnaires and interviews, and analyzed
interactively with the supply chain managers and experts of the firm in order
to get valid results. In this case, three first steps of TOCTP, i.e. drawing
intermediate objective (IO) map, current reality tree (CRT) and conflict
remove diagram (CRD) were performed. The results showed that these
logical diagrams are useful tools to identify the drivers of supply chain
complexity and the determine root causes of them

The α subunit of β-conglycinin is a major allergen in soybean. The objective of this study was to predict and identify the linear immunoglobulin (Ig)E epitopes of the soybean α subunit of β-conglycinin. Three immunoinformatics tools were used to predict the potential epitopes and were confirmed by dot-blot inhibition using sera from soybean allergic subjects. As a result, 15 peptides were predicted and assembled by solid-phase synthesis. Eleven epitopes were identified by the dot-blot inhibition test. Moreover, peptide 3 had IgE binding capability with all sera(5/5) tested, while peptide 1, 4, 6, 8 and12 could bind to 4/5 of the sera samples. Secondary structure prediction of peptide 3 and circular dichroism test validated that the structure of peptide 3 was a random coil.

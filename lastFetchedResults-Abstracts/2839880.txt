This paper presents a PID controlled two-wheel based robot which is able to move accurate motions simply by tuning the PID coefficients manually. The fundamental required function was defined and its required objective is clarified first. Then, the PID algorithm was developed in the orders of contribution of each term. Next, the fundamental function was realized in RobotC programming language. The higher level functions thus were able to be built on top layer by layer. There are many methods for tuning the PID coefficients. However, they require either complex mathematics or expensive software. Instead, the real-time online debugger provided by RobotC was used to tune the coefficients efficiently. The accuracy and stability of the algorithm have been verified by participating in a national robot competition. Our two teams won the first two ranks.

This article deals with the influence of different atmosphere (normal, vapor, nitrogen) on some mechanical parameters, as shear strength, for BGA solder balls (Sn63Pb37, SAC305). There are also micro-sections of solder balls studied. Main objective of this work is to establish the optimal and necessary concentration of nitrogen for each application.

Objective
 knowledge, none of the articles has been published in the literature which analyse the alterations of saliva in different stages of chronic renal failure (CRF). The objective of this study has been to analyse the flow, pH and biochemical composition of saliva in patients with moderate–severe CRF (M–S CRF) and with terminal renal failure (TRF).

udy group was formed of 50 CRF patients: 22 with M–S CRF and 28 with TRF included in a haemodialysis programme. A control group with similar characteristics was established (n = 64). Saliva samples were taken from both patients and controls to determine the salivary pH and biochemical composition.
s
salivary flow was similar in patients and controls. Salivary concentrations of creatinine, urea, sodium, potassium, chloride and alpha-amylase were significantly higher in patients than in controls. Calcium concentration was significantly lower in patients than in controls. Creatinine, urea and potassium concentrations were significantly higher in patients with M–S CRF than in those with TRF. The salivary pH was significantly higher in patients than in controls.
sions
ry composition in patients with CRF is conditioned by the stage of renal failure. The relationship between these biochemical parameters and the oral health status has still not been definitively clarified.

Many forward electromagnetic scattering models have been proposed to predict the normalized radar cross section, &#963;<sup>0</sup>, from sea ice characteristics. The authors apply scatterometer data to large scale inverse modeling. Given the limited resolution, they adopt a simple geometric optics forward scattering model to analyze surface and volume scattering contributions to observed Ku-band signatures. A model inversion technique based on recursive optimization of an objective function is developed. Simulations demonstrate the performance of the method in the presence of noise. The inverse model is implemented using Ku-band image reconstructed data collected by the NASA scatterometer. The results are used to analyze and interpret &#963;<sup>0</sup> phenomena occurring in the Arctic

Background: Kidney stone is a common multifactorial disease in Iran. Environmental and genetic factors including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) affect the incidence of kidney stones. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the association of +4065 T/C polymorphism at 3?untranslated region (3'UTR) of urokinase gene and calcium kidney stones.
Methods: This case-control study was conducted on 70 patients with history of calcium kidney stones as case group and 70 healthy subjects as control group in the Baqiyatallah hospital in 2013. The polymorphism was assessed using the Allele Specific PCR (AS-PCR) method. Allele and genotype frequencies of the two groups were compared using 2x2 contingency tables. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was compared between the two groups using Chi-square test.
Findings: Of 70 cases, 10 (15%) were heterozygous and 24 (34%) were homozygous for the polymorphism. Of 70 controls, 25 (35%) were heterozygous for the polymorphism. The frequency of mutant T allele was 41% in the case group and 18% in the control group. The frequency of mutant C allele was 59% in the case group and 82% in the control group. The risk of calcium kidney stones in carriers of the mutant allele was 1.7 times higher than non-carriers (OR: 1.7). 
Conclusion: With regards to the results, it seems that there is a significant association between the polymorphism at 3?UTR of urokinase gene and formation of calcium kidney stones. Urokinase gene polymorphism may be introduced as a candidate gene involved in calcium stone formation.â€Œ

This article proposes a Multi-Objective Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimization (MOCLPSO) approach for multi-objective environmental/economic dispatch (EED) problem in electric power system. The EED problem is a non-linear constrained multi-objective optimization problem where the power generation cost and emission are treated as competing objectives. The proposed MOCLPSO approach handles the problem with competing and non- commensurable fuel cost and emission objectives and has a diversity-preserving mechanism using an external memory (called "repository") and Pareto dominance concept to find widely different Pareto-optimal solutions. Simulations are conducted on typical power system problems. The superiority of the algorithm in converging to the better Pareto optimal front with fewer fitness function evaluations is shown in general.

Objective: Helicobacter pylori (H. Pylori) is now recognized as a major etiological factor in the pathogenesis of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. There is concrete evidence that eradication of the bacterium reverses histological gastritis, and results in significant reduction of duodenal and gastric ulcer recurrence. Poor compliance and antibiotic resistance are the main causes for failure of anti H. pylori therapy. In this study we determined efficacy of omeprazole based triple therapy with b.i.d. dosing of furazolidone, amoxicillin for 2 weeks and omeprazole in Iranian children.
Methods: This prospective study included 37 children, in whom H. Pylori infection was diagnosed endoscopically. H.Pylori positive children were treated with a two weeks course of furazoidone (6 mg/kg/day) and amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/day) plus omeprazole (1-2 mg/kg/day). Eradication was assessed by 13C UBT.
Findings: Mean age of patients was 10.2 yr (5-15 yr), 25 (67.5%) patients were boys. H. Pylori was eradicated in 34 children (per patient 91.9%, per protocol 86%). Side effects occurred in 3 (8.1%) patients, but these were mild and it was not necessary to discontinue treatment. Three children (8.1%) remained H. pylori positive.
Conclusion: Our study showed that the association of furazolidone plus amoxicillin with a proton-pump inhibitor could be a valuable alternative for eradication of H. Pylori infection in children. It is an effective, affordable treatment that allows good compliance and produces low adverse effect rates.

This paper presents the performance investigation and FPGA implementation aspects of a real-time adaptive MIMO DFE system. MIMO communication systems have been a strong research topic for several years because of spectral efficiency advantages, and are starting to see adoption in real-time communication systems. The group research department in Tait Electronics has a reconfigurable platform for MIMO research. In particular, the platform has an adaptive multivariate DFE, utilizing LMS, currently implemented. The LMS algorithm has been simulated and optimized for implementation on the FPGA. The main objective of the paper is to present the investigative work for an alternative RLS algorithm by comparing its performance and implementation to the LMS algorithm. RLS is known to be more complex but offers a potentially faster convergence speed. Stability and complexity issues are also discussed

The objective of this study was to compare the differences of gene expression profiles between intramuscular and subcutaneous adipocytes originated from the isolated preadipocytes in vitro. Cytosolic triglyceride determination indicated that subcutaneous adipocytes accumulated more lipid than intramuscular adipocytes did at the late stage of differentiation. Microarray assay revealed that 172 probes representing 133 genes were differentially expressed, among which 46 genes were highly expressed in intramuscular adipocytes and the other 87 genes were highly expressed in subcutaneous adipocytes. Real-time PCR confirmed that genes related to lipid metabolism, such as LPL, FABP4, FABP5 and OSBPL10, were predominantly expressed in subcutaneous adipocytes, whereas BMP4 and BMP7 were highly expressed in intramuscular adipocytes. The results indicated that the accumulation of lipid mass in subcutaneous adipocytes might be due to the highly expressed genes related to lipid metabolism, and the high levels of BMP4 and BMP7 in intramuscular adipocytes suggested that BMPs might be involved in the differentiation of intramuscular adipocytes.

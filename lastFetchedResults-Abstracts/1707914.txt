The injection of liquid into a fluidized bed is a crucial step in many processes such as fluid coking, fluid catalytic cracking, or gas-phase polymerization, whose performance greatly depends on good and rapid contact between the injected liquid and the fluidized particles. The liquid spray, created by two-phase (gas–liquid) nozzles, forms a jet, i.e. a gas-rich cavity within the fluidized bed. Past studies have shown that good liquid–solid contact requires a large entrainment rate of particles into the jet, followed by intensive mixing of liquid droplets and entrained particles within the jet. The objective of this study is the experimental measurement of solids entrainment into spray jets. The specific application of interest is the enhancement of solids entrainment under conditions relevant to the fluid coking process.

l and accurate experimental technique has been developed to measure the solids entrainment from a fluidized bed into two-phase gas–liquid jets, gas jets and liquid jets. The effects of operating conditions of the nozzle (sonic versus subsonic) and of the fluidized bed on the solids entrainment have been investigated. The differences between the mechanisms of solids entrainment for two-phase gas–liquid, gas and liquid jets have been analyzed.

xperimental tool has been applied to the design and testing of a mixing chamber consisting of a cylindrical tube placed at a certain distance downstream of the nozzle tip, resulting in a confined, turbulent jet with enhanced liquid–solid mixing properties.

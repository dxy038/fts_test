The thermal wave effect occurs during rapid heating of pure dielectric materials. It also serves as a limiting solution for rapid heating of other materials. The numerical and series solutions for this type of problems are well documented in the literature. This work uses a finite series solution at small time to prepare a Green’s function (GF) solution. The determination of the thermal wave Green’s functions in one-dimensional plate is the primary objective. Another objective is to present the thermal wave Green’s function solution equation (GFSE). Once the Green’s functions and GFSE are known, one can produce temperature solution for different applications. As long as the time is finite, a produced series solution is also finite and the solution can be classified as exact.

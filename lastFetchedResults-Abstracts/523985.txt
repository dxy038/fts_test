Objective: Newcastle disease virus (NDV) or avian paramyxovirus type1 possesses
several unique properties that make it an excellent anticancer agent. The hemagglutinin
neuraminidase (HN) protein of NDV plays an important role in viral infection. The
purpose of the present study is to investigate the dissemination of Newcastle disease
virus (NDV) AF2240 strain in the liver during intratumoral injection in 4T1 breast cancer
in female BALB/c mice.
Materials and Methods: A total of 200 female BALB/c mice were divided randomly
into 10 cancerous groups consisting of 20 mice per group. The mice were initially induced
with 104 4T1 cells, NDV-AF2240 and tamoxifen co-culture. Cancerous groups
were divided into: cancer control (CC), cancer treated with 0.5 ?g/ml tamoxifen citrate
(CT), cancer treated with 8, 16, 32 and 64HA units of NDV-AF2240 (respectively
named C/NDV8, C/NDV16, C/NDV32, C/NDV64), cancer treated with 8, 16, 32 and
64HA units of NDV-AF2240 and tamoxifen (respectively as CT/NDV8, CT/NDV16, CT/
NDV32 and CT/NDV64 daily for four weeks). In situ reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (In situ RT-PCR), negative staining electron microscopy (NSEM), polyclonal
chicken antibody and goat anti-chicken antibody conjugated with fluorescein
isothiocynate (FITC) using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) were used to
detect the virus in the tumor and liver.
Results: In situ RT-PCR, NSEM and CLSM successfully detected NDV-AF2240 in
tumor cells and liver.

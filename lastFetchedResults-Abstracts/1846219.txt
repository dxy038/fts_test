The objective of the study was to assess the usefulness of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in distinguishing malignant from benign conditions in patients with an abnormal uterine cavity. Fifty-four patients that were suspected of having abnormal uterine cavities were retrospectively evaluated by using MR imaging. The diagnosis of an abnormal uterine cavity included a thickened endometrium, and/or a endometrial mass, and/or a submucosal mass. Threshold values to classify the uterine cavity as abnormal on sagittal T2-weighted images were &gt;10 mm for premenopausal women and &gt;5 mm for postmenopausal women. Malignancy was diagnosed when lesions invaded the myometrial/junctional zone, and/or lesion enhancement was lower than that of the adjacent myometrium. The results found that histology confirmed 18 malignant and 37 benign lesions. Twelve of 15 endometrial carcinomas and 3 malignant mixed mesodermal tumors (MMMT) were correctly characterized as malignant on enhanced T1-weighted images; whereas 6 of 15 endometrial carcinomas and 3 MMMT were correctly characterized on T2-weighted images. Thirty-four of 37 benign cases were correctly characterized as not malignant on enhanced T1-weighted images. One of 14 submucosal leiomyomas, one endometrial stromal metaplasia, and one of ten pathologically normal endometria were misdiagnosed on enhanced T1-weighted images but were correctly diagnosed on T2-weighted images. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for distinguishing malignant from benign central uterine masses were 83%, 92%, and 89% for enhanced T1-weighted image, and 50%, 97%, and 82% for T2-weighted image, respectively. We came to the conclusion that in diagnosing patients with abnormal uterine cavity, MR imaging may help differentiate malignant from benign disorders.

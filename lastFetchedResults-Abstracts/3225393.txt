This paper presents a spatial hand tracking system using a 6 DOF anthropomorphic robot applied in human machine interaction. The main objective of this mechatronic system is to obtain information about the spatial position of a userÂ´s hand movements in order to be used like a skills trainer to accelerate the skills transfer from the machine to the human by integrating the laws of physics of virtual objects and adapting different design techniques and use of computer software for three-dimensional virtual reality.

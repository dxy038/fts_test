In this paper we propose an electric model vehicle with its own system of acquisition and computation of the information, on which we will test the collision control algorithms in indoors and outdoors with GPS localization. The algorithm used in this project is the Potential Field method. We chose to use a LIDAR sensor that can acquire distance data from the environment in 2D. The main objective of these tests is to make obstacle avoidance with mobile robot in Real-Time.

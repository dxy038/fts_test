Neural-Network Response Surfaces (NNRS) is applied to replace the actual expensive finite element analysis during the composite structural optimization process. The Orthotropic Experiment Method (OEM) is used to select the most appropriate design samples for network training. The trained response surfaces can either be objective function or constraint conditions. Together with other conventional constraints, an optimization model is then set up and can be solved by Genetic Algorithm (GA). This allows the separation between design analysis modeling and optimization searching. Through an example of a hat-stiffened composite plate design, the weight response surface is constructed to be objective function, and strength and buckling response surfaces as constraints; and all of them are trained through NASTRAN finite element analysis. The results of optimization study illustrate that the cycles of structural analysis can be remarkably reduced or even eliminated during the optimization, thus greatly raising the efficiency of optimization process. It also observed that NNRS approximation can achieve equal or even better accuracy than conventional functional response surfaces.

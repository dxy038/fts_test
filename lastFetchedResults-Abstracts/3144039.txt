A certificate of authenticity (COA) is an inexpensive physical object that has a random unique structure with high cost of near-exact reproduction. An additional requirement is that the uniqueness of COAÂ´s random structure can be verified using an inexpensive device. A COA design for objects that behave as COAs in the electromagnetic field is proposed. The objective is to complement RFIDs so that they are physically, not only digitally, unique and hard to replicate. By enabling this feature, it is desired to create a super-tag whose information about the product can be read within a relative far-field, and also whose authenticity can be verified within its near-field with low probability of a false alarm. This can ultimately lead to a physically-secure RFID.

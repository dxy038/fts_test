This paper is based on a comprehensive dynamic mathematical model (Copernicus) of vascular bubble formation and growth during and after decompression from a dive. The model is founded on the statistical correlation between measurable Venous Gas Emboli (VGE) and risk of severe Decompression Sickness (DCS) where VGE has been shown to be a reliable and sensitive predictor of decompression stress. By using the Copernicus model the diving decompression problem can be formulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem, where the objective is to minimize the total ascend time subject to constraints on the maximum bubbles volume in the pulmonary artery. A recent study reveals that the optimal solution can be obtained by solving the optimization problem with some equality constraints. Inspired by which, a simpler approach using barrier function is proposed in this paper, through which we achieve a more efficient and robust numerical implementation. The paper also studies the effect of ascent profile parameterization.

The objective of this study was to establish the identity of a 40 kDa bovine oviductal fluid protein as a haptoglobin-like protein and to evaluate the association of the haptoglobin-like protein with ovarian and oviductal tissues and fluids. An oviductal fluid protein band corresponding to a molecular mass of 40 kDa was excised and electroeluted from SDS-PAGE gels. Sequence analysis revealed an N-terminal region sharing 81% identity with the beta-subunit of bovine haptoglobin. The 40 kDa oviductal fluid protein crossreacted on immunoblots with antiserum against rabbit endometrial haptoglobin and with an anti-human haptoglobin polyclonal antibody. Two-dimensional PAGE revealed four protein variants ranging in pI from 7.7 to 8.6, which appeared identical, with respect to molecular weight, number of isoforms and pI, to bovine haptoglobin in acute phase serum. The haptoglobin-like protein was localized using immunohistochemistry to the lumina of blood vessels and to the extracellular matrix of ovarian and oviductal tissues. Immunostaining for the haptoglobin-like protein was also detected in the oviductal lumen, in the mucosa of the ampullary oviduct but not the isthmic oviduct, and in intermittent ampullary epithelial cells. Within the ovary, the haptoglobin-like protein was localized to the avascular granulosa cells and follicular fluid of antral follicles, but not in the theca cells or in preantral follicles of any developmental stage. It was concluded that the haptoglobinlike protein is a normal constituent of bovine ovarian and oviductal tissues and fluids, and it was hypothesized that the haptoglobin-like protein contributes to ovarian follicular development and oviductal function.

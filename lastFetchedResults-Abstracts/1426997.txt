Objective
der people who have had hip fracture surgery, to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a nurse-led intervention in treating depression compared to treatment as usual (TAU), and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a psychological treatment for the prevention of depression.

nked cost-effectiveness studies for the treatment and prevention of depression after hip surgery, from the perspective of health, social care, voluntary sector agencies and unpaid carers.
g
aedic units in Manchester, England.
ipants
ndred and twenty-one patients with Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) scores greater than 6 were included in the treatment study and 172 patients with GDS scores less than or equal to 6 were enrolled in the prevention study.
entions
led intervention for treating depression versus TAU; and cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for preventing depression following surgery for hip fracture.
utcome measures
es were changes in HADS-depression scores at 6 weeks. Costs covered treatment and all service impacts.
s
6 weeks, there were no significant differences in cost. However, the nurse-led intervention group had a lower mean HADS-depression score compared to TAU. In the prevention study, there were no significant differences in cost and depression score between patients treated with CBT and TAU.
sion
sults for this parallel randomized controlled study show that after hip fracture surgery a nurse-led intervention may be a cost-effective option for the treatment of depression in older people with depression. However CBT does not appear to be a cost-effective option for the prevention of depression in this population.

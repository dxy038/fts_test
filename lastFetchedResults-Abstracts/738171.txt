Presenting features
A 42-year-old man was admitted with a chief complaint of cough and night sweats of 2 months’ duration. The cough produced brown sputum but no blood. He also reported drenching sweats every night for the last several weeks before admission. He attributed his cough to exposure to dust while working on demolishing a funeral home 2 months ago; he denied any history of respiratory symptoms before this recent job. The patient smoked less than one pack of cigarettes per week during the previous year. He had no history of tuberculosis or contact with infected persons. He denied a history of severe lung infection, asthma, sinus disease, or overseas travel, as well as behaviors that are risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, such as intravenous drug use or multiple sexual partners.
His physical examination was notable for a temperature of 101.4°F and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. In general, he was thin, although well in appearance, and not visibly short of breath. His lungs were clear to auscultation. Laboratory studies and urinalysis were normal.
A chest radiograph showed a 3-cm by 2-cm mass with a surrounding cavity in the right upper lobe (Figure 1). A subsequent chest computed tomographic scan showed a 5-cm by 4-cm cavity in the right upper lobe, with surrounding infiltrates as well as a mass within the cavity suspicious for a fungus ball (Figure 2). Patchy infiltrates were also seen in the left and right lower lobes.

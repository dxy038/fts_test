Streaming video over packet networks is considered a joint source/channel coding problem, where the necessity of real-time delivery, bandwidth constraints, and error resilience determine the design parameters for the video transmission system. The objective of video coding for network applications is changed to optimising the video quality over a given bit rate range instead of at a given bit rate. Meeting bandwidth requirements and maintaining acceptable image quality simultaneously is a challenge. This paper provides an overview of scalable video coding methods.

Multi-objective Genetic Algorithms have become a popular choice to aid in optimising the size of the whole hybrid power train. Within these optimisation processes, other optimisation techniques for the control strategy are implemented. This optimisation within an optimisation requires many simulations to be run, so reducing the computational cost is highly desired. This paper presents an optimisation framework consisting of a series hybrid optimisation algorithm, in which a global search optimizes a submarine propulsion system using low-fidelity models and, in order to refine the results, a local search is used with high-fidelity models. The effectiveness of the Hybrid optimisation algorithm is demonstrated with the optimisation of a submarine propulsion system.

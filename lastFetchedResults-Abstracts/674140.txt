Objective
Hospitalization of a child can cause severe anxiety and stress in the parents, 
especially for the mother. This stress consequently affects the treatment 
course of the child. Hereby, we investigate the impact of different stressors 
in mothers of hospitalized children. 
Materials & Methods 
In this cross-sectional study, 225 mothers of hospitalized children in the 
pediatric ward of Besat hospital were randomly selected and studied. Data 
collection tool was a two-part questionnaire gathered by interviewing the 
mother. The first part included demographic information of the patients. 
The second part included questions regarding stressors in four different 
categories; child-related factors, environmental factors, socioeconomic 
factors and health professional factors. SPSS 16.5 was used for statistical 
analysis and data were analyzed by one way ANOVA and T test. 
Results 
In the child-related factor category, fear of child death (84%); in the 
socioeconomic factor category, fear of disease in the other siblings (84%); in 
the environmental factor category, unpleasant odors in the ward (56%); and 
in the health professional category, not enough explanation about inserting 
IV lines, (54.2%) constituted the most important factors.
There was a meaningful correlation between the stressors and the mothersâ€™ 
age and occupation, child age, days of hospitalization, types of admission 
and health insurance coverage, but there was no meaningful correlation 
between stressors and other factors.
Conclusion 
Professional and in depth training programs should be provided for 
health care providers and nursing staff regarding dealing with mothers of 
hospitalized children

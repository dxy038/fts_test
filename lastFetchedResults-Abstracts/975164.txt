Objective: Stress and emotion play significant roles in the quality of human life; therefore, the presentation of a suitable model of them is useful in understanding these mental states. Method: Behavioral and Emotional activities are associated with the limbic system. Therefore, we will first describe parts of the brain which are important in emotional reactions, including the cortex, thalamus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, locus coeruleus, hippocampus and hypothalamus. Thereafter, we will describe a general cognitive map for this brain state. This cognitive map exhibits the basic role of neuronal and hormonal systems in processing emotional stress. Results: By describing the necessary relations and characteristics, a computational model was executed in simulink Matlab toolbox, and different experiments were carried out in order to determine the validity of the model. Conclusion: Results showed that during emotional stress, the orbitofrontal cortex reduces the stress and prevents it from continuing. Also, the computational model could describe brain function in emotional stress; therefore, it can be used in larger models as a subsystem.

Our study aims to solve a hybrid flow shop scheduling problem. This one has a specification which is: it contains different stages in series, each one is composed of some identical parallel machines, each order is composed of several batches and some ones are re-entrant. The objective function of this problem is to minimize the total tardiness. A new method is developed to solve the problem based on the Nature which is the particle swarm optimization method under fuzzy logic controller (FLCPSO). This one is compared to another modified Particle Swarm Optimization developed by us in previous works. The results are very interesting.

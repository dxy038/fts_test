Human consciousness is a target of research in multiple fields of knowledge, that presents it as an important characteristic to better handle complex and diverse situations. Artificial consciousness models have arose, together with theories that attempt to model what we understand about consciousness, in a way that could be implemented an artificial conscious being. The main motivations to study artificial consciousness are related to the creation of agents more similar to human beings, in order to build more efficient machines. This paper presents an experiment using the Global Workspace Theory and the LIDA Model to build a "conscious" mobile robot in a virtual environment, using the LIDA framework as a implementation of the LIDA Model. The main objective is to evaluate if it is possible to use conscience as implemented by the LIDA framework to simplify decision making processes during navigation of a mobile robot subject to interaction with people, as part of a cicerone robot development.

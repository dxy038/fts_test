The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects
of o-hydroxyethylorutin on Botrytis cinerea mycelium
growth and metabolism. Hydrogen peroxide concentration,
superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase
activities were compared in the pathogens  mycelium
grown on control and o-hydroxyethylorutin containing
medium. Transfer of B. cinerea mycelium to medium
supplemented with 5 mm o-hydroxyethylorutin resulted
in a large decrease in catalase activity. No changes in
mycelium growth, hydrogen peroxide concentration
and superoxide dismutase activity were observed. Guaiacol
and ascorbate peroxidases were not detected in
mycelia. The data are consistent with previous findings
that o-hydroxyethylorutin treatment of tomato plants
restricts the development of B. cinerea infection due to
the induction of higher active oxygen species (AOS)
generation in plants by this compound. Being poor in
catalase, the pathogen may not be able to cope with
increasing AOS formation. The results indicate that
catalase is an infective agent of B. cinerea.

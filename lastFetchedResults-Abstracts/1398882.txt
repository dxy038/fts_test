The viscoelastic behavior of articular cartilage changes with progression of osteoarthritis. The objective of this study is to quantify this progression and to propose a viscoelastic model of articular cartilage taking into account the degree of osteoarthritis that which be easily used in predictive numerical simulations of the hip joint behavior.

ntify the effects of osteoarthritis (OA) on the viscoelastic behavior of human articular cartilage, samples were obtained from the hip arthroplasty due to femoral neck fracture (normal cartilage) or advanced coxarthrosis (OA cartilage). Experimental data were obtained from instrumented indentation tests on unfrozen femoral cartilage collected and studied in the day following the prosthetic hip surgery pose. By using an inverse method coupled with a numerical modeling (FEM) of all experimental data of the indentation tests, the viscoelastic properties of the two states were quantified.

alues of viscoelastic parameters were significantly lower for OA cartilage than normal (instantaneous and relaxed tension moduli, viscosity coefficient). Based on the results and in the thermodynamic framework, a constitutive viscoelastic model taking into account the degree of osteoarthritis as an internal variable of damage is proposed. The isotropic phenomenological viscoelastic model including degradation provides an accurate prediction of the mechanical response of the normal human cartilage and OA cartilage with advanced coxarthrosis but should be further validated for intermediate degrees of osteoarthritis.

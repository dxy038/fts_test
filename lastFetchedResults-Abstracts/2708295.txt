This work presents the analysis of an RF (radio-frequency) receiver system which is part of a RIR (Range instrumentation Radar) type Radar. This radar has been unused for over 20 years, which is why a method to validate the correct performance of the reception chain and study modernization is required. The following consist of the simulation process created over LabVIEW systems with the objective of having a mathematical model of the receiver which is used to verify the correct functioning of the system. The results of the simulation are contrasted with testing performed over the system, obtaining very satisfactory results in the analysis of the antenna reception lobes and the process that measures the shifting in the RF axis.

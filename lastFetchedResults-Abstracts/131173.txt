The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the use of bonded composite patches in strengthening or repair of damaged structural elements. The high strength, light weight, formability and relative ease of application, make composite materials an excellent option for use as external reinforcing systems for structures.
A square aluminum plate with a central circular cutout is considered as a damaged structural element. The change in vibration response of damaged metallic plates reinforced with fiber-reinforced polymer composite materials (composite patch) are presented in this study. Numerical studies using commercial finite element software were conducted to investigate the effects of variation in patch geometries and fiber orientation on free vibration responses of repaired plates. A quantitative measure for the effectiveness of the composite patches is taken to be the relative change in natural frequencies of the repaired plates compare to those of the damaged one.
The results presented herein indicated that, for vibration response of a repaired aluminum plate with central cutout, a set of composite patches with different shapes and fiber angles can be found which change and improve vibration frequency of damaged plates.

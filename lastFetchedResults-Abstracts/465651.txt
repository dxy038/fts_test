Objective: Our goal was to compare the use of a specially designed trocar for initial uterine entry with standard entry by electrocautery in creation of a hysterotomy for fetal surgery. Study Design: Ten consecutive patients undergoing hysterotomy for intrauterine repair of myelomeningocele were randomized to initial uterine entry with electrocautery or with the Tulipan-Bruner trocar. Timing of initial uterine entry with electrocautery began with incision into the uterine serosa and ended with incision of the chorioamnionic membranes. Timing of initial uterine entry with the Tulipan-Bruner trocar began with placement of stay sutures and ended with removal of the central introducer from the peel-away sheath. Blood loss was estimated by the primary surgeon. All of the participating surgeons judged the convenience and ease of each technique. The times required for initial uterine entry were compared with an unpaired t test. Statistical significance was set at P< .05. Results: The time required for initial uterine entry with electrocautery was 231 ± 63 (mean ± SD) seconds compared with 146 ± 51 seconds with the trocar (P< .05). The total blood loss for all 10 cases was <50 mL, but the presence of blood in the wound was judged much more inconvenient when electrocautery was used. Finally, electrocautery required 2 surgical assistants in every case, whereas the trocar was readily placed with only a single assistant. Conclusion: The Tulipan-Bruner trocar provides quicker, less traumatic uterine entry during creation of a hysterotomy, as compared with electrocautery. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:1188-91.)

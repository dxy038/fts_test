Targeting at the fuzziness and uncertainty among the factors affecting high-temperature corrosion, tests and analyses were conducted based on the fuzzy mathematical theory and by use of the Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). By discriminating the pair wise membership degree of all affecting factors and combining the in-situ tests, a fuzzy matrix reflecting the consistency between thinking judgment and objective reality was constructed. The weighting indexes of all factors affecting high-temperature corrosion of the water wall of a certain thermal power plant were quantified. The factors most affecting high-temperature corrosion of the water wall of the plant were discovered and combustion adjustment was made correspondingly. During the shutdown inspection after operating for half a year, it was found that the high-temperature corrosion phenomenon of the water wall was basically removed.

Power modulators for compact, repetitive systems are continually faced with new requirements as the corresponding system objectives increase. Changes in pulse rate frequency or number of pulses significantly impact the design of the power conditioning system. In order to meet future power supply requirements, we have developed several high voltage (HV) capacitor charging power supplies (CCPS). This effort focuses on a volume of 6" x 6" x 14" and a weight of 25 lbs. The primary focus was to increase the effective capacitor charge rate, or power output, for the given size and weight. Although increased power output was the principal objective, efficiency and repeatability were also considered. A number of DC-DC converter topologies were compared to determine the optimal design. In order to push the limits of output power, numerous resonant converter parameters were examined. Comparisons of numerous topologies, HV transformers and rectifiers, and switching frequency ranges are presented. The impacts of the control system and integration requirements are also considered.

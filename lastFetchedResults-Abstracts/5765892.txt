The simulation has been carried out of the radiation monitoring systems for dry storage casks of spent nuclear fuel (SNF). Two types of systems have been tested: system based on gamma imaging and neutron imaging. The main objective of the work is finding optimal design for integrity check of the outer shell of the cask (cracks in the concrete walls, welds sealing, etc.). The secondary objectives are assessing activity of the fuel and obtaining tomographic sections of the cask. It is supposed that the monitoring system consists of a gamma/neutron imager mounted on a gantry for radial and vertical movement to scan the surface of the cask. It has been shown that coded aperture gamma telescope based on continuous scintillation CsI(Na) crystal or pixelated CZT detector can be used for flaw detection in concrete walls. The estimated time of inspection is several days for a cask of 3.4meter diameter and a length of 5.8 meters. The best result achieved is the detection of defects of ~10 cm size. The further optimization of the detectors, however, can reduce this value to several centimeters. Neutron imager has worse performance, and can be used as an auxiliary detector. The paper presents the results of simulations and discusses the possible implementation of the detectors.

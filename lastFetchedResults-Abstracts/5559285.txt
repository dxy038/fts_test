In this paper, we present a complete system for car platooning using visual tracking. The visual tracking is achieved by directly estimating the projective transformation (in our case a homography) between a selected reference template attached to the leading vehicle and the corresponding area in the current image. The relative position and orientation of the servoed car with regard to the leading one is computed by decomposing the homography. The control objective is stated in terms of path following task in order to cope with the non-holonomic constraints of the vehicles.

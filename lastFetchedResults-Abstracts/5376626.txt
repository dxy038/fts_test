This paper introduces a methodology for robust control of vehicle dynamics. The vehicle lateral behavior with roll dynamics is described by Takagi-Sugeno (TS) model. A fuzzy observer is first developed to estimate the vehicle sideslip angle as well as the roll parameters using the yaw rate measurement, while taking into account the road bank angle and the unmeasurable premise variables of the TS model. The objective of this study is the design of an observer-based controller to improve the stability and vehicle safety with perturbations related to the nonlinearities of the contact forces, the variations of the adhesion coefficients, the road bank angle. The proposed observer based controller is represented in the linear matrix inequality (LMI) form. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control method when different cornering maneuvers are applied to the vehicle.

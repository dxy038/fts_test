An interactive color graphical simulation and analysis package for a power plant´s electrical auxiliary system is developed and presented. The software is written in C and is designed for PC use. The objective of this package is to help engineers do nonreal-time and what-if types of analyses in a portable and highly user-friendly environment, and to minimize the growth of the company´s mainframe computer and decrease computer turn-around time for auxiliary system studies. Five of the package´s modules-symbol builder, one line diagram design, load flow, motor starting, and fault study-are discussed. Each module can be executed individually, or they can be linked together as integrated modules. Using this package, engineers can analyze the power plant´s electrical auxiliary system in a highly user-friendly manner. A description of the package, a detailed demonstration of user interface capabilities, and hardware requirements are provided

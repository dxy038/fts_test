This Scintigraphy represents a tool for exploring functional property shown in several pathologies. Take the example of the ventriculair ejection fraction, the renal clearance and the thyroid activity. However, scintigraphic images are strongly affected by noise. So, our objective in this work is to improve scintigraphic images to obtain sharper images and more reliable diagnosis for better orientation and understanding of pathological phenomenon. This article focuses on the comparison of the multiresolution methods for assessing the quality of scintigraphic images to reduce noise using wavelet, contourlet, curvelet, ridgelet and bandelet.

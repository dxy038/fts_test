Detection of radiological accidents and monitoring the spread of the contamination is of great importance. Following the Chernobyl accident many European countries have installed monitoring networks to perform this task. Real-time availability of automatically interpolated maps showing the spread of radioactivity during and after an accident would improve the capability of decision makers to accurately respond to a radiological accident. The objective of this paper is to present a real-time automatic interpolation system suited for natural background radioactivity. Interpolating natural background radiation allows us to better understand the natural variability, thus improving our ability to detect accidents. A real-time automatic interpolation system suited for natural background radioactivity presents a first step towards a system that can deal with radiological accidents. The interpolated maps are produced using a combination of universal kriging and an automatic variogram fitting procedure. The system provides a map of (1) the kriging prediction, (2) the kriging standard error and (3) the position of approximate prediction intervals relative to a threshold. The maps are presented through a Web Map Service (WMS) to ensure interoperability with existing Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

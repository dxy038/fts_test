This study shows the feasibility of short pulse testing in a Reverberation Chamber (RC). The main objective of this study was to evaluate the use of a Reverberation Chamber as a High Power Microwave test facility. Current high power microwave sources generate very short pulses (less than 100 ns). Such pulses are not long enough to fill a RC completely and are therefore excluded by IEC-61000-4-21. This study shows that EMC testing is still possible with these short pulses and makes sense if no other pulse sources are available.

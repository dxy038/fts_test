A comparative study has been done in which a portion of an icon-based simulation program generator is implemented in each of four object-oriented programming languages that are available for MS-DOS and PC-DOS based personal computers. The languages studied are MODSIM II, Objective-C 4.0, Smalltalk/V 286, and Zoretch C++. These languages and versions of older languages produce code that runs much more quickly than code produced by earlier object-oriented programming languages, thereby eliminating much of the execution speed penalty commonly associated with object-oriented programming. The choice of which object-oriented language to use is dependent on the syntax one feels most comfortable with, the appropriateness to the job at hand of the classes in the libraries provided with the language, and the quality of support given by the programming environment supplied with the language

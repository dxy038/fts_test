In recent years a great effort has been made in studying many aspects related to modeling and design of ATIS, but a unified theory does not yet exist and there is no consensus on the objectives that can be achieved. This paper aims to show that the explicit modeling of the compliance as an endogenous variable depending on the information accuracy leads to the conclusion that the only objective worth pursuing (at least under recurrent conditions) is the provision of correct information, while the formulation of ATIS in the perspective of a system optimum is suitable only in cases where there is a not negligible incidence of non familiar travelers.

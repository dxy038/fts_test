Background: Availability of an accurate information system in recording and analysis of medical findings obtained from patients with cardiovascular diseases plays a crucial role in fighting cardiovascular diseases. One of the most important approaches in collecting such information is the classification system of cardiovascular diseases.
Objective: The main goal of this research was to provide effective strategies for establishing a national classification system for cardiovascular diseases in Iran through a comparative study of such national systems currently available in USA, Australia, Canada, and England. Methods: This was a descriptive-comparative study conducted during 2007-2008. The classification systems of cardiovascular diseases in USA, Australia, England and Canada were reviewed to provide an appropriate model for Iran. Data collection was performed through literature review, Internet and e-mails.
Findings: Our findings showed that all selected countries benefit a national classification system for cardiovascular diseases. At present, the systems named as ICD-10-CM in USA, ICD-10-AM in Australia, Rcc in England, ICD-10-CA in Canada, and ICD-10 in Iran are in use. This research attempted to discuss the advantages and the constraints of each system mentioned earlier. Conclusion: Considering our domestic needs, policies and health system priorities, establishing a national classification system for cardiovascular diseases seems to be necessary.

10000KN fine blanking presses is a kind of large-scale Forging equipment, which support immense pressure and stamping frequency in the process. The deformation and vibration of the fine blanking press frame have direct relationship with the tool life and the component precision. Therefore, the high structural stiffness and the good dynamic performance are predominant requirements for the reliability of the machine tool. To ensure the virtual prototype of the 10000KN fine blanking press frame meets the requirements in the best way, the paper starts from the concept design of the machine frame by the desired workspace dimensions. Then a single aim optimization method is used to find optimization parameters and the multi-objective optimization method is applied to get the global optimum which can satisfies both the stiffness of the press frame and the natural frequencies. At last, remodel the structure of the fine blanking press frame according to the result of topology optimization and ensure the feasibility of the manufacture, shape optimization is used to find the best structural parameters for the light weight design. The optimized prototype of fine blanking press frame can be applied to provide references for the machine manufacture.

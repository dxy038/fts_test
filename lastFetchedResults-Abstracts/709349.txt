The aim of this study was to assess the influence of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on chronic haemodialysis (HD) patientsâ€™ ability to achieve fluid intake related behavioural objectives. This one group before and after quasi-experiment consisted of a four-week base-line phase, a six-week intervention phase and a four-week follow-up phase. Interventions included self-contract, reinforcement and self-monitoring. Participants were 10 Japanese HD outpatients. The average achievement of the fluid intake objective in the intervention phase was 65%. Fifty percent of participants achieved their objectives at least  of the time without individualised reinforcement. CBT was effective in helping patients change their fluid intake behaviours.

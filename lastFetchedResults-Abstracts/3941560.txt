A conceptual framework for assessing scientific journal quality, both on intrinsic and on relative scales, is outlined. Several quantitative tools for objective estimation of relative quality are discussed, including volume use, citation analysis, quality sampling, and rejection rate analysis. The identification of factors that contribute to journal quality, and the implications for quality control, are briefly considered.

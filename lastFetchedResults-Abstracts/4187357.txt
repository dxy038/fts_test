Summary form only given. The evolution towards smaller slider form factors has challenged the head gimbal assembly (HGA) processes in many different ways such as head bonding and wiring. The flex-on-suspension (FOS) technology, which employs a microflex circuit for recording head interconnection, has been developed and proved many electrical and manufacturing advantages over the conventional wire interconnects. However, the effects of the flex on the dynamic characteristics of suspension have not been understood well. The objective of this paper is to investigate the dynamic characteristics of a flex suspension assembly (FSA) using tests and FE analysis.

In modern days, communication role of wireless device is picking place. With the advent of WSNÂ´s, the problem of battery life to enhance the lifetime is a significant challenge to overcome. Moreover heavy traffic load for packet transmission on the nodes closer to the sink also increase power consumption and reduce battery life. It is desired that the distance between the nodes and sink to be reduced. So reduction of delay and improvement in energy efficiency are the critical concern. The major objective behind the design is to keep the sensors operating for as long as possible by increasing lifetime of the network. The data collected by sensor nodes is forwarded to the sink, so therefore proper placement of sinks has a great impact on the performance of the WSN. Almost all applications of Wireless Sensor Network require the flow of sensed data from multiple sources to a sink. So, the optimal location of sink is an important topological consideration to minimize the energy consumption. This paper proposes a mechanism to improve and optimize the existing Multiple Sink placement strategy i.e. Geographic Sink Placement (GSP) strategy using network division in concentric circular rings around the central circular region where sinks placement is in uniform and random manner. It has been observed that the proposed strategies provide better performances with respect to energy usage and lifetime. The work is implemented in Matlab and simulation shows improved results in proposed strategies.

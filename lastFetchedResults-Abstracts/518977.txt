Background- Epidemiological evidence shows that among women the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), risk factors of cardiovascular disease, and mortality rate of AMI are different. The objective of this study was to compare the baseline characteristics, risk factors, medical care, and mortality of AMI between women and men. Methods- In this descriptive-analytical study, we examined data from medical charts and administrative files of patients that were hospitalized with AMI between 1994 and 2003 in Birjand hospitals. Questionnaires were completed by two educated nurses under the supervision of a cardiologist and the data were analyzed with SPSS software. Results- From 918 patients, 71.9% were male (M) and 28.1% were female (F). The women were older than the men (mean age 65.62 10.56yr in F vs. 58.98 12.11yr in M) and had a greater incidence of hypertension (50% in F vs. 24.6% in M, p<0.001) and diabetes mellitus (17% in F vs. 9.8% in M, p<0.006), but smoking was more common in the men (13.7% in F vs. 36.3% in M, p<0.001). Intra-hospital mortality was higher in the women but not significantly (10.4% in F vs. 8.6% in M, p=0.42). Fasting blood sugar (FBS), cholesterol level, and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were significantly higher amongst the women. Conclusion- Women with AMI had older age and higher incidence of diabetes and hypertension. Thus designing interventional programs for reducing these risk factors by education in women is needed (Iranian Heart Journal 2009; 10 (1):31-34).

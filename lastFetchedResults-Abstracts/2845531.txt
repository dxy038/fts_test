Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar is advantageous for target detection, parameters identification, and target classification due to waveform diversity and perspective. By taking the benefit of spatial diversity, MIMO radar system performance can be dramatically enhanced. In this paper, Space Time Coding (STC) is used to improve the target detection capability of coherent MIMO radar. Probability of Detection (PoD) vs Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is analyzed with STC through simulations. Then a comparison is made to show the better performance with STC. On the other hand different types of unwanted signals can interrupt the main signal at the receiving end. In this paper Space Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) is also applied to remove interrupting signals (noise, clutter and jammer). STAP algorithm forces the radar to operate at only one domain at a time: space for beam forming, fast time for matched filtering and slow time for doppler processing. STAP uses adaptive arrays that simultaneously process spatial and temporal data. The objective of this paper is to analyze the PoD and reduce interrupting signals for improving the radar detection performance by using STAP.

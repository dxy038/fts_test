In this paper, we investigate the capacity of multi-carrier modulation (MCM) system based on multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antennae for single user communications over the additive noise channel. We define a two variable energy spectrum function for each antenna which describes energy distribution in time-frequency-space (T-F-S) subchannels. The general wavelet packet basis functions are employed as sub-carrier to give more flexibility to partition of T-F plane compared with Inverse Fast Fourier Transform and Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT/FFT). The total energy and T-F space constraints are given. Under the prior information of additive noise energy distribution, the water-filling resolution is derived to obtain maximum objective capacity function. Furthermore, the optimal resource distribution in three dimensions space is obtained finally.

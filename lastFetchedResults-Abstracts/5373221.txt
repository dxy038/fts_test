Two industrial deployments of multi-criteria decision-making systems at General Electric are reviewed from the perspective of their multi-criteria decision-making component similarities and differences. The motivation is to present a framework for multi-criteria decision-making system development and deployment. The first deployment is a financial portfolio management system that integrates hybrid multi-objective optimization and interactive Pareto frontier decision-making techniques to optimally allocate financial assets while considering multiple measures of return and risk, and numerous regulatory constraints. The second deployment is a power plant management system that integrates predictive modeling based on neural networks, optimization based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, and automated decision-making based on Pareto frontier techniques. The integrated approach, embedded in a real-time plant optimization and control software environment dynamically optimizes emissions and efficiency while simultaneously meeting load demands and other operational constraints in a complex real-world power plant

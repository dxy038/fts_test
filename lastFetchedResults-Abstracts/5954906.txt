In this paper we make use of classical numerical optimization methods to design a second order band-pass continuous-time filter at 10.7 MHz in 0.35 mum CMOS technology. Our initial design is obtained using Level 1 MOSFET models whose parameter values are extracted from high-level models by numerical optimization. We then replace all transistors by Level 49 MOSFET models and re-optimize the frequency response of the filter using a multi-objective Euclidean formulation with a penalty function. Our methodology is simple and efficient, and can be implemented using readily available tools.

In this paper, adaptive speed control of a light weighted all-electric vehicle (EV) is presented for strict feedback form with unknown time delay. The EV is driven by DC motor. The unknown time delay has been compensated through the appropriately chosen Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. In present work, state feedback control is presented via backstepping, applied to a strict feedback form of the EV system. The controller singularity problem has been resolved by relaxing our control objective of convergence to a bounded region rather than the origin and assembling unknown parameters together. The proposed adaptive backstepping design has been proved that the output of the system to converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the origin. The new European driving cycle (NEDC) test is performed to test the control performance. Through simulation results the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme are shown.

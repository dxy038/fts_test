This paper discussed about design, fabrication and characterization of pH transducer on printed circuit board (PCB). The main objective is to explore the possibility of pH transducer by using interdigital capacitor (IDC) on PCB and to study the performance of interdigital capacitor on PCB. The transducer can be used to sense the pH value for a solution. The term interdigital refers to pattern of fingers that is resembled by the shape and relative position of the electrodes. This transducer was fabricated by using PCB in order to prepared a lower cost pH transducer compared to the commercialize pH transducer. In addition, the result produces the capacitance changes over the time is 0.0189 &#956;F/s. Moreover, the percentage of drift test is about 39.6% and the hysteresis is about 0.086&#956;F and 0.895 &#956;F. The results show that a good correlation coefficient was observed in sensitivity test. The correlation coefficient for sensitivity test is about 0.65. As long as the value of correlation coefficient is above 0.5 the transducer is good.

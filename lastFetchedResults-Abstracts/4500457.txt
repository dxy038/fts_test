This work considers the problem of optimizing sidelobe (SLL) and directivity (D) for concentric regular hexagonal antenna arrays (CRHAA). The relation between and SLL and D is generally considered to be convex. An objective vector comprising of functions of SLL and D is proposed. The aim is to compare the convergences of the obtained SLL - D fronts of two bi-objective vectors: i) {SLL,D}, and ii) the proposed bi-objective vector. For simplicity in pattern computation, the elements are considered to be ideal, without loss of generality. A popular multiobjective optimization algorithm, named MOEA/D is utilized to obtain the pareto optimal fronts for the considered objective vectors. Results reveal that, proposed objective vector outperforms the {SLL,D} objective vector.

Urodynamic pressure measurements using catheters have been widely used among clinicians. More often objective interpretation of urodynamic pressure measurements requires fundamental understanding of pressure measurement techniques due to many measurement artifacts. In this study we developed a simplified compound thick-walled cylinder model to investigate the mechanical nature of urodynamic pressure measurement as well as pressure transmission. Efficacy of collagen implantation was also explored. Lamé’s formulation was used to find analytical solutions. Pressure transmission can be related to catheter caliber and the compressibility of the urethral tissue (poisson ratio) in a simple mathematical form. The theoretical pressure transmission ratio will be 133% with the additional incompressibility assumption, reflecting the passive structural transmission of intraabdominal pressure increase. The relationship between the pressure measurement error and the catheter caliber was found to be linear (r2=0.94±0.04) and two or more pressure measurements need to be used to find the uninstrumented pressure. It was predicted that collagen implantation treatment might improve the pressuretransmission ratio maximally by 33%.

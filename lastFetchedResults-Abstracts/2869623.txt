The polarized hyperspectral remote sensing combines hyperspectral remote sensing with polarization. However, research on polarized hyperspectral remote sensing started late and the data is far from enough. This paper presents the simulation of a simple scene based on hyperspectral and polarized models, which consists of canopy and wall. When analyzing wallÂ´s secondary scattering effects to the surrounding canopy, the paper introduces a comprehensive analytical expression for Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) which includes specular, directional diffuse and uniform diffuse reflection and performs scene simulation with geometric model. The outcome of the paper will provide theoretical base for the more complex polarized hyperspectral scene simulating and modeling in the further research.

We consider a scenario where a wind farm is given a power set point below its actual power production capacity. The objective is to dynamically redistribute power in order to minimize the fatigue loads experienced by the turbines, while maintaining the desired power production at all times. We show that this can be done in a distributed way by coordinating neighboring turbines. The result is a control scheme where both the synthesis and the resulting control law only require each turbine to communicate with a limited set of neighboring turbines.

In this paper, the family of conditional minimum mean square error (MMSE) spectral estimators is studied which take on the form (E(XEalpha<sub>p</sub>/|X<sub>p</sub> + D<sub>p</sub>|))<sup>1</sup>alpha/, where X<sub>p</sub> is the clean speech spectrum, and D<sub>p</sub> is the noise spectrum, resulting in a generalized MMSE estimator (GMMSE). The degree of noise suppression versus musical tone artifacts of these estimators is studied. The tradeoffs in selection of (alpha), across noise spectral structure and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level, are also considered. Members of this family of estimators include the Ephraim-Malah (EM) amplitude estimator and, for high SNRs, the Wiener Filter. It is shown that the colorless residual noise observed in the EM estimator is a characteristic of this general family of estimators. An application of these estimators in an auditory enhancement scheme using the masking threshold of the human auditory system is formulated, resulting in the GMMSE-auditory masking threshold (AMT) enhancement method. Finally, a detailed evaluation of the proposed algorithms is performed over the phonetically balanced TIMIT database and the National Gallery of the Spoken Word (NGSW) audio archive using subjective and objective speech quality measures. Results show that the proposed GMMSE-AMT outperforms MMSE and log-MMSE enhancement methods using a detailed phoneme-based objective quality analysis

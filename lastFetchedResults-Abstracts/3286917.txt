In this paper wide-band modeling methodology of a parallel quasi-resonant dc link inverter (PQRDCLI) fed induction machine (IM) is presented. The modeling objective is early-design stage prediction of conductive electromagnetic interference (EMI) emissions of the considered converter fed IM drive system. Operation principles of the selected topology of PQRDCLI feeding IM drive are given. Modeling of the converter drive system is based on the partial-element equivalent circuit (PEEC) method. Component elements description with parasitic inductive and capacitive couplings and distribution of current flow trough connections (skin effects) and cables are included. Simulation study is carried out in the Saber/MAST programming environment with the aid of especially developed Matlab tool, enabling the PEEC matrix equations to be converted directly to the Saber@Sketch macrocomponents. Results of modeling and simulation are experimentally validated.

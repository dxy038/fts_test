Summary form only given. The objective of this study was to develop a just-in-time (JIT) model that would fit a sector of the chemical industry, namely, specialty chemicals. Applications of JIT in the chemical industry are very limited due to the sensitivity of the process itself. Implementation of this manufacturing technique has been mainly limited to inventory control and operation structure that include quality control, maintenance, warehousing and other sections of the organization. This study involved a specialty chemical company located in northeastern Ohio. The particular manufacturing plant that was studied was responsible for producing specialty additives that are used in the polymer industry throughout the world

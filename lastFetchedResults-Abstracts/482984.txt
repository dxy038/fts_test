In the present work, a thermoeconomical optimization approach is applied to a vapor compression refrigera足tion system. The cooling load and the outdoor and in足door temperatures are considered as constraints in this optimization procedure. Two optimization parameters are considered in this analysis. The first one is the dif足ference between condensation temperature and outdoor temperature, which fixes the condensation pressure. The difference between evaporation temperature and indoor temperature is considered as the second optimization pa足rameter, which, in turn, fixes the evaporation pressure. The objective function is a cost function, which is the sum of the exergy input costs and the capital costs. The analysis shows that optimum cycle parameters may be found by a trade-off between the compression cost and other costs, including those for heat exchangers, fans and the input power of the fans.

This paper addresses the energy-based localization problem in wireless sensor networks. The maximum likelihood (ML) location estimation problem is a difficult optimization problem due to the non-convexity of the objective function, and finding an exact solution is difficult. In this work, an approximate solution to the ML localization is presented, by relaxing the minimization problem into semidefinite programming form. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing solutions.

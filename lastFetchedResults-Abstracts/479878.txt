Background and Objective: Shift work is a major feature of working life that affects diverse aspects of human life. The objective of this study was to investigate shift work-related health problems and their associated risk factors among employees of petrochemical industries.
Subjects and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out at 14 petrochemical companies in 2009. Study population consisted of 2357 workers (including 43.7% shift workers and 56.3% day workers). Data on personal details, shift schedule and adverse effects of shift work were collected by anonymous questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 11.5. The level of significance was set at  < 5%.
Results: The mean of age in day workers and shift workers was estimated 36.26±8.20 and 34.96±8.08, respectively. Also, the mean of job tenure in both groups was estimated 10.83±7.50 and 10.15±7.55 years, respectively. Although, the results showed that health problems among shift workers was more prevalent than day workers, but the differences were only significant in relation to gastroi- ntestinal and psychological disorders (P < 0.05). Multiple linear regressions indicated that in addition to shift working, other variants such as long working hours, type of employment, second job, age and education were associated with health problems.
Conclusions: Prevalence rates of gastrointestinal and psychological problems among shift workers were significantly higher than those of day workers. Although, working in shift system was the main significant factor associated with the reported problems, other demographic and work variables were also found to have association.

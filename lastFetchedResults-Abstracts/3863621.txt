A new bidirectional wavelength-division-multiplexed radio-over-fiber system to simultaneously transmit both wired and wireless gigabit data is proposed. A Fabry-Perot laser diode is used as a multiwavelength optical source. Multimode injection locking technique is implemented to create single sideband carriers for several base stations. Reflective semiconductor optical amplifiers are used as modulators for both uplink and downlink. The experimental demonstration showed that bidirectional 1.25-Gbps wired and 15-GHz wireless data transmission with bit error rate (BER) &lt; 10<sup>-9</sup> for three channels after 23 km was accomplished. Moreover, mitigation of RF signal distortion due to chromatic-dispersion effect was observed.

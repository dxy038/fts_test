Although a number of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been proposed over the last two decades, very few studies have utilized MOEAs for game agent synthesis. Recently, we have suggested a co-evolutionary implementation using the Pareto evolutionary programming (PEP) algorithm. This paper describes a series of experiments using PEP for evolving artificial neural networks (ANNs) that act as game-playing agents. Three systems are compared: (i) a canonical PEP system, (ii) a co-evolving PEP system (PCEP) with 3 different setups, and (iii) a co-evolving PEP system that uses an archive (PCEP-A) with 3 different setups. The aim of this study is to provide insights on the effects of including co-evolutionary techniques on a MOEA by investigating and comparing these 3 different approaches in evolving intelligent agents as both first and second players in a deterministic zero-sum board game. The results indicate that the canonical PEP system outperformed both co-evolutionary PEP systems as it was able to evolve ANN agents with higher quality game-playing performance as both first and second game players. Hence, this study shows that a canonical MOEA without co-evolution is desirable for the synthesis of cognitive game AI agents

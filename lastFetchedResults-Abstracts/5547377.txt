3D video has received wide attention as next generation broadcasting system but still has some problems such as visual fatigue and headache. In this paper, we propose a smart stereo camera system based on visual fatigue factors. We classify visual fatigue factors into camera-based and contents-based factors. The proposed system minimizes camera-based visual fatigue factors by analyzing geometrical distortion between left and right cameras. Contents-based visual fatigue factors which reflect the characteristics of shooting scene are estimated by objective visual fatigue detection metric. The proposed system can provide the shooting guideline by indicating estimated visual fatigue level. It can help contents creator producing a comfortable stereoscopic video. Experimental results show that geometrical distortion minimization and visual fatigue monitoring are useful to produce a comfortable 3D contents.

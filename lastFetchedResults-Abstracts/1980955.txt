The objective of the present study was to evaluate the mycoflora and occurrence of aflatoxins in stored peanut samples (hulls and kernels) from Tupã, State of São Paulo, Brazil. The samples were analyzed monthly over a period of one year. The results showed a predominance of Fusarium spp. (67.7% in hulls and 25.8% in kernels) and Aspergillus spp. (10.3% in hulls and 21.8% in kernels), and the presence of five other genera. The growth of Aspergillus flavus was mainly influenced by temperature and relative humidity. Analysis of hulls showed that 6.7% of the samples were contaminated with AFB1 (mean levels = 15–23.9 μg/kg) and AFB2 (mean levels = 3.3–5.6 μg/kg); in kernels, 33.3% of the samples were contaminated with AFB1 (mean levels = 7.0–116 μg/kg) and 28.3% were contaminated with AFB2 (mean levels = 3.3–45.5 μg/kg). Analysis of the toxigenic potential revealed that 93.8% of the A. flavus strains isolated were producers of AFB1 and AFB2.

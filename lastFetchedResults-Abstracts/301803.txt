The development of gastric cancer is a multistep process that is multi-factorial. An association with the Helicobacter pylori infections, gastric atrophy and gastric cancer has received recent attention. The objective of this study was to elucidate the risk factors for gastric cancer by using molecular epidemiological techniques for genetic susceptibility, gastric atrophy and serum markers including H pylori infection. We used an age- and gender-matched case-control study, where patients with benign gastric lesions were the controls. Low serum pepsinogen I levels (cut-off < 50 ng/mL) and low pepsinogen I/pepsinogen II ratios (cut-off < 3.0) were significantly associated with the risk of gastric cancer (odds ratio [OR]= 3.53: 95% confidence interval [CI]= 2.46-5.09 and OR = 4.73: 3.26–6.88, respectively). However, seropositivity of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody against H pylori (OR = 1.09: 0.74–1.61) was not associated with gastric cancer, even when analyzed by age greater than or less than 50 years. Specific genotypes of the cytochrome p450 2E1 (CYP2E1) RsaI polymorphism and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) M1 gene deletion were determined but were not associated with gastric cancer; however, a L-myc genetic polymorphism was associated with gastric cancer (OR = 1.55: 1.03–2.34). Therefore, in this Japanese study, atrophic mucosal change, indicated by serum pepsinogen levels, is a possible risk factor for gastric cancer.

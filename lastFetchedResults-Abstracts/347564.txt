Objective: To test the hypothesis that ‘metabolites released during fatiguing muscle contractions excite group III–IV muscle nociceptive afferents, inhibiting homonymous motoneurones via Renshaw cells,’ by recording changes in recurrent inhibition of soleus motoneurones when high-threshold, small-diameter afferents (group III–IV fibres) from the same muscle were tonically activated.
Methods: Experiments were performed in 7 healthy subjects at rest and during weak isometric voluntary contraction of the soleus muscle. Muscle nociceptive afferents were activated by local standardized injection of levo-ascorbic acid. Renshaw cells were orthodromically activated by a conditioning H reflex and the resulting recurrent inhibition of the soleus motoneurones was assessed by a subsequent test H reflex. An additional H reflex of the same size as the test reflex was used to assess motoneurone excitability.
Results: At rest, muscle nociceptive stimulation produced transient facilitation of both test H and reference H reflexes. Under weak voluntary contraction, muscle nociceptive stimulation produced long-lasting extra-inhibition and extra-facilitation of the test reflex and reference reflex respectively, the time course of which closely resembled that of the subjective muscle pain curve.
Conclusions: Discharge of putative group III–IV muscle afferents facilitated homonymous recurrent inhibition. The filtering property of recurrent inhibition may contribute to limit motoneurone activity during muscle pain and/or adapt motoneurone firing rate to the modified contractile properties of motor units as muscle fatigue developed.

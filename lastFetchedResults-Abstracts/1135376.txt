This paper reports on a study on creep–fatigue crack growth resistance of a precipitation hardened 2650 T6 aluminium alloy selected for fuselage panels of a future civil supersonic aircraft. The objective is to develop a methodology to predict crack growth under very low frequency loading at elevated temperatures. With this aim, creep crack growth rates (CCGRs), fatigue crack growth rates (FCGRs), creep–fatigue crack growth rates (CFCGRs) have been measured at 130 °C and 175 °C in laboratory air and in vacuum at R = 0.5 under different load frequencies and waveshape signals. It is shown that, for a given temperature, CFCGRs are unaffected by frequency below a critical value of the load period Tc. Above this value CFCGRs are directly proportional to the load period. This time-dependent crack growth regime is assisted by a significant creep damage as indicated by the large amount of intergranular decohesions induced by cavitation on fracture surfaces. CFCGRs are calculated under the assumption that fatigue damage and creep damage can be linearly summed. In vacuum the predictions are in good agreement with experimental data at both temperatures. In air however a discrepancy is observed for low frequency loading, suggesting the occurrence of a creep–fatigue–environment interaction. As a consequence the time-dependent crack growth behaviour affected by this interaction is different from creep crack growth behaviour, although the reasons for this are still unclear. A methodology is then proposed to predict CFCGRs in air. This methodology, if assessed by very low frequency experimental results, could be extended to different structural components made of aluminium alloys operating at elevated temperatures, provided that the mechanisms are unchanged.

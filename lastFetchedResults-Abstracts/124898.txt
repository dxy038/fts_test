The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of whey powder supplementation as dietary component on body mass gain, feed conversion rate, amount of abdominal fat, feed intake and blood parameters in broilers. The experiment was conducted on 240 one day-old chickens (As hatched) through a 42-day period. Diets used in the present experiment were differentiated with regard to quantities of whey powder. Chicken was assigned randomly to one of three treatments: control and two diets including whey powder (2% and 4%). Body weight gain in the grower period was significantly (p<0.05) affected by increase in the whey powder (4%), but in the total period there were no effect of treatment on body weight gain. Feed convertion rate were lower significantly (p<0.05) for animals supplemented with whey powder than for control group. No significant differences were found in the amount of abdominal fat (and another carcass trait), feed intake and blood parameters of broilers given the different dietary treatments.

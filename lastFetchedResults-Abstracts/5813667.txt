Optimum location and size of capacitors for a distribution system under APDRP (Accelerated Power Development Programme) is presented. In the present study capacitor sizes are assumed as discrete known variables, which are to be placed on the buses such that it reduces the losses of the distribution system to a minimum. Genetic algorithm is used as an optimization tool, which obtains the optimal values and location of capacitors and minimizes the objective function, which is the power loss in the distribution network under study. A dedicated distribution system load flow is used to calculate power loss and voltage profile of the distribution system. Implementation aspects and important results for a 33 bus, 29 Indian power distribution system and practical 34 bus system have been presented to highlight the working of the algorithm.

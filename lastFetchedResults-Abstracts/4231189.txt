The objective of these new algorithms is to specify the means of reducing the vocoding conversions among different PLMN, PSTN and IP networks. This invention is one of the key enabler to the wireless VoIP application. VoIP is getting more and more momentum and is viewed as the future way of transporting voice. This new algorithm uses the integrated signaling among wireline and wireless (PSTN/PLMN, TDMA, GSM, CDMA, AMPS) networks so that wireless voice can be tunneled through different wireless system without any vocoding (except at the handset). This provides a means of efficient bandwidth, vocoding resources and potential delay management for wireless VoIP application. After the calling party dialed the digits, the signaling will be set up to notify the called party network that the call is on which wireless technology and how the network and handset will be handling the call. The called party network can have local storage media to load the vocoder driver if the software defined handset concept is adopted. As 3G is right around the corner, some features that could be supported by 3G are also discussed. For example, more efficient and intelligent interaction between the user and handset can be a reality now. The fundamental channel can be used to control the air-link resources and become more flexible and efficient.

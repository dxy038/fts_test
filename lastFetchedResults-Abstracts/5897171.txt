Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based simulation models have been used to automate lengthy building energy modeling processes and it enable fast acquisition of results. Recent improvements of simulation programs have continued to the increase in the use of energy simulation in sustainability studies at the earlier design stage. However, it is often difficult to leverage the full potential of BIM due to inadequate information exchange between BIM models and simulation programs. Ambiguous assumptions on many simulation parameter values could result in a significant chance of misunderstanding on the predicted energy performance. The main objective of this study is to identify the differences in energy simulation results between detailed simulation method (DOE 2.2 simulation engine) and BIM-based simulation method.

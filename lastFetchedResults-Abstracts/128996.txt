BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Atherosclerosis and its complications are a major cause of ischemic heart diseases. Platelets play an important role in initiation of atherosclerosis and coronary thrombus formation. Large platelets are shown to be hemostatically more active. Evaluation of platelet volume parameters could be useful and significant in prediction and differentiation of coronary events.
METHODS: In this study, 100 patients with chest pain were divided into three groups according to clinical manifestation and standard diagnostic criteria. Twenty-five patients were with unstable angina, twenty-five patients with chronic stable angina and fifty patients with non-cardiac chest pain as normal population. Platelet indices and count were assayed within 1 to 3 hours, after sampling from venous blood and collection in K3 EDTA, by a Sysmex KX21 analyzer. Data were provided for each group and surveyed by ANOVA & Tukey tests with Pearson correlation and P-value less than 0.05.
FINDINGS: Patients with unstable angina had a significant higher MPV (mean platelet volume) (10.7±0.23fl), PDW (platelet distribution width) and PLCR (platelet- lerge cell ratio) than those in chronic stable angina and normal group (p<0.05). MPV in chronic stable angina patients (10.1 ± 0.2 fl) was higher than normal population (9.5* 0.1 fl), but platelet count and other indices were not statistically significant difference. There were no sex or age differences in MPV amounts in population group.
CONCLUSION: Platelet volume indices are increased in unstable angina probably because of platelet activation and a compensatory volume enhancement. Platelets count reduction in this condition results from platelets consumption. These changes in platelet count and volume could differentiate unstable angina patients from chronic stable patients and normal individuals.

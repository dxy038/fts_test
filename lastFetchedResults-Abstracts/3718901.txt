This paper presents a bidirectional interactive contents player for terrestrial digital multimedia broadcasting (T-DMB). The presented player is capable of sending user requests to a proper return channel server using information included in a scene presentation. The player provides functionality to combine requested data received via communication networks with the initially broadcasted contents to present additional information to users. The result of a request transmitted back through the broadcasting network can also be presented properly using the presented player.

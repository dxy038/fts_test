Throughout the years many studies have explored the potential of Virtual Reality (VR) technologies to support collaborative work. However few studies looked into CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work) collaboration models that could help VR systems improve the support for collaborative tasks. This paper analyzes the applicability of the 3C collaboration model as a methodology to model and define collaborative tools in the development of a collaborative virtual reality application. A case study will be presented to illustrate the selection and evaluation of different tools that aim to support the actions of communication, cooperation and coordination between users that interact in a virtual environment. The main objective of this research is to show that the criteria defined by the 3C model can be mapped as a parameter for the classification of interactive tools used in the development of collaborative virtual environments.

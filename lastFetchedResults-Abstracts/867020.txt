The primary objective of this study is to develop a 3D model to determine the maximum allowable noise exposure time. This model allows the presence of multiple uncorrelated sources. The model provides an optimal arrangement for locating various machinery and equipment in the plant layout and also takes into consideration the acoustic characteristics of materials used in constructing the room. A detailed description of the models and results obtained will be presented and discussed.

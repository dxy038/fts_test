Background and Objective: Determination of hormone receptor status in the management of breast cancer is well-established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of androgen receptor (AR) expression in invasive ductal carcinoma of breast.
Materials and Methods: For this purpose, 55 cases of invasive ductal breast carcinoma were examined using a monoclonal antibody against AR on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival material. The results were correlated with the results of estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR) previously done immunohistochemically on the specimens.
Results: It was found out that AR was positive in 24 cases (43.6%). In addition, AR was positive in 33% (3) of grade 1,45% (16) of grade 2, and 38% (15) of grade 3 tumors. Previously, ER and PR were done on 34 cases including 5 grade 1, 18 grade 2, and 11 grade 3 carcinomas. Among the grade 1 cases, 2 out of them were AR positive which were also ER and PR positive but 2 (11%) out of grade 2 and 3 (27%) out of grade 3 tumors were AR positive and ER negative. Also, 5 (28%) out
of grade 2 and 3 (27%) out of grade 3 tumors were AR positive and PR negative. In grade 2 tumors, correlation between ER and PR negativity with AR positivity was significant.
Conclusion: AR expression is common in invasive breast carcinomas. Some high grade carcinomas are ER and PR negative and AR positive. We suggest that immunohistochemical evaluation of AR may help in providing more information about steroid receptors in breast carcinomas.

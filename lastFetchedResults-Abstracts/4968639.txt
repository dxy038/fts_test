Several routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks work efficiently only in bidirectional networks. Unidirectional links may exist in a real network due to variation in transmission power of different nodes, noise or other signal propagation phenomena, and heterogeneity in transmission hardware of nodes in the network. We introduce a sub-layer called Modified AODV (ad-hoc on demand distance vector) provide a bidirectional abstraction of the unidirectional network to the routing protocols. We present a scalable and efficient way to provide this abstraction by finding and maintaining multi-hop reverse routes to each unidirectional link. We simulate modified AODV and to route packets in unidirectional network. We observed that with modified AODV, the packet delivery of AODV in unidirectional networks increases substantially. Further our simulations indicate that reverse routes are often only a few hops long and hence the overhead of using modified AODV is very low.

A three-phase ac to dc converter employing a new control scheme is presented. Only four power switches and two current sensors are required in this system. By using the proposed control scheme, just two of the switches are active to approach the desired waveform at any timer, hence the switching numbers can be reduced, compared with the conventional six switches converter. Furthermore, the local average method is presented to verify that the instantaneous power between ac source and dc source is balanced. Finally, simulated and experimental results are presented to verify the characteristics of unity power factor, sinusoidal input current, and bidirectional power flow capability

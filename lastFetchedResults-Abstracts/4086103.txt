The authors present a novel approach to studying the automatic contingency selection (ACS). The total curtailment of the reactive loads is used as the performance index to evaluate the severity of contingencies. The minimum cost network flow model is proposed to determine the optimal curtailment in the line outage case. The objective of the model is the determination of the sum of branch voltage drops in terms of the line reactive flows. The optimisation model is solved by the out-of-kilter algorithm. The numerical results for several IEEE sample systems show that the proposed technique is feasible and effective

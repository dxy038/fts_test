Objective: Endometriosis is a complex gynecologic disorder that may display features similar to malignancy, including aggressive growth and localized invasion of the myometrium or spread to various organs outside the uterus. Molecular studies of cancer have demonstrated that genomic instability involving chromosome 17 plays a role in the development and progression of various tumor types. These involve gain and/or loss, deletions, and mutations of candidate tumor suppressor genes (eg, BRCA1 and p53 ) on chromosome 17. Study Design: We used a 2-color fluorescence in situ hybridization method for analysis of endometriotic and normal archival tissue. Centromere-specific and locus-specific p53 probes localized to chromosome 17 were selected to study 8 patients with late-stage (severe) endometriosis. Single cells localized to endometriotic lesions or normal endometrial glands were analyzed and identified as normal or abnormal on the basis of the distribution of fluorescence in situ hybridization signals. Results: Overall, chromosome 17 aneuploidy was significantly greater (P< .05) in the endometriosis specimens (mean of 65%) than in normal endometrial cells (mean of 25%). No significant difference (P = .1071) in the distribution of fluorescence in situ hybridization signals was observed among the 5 normal endometrial specimens. However, significant differences (P< .0001) were observed between the 8 endometriosis tissue specimens. Conclusion: We found increased heterogeneity of chromosome 17 aneuploidy in endometriosis. These findings support a multistep pathway involving somatic genetic alterations in the development and progression of this common disease. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;180:792-7.)

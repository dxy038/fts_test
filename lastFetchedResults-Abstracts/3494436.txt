Business process management systems traditionally focused on supporting the modeling and automation of business processes, with the objective of enabling fast and cost-effective process execution. As more and more processes become automated, customers become increasingly interested in managing process execution. This paper presents a set of concepts and a methodology toward business process intelligence (BPI) using dynamic process performance evaluation, including measurement models based on activity-based management (ABM) and a dynamic enterprise process performance evaluation methodology. The proposed measurement models support the analysis of six process flows within a manufacturing enterprise including <i>activity</i> <i>flow</i>, <i>information</i> <i>flow</i>, <i>resource</i> <i>flow</i>, <i>cost</i> <i>flow</i>, <i>cash</i> <i>flow</i>, and <i>profit</i> <i>flow</i>, which are crucial for enterprise managers to control the process execution quality and detect problems and areas for improvements. The proposed process performance evaluation methodology uses <i>time</i>, <i>quality</i>, <i>service</i>, <i>cost</i>, <i>speed</i>, <i>efficiency</i>, and <i>importance</i> as seven evaluation criteria. A prototype system supporting dynamic enterprise process modeling, analysis of six process flows, and process performance prediction has been implemented to validate the proposed methodology.

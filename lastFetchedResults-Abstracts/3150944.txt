Three tank system can be adapted to emulate many systems in process and aerospace industry. This paper presents synthesis of LMI based H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controller for uncertain three tank system. Uncertainties in parameters can arise due to imperfect knowledge of physical parametric values or from variations of these parameters during operation. A linearized affine dynamical model is derived with uncertain flow coefficients as varying parameters. H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controller is designed with multi-objective approach using derived affine model. Simulations are also carried out to assess the performance of controller against parametric variations/uncertainties simultaneously in the presence of input disturbances. The performance of designed controllers is compared with PI controller.

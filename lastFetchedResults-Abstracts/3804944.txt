In this paper, different methods for the evaluation of building detection algorithms are compared. Whereas pixel-based evaluation gives estimates of the area that is correctly classified, the results are distorted by errors at the building outlines. These distortions are potentially in an order of 30%. Object-based evaluation techniques are less affected by such errors. However, the performance metrics thus delivered are sometimes considered to be less objective, because the definition of a ldquocorrect detectionrdquo is not unique. Based on a critical review of existing performance metrics, selected methods for the evaluation of building detection results are presented. These methods are used to evaluate the results of two different building detection algorithms in two test sites. A comparison of the evaluation techniques shows that they highlight different properties of the building detection results. As a consequence, a comprehensive evaluation strategy involving quality metrics derived by different methods is proposed.

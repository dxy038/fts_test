This paper propose an improved image filtering algorithm which is based on median filteringing algorithm and medium filteringing algorithm according to the simpleness of median filteringing algorithm and the significant denoising effect of medium filteringing algorithm. The new algorithm combines the two algorithms and thus gets a better filtering effect. We did the simulation using MATLAB, and then did the objective evaluation using the classical method PSNR. Simulation results showed that the new algorithm has a better denoising effect than the medium filteringing algorithm and reduces the denoising time as well. Thus the improved algorithm has a better practicalility.

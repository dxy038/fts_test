Objective(s): Predegeneration is a standard technique to obtain mitotically activated and enriched cultures of Schwann cells (SCs). This study, for the first time, evaluated the impact of various duration of predegeneration on cell yield and enrichment of SCs from dog peripheral nerve. Materials and Methods: Dog sural nerves were subjected to 5, 10, 15 day-long in vitro predegeneration. The total cell yield and the purity of SCs were evaluated in each group on the first and seventh day after plating. Results: The maximum and minimum numbers of cells were counted in 15 day-long predegene-ration and control groups which underwent no predegeneration. The 10 day-long in vitro predegeneration group with 80Â±0.5% SCs enrichment had the best purity after plating day and could maintain its purity with elapsing on cultures. Conclusion: 10 day-long predegeneration results in the higher cell number and the better and prolonged purity of SCs in culture.

BDI (belief, desire, intention) is the theoretic model of agent, this paper will introduce some non-normal modal operators for the study of the BDI semantic, which are unknown-objective-belief, known-objective-belief, realizable-subjective-belief, known-subjective-belief, h-achieved-desire and u-achieved-desire. And there is no logical omniscience problem that usually exists in the normal modal logic, and the BDI model will be evolving.

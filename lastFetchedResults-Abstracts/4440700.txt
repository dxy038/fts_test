Psaraftis,<br/>in Marine Technology, Vol. 46, No 1, Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers (SNAME), January 2009<br/><br/>The Ship Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) is the premier scientific method that is currently being used for the analysis of maritime safety and the recommendations of concerned regulatory policy. This paper conducts an overview of the FSA methodology and proposes ways to improve it. The applications of both quantitative risk analysis (QRA) and risk-based decision making techniques were discussed, and possible pitfalls or other deficiencies are identified. Then proposals of relative risk assessment methodology are made to alleviate such deficiencies, with a view to achieve a more transparent and objective approach. The results of this paper may be useful if a revision of the FSA tools is contemplated along these discussions.

Since the implementation of the very first intelligent network platforms in the USA in the 1980s and in Europe in the early 1990s, manufacturers invested much effort and allocated many resources to develop and to support service-independent building block (SIB)-based service design tools, and thus to comply with ITU-T, ETSI CS-x and Bellcore standards. Siemens will introduce and market in 2001 a new version of its IN product under the brand name @vantage. Among the numerous innovations a service feature concept will revolutionize service creation processes. The objective of this new service feature concept is to replace regular SIB-based service implementations by reproducing those SIB functionalities on a higher level. The service feature concept will allow us to cut back costs in service development and test, reduce time to market by speeding up the service creation process through all phases and enhance service quality

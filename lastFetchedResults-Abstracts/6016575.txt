In this paper a new methodology is proposed to optimize placement of Hybrid PV-Wind-Storage System. The PV-Wind power output model and the charging and discharging of battery model are presented by analyzing output characteristics of devices of the power station. This method builds the model of the placement of PV-Wind-Storage Hybrid System, and takes the annual average net income as the object function, puts the region and area characteristics, planned scale, the complementary property, the utilization ratio of resources and output stability as constrains. The simulation result shows the feasibility and reliability of this method. The model is more accurate, considering the emissions trading income as one of the annual average net income objective functions. moreover, the optimal result is more valuable.

In this article, the author tries to discuss ‘mystical wayfaring’ in Mulla Sadra and Allamah Tabataba’i’s thoughts. The main objective of the present study is to outline the Allamah’s innovations in the issue, on the basis of the theoretical grounds of his philosophy. Mulla Sadra arranges his al-Asfar al-Arba‘ah (Four Intellectual Journeys) in line with mystical teachings of Ibn ‘Arabi and in particular man’s four journeys for wayfaring in Divine truths. He tries to provide a philosophical interpretation of man’s mystical wayfaring in his path towards Allah. He believes that the end of mystical wayfaring is to come to the sphere of existence on the basis of knowledge and theoretical hikmah; and speaks of Divine proximity within this very paradigm, though he considers it as something marginal to theoretical hikmah and ontological issues. Proving personal unity of existence, based on his own principles, Allamah Tabataba’i, delicately, changes Mulla Sadra’s plan; in his philosophy, mystical wayfaring is realized to approach to the absolute reality and Divine proximity, without intermediates mentioned by Mulla Sadra.

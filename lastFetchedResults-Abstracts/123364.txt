Background & Objective: Five percent of maternal mortality in the first trimester of pregnancy is due to ectopic pregnancy (EP). The objective of this study is to determine the incidence of EP during the years 1374 to 1378 in Motazedi hospital of Kermanshah, Materials and Methods: This descriptive study was based on records of pregnant women in Motazedi hospital of Kermanshah. Definitive diagnosis of EP was made by laparatomy findings. The incidence rate was expressed per 1000 pregnancies including vaginal or cesarean section deliveries, abortion or EP in each year and total EPs in of years. Risk factors, signs and symptoms were also determined.
Results: Total incidence of EP was 2.45 per 1000 pregnancies. Annual incidence rates increased during the years 1374 to 1378. The most frequent signs of EP were abdominal pain (992%), abnormal uterine bleeding (70.2%), and gastrointestinal problems (38.3%). The most frequent symptoms were abdominal tenderness (92.2%), painful cervix (70.2%) and painful adenexa (46.8%). There was no risk factor in 24% of patients but 22.7% of patients had more than one risk factor. Infertility was the most frequent risk factor. The tube was the most frequent site of EP.
Discussion: Pattern of distribution of sexually transmitted diseases and low rate of use of assisted reproductive techniques may be the causes of low incidence of EP in Kermanshah. Our study showed the increase in incidence rates of EP, which needs to be evaluated in future studies.

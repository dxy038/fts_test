In this paper, we are interested in determining a maintenance policy with an optimal cost to enable the company to generate significant profits, often the means of transport travelled different paths, they are characterized by their distance flown; however each distance has an effect on the operating characteristics of means of delivery. The objective of this paper is twofold: It aims both to introduce the model of supply chain and specify distances and codify for use it in the proportional hazard model, after presented a maintenance policy taking into consideration the types of paths travelled by the means of delivery.

A novel probabilistic algorithm, called the probabilistic rejectionless anti-voter (PRAV) algorithm, is introduced. Due to its property of concentrating computational efforts on places where there are the greatest chances of the improvement of an objective function and due to the rejectionless mechanism used, a significant speed-up over other probabilistic methods is achieved. The extensive superior experimental results with respect to simulated annealing on both generic NP-complete problems and high level synthesis tasks are presented and statistically analyzed. The problems discussed include a novel application of commutativity for design improvement. In addition, the proof of convergence is presented

Objective: In recent years, composite scaffolds made of polymers and bioactive ceramics have found numerous applications in bone tissue engineering due to their superior properties. Among various polymers, chitosan (Cs) and gelatin (Gel) gained more attention because of their desirable properties. In this study, by using these two polymers and hydroxyapatite (HA) which resembles inorganic phase of human bone, three-dimensional composite scaffolds were prepared by freeze-drying method and behavior of osteoblast cells on them was evaluated. Thisstudy aimed at preparing an appropriate bioactive scaffold for bone tissue engineering.
Methods: In order to evaluate the effect of gelatin concentration onbiological properties of scaffolds, three different concentrations of gelatin (0,10, and 20%) were added to composite scaffolds. For assessment of the biological properties of scaffolds, osteoblast cells were cultured on the composite scaffolds and their behavior was monitored. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)analysis and alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) test were carried out to assess the mentioned factors
Results: SEM analysis showed high cell attachment and proliferation on the scaffolds. Alkaline phosphatase activity of osteoblast cells indicated the suitability of composite scaffolds containing a higher concentration of gelatin compared to other concentrations as well as overall high activity of osteoblast cells on all scaffolds.
Conclusion: Cs/Gel/HA bioactive composite scaffold is recommended for bone tissue regeneration purposes as a suitable scaffold.

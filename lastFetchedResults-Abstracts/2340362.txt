Upper stage solid rocket motors (SRMS) for launch vehicles require a highly efficient propulsion system. Grain design proves to be vital in terms of minimizing inert mass by adopting a high volumetric efficiency with minimum possible sliver. In this article, a methodology has been presented for designing three-dimensional (3D) grain configuration of radial slot for upper stage solid rocket motors. The design process involves parametric modeling of the geometry in computer aided design (CAD) software through dynamic variables that define the complex configuration. Grain burn back is achieved by making new surfaces at each web increment and calculating geometrical properties at each step. Geometrical calculations are based on volume and change-in-volume calculations. Equilibrium pressure method is used to calculate the internal ballistics. Genetic algorithm (GA) has been used as the optimizer because of its robustness and efficient capacity to explore the design space for global optimum solution and eliminate the requirement of an initial guess. Average thrust maximization under design constraints is the objective function.

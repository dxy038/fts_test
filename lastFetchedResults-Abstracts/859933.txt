This paper deals with the development of decomposition of domains methods related to the discretization, by collocation-interpolation methods, of continuous models described by nonlinear partial differential equations. The objective of this paper is to show how generalized collocation and domain decomposition methods can be applied for problems where different models are used within the same domain.

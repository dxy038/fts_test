In this paper, a novel algorithm named Sparsity-based Wiener plus Dictionary Learning (SWDL) is proposed for single channel speech enhancement. SWDL combines both Wiener filter and dictionary learning technique. The Wiener filter is used to ensure the enhanced speech is statistically optimal, while the dictionary learning technique is used to improve the enhanced speech quality and intelligibility by utilizing speech-specific information. Such information is incorporated in the pre-trained speech dictionary that can sparsely represent the clean speech spectra. When applied to the TIM-IT database, SWDL outperforms the Log Mean Square-Error Short-Time Spectra Amplitude estimator (LSTSA) according to four different objective metrics measuring speech quality and intelligibility. Subjective tests also show that SWDL produces better speech quality and intelligibility than LSTSA.

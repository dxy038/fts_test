In this paper, a grey polynomial interpolation (GPI) is developed and applied to reduce the block effect in low bit rate coding. The proposed approach consists of three stages: First, the input image is down sampled to reduce the amount of data. Second, the down sampled image is put into an image coder, such as the JPEG. Finally, the GPI is applied to enlarge the reconstructed image. Examples with the JPEG are provided to verify the proposed approach. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is able to effectively reduce the block effect in low bit rate coding of JPEG. Also, both subjective and objective assessments are improved in the given examples.

In recent past, researchers have suggested the idea of extending information theory to the microfluidic domain. Along this stream, a few solutions have been proposed to support logic and computing functions as well as simple communications in droplet-based microfluidic systems. Of course, pursuing this objective, requires a deep knowledge of microfluidic basics and relies on the use of an appropriate information coding strategy. Accordingly, in this paper we introduce a possible scheme for information coding in microfluidic devices, evaluate its performance by means of some preliminary experimental results and draw a number of considerations.

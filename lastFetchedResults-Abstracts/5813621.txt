In the era of computer and communication technologies, strengthening students´ high-level thinking abilities has become an important educational objective nowadays. Among various learning strategies, inquiry-based learning has been recognized as being a helpful approach for training the thinking process of students. In this study, the effects of integrating the STS (Science/Technology/Society) strategy into online inquiry-based learning activities on students´ learning achievement and attitude ability are investigated. The participants were divided into an experimental group, which learned with online STS-oriented inquiry learning approach in a science classroom, and control group, which learned with conventional in-class online inquiry learning approach. From the experimental results, it is found that the experimental group reveals better learning achievement and learning attitude than the control group, showing the effectiveness of the innovative approach.

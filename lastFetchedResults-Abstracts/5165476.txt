The paper presents a testbed for native IPv6 multicast and tries to evaluate the available routing protocols such as PIM-DM and PIM-SM. From an objective perspective we can measure the join latency, as well as multicast forwarding delay, its jitter and the control overhead. Having a calibrated software tool, we can evaluate later the existing alternative solution towards IPv6 multicast: CastGate and CastGate router. The proposed enhancements are referring to PIM-SM support and to the possibility of migrating from IPv4 to IPv6 on CastGate architectures

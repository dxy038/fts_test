Objective: To examine the relation between serum cholesterol and coronary artery disease prevalence below the range of cholesterol values generally observed in developed countries. Design and Setting: Cross-sectional survey of two randomly selected villages from Moradabad district and 20 randomly selected streets in the city of Moradabad. Subjects and methods: 3575 Indians, aged 25â€“64 years including 1769 rural (894 men, 875 women) and 1806 urban (904 men, 902 women) subjects. The survey methods were questionnaires, physical examination and electrocardiography. Results: The overall prevalences of coronary artery disease were 9.0% in urban and 3.3% in rural subjects and the prevalences were significantly (P<0.001) higher in men compared to women in both urban (11.0 vs. 6.9%) and rural subjects (3.9 vs. 2.6%). The average serum cholesterol concentrations were 4.91 mmol/l in urban and 4.22 mmol/l in rural subjects without any sex differences. The prevalences of coronary artery disease were significantly higher among subjects with low and high serum cholesterol concentration compared to subjects with very low cholesterol and showed a positive relation with serum cholesterol within the range of serum cholesterol level studied in both rural and urban in both sexes. Among subjects with low serum cholesterol, there was a higher prevalence of coronary risk factors, hypertension, diabetes, obesity and sedentary lifestyle. Serum cholesterol level showed a significant positive relation with low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides in all the four subgroups. Logistic regression analysis after pooling of data from both rural and urban, with adjustment of age showed that low serum cholesterol level (odds ratio: men 0.96, women 0.91) had a positive strong relation with coronary artery disease and there was no evidence of any threshold. Diabetes mellitus (men 0.73, women 0.74) and sedentary lifestyle (men 0.86, women 0.74) were significant risk factors of coronary disease in both sexes. Hypertension (men 0.82, women 0.64) and smoking (men 0.81, women 0.52) were weakly associated with coronary disease in men but not in women. Conclusion: Serum cholesterol level was directly related to prevalence of coronary artery disease even in those with low cholesterol concentration (<5.18 mmol/l). It is possible that some Indian populations may benefit by increased physical activity and decline in serum cholesterol below the range of desired serum cholesterol in developed countries.

The classical solution for collecting data from energy meters, based on displacements of peoples, tends to be replaced by modern solutions: drive-by and Automated Meter Reading (AMR). AMR means to automatically collect data from meters and send them to a central computer. An Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is an AMR infrastructure with bidirectional smart meters - gateway communication, this leading to extra facilities. This paper describes an AMI based system. Smart meters are connected to a gateway through power lines and the gateway communicates with a central computer through GSM. The power line communication is implemented with an industrial bus, LonWork. The paper focuses the data collection solution.

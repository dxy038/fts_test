Background and Objective: Whereas the available synthetic analgesic drugs have side effects, it seems tobe logical to using herbal medicines with few side effects. The purpose of this study was the evaluation of analgesic effect of hydroalcoholic extract of ficuscarica leaf and comparing it with morphine and aspirin.
Materials and Methods: This study was done on male rats of Wistar species. The animals were divided into nine groups (n= 6 rats). A negative control group received a single intraperitoneal dose of normal saline (5ml/kg). Two positive control groups received morphine (2.5 mg/kg) and aspirin (300 mg/kg) intraperitoneally, respectively. Five treatment groups received a single intraperitoneal dose of 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 mg/kg of hydroalcoholic extract of Ficuscarica leaves, and a group received hydroalcoholic extract (800mg/kg) with naloxon (1mg/kg). In this study, the analgesic effects were investigated via formalin test.
Results: The results showed that the 600, 800, 1000 mg/kg of extract had analgesic effects significantly different in comparison with negative control group. Our results showed that the analgesic effect (800 mg/kg) was less than aspirin on the second phase of pain and morphine on both pain phases. Naloxone could reduce the analgesic effect of extract on the second phase of pain.  
Conclusion: The hydroalcoholic extract of Ficuscarica leaf contains analgesic effects in both pain phases. It can be concluded that Ficuscarica leaf extract may induce its effect through opioid receptors activation.

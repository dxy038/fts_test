The author comments on electromagnetic fundamentals discussed by J.C.G. Field (see ibid., vol.135, no.8, p.527-7). He suggests that the author has not dealt in sufficient depth with the question of the ´suppression of dimensions´ and the effect of this on teaching. In his reply, J.C.G. Field argues that the basic objective of his paper was limited to putting forward the case for more appropriate terminology in current literature; his attempt at summarising the underlaying physics was therefore made as brief as possible.

The existence of rival models of the same macroeconomic system is well known. In this paper, the basic policy optimization problem is extended to take account of rival models. A min-max problem is introduced and subsequently reformulated as that of the minimization of the "worst" convex combination of the objective functions of the rival models. This yields a saddle-point problem. A Newton-type algorithm is proposed for its solution. The algorithm requires the solution of a quadratic subproblem. The proposed range-space based quadratic programming algorithm for the latter utilizes the fact that the models, and thereby constraints, are far fewer than the number of variables.

    The objective of this study was to show the effect of silymarin on peritoneal adhesions in dog. Ten adult male and female dogs were divided into two equal groups randomly: control and intraperitoneal silymarin. A 10-cm midline laparotomy incision was made in all dogs. After entrotomy, the abdominal wall incision was sutured. Re-laparotomy was performed on the 30th postoperative day and adhesion formation was macroscopically graded according to the Nair classification and Adachi classification. Serum malondialdehyde and total antioxidant activity were determined. Adhesion scores in silymarin group were significantly (p < 0.05) greater than control group. The adhesion formation in silymarin group was more extensive and denser than control group. Silymarin might not be absorbed from the peritoneal cavity and act as a foreign substance. The serum concentration of malondialdehyde and total antioxidant activity was not different between control and silymarin groups significantly. Thus, silymarin does not have any benefitial effect on peritoneal adhesions, in local administration.

Designing a promising online broadcast scheduling algorithm is a necessity in any disseminate-based system. Nevertheless, without having a well-designed and robust offline algorithm, no good and comparable online algorithm emerges. In this paper, we propose both offline and online broadcast scheduling algorithms with throughput maximization objective while our application in-hand is a file broadcast. Both algorithms are analytically evaluated. Besides, partial file requests are allowed and implemented. Afterwards, for a file broadcast system based on mobile WiMAX network a simulation is conducted. Simulation results using NS-3 simulator reveal better throughput for online proposed algorithm compared to three other implemented ones. Furthermore, comparing the proposed online algorithm with its offline version shows acceptable level of performance for online algorithm.

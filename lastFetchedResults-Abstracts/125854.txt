Introduction: There are many methods for treatment of patients with unexplained infertility. The easiest method is induction of ovulation and the most commonly used drug for induction of ovulation is Clomiphen Citrate.
Objective: This study was carried out to compare the efficacy of different methods of Clomiphen Citrate administration for induction of ovulation.
Materials and Methods: This is a randomized clinical trial performed on 60 cases with unexplained infertility in Mirzakoochakkhan Hospital of Tehran from September 23, 2001 to March 20, 2003. Patients were divided into three groups with 20 cases in each group. All three groups were treated with Clomiphen Citrate 100 mg/d. In group A, 100 mg of Clomiphen Citrate was given for the first 5 days of the cycle and in group B on days 3-7 and in group C on days 5-9.
Results: The results showed no significant differences in age, parity, duration of infertility, weight or endometrial pattern in the three groups.
The mean follicles number in group A was 2± 0.85, in group B 2.25± 0.9 and in group C 1.1* 0.8. There was signiticant difference between three groups. We observed 2 pregnancy cases in group A, 4 pregnancies in group B and 1 pregnancy in group C.
No differences in the mean serum progestrone levels in mid - luteal phase were detected between the three groups.
Conclusion: Considering the results obtained, it appears that administration of Clomiphen Citrate on days 3-7 exert the best impact on the folicle number and pregnancy rate.

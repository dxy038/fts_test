An algorithm is presented for stabilizing a linear multivariable system with a controller of fixed dynamic order. This is an output feedback stabilization problem. The algorithm attempts to solve this by a sequence of approximate pole assignment problems. The approximation is driven by the optimization of an objective function consisting of a weighted sum of the condition number of the closed-loop eigenvectors and the norm of the difference between the computed and actual equivalent state-feedback controls

As recently seen in GoogleÂ´s Gmail, the messages in inbox are classified into primary, social and promotions, which makes it easy for the users to differentiate the messages which they are looking for from the bulk of messages. Similarly, a users wall in facebook is usually flooded with huge amount of data which makes it annoying for the users to view the important news feeds among the rest. Thus we aim to focuses on classification of facebook news feeds. In this paper, we attempt to classify the users news feeds into various categories using classifiers to provide a better representation of data on users wall. News feeds collected from facebook are dynamically classified into various classes such as friends posts and liked pages posts. Friends posts are further categorized into life events posts and entertainment posts. Posts or updates from pages which are liked by the users are grouped as liked pages posts. Posts from friends are tagged as friends posts and those regarding the events occurring in their lives are said to be life event posts and the rest are tagged as entertainment posts. This helps users to find &#8220;important news feeds&#8221; from &#8220;live news feeds&#8221;. Sentiments are important as they depict the opinions and expressions of the user. Hence, detecting the sentiments of users from the life event posts also becomes an essential task. We also propose a system for automatic detection of sentiments from the life event posts and categorize based on sentiments into happy, neutral and bad feelings posts. This paper looks towards applying the classification methods from the literature to our dataset with the objective of evaluating methods of automatic news feeds classification and sentiment analysis which in future can provide facebook page a well organized and more appealing look.

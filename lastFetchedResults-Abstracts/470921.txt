Objective
Women who develop pre-eclampsia show significantly less hypervolemia of pregnancy, compared with controls. We have shown that chronically elevated angiotensinogen expression increases a woman's risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Our objective was to determine whether increased angiotensinogen expression is sufficient to cause failed hypervolemia.
Study design
To isolate the effects of elevated angiotensinogen expression, we studied transgenic mice with either 2 or 3 copies of the murine angiotensinogen gene. Plasma volume was measured by Evans blue dye dilution, and kidney sections were immunostained for angiotensinogen and renin.
Results
Three-copy mice failed to maintain hypervolemia after midgestation (P< .01) and failed to up-regulate renin expression in the distal nephron, compared with 2-copy controls. Intrarenal angiotensinogen was up-regulated during pregnancy in both genotypes.
Conclusion
Chronically elevated angiotensinogen expression is sufficient to cause failed hypervolemia of pregnancy. Whether this observation is related to failed up-regulation of distal tubule renin expression requires further study.

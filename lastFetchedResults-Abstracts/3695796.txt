The objective of the hydrogen reformer process is to produce hydrogen by catalysis from desulphurised hydrocarbons. The controller to be designed is the fuel flow controller, whose main objective is to maintain the reformer at a constant temperature despite important variations in the temperature of the input steam. With the proposed controller the simulation demonstrates that the output temperature variation can be reduced to /spl plusmn/1/spl middot/2/spl deg/C, compared with /spl plusmn/1/spl middot/8/spl deg/C using the more traditional PID controller installed in the plant.

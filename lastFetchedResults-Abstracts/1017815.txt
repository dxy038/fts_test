Objective (s): Obesity is one of the primary risk factors in cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The purpose of this study was to determine the anthropometric indices associated with CVD risk factors.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 991 men and 1188 women aged 15 to 64 years. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and percentage of body fat were measured. CVD risk factors, including fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol (Tchol), low-density (LDL-C) and high density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were assessed.
Results: Using multiple regression analysis, BMI, WHtR and WHR explained the highest percentage of variation of triglycerides, Tchol/HDL-C ratio and LDL-C in men, respectively, whereas WHR explained the highest percentage of variation of triglycerides and WC explained the highest percentage of variation of Tchol/HDL-C ratio and LDL-C in women.
Conclusion: The findings indicated that WHR and WHtR best predicted CVD risk factors in men and WHR and WC in women. Indeed the determined anthropometrics might be considered for predicting cardiovascular risk factors among Iranian urban populations.

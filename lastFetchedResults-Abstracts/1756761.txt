Objective
rpose of this study was to examine the influence of attachment, social support and the quality of the current partnership on the outcome of bereavement after perinatal loss.
s
rospective cohort design 33 women after perinatal loss were approached on admission to hospital and reassessed four weeks, four months and nine months later. The initial assessment included the Adult Attachment Interview and self-report questionnaires for social support and quality of the current partnership. Bereavement outcome was assessed using measures of grief (MTS), depression and anxiety (HADS), psychological distress (BSI), somatisation (BSI-SOM) and symptoms of PTSD (PDS).
s
asures of outcome showed a significant improvement over time. Standardized effect sizes between the initial assessment and nine month follow-up ranged between .36 for anxiety (HADS) and 1.02 for grief (MTS). Social support, quality of the partnership and secure attachment correlated inversely, and insecure preoccupied attachment correlated positively with the outcome measures. Preoccupied attachment was included as a predictor in two multivariate statistical models of non-linear regression analysis, one with somatisation (adjusted R2 = .698, P = .016), the other with posttraumatic stress symptoms at nine month follow-up (adjusted R2 = .416, P = .002) as target variable. Initial assessment scores of psychological distress predicted the course of the respective measure during follow-up (adjusted R2 = .432, P = .014).
sion
ment, social support and the quality of the current partnership have an impact on the course of bereavement after perinatal loss. Secondary prevention after the event may focus on these factors in order to offer specific counselling and support.

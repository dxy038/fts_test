The objective of the present experiment was to study the effect of flaxseed processing on nitrogen corrected true metabolizable energy (TMEn) values for adult roosters. Flaxseed was processed as pelleted, autoclaved or microwave roasted. Leghorn roosters were used for the TME determination procedure. The TMEn value of flaxseed batch A, 14.48 MJ kg^-1 DM, was significantly (P < 0.05) increased to 17.89 MJ kg^-1 DM by three -time repeat-pelleting, or to 18.07 MJ kg^-1 dry matter (DM) by autoclaving, respectively. Microwave roasting also significantly (P < 0.05) increased the TMEn value of flaxseed batch B by 22%. The TMEn improvement observed due to processing was accompanied by increased ether extract utilization. The apparent ether extract digestibility of flaxseed batch A, 61.2%, was very significantly (P < 0.01) increased to 81.5 and 83.2% by processing as repeat-pelleting and autoclaving, respectively. Microwave roasting also significantly (P < 0.05) increased the apparent digestibility of ether extract for flaxseed batch B from 49.1 to 64.4%. Proper flaxseed processing as pelleting, autoclaving and microwave roasting led to higher TMEn values for Leghorn roosters, mainly as the result of increased ether extract utilization.

Xylose is a hemicellulosic sugar that can be used as a carbon and energy source for the growth of microorganisms. The main use of xylose is its bioconversion to xylitol. Sorghum straw is a raw material for xylose production that has not yet been studied. The objective of this work was to study xylose production by hydrolysis of sorghum straw at 122°C, using three concentrations of sulphuric acid (2%, 4% and 6%). Kinetic parameters of mathematical models for predicting the concentration of xylose, glucose, acetic acid and furfural were found and optimal conditions selected. These were 2% H2SO4 at 122°C for 71 min, which yielded a solution with 18.17 g xylose/l, 6.73 g glucose/l, 0.9 g furfural/l and 1.51 g acetic acid/l.

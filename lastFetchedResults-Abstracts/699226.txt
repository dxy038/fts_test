The filter medium could be selected and the longevity of the filter medium by the phosphorus saturation could be predicted in the constructed wetland system, accordingly proposing the scheme to remove the phosphorus for a long period. The phosphorus adsorption capacities of various filter media were investigated in relation to the size and types of filter media to screen the optimal condition. The objective of this study was to evaluate the constructed wetland longevity by improving P adsorption capacity. The maximum P adsorption capacities of filter media A (4–10 mm), B (2–4 mm), and C (0.1–2 mm) were 7.7, 11.6, and 22.5 mg/kg, respectively, showing that they increased as the filter media size decreased. Among the experimental media, the optimal filter media size was 0.1–2 mm. When Ca, Mg, Al and Fe were added to the filter medium C, which is the optimal filter medium, the addition of Ca improved mostly the P adsorption capacity. In the alternative proposal to use these facts, the oyster shell was added to the filter medium and the P adsorption capacity was examined: adding 2% oyster shell increased the P adsorption capacity from 23 to 36 mg/kg. In the column where the oyster shell was mixed, when the oyster shell content was 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% in the filter medium C, the respective saturation times of the P adsorption were about 6, 9, 17, 30, 43, 56, and 70 days. When the oyster shell content was 0%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% after 1 month in the column, the P adsorption amount was about 180, 600, 1560, 4280, 6157, 7089, 7519, and 7925 mg/kg, respectively. The increment of the P adsorption amount was small if the oyster shell content was 60% or more, because the filter medium with more than 60% oyster shell content did not approach the saturation time by the P adsorption yet. The P adsorption amount for 60%, 80%, and 100% could be predicted as about 9702, 12,879, and 16,056 mg/kg, respectively. The largest amount of extracted P in the filter media with oyster shell after 30 days of P solution application was bound to Ca, followed by water soluble-P, Al–P, and Fe–P. Therefore, it was concluded that the adsorption amount of the phosphorus could be increased by adding the oyster shell to the filter medium. Also, it was concluded that adding the oyster shell to the filter medium in the constructed wetland was the scheme to extend the longevity of the constructed wetland by the phosphorus saturation, and using the oyster shell would be useful in aspect of economical efficiency and easiness. Especially, it would be the alternative proposal to reduce the environmental pollution in aspect of recycling wastes.

The objective was to evaluate independently the reliability of a commercially available canine serum interleukin-10 (IL-10) enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and to investigate canine serum IL-10 concentrations in healthy dogs, in dogs with a naturally-occurring acute phase reaction and in dogs following surgical stimulus by assessing intra- and interassay imprecision, inaccuracy and detection limits. Median (and range) serum IL-10 concentrations (ng/L) in the various groups were as follows: healthy dogs (n = 15), 18.9 (11.2–71.5); dogs with pyometra (n = 9), 37.9 (12.4–201.8); dogs with angiostrongylosis (n = 8), 20.29 (14.3–108.7) and values in dogs following surgical stimulus (n = 15), 14.8 (10.7–65.8).

say measured canine serum IL-10 reliably (intra- and interassay imprecision 4.9–8.3% and 9.9–10.9%, respectively; detection limit 10.7 ng/L with no significant inaccuracy). No significant increases in IL-10 were observed following surgical stimulus and no difference in IL-10 was observed between the diagnostic groups. IL-10 values showed a higher degree of variation in dogs with an inflammatory response, i.e. those with elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations, compared to healthy dogs. As anticipated, healthy dogs had low levels of both analytes, whereas dogs with an acute phase response had IL-10 levels with no clear relationship to CRP concentrations, with observed low IL-10 values even when there was a marked inflammatory response.

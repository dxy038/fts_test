The objective of this study was to investigate the timing of foetal mortality in gilts of a segregating F2 cross of Large White and Meishan pigs on the basis of the length distribution of mummified foetuses and the frequency of non-fresh stillborn piglets in order to establish whether critical periods for foetal mortality exist. All expelled conceptuses and placentae of 192 farrowing gilts with a normal health status were meticulously investigated to recover all mummified foetuses. The length of each mummified foetus was measured. The predicted number of foetuses present per gilt at the early foetal stage of gestation was calculated as the sum of numbers of mummified foetuses and non-fresh stillborn, fresh stillborn and liveborn piglets. Foetal loss was calculated as the sum of mummified foetuses and non-fresh stillborn piglets. The average foetal mortality rate per gilt was 8.7%. In total 162 mummified foetuses were found (average 0.84 per litter), ranging in length from 0.4 to 33.0 cm. This indicates a range in foetal age at death of ∼35–100 days. Although mummified foetuses of all lengths within the above mentioned range were found, relatively many had a length of less than 4 cm or of 10–21 cm. The total number of non-fresh stillborn piglets (i.e. late foetal deaths) was 58 (average 0.30 per litter). It can be concluded that foetal mortality occurred in these gilts throughout the period from day 35 to term, with relatively high incidences at the early foetal stage (days 35–40), shortly after mid-pregnancy (days 55–75) and after ∼day 100 of gestation. These three periods coincide with reported periods of change in porcine placental growth.

An important factor in increasing quality of service in real-time wireless networks is minimizing energy consumption, which contradicts with increasing message delivery rate because of associating a time deadline to each message. In these networks, every message has a time deadline constraint and when the message is not delivered to its destination before its deadline, it will drop. Therefore, scheduling methods that simultaneously consider both energy consumption and time deadline constraint are needed. An effective method for reducing energy consumption is multi-hop transmission of packets. However, this method takes longer time for transmission as compared to single-hop transmission. Parallel transmission is another approach which on one hand reduces the transmission time and on the other hand increases the network throughput. However, a main issue with parallel transmission is the presence of interference among nearby nodes. In this paper, we propose a linear model (ILP formulation) for energy aware scheduling problem in real-time wireless sensor networks using parallel transmission. The main objective of the model is to reduce energy consumption and packet loss using multi-hop routing and parallel transmission. Simulation results show that the proposed model finds the optimum solution for the problem and outperforms the sequential scheduling based on the TDMA protocol.

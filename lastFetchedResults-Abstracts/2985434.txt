The objective of this study wits to identify factors affecting adequacy of haemodialysis and relations between them using Taguchi Method (fractional factorial experiments) throughout minimum of tests. Dialysis age, dialyser membrane material, haematocrit, interdialytic weight difference, dialysate, pump speed, heparin type, and socio-economical status were applied as parameters for Taguchi Method in order to drive out not only their individual effectiveness on the therapy but also interactions among them. Adequacy of a hemodialysis treatment was decided according to Kt/V using Daugirdas-2 formula. Delivery of Kt/V of 1.2 was accepted as target value. Performing analysis of Variance (ANOVA), dialyzer, haematocrit, pump speed and socio-economical status were found to have direct influence on the treatment quality, while dialyzer-interdialytic weight difference, dialyzer-haematocrit, dialyzer-pump speed, dialyzer-socio-economical status relations were detected as effective

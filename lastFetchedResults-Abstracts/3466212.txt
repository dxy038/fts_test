Auditory brainstem implants (ABI) that electrically stimulate the surface of cochlear nucleus have been clinically used for the rehabilitation of deaf patients with bilateral vestibular schwannomas. The change of pitch perception with an active electrode location is not as clear in ABIs as in cochlear implants, a factor which might play a role in poorer speech performance in ABIs. The objective of present work was to develop an animal ABI model that could provide physiological data for future ABI development and optimization. The experimental system included a penetrating microelectrode array for microstimulation of the cochlear nucleus and a surface microelectrode array for mapping evoked potentials over the auditory cortex. We first obtained tone-evoked cortical activation patterns, which represented a place code of the frequency and intensity of test tones, i.e., the ampli-tonotopic organization, and compared the patterns with those evoked by cochlear nuclear microstimulation. Our experimental results demonstrated that microstimulation of both the dorsal and ventral cochlear nucleus (DCN and VCN) could access the cortical ampli-tonotopic organization as acoustic stimuli did. We also found that the cortical dynamic range was wider for the DCN than VCN stimulation and for the low-frequency than for the high-frequency pathway. The present results have great implications for improved ABI performance.

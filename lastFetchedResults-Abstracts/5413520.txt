The objective of this research is to assure the management of Production Planning and Control (PPC) by assuring Information Quality (IQ) through Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems in tobacco industries. The contribution of this research is in applying the IQ concept to assure PPC which can ultimately minimize risks of current and potential customer loss. The research was conducted in a cigarette company in China, the Risks, Costs, and Profits (RCP) Analysis reveals that loss of current customers plays a more important role to the firm than loss of potential new customers. This is because the major source of income is from current customers and the major cash flow of the firm is derived from the relationships between their business processes. From the findings, a number of recommendations are developed for managing PPC more effectively; a number of limitations of the study and ideas for further research are also discussed.

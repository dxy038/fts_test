The objective of this review paper is to present a summary of the specific contributions in the field of fuel processing, particularly, outlines various developments involving catalytic reforming of a range of fuels for the development of an efficient fuel-processing unit for syngas production in fuel cell applications. Two major topics are discussed (i) the basic reactions involved in each of the processes and (ii) various catalyst systems that have been tested. A final short section offers some new possible routes for future research.

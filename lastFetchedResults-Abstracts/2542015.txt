Participants were assessed in terms of tolerance of ambiguity. Then, according to the level of the ambiguity tolerance, were divided into two groups that have high and low tolerance.
Results: Accordingly, the number of sle reduced to 190. Mobarake is ambiguty tolerance Scale (1388) was used to measure ambiguity tolerance, Cartwrighthatton  Wells Metacognition questionnaire (2004) was used to measure metacognition believes and De Groot  Pintrich Spontaneous learning strategies questionnaire (1990) was used to measure academic engagement. The multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used for statistical analysis.
Conclusion: The results showed that the tolerance of ambiguity affects students metacognition beliefs. Also, they showed that the ambiguity tolerance power increased academic engagement. The findings pointed out the role of the tolerance ambiguity are undeniable contrast in academic area.

Summary form only given. The objective of this paper is to investigate the DNA fragmentation by MHz range intense burst sinusoidal electric fields (IBSEF) by means of a single gel electrophoresis, Comet assay method. Although all IBSEF treated samples showed DNA fragmentation, there was no clear dependence on the frequencies. There are two possible mechanisms of the DNA fragmentation by IBSEF. One is the direct physical breaking of DNA. The other is an activation of biological process of DNA division, such as apoptosis. The agarose electrophoresis method indicates that DNA itself was not fragmented by the intense electric field with an amplitude of 4 kV/cm.

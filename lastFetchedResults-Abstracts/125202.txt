Introduction: Nowadays, chronic ulcers are one of the most expensive issues of health problems. Conventional treatments include, anti-biotic therapy, anti septic drugs and sometimes surgical debridment and in some cases skin graft, which in cases like diabetics or bed sores are the most effective and best methods.
Objective: The main aim of this study was to evaluate Aloe Vera gel (AVG) effect on the quality and duration of the ulcer healing process. Because no studies had been done in this field in Iran, we decided to do it.
Materials and Methods: This study included 19 patients who had undergone common treatments therapy for at least one month but without any appropriate response. We applied AVG topically 2-3 times daily on the various kinds of ulcers. We considered a golden time for healing such as three months for blood vascular insufficiency ulcers and bed sore, and one month for bum ulcers and others. This was a prospective study and because each patient was the control of his own-self, so it was a pre- post after study, too.
Results: Healing of ulcers was happened in 16(84.2%) cases and was failed in 3(15.8%) cases which was mainly due to non-compliance. Overall mean times for healing of ulcer was 31.25 days. The healing measures included the mean time for reduction of redness, swelling, secretion of ulcer and time for closure of ulcer. Maximum time for healing of ulcer was 90 days for bed sores and mean time for bed sores was 58.1 days. Minimum time for healing of ulcer was related to surgical ulcers (minimum 3 days) and mean time was 11 days. Statistical difference was significant (P Value =0).
Conclusion: Like previous studies, AVG was effective on the quality and rate of healing process of the ulcers. Besides, compared to common treatment. It is much more effective and inexpensive.

Background and Objective:Considering the high prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetic patients, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of probiotic yoghurt on blood pressure and serum lipid concentrations in these patients.
Materials and Methods:In this controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, 60 patients (23 males and 37 females) with type 2 diabetes and an LDL-cholesterol level higher than 100 mg/dL were assigned to one of two groups. Subjects in the intervention group consumed daily 300 gr of probiotic yoghurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis, and those in the control group consumed daily 300 gr of conventional yoghurt, for 6 weeks. Dietary intakes, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure and serum lipids concentrations were measured at the baseline and at the end of the study. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software, the statistical tests being analysis of covariance and paired-samples t-test.
Results: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged in both groups, while the total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations  decreased by 4.54% and 7.45% in the intervention group, respectively, as compared with the control values (P = 0.008 andP = 0.004, respectively). However, no significant differences were observed between the initial and final triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol concentrations in the intervention group.
Conclusion:Consumption of probiotic yoghurt can decrease the total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in type 2 diabetic patients; however, it has no effect on blood pressure. This study shows that probiotic yoghurt may help reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors in type 2 diabetes.

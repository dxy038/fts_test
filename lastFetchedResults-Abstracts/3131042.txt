Supply chain management is the main model of corporate production, operation and market competition. Performance evaluation of supply chain provides important and strategic guidance for the effective implementation of supply chain management. According to designing principles of performance evaluation index in supply chain, this paper constructed a performance evaluation index system of supply chain. In view of the uncertainty and fuzziness of indexes in evaluating supply chain performance, this paper combined improved entropy method and fuzzy matter-element theory to establish a fuzzy-matter model for evaluating supply chain performance. The weight of index was endowed by improved entropy method in the process of performance evaluation, and this method could avoid the influences of objective factors. The case study indicates that the evaluation method based on fuzzy matter-element model is simple and workable, and provides a new way for the evaluation of supply chain performance.

As biometric technology spreads into a number of application areas, it is most important to promote the commercialization of the biometric system, and secure objective standards pertinent to user reliability needs. In response to these needs, Recently K-NBTC (Korea National Biometric Test Center) was launched in Korea Information Security Agency on 30 June 2006. K-NBTC is driving the international standardization to occupy the international biometric market share and develops the applicable domestic standards through analyzing the international standards such as ISO/IEC JTC1 SC37 (biometrics), ITU-T SG17 Q.8 (telebiometrics). Mission and function in K-NBTC is building a test environment compatible with techniques and development environment of products of Korea biometric companies, managing test equipment for the BioAPI conformance, performance and interoperability for Korea biometric products using the biometric database of Korea Information Security Agency for the test and certification services. This paper describes the trends of biometric and test techniques of K-NBTC for biometrics.

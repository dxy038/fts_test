OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the outcomes of pregnancies complicated by a multiple (double, triple, or quadruple) nuchal cord entanglement.
STUDY DESIGN: Computerized data from our University Hospital perinatal database were reviewed between 1990 and 1994. Only singleton, vertex, and term pregnancies undergoing labor were analyzed. Patients with active perinatal complications were eliminated to reduce bias. Pregnancies with infants with either a single or no nuchal cord entanglement served as comparison groups. A comparison of frequencies in the three groups was by Ï‡2 teting and a comparison of means by a two-tailed Student t test and analysis of variance.
RESULTS: Of the 8565 deliveries, the frequency of two or more cord entanglements at delivery was 3.8%. Compared with a single or no cord entanglement, pregnancies with a multiple entanglement were more likely to exhibit an abnormal fetal heart rate pattern during advanced labor (p< 0.001) and to require low or midforceps application (p< 0.001). The study infants were also more likely to have meconium (p = 0.013), a low 1-minute Apgar score (p< 0.001), and an umbilical artery pH <- 7.10 Odds ratio 2.2, p = 0.013) than the controls. Rates of abruptio placentae, cesarean delivery, and 5-minute Apgar scores <7 were no more common in the multiple entanglement than the control groups.
CONCLUSION: A multiple nuchal cord entanglement was associated with a greater risk of meconium, an abnormal fetal heart rate pattern during advanced labor, the need for operative vaginal delivery, and mild umbilical artery acidosis at birth; however, there was no added risk of an adverse neonatal outcome.

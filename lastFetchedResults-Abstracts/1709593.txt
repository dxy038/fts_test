BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Regarding increasing traffic accidents and major surgery in this region the number of patients who need intensive cares is increasing too. Determinants of outcome in patients admitted to the Intensive care unit are varied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the determinants of outcome in patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit of Shahid Beheshti hospital (Babol, Iran).
METHODS: This cross sectional study was carried on patients who were admitted to the surgical intensive care unit of Shahid Behishti hospital during 2009-2010. Information including gender, age and cause of admission, treatment process and length of stay extracted from files.
FINDINGS: Out of 334 patients, 170 (50.8%) patients recovered completely, 102 (30.5%) with partial recovery discharged or transferred to other wards, 5 (1.5%) referred to other hospitals for further evaluation and treatment and 57 (17.2%) were died. There were meaningful correlation between outcome of patients and age (p=0.049), cause of admission (OR=0.52, 95%CI: 0.28-0.97) and length of stay (p < 0.001). There was no meaningful correlation between outcome of patients and level of consciousness and intubation, mean arterial pressure and level of consciousness. 
CONCLUSION: Knowledge of determinants of outcome in patients of intensive care units may help to recognize high risk patients, optimum care planning and decreasing the mortality rate.

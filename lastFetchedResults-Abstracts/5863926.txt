Energy consumption is a vital factor in the successful deployment of ad hoc sensor networks because sensor nodes are powered by on board battery which are extremely difficult to be recharged. In this article we have proposed a new routing technique based on the idea of random walk with the objective of saving energy. Our approach is inspired by an existing TDMA like routing protocol. We have given a detailed description of our algorithm taking help of a small size network and performed simulations on large network to draw a comparative analysis with the existing algorithm. The simulation results show that our approach significantly reduces number of transmissions hence conserving energy.

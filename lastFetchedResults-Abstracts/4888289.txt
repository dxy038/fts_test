This paper presents a method for the overdesign of gain-shaping filters in an optimal way. The passband minima and the stopband maxima of a filter approximation are adjusted using an iterative method, with the objective of obtaining a special approximation, that satisfies exactly the specifications when the worst-case error in the filter transfer function due to errors on its components is considered

In this paper, we present semi-analytical modeling and optimization approaches based on genetic algorithm computation to improve the electrical performance of amorphous SiGe thin-film solar cell including multi-trench region. The key idea behind the proposed investigation is to model the electrical efficiency using 2D numerical database and analytical fitting. Semi-analytical expression of the efficiency for the trench-dependent electrical models, have been used to estimate the performance of the investigated a:SiGe thin-film solar cell. Trench-dependent model includes the multi-trench region parameters, which are: the doping, thickness and width. The semi-analytical model has been used to formulate the objective function where multi-trench region, its geometry dependence and doping profile are considered simultaneously. The proposed approach is used to search for solar cell design parameters that optimize the electrical performance. The obtained results are validated with 2D numerical data, where a good agreement is recorded. The proposed semi-analytical analysis may provide a practical basis to investigate and optimize the a:SiGe-based solar cells for low cost and high performance applications.

Effective underwater communication can be carried out when the masking effect of underwater ambient noise is reduced. The main objective of this paper is to develop an optimum adaptive algorithm for accurate detection of the underwater acoustic signal buried due to the effect of ambient noises in the near and far seas. A comparative analysis on various algorithms using MATLAB is performed and to validate its performance the signal to noise ratio is calculated. For this analysis the data collected using passive Sonar at Chennai at a depth of 5metre in shallow water region is considered.

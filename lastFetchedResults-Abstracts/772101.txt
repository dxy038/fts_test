When the subject of scientific analysis is learning, the research needs to be
anchored in various nonmonolithic pillars. Several disciplines require a
common ground of convergence. An objective observer of the domain can
easily conclude that semantic e-learning brings together the three different
worlds of learners, pedagogues and technologists.
In this short concluding paper of the special issue, we criticise the monolithic
approaches to technology-enhanced learning. We argue that semantic elearning
presents a critical research challenge to move towards extended
openness, meaning exploitation and unforeseen learning opportunities for the
global community.
The concluding remark is a call for a new learning generation primer.
Synthesizing fantasies is in fact an invitation to semantically define our
commitment to collaborate and to agree on the technology-enabled services
that bring learning to the forefront. The promotion of the knowledge-andlearning-
society requires an integration of the demand and supply side of
knowledge and learning.

Acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) is an ultrasound method for converting biocompatible microdroplets into microbubbles. The objective is to demonstrate that ADV bubbles can enhance high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy by controlling and increasing energy absorption at the focus. Thermal phantoms were made with or without droplets. Compound lesions were formed in the phantoms by 5-second exposures with 5-second delays. Center to center spacing of individual lesions was 5.5 mm in either a linear pattern or a spiral pattern. Prior to the HIFU, 10 cycle tone bursts with 0.25% duty cycle were used to vaporize the droplets, forming an "acoustic trench" within 30 seconds. The transducer was then focused in the middle of the back bubble wall to form thermal lesions in the trench. All lesions were imaged optically and with 2T MRI. With the use of ADV and the acoustic trench, a uniform thermal ablation volume of 15 cm<sup>3</sup> was achieved in 4 minutes; without ADV only less than 15% of this volume was filled. The commonly seen tadpole shape characteristic of bubble-enhanced HIFU lesions was not evident with the acoustic trench. In conclusion, ADV shows promise for the spatial control and dramatic acceleration of thermal lesion production by HIFU.

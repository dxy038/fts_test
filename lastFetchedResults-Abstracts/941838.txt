Selenium (Se) is an essential element which has been shown to play an important role in
protecting marine mammals against the toxic effects ofmercury (Hg) and other metals. It has
been suggested thatmetal concentration inmarinemammal teeth can potentially be used as
bioindicators for body burden. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship
between Se concentrations in beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) teeth and those previously
measured in soft tissues (liver, kidney, muscle and muktuk). Tooth Hg concentrations are
also measured, and the relationships between Se and Hg in teeth and soft tissues are
examined. Se in the teeth of beluga was measured using hydride generation atomic
fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS) and Hg in beluga teeth was measured by cold-vapour
atomic absorption. Tooth Se concentrations ranged from108 ng/g to 245 ng/g dry weight, and
tooth Hg concentrations ranged from 10 to 189 ng/g dry weight. In the soft tissues, Se
concentrations were highest in the liver, followed by kidney,muktuk, andmuscle. Therewere
significant correlations between tooth Se concentrations and animal age, tooth Se and liver
andmuscle Se, and between liver Se and animal age. Themolar ratio of Hg:Se in the liver was
found to be 0.70. This study is the first tomeasure Se in the teeth of amarinemammal species,
and HG-AFS is found to be an effective technique for determining Se in beluga teeth. Tooth Se
can be used as predictor for liver andmuscle Se, although these relationships may be strongly
influenced by the association of Se with Hg in marine mammal tissues. This study contributes
to an increased understanding of the storage and metabolismof Se in marinemammals.

Many advantages of microwave ablation over the other ablative therapies in the field of liver tumor ablation have driven researchers to develop innovative interstitial microwave antennas to effectively treat deep seated, nonresectable hepatic tumors. A new coaxial antenna for microwave ablation therapies has been proposed in this research paper. Two dimensional axisymmetric Finite Element Method (FEM) has been used to design and measure the results of the proposed antenna. Objective metrics for assessing the size and shape of a ablation zone and S11 for efficiency of antenna has been specified and verified for the proposed antenna. The dependence of antenna performances on possible changes in the antenna´s structure has also investigated for finding the stability and highlighting the fundamental role played by the antenna´s split tip. The novel antenna results depicts that with reflection coefficient -27 dB, the antenna is well matched and having capability of creating spherical ablation zones up to 2 cm in radius using 60 Watt input power at 2.45 GHz proves that it is able to produce good performance parameters.

The objective of this investigation was to further increase the medium chain fatty acid (MCFA) production rate by reducing the hydraulic retention time (HRT) in an upflow anaerobic filter. The results showed that the volumetric MCFA production rate was increased to 57.4 g MCFA l−1 d−1, more than 3 times higher than previous work. Despite the lower MCFA concentrations at 4 h HRT, the MCFA selectivity remained above 80%. Extra carbon dioxide additions and higher yeast extract concentrations were required to increase the MCFA production rate. More research related to substrates and (micro)nutrients in mixed culture continuous reactors needs to be performed to reduce yeast extract use in chain elongation.

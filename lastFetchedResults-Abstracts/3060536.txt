This paper aims to find out the effect of the variation of the design parameters, particularly, the stator resistance and the d-q axes inductances of a brushless DC motor on its performance indices with the help of a non-conventional optimization technique. The objective is to find such values of these parameters that maximize the efficiency and minimize the torque ripple. The genetic algorithm is found to yield better results when compared to other conventional optimization methods.


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In beta-thalassemia major patients, iron overload can cause dysfunction in many organs. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between renal tubular dysfunction with iron overload in beta-thalassemic patients referring to our thalassemia center. 
METHODS: In this descriptive-analytic study, beta-thalassemia major patients aged more than ten years were selected. Magnetic Resonance Imaging T2*done for patients. Iron overload of liver designed by MRIT2*. It was considered as two levels; severe and mild to moderate levels. Forty five patients were severe iron overload (case) and forty five patients were mild to moderate levels (control). They were matched for age and gender. Random morning urine samples were collected and the electrolytes, uric acid, creatinine and urinary B2M (beta2-microglobulin) levels were examined. Blood samples for levels of BUN, Cr, Na, K, FBS and Ferritin were taken too. Then, Ca/Cr ratio in urine, Pr/Cr ratio in urine, fractional excretion (FE) Na, FE K and FE uric acid were calculated. Abnormal excretion of these biochemical factors considered as a renal tubular dysfunction. The data was analyzed and p < 0.05 was considered significant.
FINDINGS: Mean age of patients in case and control groups were 27±6.106 and 27.64±7.834 years, respectively. Serum ferritin level (case; 2300.46±146.32, control; 1488.09±1051.46, p=0.002), the urinary Ca/Cr ratio (case; 0.11, control; 0.12, p=0.01), and urinary B2M/Cr ratio (case; 502.18±1053.21, control; 513.48±936.86; p=0.024) were significant.
CONCLUSION: The results of study showed that iron overload can affect the renal tubular function.

The objective of this work is to illustrate the potential in the use of activated carbon in the binary component sorption of copper and lead ions. Eucalyptus bark was used as a precursor for the activated carbon which was prepared through the phosphoric acid activation process. This activated carbon was then used for the sorption of copper and lead ions. The quantity of the metal ions in the solution was measured with the Flame &amp; Graphite Furnace Atomic Adsorption Spectrophotometer. The results indicated that the optimal pH for sorption was 5. The maximum sorption capacities for Cu(II) and Pb(II) were 0.45 and 0.53 mmol gâˆ’1. Carboxylic, amine and amide groups were found to involve in the sorptions of Cu(II) and Pb(II). A major mechanism for the uptake of both heavy metals was proven not to be ion exchange but adsorption. In binary component sorptions, activated carbon still could sorb Pb(II) in a greater amount than Cu(II). However, the presence of the secondary metal ions suppressed the sorption of the primary metal ions. There seemed to have a linear inverse dependency between the sorption capacity and the concentration of the secondary metal ion.

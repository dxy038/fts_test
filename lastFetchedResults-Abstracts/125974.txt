BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) deficiency is the most common enzyme deficiency in human beings. Using fava beans, some drugs and oxidant agents cause life-threatening hemolysis in children and other ages. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of G6PD deficiency and its relation to age and family history.
METHODS: This cross sectional, descriptive and analytical study was performed on 732 persons. Students aged between 7-11 years old were randomly chosen by cluster sampling method. Data were analyzed by SPSS. For comparing enzyme deficiency between two sexes and the effect of family history, chi square test was used.
FINDINGS: From 732 students, 295 were male and 437 were female. 11.2% of males and 1.4% of females were G6PD deficient that this difference was considered significant (p<0.0001). Children who have G6PD deficiency, history of G6PD deficiency among their family members was significantly more (p<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Due to high prevalence of G6PD deficiency as a threatening factor for public health in north of Iran, it is suggested cord blood G6PD screening be considered at birth especially in male neonates and the quality of primary health care and public information be increased by teaching.

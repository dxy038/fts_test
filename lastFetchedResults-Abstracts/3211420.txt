The distributed compressive video sensing (DCVS) poses itself as a very promising framework for future video coding on mobile devices due to its very low complexity at the encoder not only in sampling but also in compression. However its blocking artifacts and oscillatory artifacts especially in high-frequency components seriously degrade perceptual quality. In this paper, we try to solve both problems of the high-frequency oscillatory and blocking artifacts as a whole by a proposed deblocking filter. By differentiating those well-decoded blocks from poorly-decoded blocks using concept of reliability, the proposed method can improve DCVS framework in both objective and subjective qualities.

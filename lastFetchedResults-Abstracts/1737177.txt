We present an automatic control method for phase locking of regular and chaotic nonidentical oscillations, when all subsystems interact via feedback. This method is based on the well known principle of feedback control which takes place in nature and is successfully used in engineering. In contrast to unidirectional and bidirectional coupling, the approach presented here supposes the existence of a special controller, which allows to change the parameters of the controlled systems. First we discuss general principles of automatic phase synchronization (PS) for arbitrary coupled systems with a controller whose input is given by a special quadratic form of coordinates of the individual systems and its output is a result of the application of a linear differential operator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for controlled PS on several examples: (i) two coupled regular oscillators, (ii) coupled regular and chaotic oscillators, (iii) two coupled chaotic Rِssler oscillators, (iv) two coupled foodweb models, (v) coupled chaotic Rِssler and Lorenz oscillators, (vi) ensembles of locally coupled regular oscillators, (vii) ensembles of locally coupled chaotic oscillators, and (viii) ensembles of globally coupled chaotic oscillators.

The Heat Cycle Research Program being conducted for the US Department of Energy is discussed. It has as its objective the development of technology for improving utilization of moderate-temperature geothermal resources. The performance of binary power cycles utilizing mixtures of nonadjacent hydrocarbons as the working fluids, with supercritical vaporization and in-tube condensation, is currently being tested. Test results for the condenser at different tube inclinations are presented. The performance in the vertical orientation is shown to be better than in either the horizontal or inclined orientation

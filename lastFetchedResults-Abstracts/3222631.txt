A novel isolated zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) bidirectional DC-DC converter (BDC) with coupled inductors is proposed in this paper. The series half bridge structure in the high-voltage side reduces the switch voltage stress to half of the high-side voltage, which extends the high-side voltage when using power MOSFETs. Furthermore, all the switches can achieve ZVS soft-switching performance at any load condition by adopting the active clamp circuits and the PWM plus phase shift (PPS) control strategy. Thus, the BDC can operate at high frequency to achieve high power density and still with high efficiency for high voltage dc bus applications. Finally, a 1.5kW 100kHz 48V/800V prototype is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed circuit.

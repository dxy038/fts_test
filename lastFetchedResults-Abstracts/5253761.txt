Tracking moving objects in variable cluttered environments is an active area of research. It is common to use some simplifying assumption in such environments to facilitate the design. In this paper a new method for simulating the completely non-Gaussian cluttered environments is presented. The method is based on using the variable variance of process noise as a description of variability in such environments. The key objective is to find an effective algorithm for tracking a single moving object in variable cluttered environments, with utilization of the presented method. The new methodology is presented in two steps. In the first step we compare the accuracy of estimators in tracking a moving object, and in the second step, the goal is to find the best algorithm for tracking a single moving target in variable cluttered environments.

Monitoring complex environmental systems is extremely challenging because it requires environmental professionals to capture impacted
systemsâ€™ governing processes, elucidate human and ecologic risks, limit monitoring costs, and satisfy the interests of multiple stakeholders
(e.g., site owners, regulators, and public advocates). Evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) has tremendous potential to help resolve
these issues by providing environmental stakeholders with a direct understanding of their monitoring tradeoffs. This paper demonstrates how
3-dominance archiving and automatic parameterization techniques can be used to significantly improve the ease-of-use and efficiency of
EMO algorithms. Results are presented for a four-objective groundwater monitoring design problem in which the archiving and parameterization
techniques are combined to reduce computational demands by more than 90% relative to prior published results. The methods of this paper can
be easily generalized to other multiobjective applications to minimize computational times as well as trial-and-error parameter analysis.

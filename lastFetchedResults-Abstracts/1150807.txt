This paper presents a study of the influence of cutting conditions on the surface finish obtained by turning. A plan of experiments, based on the techniques of Taguchi, was designed and executed on controlled machining with cutting conditions prefixed in workpieces. Afterwards, the roughness was evaluated on workpieces using two different profilometers. The objective was to establish a correlation between cutting velocity, feed and depth of cut with the roughness evaluating parameters Ra and Rt, following the international norms. These correlations were obtained by multiple linear regression. Finally, confirmation tests were performed to make a comparison between the results predicted from the mentioned correlations and the theoretical results.

We investigate resource allocation in OFDMA cooperative networks with Best effort services and real time services. We design a utility framework to satisfy QoS requirements of different applications. We define network utility as functions of data rate, delay, and packet loss. A utility function is assigned to user-relay pairs or only the user over each subcarrier, and the relay and subcarrier dedicated to achieve the optimal utility will be selected for cooperation transmission. The objective of resource allocation is to strike a balance between maximizing the data rate utility while minimizing the delay and packet loss.

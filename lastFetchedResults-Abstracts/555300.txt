Background and Objective: Burn wound is a suitable site for the incidence of resistant infections. Thus, the research for finding of effective drugs against this infection is necessary. The purpose of this study was to determine antibacterial activity of methanolic extract of Curcuma longa rhizome against bacteria isolated from burn wound infections and to compare with effects of selected antibiotics.
Materials & Methods: First, a sample of methanolic extract of the plant rhizome was prepared . Then its antibacterial activity against 8 isolates of bacteria from 100 samples of burn wound infection was evaluated by well diffusion and then Agar Serial Dilution method. Also, the MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) of extract was determined. The effect of selected antibiotics was tested by disk diffusion method. The onava test was used to compare the results.
Results: The results demonstrated that the plant extract had been effected against 80% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , 69% of Acinetobacter and more than 75% of Staphylococcus species. The MIC of the extract for this bacteria was 13.95,14.55 and 3.7 mg/ml respectively,while they were often resistant to selected antibiotics .There was significant difference between the effects of plant and antibiotics on all of them (P<0/05).
Conclusion: This study demonstrates that methanolic extract of Curcuma longa have good antibacterial activity against most of bacteria isolated from burn wound infections. However, we need more investigation

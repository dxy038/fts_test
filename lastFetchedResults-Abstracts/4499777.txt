The Advanced Airlift Interactive Maintenance System (AAIMS) concept is both an on-aircraft and off-aircraft information system that gathers, correlates, and processes aircraft data; automates the debrief process; provides historical data for each aircraft tail number as well as the entire fleet; provides the ability to interactively diagnose the aircraft. The objective of AAIMS is to improve mission effectiveness, reduce life-cycle costs and maintenance man-hours per flight-hour, and decrease aircraft turnaround time. AAIMS also provides the data collection mechanisms to interface to the Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS)

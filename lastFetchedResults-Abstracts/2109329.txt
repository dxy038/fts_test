Introduction: Appendicitis is one of the most common surgical emergencies. In spite of the relatively high rate of negative
appendectomy, as a result of miss diagnosis, uncertainty of diagnosis still continues to challenge physicians. The objective of
this prospective study was to investigate the role of 99mTc-Ubiquicidin (UBI) scintigraphy in the diagnosis of acute
appendicitis and to compare 99mTc-UBI scintigraphy with 99mTc-IgG scintigraphy.
Methods: Twelve patients with right lower quadrant pain and suspicious of acute appendicitis were referred to the nuclear
medicine imaging center. Radionuclide imaging was performed with 99mTc-UBI in 8 and 99mTc-IgG in 4 patients.
Ultrasonography, Alvarado scoring and histopathological examinations were also performed as additional diagnostic tests.
Results: Reports from 99mTc-IgG and 99mTc-UBI scintigraphies of all patients were negative.
Conclusion: This study may conclude that 99mTc-IgG scintigraphy and 99mTc-UBI scintigraphy in the detection of
appendicitis do not have adequate efficacy. However, in order to better evaluate 99mTc-IgG and 99mTc-UBI scintigraphy, a
comprehensive study on a large number of patients with clinical suspicious of acute appendicitis would be more helpful.

Objective (s): To achieve a model to monitor and evaluate drug abuse treatment centers in Iran. 
Methods: This was a nationwide study. The data were collected through interviews with selected experts, experts working in drug treatment centers using a questionnaire, and interviewing technical officers (300 centers from 31 provinces), and existing documents. Then, based on ‘guiding principles’ it was decided to provide a model for monitoring and evaluating drug abuse treatment centers.
Results: Overall we found 3 types of centers: complying with more than 80% of obligations, complying with 60% to 80% of obligations, and complying with under 60% of obligations. In addition to views of the university and staff experts who assume the current monitoring and evaluation system is incomplete and require further development, 70% of directors were dissatisfied or moderately satisfied with the current method of monitoring and evaluations. The analysis of the data indicated that in order to further develop the current situation, there is need to concentrate on improving horizontal and vertical coordination in supervising at national, provincial, and regional levels. In addition the findings indicated that there were several confusions in duties among staffs.
 Conclusion: As a result a style sheet and check list were provided to clarify duties in the centers at each level.

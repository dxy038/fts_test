This study identifies the country specific potential risks categories and their respective components. The study proposes a model to calculate the Environment Related Factor Index (ERFI) value. This index determines the amount of risk in a particular project. Generally higher index values are related to higher risks in the project. The objective of categorizing and classifying country specific project risks is to assist the project managers to quickly identify and evaluate the potential constraints to project success.

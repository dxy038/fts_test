Objective (s): This study aimed to determine the value of Health Belief Model in predicting preventive behaviors of occupational accidents among building workers.
Methods: The present study was a descriptive study of a random sample of 176 building workers in Mashhad, Iran.  The study investigated the relationship between health belief model variables and occupational accidents in order to prevent injuries among building workers. The data were collected using two questionnaires including questions on demographic and the model structures. 
Results: The results showed significant correlation between preventive behaviors of occupational accidents and perceived benefits (p < 0.05 & r= 0.319), perceived barriers (p < 0.05 & r= - 0.26), perceived threat (p < 0.05 & r= 0.60), cues to action (p < 0.05 & r= 0.26), and self-efficacy (p < 0.05 & r= 0.42). The regression analysis revealed that the model worked extremely well. Indeed, the independent variables accounted for 41.7% of the variance in behavior. The perceived threat and self-efficacy had the most influential role in the prediction.
Conclusion:  According to the results and due to the significant relationship between perceived threat and function, educational programs is recommended based on the health belief model to enhance the sensitivity and perceived intensity of the workers with emphasis on increasing self-efficacy.

Outdoor levels of fine particles (PM2.5; particles <2.5 μm) have been associated with cardiovascular health. Persons with existing cardiovascular disease have been suggested to be especially vulnerable. It is unclear, how well outdoor concentrations of PM2.5 and its constituents measured at a central site reflect personal exposures in Southern European countries. The objective of the study was to assess the relationship between outdoor and personal concentrations of PM2.5, absorbance and sulphur among post-myocardial infarction patients in Barcelona, Spain.
Thirty-eight subjects carried personal PM2.5 monitors for 24-h once a month (2–6 repeated measurements) between November 2003 and June 2004. PM2.5 was measured also at a central outdoor monitoring site. Light absorbance (a proxy for elemental carbon) and sulphur content of filter samples were determined as markers of combustion originating and long-range transported PM2.5, respectively.
There were 110, 162 and 88 measurements of PM2.5, absorbance and sulphur, respectively. Levels of outdoor PM2.5 (median 17 μg m3) were lower than personal PM2.5 even after excluding days with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) (median after exclusion 27 μg m3). However, outdoor concentrations of absorbance and sulphur were similar to personal concentrations after exclusion of ETS. When repeated measurements were taken into account, there was a statistically significant association between personal and outdoor absorbance when adjusting for ETS (slope 0.66, p<0.001), but for PM2.5 the association was weaker (slope 0.51, p=0.066). Adjustment for ETS had little effect on the respective association of S (slope 0.69, p<0.001).
Our results suggest that outdoor measurements of absorbance and sulphur can be used to estimate both the daily variation and levels of personal exposures also in Southern European countries, especially when exposure to ETS has been taken into account. For PM2.5, indoor sources need to be carefully considered.

Objective
We investigated whether low human chorionic gonadotropin from maternal serum screening is associated with adverse pregnancy outcome.
Study design
Women between 15 and 20 completed weeks of gestation who had a maternal serum screen performed from June 1999 to November 2001 were studied. Cases included women with human chorionic gonadotropin values of â‰¤0.5 multiples of the median, Î±-fetoprotein values of >0.5 and <2.0 multiples of the median, and estriol values of >0.6 and <2.0 multiples of the median. Control subjects were selected randomly from the population of women with normal values for all three analytes.
Results
There were 146 case subjects and 292 control subjects. There was no increased risk in the study group compared with the control subjects for preterm delivery, intrauterine fetal death, low birth weight, abruptio placentae, preeclampsia, or preterm premature rupture of membranes.
Conclusion
An isolated low human chorionic gonadotropin level from second-trimester maternal serum screening is not associated with adverse pregnancy outcome.

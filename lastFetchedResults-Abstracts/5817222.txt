Summary form only given. In 1987, an initiative was made to consolidate radar cross section (RCS) code development sponsored by the Tri-Services and NASA. The RCS Code Consortium was formed, consisting of a government steering group and members from industry and the academic community. Since the formation of the consortium, significant progress has been made to advance code development work sponsored by the US government. The objective of the Electromagnetic Code Consortium is to significantly advance the state of the art in basic EM scattering research and to produce the computer codes necessary for prediction of military platform signatures. This will be accomplished by determining the current state of the art, and avenues for further advancement of electromagnetic radiation and scattering prediction codes. After developing the technology roadmap, the roadmap will be implemented through the development of highly efficient, modular computer codes, which form the basis for advanced RF, IR, and EO scattering and radiation analytical techniques.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

In this paper, we consider single machine earliness-tardiness scheduling problem with sequence dependent setup time under different due dates. The objective is to minimize the penalty function, which includes the penalty of completion time of the job is early or tardy for its due date and the penalty of total setup time between jobs. For this problem, we form a hybrid algorithm by combining the heuristic with a genetic algorithm after giving a heuristic. The results of experiment show this algorithm is efficient

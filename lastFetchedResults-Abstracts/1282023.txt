Background and Objective: Research results have revealed a relation between homocysteine as an inflammatory index and inactivity-related diseases. The purpose of this research was to examine the relation between the maximum oxygen consumed (a cardio-respiratory endurance index) and blood homocysteine level in sedentary subjects.

Materials and Methods: The present study was a semi-experimental research in which 28 students were randomly selected from a population of 240 students of Science & Industry University of Iran (age=19.14±1.24, weight=70.13±11.76 height=175.42±5.86 cm, lipid percentage=19.11±5.98). The sample was then divided into two groups of experimental and control. The experimental and control groups participated in blood donation both in pre-test and post-test. But only the experimental group performed the Bruce Test in 8 weeks of aerobic exercise test (Bruce protocol-Vo2max) three times per week and at their 60 to 75 percent maximum heart rate. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to examine the normality of data and Pearson correlation coefficient was employed to analyze the data. 

Results: With an eight-week aerobic exercise, no significant correlation was observed between homocysteine (r= 0.16, p?0.05), and Vo2max, and no significant difference in the experimental group homocysteine was also observed (p=0.64). However, the Maximum Oxygen Consumed level in the post-test experimental group indicated a significant increase (p=0.0001).

Conclusion: No significant relationship was found out between blood homocysteine and maximum oxygen consumption in inactive men.

Mulla Sadra's interpretaion or hermeneutic of the Divine speech, which is inspired by the hermeneutic interpretation of the Holy Qur'an, can be considered as a bridge reconciling philosophical and traditional hermeneutics with each other, as well as a foundation for philosophical hermeneutics.
Man's understanding is a complex process which cannot be restricted to a general principle. Concerning the study of man's understanding and interpretation of the Divine Words and Revelation (genetic or religious), Mulla Sadra believes that the best proof for demonstrating the relation between understanding or interpretation and man's existence is tantamount to the existential relation between the macro anthropo and micro anthropo. And the best method for proving the relation of language, being, and the manifestation of being in language to each other is the perception of the classification of the grades of being - from objective existence to verbal existence. This is because on the basis of the fact that the reality of existence enjoys vertical and horizontal levels and grades, the genetic and religious forms of the Divine Language are two existential forms of the same reality.

This paper presents a penalty function approach to the solution of inequality constrained optimal control problems. The method begins with a point interior to the constraint set and approaches the optimum from within, by solving a sequence of problems with only terminal conditions as constraints. Thus, all intermediate solutions satisfy the inequality constraints. Conditions are given which guarantee that the un "constrained" problems have solutions interior to the constraint set and that in the limit these solutions converge to the constrained optimum. For linear systems with convex objective and concave inequalities, the unconstrained problems have the property that any local minimum is global. Further, under these conditions, upper and lower bounds in the optimum are easily available. Three test problems are solved and the results presented.

In the literature, solution approaches to the shortest-path network interdiction problem have been developed
for optimizing a single figure-of-merit of the network configuration when considering limited
amount of resources available to interdict network links. This paper presents a newly developed evolutionary
algorithm that allows approximating the optimal Pareto set of network interdiction strategies
when considering bi-objective shortest path problems. Thus, the paper considers the concurrent optimization
of two objectives: (1) maximization of shortest-path length and (2) minimization of interdiction
strategy cost. Also, the paper considers the transformation of the first objective into the minimization
of the most reliable path reliability. To solve these multi-objective optimization problems, an evolutionary
algorithm has been developed. This algorithm is based on Monte Carlo simulation, to generate potential
network interdiction strategies, graph theory to analyze strategiesâ€™ shortest path or most reliable path
and, an evolutionary search driven by the probability that a link will appear in the optimal Pareto set.
Examples for different sizes of networks and network behavior are used throughout the paper to illustrate
and validate the approach.

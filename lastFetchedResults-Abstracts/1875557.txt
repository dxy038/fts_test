Objective To investigate whether educational information for nurses concerning causes of noise would decrease noise levels in an intensive care unit for term newborns and infants.

 Pretest and posttest.

g: Children's surgical ward in a university hospital in southern Sweden.

ts Fifty-two nurses in the surgical ward.

e Measures Noise levels.

ention An educational program consisting of a presentation of a videotape, presentation of the decibel values for various care activities, and a discussion of the problem.

s Statistical analysis with a paired two-tailed t test showed significant differences to exist between measurements in a cot and an incubator before the intervention (p=0.0001), and between cot measurements before and after the intervention program (p=0.0007).

sions The results of this study show that through simple methods and without additional costs, and by making the staff aware of the problem, noise levels can be lowered considerably.

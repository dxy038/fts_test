Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) has been applied to examination of several clinically and biologically important materials including the lens of the eye. Visual comparison of DLS particle size distribution data from distinct classes; such as normal and cataractous eyes is often adequate for clinical grouping. However a more objective, formal and rigorous classification scheme is needed for evaluation of more subtle effects as may occur in therapeutic or toxicological investigations. We review sources of variability in DLS methodology as a step toward a classification scheme

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) includes both gastric and duodenal ulcers. There are three major factors which affect its aetiology: Consumption of NSAIDs, Helicobacter pylori infection and hyperacidity state. The objective of the present study is to compare two Anti Helicobacter Pylori eradicative regimens (OCA and OCM) to determine for the preference of replacing Metronidazol with Amoxicillin in Mashhad.	Introduction



	
Randomized sampling was used to select 120 endoscopic proven PUD patients for this study. The patients had referred to the hospitals of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences during the years of 1385-88 (HS). They were equally divided into two groups (60 patients in each group). All the individuals were required to complete a questionnaire and received the Urea Breath Test. Then, the first regimens prescribed for the first group consisted of Omeprazole (20mg/Bid), Clarithromycin (500mg/Q12H), and Amoxicillin (1gr/Q12H). For the second regimen, the patients in the second group were given the same prescription except for Amoxicillin (1gr/Q12H) which was replaced with Metronidazole (500mg/Q12H). 	Materials 
and 
Methods
	
H pylori infection was mostly frequent in the third and fourth decades of life. Most of the patients were male with lower level of education.  The comparison between the two treatment protocols did not show any meaningful differences 
(P=0.927).
	Results



	
Although the efficacy of these two regimens is near equal, due to better results of Amoxicillin, mainly tolerance and lower complications, OCA regimen is preferred.	Conclusion
	
Helicobacter Pylori, Urea Breath Test (UBT), Omeprazole, Clarithromycin, Amoxicillin, Metronidazole	Keywords

A preliminary investigation has been carried out on the occurrence and effects of antibiotics used in Italian aquaculture with the objective of identifying priorities for monitoring programmes.

According to the information available on the most pertinent and diffuse fish diseases and their related therapies, the presence of flumequine and oxytetracycline in sediments sampled from two trout farms and three sea-bass farms and in their surrounding environments was selected for an analytical investigation. The concentrations of oxytetracycline and flumequine varied up to a maximum of 246.3 and 578.8 μg/kg d.w., respectively. Flumequine was seen to have the highest toxicity in a bioluminescence assay with EC50 values varying within the range of 12–15 mg/l, while the EC50 values for oxytetracycline were within the range of 121–139 mg/l.

The results of the present study indicate flumequine and oxytetracycline as priority chemicals to be monitored for possible environmental side effects of aquaculture in Italy. Apart from peak concentrations the chronic presence of flumequine and oxytetracycline in sediments both inside and outside farms should also be considered. In spite of the potential risks related to the use of antibiotics, the concentrations found in the sediments of the studied fish farms are significantly lower than those found in other areas.

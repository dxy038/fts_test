Double-loop networks are widely used in computer networks. In this paper, we present an optimal message routing algorithm and an optimal fault-tolerant message routing algorithm for weighted bidirectional double-loop networks. The algorithms presented are novel, and they do not use routing tables. After a precalculation of O(log N) steps to determine network parameters, the algorithms can route messages using constant time at each node along the route. The algorithm presented can route messages in the presence of up to three faulty nodes or links. The fault-tolerant routing algorithm guarantees an optimal route in the presence of one node failure.

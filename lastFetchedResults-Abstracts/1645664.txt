The applications of anti-bacterial agents are developed extensively in textile industry. Antibacterial of PHMB (Polyhexamethylene Biguanide Hydrochloride) are one of the agents applied for implying anti-bacterial properties on textiles. In this study, PHMB was used to create antibacterial properties on woolen fabric. Uuntreated and treated with protease enzyme wool fabric were loaded with PHMB by exhaustion method. Samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy SEM. Loading efficiency and the amount of PHMB on fabric is determined by spectroscopic method. Antibacterial properties of wool fabric loaded PHMB are investigated against a Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aurous). This research was conducted with the objective of preparing an antimicrobial woolen fabric using the PHMB polymer; in this case we can to be effective to create antimicrobial properties on woolen fabric in the textile industry. Results of anti-bacterial indicated that the fabrics loaded with PHMB have antibacterial properties against both Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus).

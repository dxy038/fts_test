Vegetation maintenance involves trimming or removing
trees and brush near the overhead conductors to reduce
the number of tree-related outages and maintain system reliability.
This paper reports a maintenance-scheduling algorithm
that determines the optimal location and time for performing
vegetation maintenance on overhead distribution feeders. A
vegetation failure rate model is developed that quantifies the
impact of the maintenance schedule on the reliability of a distribution
system. Using this reliability model and a predictive
reliability assessment algorithm, the maintenance-scheduling
algorithm is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem
that considers different objective functions and constraints.
After experimentation with several heuristic search techniques,
a hybrid genetic algorithm-hill climbing technique consistently
found the highest-quality maintenance schedules. The results
from applying the maintenance-scheduling algorithm to a real
distribution system are also presented. It is shown that the new
maintenance scheduling algorithm can find lower cost and more
reliable schedules compared to standard fixed interval schedules.

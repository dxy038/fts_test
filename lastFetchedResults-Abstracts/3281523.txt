In the last decade, many research efforts have been done in order to increase the spectral efficiency of wireless communications. From now on, opportunistic resource allocations have emerged as the best way to reach this objective. They take into consideration the radio conditions in the allocation process. This allows to guarantee high system throughput and high Quality of Service (QoS). However, today, it is not sufficient anymore. Many climate problems have been underlined by the majority of world scientists and decreasing world greenhouse gas emission has become a necessity for the worldÂ´s environment preservation. This requires to also reduce energy consumption in as much sectors as possible including wireless communication networks. This paper proposes to extend the opportunistic approach with the proposition of a new scheduling solution enables to significantly decrease the system energy consumption. Performance evaluations will show that the global energy consumption can be divided by 2 compared to existing schedulers without jeopardizing system efficiency.

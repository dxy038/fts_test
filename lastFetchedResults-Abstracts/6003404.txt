Many types of objective functions have been proposed for knowledge reduction in rough set theory. These functions satisfy different reduction standard for preserving a certain discernible ability of decision systems. In this paper, different types of objective functions are studied, and the relation among them are analyzed and proved. Then the reduction of preserving corresponding discernible ability can be achieved based on these objective functions conveniently.

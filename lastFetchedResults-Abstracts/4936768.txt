In this paper we present a new approach for laser-based environment device control systems by laser pointer for handicapped people. The paper proposes the design of a Fuzzy Rule Base System for laser pointer detection. The idea is to improve the success rate of the previous approaches decreasing as much as possible the false offs, i.e., the detection of a false laser spot (since this could lead to dangerous situations). To this end, Genetic Fuzzy Systems have also been employed for improving the laser spot system detection thus reducing the system false offs, that is the main objective in this problem. The system presented in this paper, using a Fuzzy Rule Base System adjusted by a Genetic Algorithm, shows a better success rate, and the most important thing, the not desired false offs are completely avoided.

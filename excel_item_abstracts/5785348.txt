An adaptive power converter control system that contains an adaptive fuzzy controller is presented. The proposed APCCS (adaptive power converter control system) combines fuzzy logic with adaptive learning algorithm to adjust parameters of the fuzzy control to the most appropriate values. Neither the exact mathematical models of power converters nor the tuning process of the parameters of the fuzzy control are needed in the proposed system. The transient, steady-state responses, and load regulation of the proposed system will be compared with those of the conventional fuzzy logic control system through the simulation results.

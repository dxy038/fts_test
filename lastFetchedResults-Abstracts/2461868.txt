ITER project's long time span and the nature of the instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) procurement procedures for the Plant Systems require that the ITER Organization defines and follows well recognized standards which are used both by the industry and in physics experiments. The ITER I&amp;C standards are defined in the Plant Control Design Handbook (PCDH) [1]. The ITER Organization has selected PCI Express and Ethernet for IO intercommunication to be used for plant system instrumentation for fast controllers. The decision on the usage of serialized I/O bus protocols is based on the impressive performance and the commercial availability. The form factors that will be supported by CODAC include PXIe, MicroTCA, and AdvancedTCA platforms. While the PXIe form factor is already well established for instrumentation purposes through the PXI Systems Alliance (www.pxisa.org), the AdvancedTCA and MicroTCA platforms which were originally targeted for the telecommunications market (www.picmg.org) are currently optimized and specified for instrumentation use through the xTCA extensions for physics [2]. The objective of this study is the evaluation of an integrated ATCA controller design using only commercial components.

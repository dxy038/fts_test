The paper deals with soil probing by a set of emitterdetectors moving along a well. In a first step, the problem of retrieving permittivity and conductivity from the measured signals is analyzed in the framework of a simple but realistic one-dimensional model. An iterative optimization approach is adopted, making use of classical techniques of the theory of optimization. An objective function is defined, and its gradient is calculated with the help of an "adjoint field." Some results are given that show the ability of the method to reconstruct permittivity and conductivity profiles.

Abstract-This paper describes the design and modeling of a smart uncooled infrared detector with wavelength selectivity in the long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) band. The objective is to enhance the probability of detecting and identifying objects in a scene. This design takes advantage of the smart properties of vanadium dioxide (VO<sub>2</sub>): it can switch reversibly from an IR-transparent to an IR-opaque thin film when properly triggered. This optical behavior is exploited here as a smart mirror that can modify the depth of the resonant cavity between the suspended thermistor material and a patterned mirror on the substrate, thereby altering wavelength sensitivity. The thermistor material used in the simulation is vanadium oxide (VO<sub>x</sub>). The simulation results show that, when VO<sub>2</sub> is used in the metallic phase, it reflects IR radiation back to the suspended VO<sub>x</sub> and enhances IR absorption in the 9.4-10.8-&#956;m band. When the film is switched to the semiconductor phase, it admits most IR radiation, which is then reflected back to the suspended VO&#967; by a patterned gold thin film under an SiO<sub>2</sub> spacer layer. The spacer layer is used to increase the resonant cavity depth underneath the microbolometer pixel. Thus, the peak absorption value is shifted to 8-9.4 &#956;m, creating the second spectral band. The detector is designed with a relatively low thermal conductance of 1.71 X 10<sup>-7</sup> W/K to maximize responsivity (R<sub>v</sub>) to values as high as 1.27 X 10<sup>5</sup> W/K and detectivity (D*) to as high as 1.62 x 10<sup>9</sup> cm-Hz<sup>1/2</sup>/W, both at 60 Hz. The corresponding thermal time constant is equal to 2.45 ms. Hence, these detectors could be used for 60-Hz frame rate applications. The extrapolated noise equivalent temperature difference is 14 and 16 mK for the 8-9.4- and 9.4-10.8-&#956;m bands, respectively. The calculated absorption coefficients in the two spectral bands were 59% and- - 65%, respectively.

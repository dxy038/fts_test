Objective
This study was undertaken to analyze the frequency and the determinants of long-term clinically detectable recurrence rate of deep, ovarian, and pelvic endometriosis.
Study design
The clinical data of 1106 women with first diagnosis of endometriosis observed between 1979 and 2001 were collected.
Results
The 4-year recurrence rate was 24.6%, 17.8%, 30.6% and 23.7%, respectively, for cases of ovarian, pelvic, deep, and ovarian and pelvic endometriosis (P< .05). The recurrence rates decreased in all groups (with the exception of ovarian endometriosis) in the class age 34 years or older, these findings were significant (P< .05). Radicality was associated with lower recurrence rates in all the groups. A pregnancy after diagnosis was associated with a reduced risk of recurrence.
Conclusion
The study shows that the recurrence rates of endometriosis were higher in case of deep endometriosis and that the risk factors for recurrence were similar among women with endometriosis at different sites.

Robots appear to be engaging to many children with autism, and evidence suggests that engagement can facilitate social interaction not only between child and robot but also between child and another human. To date, no objective evidence has established a link between short-term child-robot interactions and long-term child-human interactions. We report on a therapy model that uses a robot in no more than 20% of available therapy time, and describe how a humanoid robot can be used during that limited time to promote generalizable child-human interactions. Preliminary evidence indicates that such low-dose robotics can promote positive child-human interactions.

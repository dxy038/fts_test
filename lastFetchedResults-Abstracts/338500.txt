Objective
The homeobox gene Hoxb8 is activated in the murine myelomonocytic cell line WEHI-3B as a result of intracisternal A particle integration. Cooperative activation between Hoxa9 and Meis1 is induced by retroviral integration in BXH2 murine myeloid leukemias and the myeloid leukemia cell line M1. The present study was conducted to examine possible Meis gene activation and cooperative DNA binding of homeobox proteins in WEHI-3B and to reveal the specific role of Hox and Meis genes in myeloid differentiation.
Materials and Methods

Northern blot analysis and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were performed to examine homeobox genes expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed to evaluate DNA binding of homeobox proteins. Myeloid differentiation of 32Dcl3 was induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.
Results

Meis2 was coactivated with Hoxb8 in WEHI-3B cells. DNA-protein complexes including Hox, Meis, and Pbx were observed in WEHI-3B and 32Dcl3. Expression and the DNA-binding complex of Hoxa9, Hoxb8, Meis1, and Meis2 were down-regulated during myeloid differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells. Enforced expression of Hox or Meis genes inhibited myeloid differentiation of 32Dcl3.
Conclusion

The results indicate that Meis2 is an important Meis gene for myeloid leukemogenesis and that Hox and Meis are important genes for myeloid leukemogenesis through differentiation block.

The main objective of this work is to show the versatility of an innovative mesh-free numerical
scheme, which allows the solution of the coupled transport equations governing the evolution of
a system of multi-ion electrolytes, by mean of the use of radial basis functions interpolation and
a nesting approach. The nesting approach is used in order to capture the detail behaviour of the
solution near a solid wall i.e. at the diffusion–reaction layer. As a numerical example the problem
of silver deposition on a rotating disk is analysed. The versatility of the proposed numerical scheme
is proved by solving the proposed electrochemical phenomena imposing three different kinds of
boundary conditions at the solid wall (Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin). The obtained numerical results
are compared with simplified analytical approximation of the corresponding problems. The effect of
the ligand concentration on the others species is considered and a comparison between the obtained
concentration profiles for the complex AgS2O−
3 and Ag(S2O3)
−3
2 when the concentration of the ligand
S2O−2
3 takes different values is shown

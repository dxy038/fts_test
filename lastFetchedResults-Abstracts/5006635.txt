This paper presents an efficient method for the multi-objective reconfiguration of radial distribution systems in fuzzy framework using adaptive particle swarm optimization. The initial population for particle swarm optimization is created using a heuristic approach and the particles are adapted with the help of graph theory to make feasible solutions. This avoids tedious mesh check and hence reduces the computational burden. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on 83-bus test system. The simulation results show that the proposed method is efficient and promising for multi-objective reconfiguration of radial distribution systems.

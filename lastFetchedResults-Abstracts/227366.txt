Genetic algorithms (GAS) are applied
to determine the worst-case overvoltage caused by
non-simultaneous energisation of mass rapid
transit (MRT) power distribution systems. Two
GA-based optimisation methods are compared,
using case studies performed on a typical MRT
system. Simulation results show that the objective
function of the GA problem is highly multimodal,
discontinuous and noisy, which makes it
difficult for the traditional sequential search
method to obtain global optimisation. Although
the effectiveness of the GA approach is verified,
one drawback of the approach is that it can be
CPU time-intensive. The GA approach performs
many executions of the electromagnetic transient
program for function evaluations. The micro-GA
(PGA) is proposed as an alternative to the simple
GA. Results show that the PGA performs fewer
function evaluations as it searches over the
response surface more efficiently than the simple
GA.

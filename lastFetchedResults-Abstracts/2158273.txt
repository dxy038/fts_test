The main objective of the present work was to investigate the effect of surfactant chain length on the structure, porosity and bioactivity of 92S6 (92% SiO2, 6% CaO, and 2% P2O5 mol%) mesoporous solâ€“gel glasses. The aim was to provide a basis for controlling the porosity of the glass to obtain a control of bioactive behavior. A series of mesoporous bioactive glasses were synthesized using three different surfactants (C10H20BrN, C19H42BrN, C22H48BrN). Surfactant type dependence on the textural properties, particularly porosity and bioactivity were studied. Results indicate that the bioactivity factors were improved by a short surfactant carbon length.

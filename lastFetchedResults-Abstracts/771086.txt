Pelargonium sidoides (Geraniaceae) is a medicinal plant used for the treatment of various infections including tuberculosis and bronchitis. Traditionally, only the roots of the plant are used for medicinal formulations in the Eastern Cape. In addition to traditional uses, there is a great demand for the plant for export, therefore, the rate of its harvesting and the number of its collector has increased in recent years. This has led to a drastic drop in the population of the species in the wild. A method that could achieve the sustainable harvesting of P. sidoides would be to substitute its shoot for the roots in medicinal formulations. A comparative study of the antibacterial activities of the leaves and the roots of the plant was conducted on the materials collected from three different populations. Generally, both the shoot and the roots of P. sidoides have antimicrobial properties. There was no significant observable difference between the MIC of extracts from both parts. The choice of the root by the traditional healers over the leaves may be arbitrary or due to easy collection. The leaves of P. sidoides may, as well, substitute for its roots in medicinal formulations especially in the treatment of bacterial diseases like tuberculosis and bronchitis.

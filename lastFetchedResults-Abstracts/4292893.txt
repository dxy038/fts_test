This paper presents a novel generalized particle duality approach (GPDA) to transform the problem-solving for multi-agent systems into the kinematics and dynamics of particles in dual force-fields. Since the resources allocation and task assignment in complex distributed network environment is a typical problem of multi-agent systems, GPDA is used to optimize the bandwidth allocation and QoS assignment in ATM networks. The construction, dynamics and properties of the GPDA and corresponding algorithm are discussed. The GPDA has many advantages in terms of the high-scale parallelism, multi-objective optimization, multi-type coordination, multi-degree autonomy, and the ability to deal randomly occurring phenomena in MAS systems

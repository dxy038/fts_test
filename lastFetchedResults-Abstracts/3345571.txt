Scheduling of water resources is the rational utilization of water resources and the main way and effective means to solve the shortage of water resources, it has some characteristics of more users, more water, multi-level and multi-objective. Chaos genetic algorithm (CGA) can be solved in the process of water resources scheduling problem such as slow convergence speed, easy to fall into local optimization, but there are some limitations in the practical application. In this paper, by using multi-objective decision scheduling, real-time and regularity of rainfall will be combined with chaos genetic algorithm (GA), a more reasonable adjustment of water supply, water resources allocation optimization. The simulation results show that multi-objective decision-making based on chaos genetic algorithm can better satisfy user needs, stick to the waste water, improve the satisfaction degree of the water, more comprehensive benefits.

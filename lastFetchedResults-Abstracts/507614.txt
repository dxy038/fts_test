Introduction and objective: Dental caries is a common oral bacterial pathology that has been associated with Streptococcus spp., mainly Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. Antibacterial activities of Terminalia chebula extracts against several bacterial strains have been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible antimicrobial potential of T. chebula fruit extracts (acetone, ethanol, methanol, cold and hot aqueous) against five dental caries causing microorganisms. 
Materials and methods: For this purpose, three bacteria S. mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and two yeasts Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were tested. Antimicrobial activity was tested using agar well diffusion method. All the tested extracts showed antibacterial activity against two bacteria S. mutans and S. aureus but no antimicrobial activity was observed against L. acidophilus, C. albicans and S. cerevisiae. 
Results: The highest activity was shown by the acetonic extract with a mean diameter of inhibition zone being 25.32mm and a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 25mg/ml against S. mutans and a mean diameter of 32.97mm and a MIC of 12.5mg/ml against S. aureus followed by ethanolic, hot aqueous, cold aqueous and methanolic extracts. 
Conclusion: These promising findings suggest the presence of antibacterial activity in the tested plant material, exhibited by its bioactive compounds, and serving them as an alternative antimicrobial agent against dental caries causing microorganisms.

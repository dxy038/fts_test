In this paper, we address an earliness/tardiness scheduling problem in identical parallel machine system with an objective of minimizing the maximum weighted absolute lateness. Genetic algorithms are applied to solve this problem. The performance of proposed procedure is compared with exiting heuristic procedure on randomly generated test problems. The results show that the proposed approach performs well for this problem.

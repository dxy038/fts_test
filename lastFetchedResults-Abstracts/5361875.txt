In the first part of this paper, we address the topic of waterside security as part of the maritime environment. The specific difficulties of measurements in the maritime domain are addressed and then further specified for the tasks in waterside security. Given the objectives of waterside security, the available technologies are scanned from the perspective of multi-sensor networks. Interestingly, a forecast from 1998 given by the Secretary-General of the United Nations describes very well the toolbox of solutions available now. We map recent journal literature as evidence for this observation, and conclude that distributive sensor network based robots are the tool of choice for waterside security. In the second part, we analyze available design parameters of such networks. Then, a new concept for multi-agent surveillance is developed. However, in the present version this concept is not addressing all necessary aspects listed in the detailed objective list. Therefore, the paper concludes with recommendations for the way ahead.

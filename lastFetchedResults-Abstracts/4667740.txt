This paper outlines the workforce development thrust in the Power System Engineering Research Center´s (PSERC) new initiative funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) to investigate requirements for a systematic transformation of today´s electric grid to enable high penetrations of sustainable energy systems. There is a projected shortage of workforce for this objective and this workforce will need to be educated with a different set of skills and tools than has been done in the past. It is this workforce that will produce innovative ideas and transformative changes needed to orchestrate a clean and sustainable energy smart grid. The relevant education of this workforce is recognized as critical to the success of the future grid. University faculty can best play their role in this work force development through filling the needs of its education. This thrust has six tasks aimed at both the breadth and depth of education needed for the emerging grid.

With the ultimate objective in contributing to the improvement of the quality control of drinking water and to facilitate the checking of its compliance with the respective regulations, an inventory of analytical techniques used in water supply companies in Eastern and Western European countries is presented. The existing regulations for drinking water and bottled mineral water quality with respect to trace elements in these countries are compared to regulations of the World Health Organisation. The data obtained can be useful for further harmonisation of the respective regulations in Europe.

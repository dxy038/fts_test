Mobile telecommunication systems and fixed telecommunication networks are developed as stand-alone systems and exist as separate and independent systems, interconnected at just a few points. A main objective of third generation mobile systems is to specify mobile-specific functionality as an integral part of fixed networks. The paper addresses the (possible) integration of future mobile and fixed systems, UMTS and B-ISDN. It proposes the use of advanced broadband basic call functions for the support of mobile call setup and handover, addresses the common use of a communication infrastructure, and finally, investigates the support of handover by B-ISDN multi-party call capabilities

Upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, non-toxic hexacyanoferrate (II) image undergoes direct photolysis, resulting in the liberation of toxic free cyanide (HCN, CN−). This experimental study employed manipulation of several environmental parameters with the objective of characterizing their effects on the photolysis rate of hexacyanoferrate (II). The photolysis rate was not affected significantly by varying (1) the initial hexacyanoferrate (II) concentration (from 10 to 400 μg/l as total CN), (2) the solution turbidity (kaolin clay concentration from 0 to 5 mg/l), and (3) pH (from pH 4 to 12). Parameters that exhibited a significant effect (significance level, α < 0.05) on the photolysis rate included the intensity of incident ultraviolet radiation (from 30 to 110 image) and the concentration of dissolved organic matter (color) from added humic acid (from 0 to 10 mg/l). In addition, observations made by spiking both deionized and natural waters demonstrated that the rate of hexacyanoferrate (II) photolysis (1) significantly exceeded the rate of free cyanide formation from photolysis and (2) exhibited significant retardation that directly depended on the free cyanide concentration in solution. The hexacyanoferrate (II) photolysis data were consistent with a simple, semi-empirical kinetic model that included the reversible formation of at least one cyanoferrate intermediate. The reverse reaction, in turn, behaved in a manner that was consistent with a second order rate law with respect to free cyanide concentration.

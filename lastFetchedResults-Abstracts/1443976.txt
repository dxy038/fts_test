This paper deals with the position control of Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) without linear velocity measurements. We propose a multistage constructive procedure, exploiting the cascade property of the translational and rotational dynamics. More precisely, we consider the force as a virtual control input for the translational dynamics, from which we extract the required (desired) system attitude and thrust achieving the tracking objective. Thereafter, the control torque is designed to drive the actual attitude to the desired one. A nonlinear observer, as well as some instrumental auxiliary variables are used to obviate the need for the linear velocity. Global asymptotic stability of the overall closed loop system is achieved. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

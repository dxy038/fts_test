This paper deals with construction project scheduling. In the literature on the subject one can find such scheduling methods as: the Linear Scheduling Model (LSM), Line of Balance (LOB) charts and CMP/PERT network planning. The methods take into account several objective functions: the least cost, the least time, limited resources, work priorities, etc., both in the deterministic and probabilistic approach. The paper presents an analysis of the time/cost relationship, performed using time coupling method TCM III. A modified hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA) developed by Bożejko and Wodecki (A Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm for Some Discrete Optimization Problems. IEEE Computer Society, 325–331, 2005) was used for optimization.

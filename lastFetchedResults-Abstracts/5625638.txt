Based on the detailed analysis of PCA transform, WT transform and IHS transform, a new fusion method was presented-PWI transformation: First, multispectral image was transformed by HIS, and then the obtained brightness component-I was transformed by PCA to extract the first principal component- PC1. Using wavelet transform, the PC1 and panchromatic images were fused, and then the results were used to replace the brightness components of the multispectral image. Finally the new multispectral image was got by the inverse IHS transformation. Subjective visual effect analysis and objective evaluation indicate that the new method was superior to the single one of three fusion methods of HIS, the wavelet transform and PCA, enhanced the representability of image spatial detail largely, and well reserved the spectral information of the multispectral image.

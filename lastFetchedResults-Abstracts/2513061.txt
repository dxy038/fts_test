<p><strong>Objective:</strong> This study aimed to assess the value of Chlamydia trachomatis (C.trachomatis) antibodytiter test in prediction ofÂ  tubal damage.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods</strong>: In this case-control study we enrolled50 women with tubal factor infertility (proven by laparoscopy after hysterosalpingography) and 110 women without infertility history. ELISA was performed for all participants, seeking C.trachomatis IgG antibodies. ELISA for<em> </em>IgM was then performed for women with positive test. Statistical package for social science version 11 was used for data entry. Statistical evaluation was performed using student t test, Fisher exact and chi-square tests. Statistical significance was defi ned as P&lt;0.05. <br /><strong>Results</strong>: In 8(5%) of all women the C.trachomatis IgG antibodywas positive .Five (10%) of the infertilepatients and 3 (2.7%) of pregnant women had positive tests (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.03). All of them had negative results for IgM antibodies. Twenty five percent of women with normal hysterosalpingography and 5.3% of women with abnormal hysterosalpingography had positive antibody test. There was not any correlation between antibody titer and abnormal HSG. Endometriosis was diagnosed in seven women with negative antibody results.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The result of C.trachomatis antibody titer was significantly different in women with and without infertility Laparoscopic. Tubalassessment is recommended in infertile women with a positive result of theC. trachomatis antibody titer. </p>

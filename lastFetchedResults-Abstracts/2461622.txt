In this paper, an Electron Beam (EB) welded mock-up is used for the calibration of the finite element method welding simulation developed. Once the method is validated, a new simulation welding sequence is proposed with the objective to reduce the mock-up final distortions. The final distortions should be reduced from 7 mm to 1 mm.

tion measures and final deformed shapes are compared between two simulation scenarios to establish the effects of the new provisions assumed. The new simulation scenario includes a balanced longitudinal weld sequence in order to minimize the effects of the accumulative angular distortion process. The power of the FE method developed is demonstrated and will allow the optimization of the welding sequences to carry out previous simulation in FEM in future applications of ITER.

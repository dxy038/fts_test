Objective
that locoregional recurrences developing from a tissue with potentially malignant disorders (PMD) in oral mucosa are a frequent cause of therapeutic failure, and that tissue with PMD is dose-limiting, the aim of the present study was to develop a model of tissue with PMD to evaluate the long-term therapeutic/toxic effects of different therapeutic modalities.
als and methods
luated 5 carcinogenesis protocols based on topical application of the carcinogen dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene in the hamster cheek pouch, twice a week for 4, 6, 7, and 8 weeks and the classical 3 times a week for 12 weeks.
s
erm follow-up (8 months after protocol completion) was only possible with the 4- and 6-week carcinogenesis protocols. Tumour development increased progressively with time and aggressiveness of the carcinogenesis protocols. The time at which tumours developed in ≥90% of the animals was at protocol completion (T0) for the 12-week protocol, 1 month post-T0 for the 8-week protocol, 3 months post-T0 for the 7-week protocol and 4 months post-T0 for the 6-week protocol. &lt;40% of the animals in the 4-week protocol developed tumours within the 8 months follow-up period. DNA synthesis rose as a function of time and protocol aggressiveness.
sions
week carcinogenesis protocol was selected for long-term studies of different therapeutic modalities in tissue with PMD because it permitted long-term follow-up and guaranteed tumour development in ≥90% of the animals.

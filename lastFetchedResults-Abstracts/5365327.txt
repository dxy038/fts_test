Network traffic signal control in oversaturated scenarios has to be disposed systematically. Three main components, traffic flow models, network control objectives and control strategies, are critical in it. This study selects the cell transmission model (CTM) to describe traffic flow characteristics and design an optimal control model using one kind of network throughput performance indices, system dispersal time, as the control objective. Signal timing plans are calculated by gene algorithm optimization with single cycle strategy (SCS) and double cycle strategy (DCS) respectively. Results show that a proper non-maximum cycle length will disperse congested network vehicles rapidly and fixed double cycle strategy is feasible in oversaturated network traffic control especially with higher priority in artery

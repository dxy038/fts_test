Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate if the sugar alcohols erythritol, xylitol and sorbitol enhance the fungicidal effect of benzethonium chloride (BTC) toward in vitro candidal biofilms.
Methods

An in vitro Candida albicans biofilm was formed on a plastic coverslip coated with type I collagen. The enhancement of the fungicidal effect was evaluated using microbial assay after treating the biofilm with the test solutions (sugar alcohols: erythritol, xylitol, and sorbitol, each containing BTC solution).
Results

No fungicidal effect was observed with sugar alcohols without BTC. The fungicidal effect of erythritol-containing BTC increased with the erythritol concentration. Further, the level of enhancement of erythritol was the highest in three sugar alcohols.
Conclusion

Sugar alcohols, especially erythritol, enhanced the fungicidal effect of BTC toward in vitro candidal biofilms.

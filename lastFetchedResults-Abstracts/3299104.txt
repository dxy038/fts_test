The problem of assignment containers to AIVs in a container terminal is a complex problem, it is a combination of several problems, the dispatching problem, the vehicles routing problem and the scheduling problem. Each problem of these depends on some criteria, this makes the global problem as a multi-criteria problem. To solve this type of problem, the idea is to consider it like a mono-objective problem depending on each criterion separately. An aggregation function is calculated according to different criteria. The coefficient value of each criterion is proposed by an expert, these values can give the nearest Pareto front solution. The approach proposed in this work is a hybrid approach, genetic algorithm and Dijkstra algorithm. This approach is tested with different numbers of vehicles, for each problem separately, in order to have the best solution. The numeric results show the performance of our approach for the multi-objective problem.

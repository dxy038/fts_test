This paper investigates the problem of multiuser packet scheduling and resource allocation for video transmission over downlink OFDMA networks. A cross-layer optimization function is proposed with the goal to maximize the received video quality. Unlike the previous methods in which the objective function is estimated the video quality in the unit of bit, the proposed algorithm develop the objective function in unit of packet, which is more fit for video transmission. In order to solve the optimization problem in a low complexity, a suboptimal algorithm for packet scheduling and resource allocation is proposed. The algorithm is compatible with the emerging wireless standards, such as IEEE 802.16. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the previous resource allocation schemes in terms of received video qualities.

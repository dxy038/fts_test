This paper presents a novel, fast integer interior point programming method that incorporates a branch and bound technique with the interior point linear programming technique to optimize the multi-objective problem under operating and radiality constraints to solve the stressed distribution system. The reliability of the integrated reconfiguration scheme for performing service restoration and load balancing on a stressed distribution system are investigated. Reliability assessments of different reconfigured topologies are performed using reliability indices based on the expected unserved energy (EUE) and the number of outage customers for each topology considered. The integrated scheme has been tested on a benchmark 32-bus distribution system under different contingencies considering service restoration and load balancing as constraints. The accuracy and speed of the integer optimization based scheme has been compared to the well-known methods.

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic effects of composites which employ proprietary self-etching primers or experimental primers containing an antibacterial monomer 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (MDPB) on human pulpal cells by in vitro dentine barrier tests.

Methods: Experimental primers were prepared by the addition of MDPB to each of two control proprietary primers at 1, 2 and 5%. Direct and indirect composite specimens were placed using each primer on one side of a dentine disk assembled in a simple pulp chamber device. Human pulp cells were incubated on the other side of the disk. After 48 h of incubation, the uptake of [3H]-thymidine by the cells was compared with that for negative controls using wax. Tests were repeated four times for each material. The diffusion of monomers from each specimen was determined using the same device.

Results: The specimens with control primers showed 26–35% reduction in cell activity. There were no significant differences in cytotoxicity between the control and experimental primers-specimens (Kruskal–Wallis test, p>0.05). 2-Hydroxyethyl methacrylate at more than 1 mg ml−1 diffused from all specimens and was considered to be the cause of cytotoxic effects. The concentrations of MDPB diffused from the experimental primers-specimens were less than the toxic level, even for 5% MDPB-containing specimens.

Conclusions: The results demonstrate that composites employing proprietary self-etching primers produced cytotoxic effects on human pulpal cells in vitro, although the toxicity was not severe. Incorporation of MDPB into a proprietary primer of up to 5% had no significant influence on the cytotoxicity observed.

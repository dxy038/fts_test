Objective
Due to excessive production of free radicals and antioxidants evolved
mechanisms against oxidative stress, infants are very vulnerable. As there was
a significant relation between antioxidant levels and birth weight, we aimed
verify this relationship.
Materials & Methods
In this descriptive analytical study we evaluated the antioxidant status of 40
healthy term newborns (gestation age 38-42 wk) with weight  > 2500 g (AGA)
and 40 healthy term newborns (gestation age 38-42 wk) with LBW babies
(weight  <  2500 g) (SGA) in Ardabil Buali Hospital, Ardabil, northwest Iran in
2014. About 15 Ml of cord blood was collected after the second stage of labor.
The levels of vitamin A, E, and C, catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPX),
bilirubin and serum uric acid were measured by standard methods. Informed
consent was obtained from newborn mothers and study protocol was approved
by university Ethics Committee. Data were analyzed using SPSS.19.
Results
The mean levels of bilirubin, vitamin C, E, catalase and GPX in AGA group
were significantly higher than SGA group but the mean of serum uric acid
in SGA group was more than AGA. In addition, the mean of vitamin A was
similar in two groups.
There was a significant relation between antioxidant levels and birth weight in
term newborns.
Conclusion
In line with other studies the amounts of antioxidant levels except serum uric
acid in AGA group was significantly more than SGA group.

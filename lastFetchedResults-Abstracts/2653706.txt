Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of slice thickness on the visibility of inferior
alveolar canal (IAC) in cone?beam computed tomography (CBCT) images.
Materials and Methods: CBCT images of thirty patients (15 male and 15 female) with an age
range between 40–50 years old were used. Cross?sectional images were obtained with 0.5, 1, and
2 mm slice thickness and 2 mm interval. Two oral radiologists with at least 5 years’ of experience
observed all of the 90 images and rated the images based on the visibility of IAC in a 4?score
classification (highly visible, visible, nearly visible, nearly invisible). Friedman test was used for the
comparison of visibility of IAC in different slice thicknesses. To do the above test, the average of
the scores of two examiners was calculated. A P. value below 0.05 was considered significant.
Results: Visibility of IAC in different slice thicknesses of both raters showed no significant difference
(P = 0.20).
Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study the slice thickness has no effect on visibilit

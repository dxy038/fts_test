This paper surveys single-project, single-objective, deterministic project scheduling problems in which activities can be processed using a finite or infinite (and uncountable) number of modes concerning resources of various categories and types. The survey is based on a unified framework of a project scheduling model including resources, activities, objectives, and schedules. Most important models and solution approaches across the class of problems are characterized, and directions for future research are pointed out.

The well-known state feedback with integral control is applied to the multioperating point pulse-width modulated push-pull DC-DC convertor. A new large-signal circuit model of the power stage is modified so that the load resistance is eliminated from the system matrix. Two closed-loop continuous-conduction mode push-pull convertors are designed using a pole-placement technique: (a) a conventional convertor with a diode rectifier; and (b) a convertor with a small inductor and a bidirectional power flow. The large-signal dynamic performance of these convertors is investigated by simulations in the time domain. It was found that the state feedback with integral control in the bidirectional power-flow convertor is suitable for switched-load applications, e.g. radar systems, dot-matrix printers, and power supplies for random-access computer memories

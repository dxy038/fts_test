Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) was first isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with various lymphoproliferative disorders, and then identified as the main pathogen of roserash and acute febrile illness of early childhood. The primary HHV-6 infection in adults is related to many diseases, such as necrotizing lymphadenitis, chronic fatigue syndrome, hepatitis and mononucleosis-like syndromes. Like most other herpes-viruses, after primary infection, HHV-6 is likely to remain latent in the host and can be reactivated in immunosuppressed states, leading to critical clinical symptoms such as interstitial pneumonitis. At present, little is known about the mechanism of latency and reactivation of HHV-6 so there is no effective specificity drug on HHV-6 infection. Therefore, it is very important to find safety and effective anti-HHV6 drugs. To study the anti-HHV-6 action of Baicalin, the human T-cell strain was used to do the anti-HHV-6 effect in vitro. The result shows that Baicalin has evident effect on cytopathic effect (CPE) caused by HHV-6 GS. This result prompts that Baicalin has therapeutical effect on infection caused by HHV-6.

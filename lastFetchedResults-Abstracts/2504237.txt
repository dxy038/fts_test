Background: Fetal alcohol syndrome is associated with numerous problems in the development
and function of the brain. Learning and memory deficits are among well known effects of prenatal
exposure to alcohol.
Objective: This study aimed to examine the spatial working memory of 60-day old rats who were
exposed to alcohol during their fetal life and to find the relation between the possible alcoholimpaired
spatial memory and gestational period of exposure to alcohol.
Materials and Methods: Pregnant rats in different stages of gestation period were administered
with ethanol. Using a radial arm maze, the offspring were subjected to spatial working memory
training at 60 days of postnatal age.
Results: The rats exposed to ethanol during the first 10 days of fetal life indicated lower
performances compared to the controls. Those receiving alcohol during the second half of
pregnancy period had no problem in maze navigation. Behavior of the animals exposed to alcohol
during the first and the second quarter of the gestation period demonstrated that only the latter were
weak in solving maze tasks. The groups related to the third and the forth quarter of gestation period
had a similar behavior with the control group. Comparison of the animals' performances in all
groups revealed that only the second quarter group was the most disadvantaged.
Conclusion: Our data indicates that the second quarter of the gestation period is more sensitive to
harmful effects of alcohol on the areas of brain involved in learning and memory. Since the
hippocampus is central in cognitive functions and this part of brain is highly vulnerable to alcohol
effects it can be concluded that the hippocampus is mostly affected in the second quarter of prenatal
life.

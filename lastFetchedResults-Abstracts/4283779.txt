We present a method to reduce blocking and ringing artifacts in H.264/AVC video sequences. For deblocking, the proposed method uses a quality measure of a block based coded image to find filtering modes. Based on filtering modes, the images are segmented to three classes and a specific deblocking filter is applied to each class. Deringing is obtained by an adaptive bilateral filter; spatial and intensity spread parameters are selected adaptively using texture and edge mapping. The analysis of objective and subjective experimental results shows that the proposed algorithm is effective in deblocking and deringing low bit-rate H.264 video sequences.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of robenacoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, for the treatment of post-operative pain and inflammation in cats. The study was a prospective, multi-centre, randomised, blinded, non-inferiority design clinical study to compare robenacoxib to meloxicam. Ninety-six cats undergoing surgery at eight centres in Japan were allocated randomly to receive a single SC injection of robenacoxib (2 mg/kg, n = 67) or meloxicam (0.3 mg/kg, n = 29) shortly before induction of anaesthesia. Most cats underwent soft tissue surgery (n = 87), mainly ovariectomy (n = 68). Post-operative pain and inflammation were assessed at 3, 8 and 22 h after recovery from anaesthesia using numerical rating scales.

e primary efficacy endpoint (total clinician score), robenacoxib had significantly better efficacy than meloxicam, the relative efficacy ratio being 1.47 (95% confidence interval 1.19â€“1.78, P = 0.0003). For the secondary efficacy endpoints, robenacoxib was superior to meloxicam when assessed on the basis of posture, behaviour, pain on palpation and overall pain control, while meloxicam was superior with respect to wound heat. No cat in either group required rescue analgesia therapy. In tolerability assessments, pain during injection and pain and inflammation at the injection site 22 h after recovery from anaesthesia were rated significantly less with robenacoxib compared to meloxicam. Both treatments were well tolerated on the basis of clinical observations and blood tests, with no significant differences between groups. In conclusion, single pre-operative administration of robenacoxib was well tolerated and had superior efficacy to meloxicam in reducing post-operative pain in cats.

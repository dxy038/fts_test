In this paper, we propose a new mechanism to maintain diversity in multi-objective optimization problems. The proposed mechanism is based on the use of stripes that are applied on objective function space and that is independent of the search engine adopted to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. In order to validate the proposed approach, we included it in a multi-objective particle swarm optimizer. Our approach was compared with respect to two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, which are representative of the state-of-the-art in the area. The results obtained indicate that our proposed mechanism is a viable alternative to maintain diversity in the context of multi-objective optimization.

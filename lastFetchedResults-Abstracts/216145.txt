Background: Since AIDS is not only a vital medical problem, but also a socioeconomic complication,
therefore increasing people's knowledge and replacing their unhealthy behavior by a healthy one is of
important consideration. Women, specially in reproductive ages of their life, have a special situation
regarding the probability of pregnancy and infection of their fetus.
Objective: The aim of this study was to explore pregnant women's knowledge about HIV/AIDS, their
perception of risk, risk behavior and management, and their attitudes towards AIDS.
Materials and Methods: In a cross sectional study, a total of 120 pregnant women, who referred to
family health clinics in Yazd, were selected by simple random sampling. Information was collected via a
special designed questionnaire containing 22 questions for evaluating knowledge and 6 questions for
evaluating attitude. Statistical analysis wasperformed using Chi-square test with SPSS software.
Results: The knowledge of pregnant women about AIDS was not significantly different in different age
groups (p==0.151), while it had a significant relationship with their education (p==O.OOO). There was a
correlation between general knowledge and attitude in pregnant women (p=0.033) (r=0.126). The attitude
about AIDS in pregnant women was fairly good and there was a significant difference in this regard
related to their education (p=O.OOO), while there was not significant difference regarding their age
(p==0.410) (Mean == 19.8).
Conclusion: There is an urgent need for HIVprevention efforts, suchas health education and focusing on
the pregnant women in developing world. Health educators should tailor education programs for women
at risk, particularly those with lower education, to enhance their knowledge about HIV and to improve
their attitude about AIDS.

This study applies the NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to the radar phase coded waveform design problem. The MOEAs are used to generate a series of radar waveform phase codes that have excellent range resolution and Doppler resolution capabilities, while maintaining excellent autocorrelation properties. The study compares the ability of NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D to generate a Pareto front of phase code solutions, and then improve upon the quality of the solutions while maintaining a sufficient diversity of available radar phase codes. Results demonstrate that for solving moderate to large instances of the radar phase code problem all three MOEAs generate a diverse set of Pareto optimal radar phase codes. The phase codes generated by NSGA-II have overall better autocorrelation properties than those generated by SPEA2 and MOEA/D, however, all three MOEAs produce useable phase codes.

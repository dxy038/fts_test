In this work, a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem of fuzzy predictive control. The main objective is to obtain an efficient control algorithm with a low computational burden and a good control performance. This is done essentially by reducing both the PSO population and the number of iterations needed for each sampling time. The control accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm are illustrated by considering the control of the continuous stirred tank reactor.

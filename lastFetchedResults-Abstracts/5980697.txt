Over the last decades the electric energy demand has grown significantly considering different areas like power networks and industry. Considering the ecodesign criteria that electrical systems must meet, different European directives were established. The main objective of this criterion is to develop asset management strategies and to manage the operating performances and aging degradation mechanisms of electrical entities under multiple stresses. In this paper was performed a life analysis under multiple stress profiles for two electrical equipments that are used on power supply systems from land transportation: power cables and supercapacitors. In order to model the effect of multiple stresses on lifetime distributions for the considered entities, the Arrhenius-Weibull life model was considered. The analysis was developed using ALTA PRO package software developed by ReliaSoft Corporation and different stress profiles were considered: temperature, humidity, vibrations and on/off cycling operation. The objective of the paper is to develop a comparative analysis regarding the effect of mixed stresses that may occur on power cables/supercapacitors. The results of the performed life analysis are useful tools for asset management strategies development, regarding future performances of a supply power system/energy recovery system.

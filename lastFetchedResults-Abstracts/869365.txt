A different approach to the capacitated single allocation hub location problem is presented. Instead of using capacity constraints to limit the amount of flow that can be received by the hubs, we introduce a second objective function to the model (besides the traditional cost minimizing function), that tries to minimize the time to process the flow entering the hubs. Two bi-criteria single allocation hub location problems are presented: in a first model, total time is considered as the second criteria and, in a second model, the maximum service time for the hubs is minimized. To generate non-dominated solutions an interactive decision-aid approach developed for bi-criteria integer linear programming problems is used. Both bi-criteria models are tested on a set of instances, analyzing the corresponding non-dominated solutions set and studying the reasonableness of the hubs flow charge for these non-dominated solutions. The increased information provided by the non-dominated solutions of the bi-criteria model when compared to the unique solution given by the capacitated hub location model is highlighted.

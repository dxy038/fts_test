Analysis of convolutional windows in fourier and fractional fourier domain is the main objective of the paper. First, the concept of convolutional windows and its necessity is discussed. Next, basics of Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT) and its properties is explained. Later fourier transform and FRFT based analysis of convolutionalwindows is carried out. It has been observed that the sidelobe level of the convolutional windows is less compared to the conventional windows in both fourier and fractional fourier domains. it is also observed that FRFT provides better Sidelobe level compared to fourier transform as the fractional order, &#945; is varied.

Objective: The release of four diffusible angiogenic growth factors in human dental pulp following orthodontic force was investigated by using neutralising growth factor antibodies (NAs), individually and in four different combinations to block their effects. This study investigated if increasing the number of NAs (anti h vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), anti h fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), anti h platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and anti Transforming growth factor beta (TGFÎ²)) in combination resulted in a progressive reduction of the angiogenic response of the pulp. Materials and methods: The dental pulps from two groups of 40 premolar teeth, four teeth from each of 20 patients treated with fixed appliances for 2 weeks, were divided vertically, and sections from each half pulp co-cultured with sections of rat aorta in collagen. In one group, one of each of the four NAs, and in the other group, one of the four different NA combinations were added to the media of the co-cultures from one half of the pulp from each of the four teeth of each patient; the other half pulp co-cultures were controls. Cultures were examined daily by light microscopy for growth and number of microvessels. Results: NAs significantly reduced microvessel numbers in the co-cultures when added individually (P&lt;0.004), and in each of the four combinations (P&lt;0.002), with a trend to progressively reduced microvessel numbers with increasing number of NAs in combination. Conclusions: Results indicated that all four angiogenic growth factors examined were released following orthodontic force application and play a role in the angiogenic response of the pulp, and that these factors may be more effective in combination.

Objective:  To investigate the predictors of life satisfaction in a sample of Iranian students. Method: 236 students (175 females and 61 males) participated in this study. All subjects completed self-esteem, Big Five Inventory, perceived social support and positive and negative affect scales. Data were analyzed using multivariate regression and hierarchical regression analysis. Results: The results of the present study showed that among major personality traits neuroticism, extraversion and conscientiousness could significantly predict hedonic balance among students. In addition, results of hierarchical regression indicated that self-esteem could predict hedonic balance beyond the big five factors of personality, while perceived social support failed to do so. Conclusion:  Big Five personality traits and self-esteem are significant predictors of hedonic balance in Iran, like in many other countries.

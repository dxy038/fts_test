The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical significance of the concentration of serum amyloid A (SAA) in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). SAA protein was determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum samples of 55 healthy controls and 98 RCC patients subdivided into groups with localized tumor (N0M0, n = 40), with lymph node metastases (N1M0, n = 13), and distant metastases (M1, n = 45). SAA concentrations in controls and N0M0 group of RCC were not different while SAA concentrations were significantly elevated in M1 patients compared to the N1M0 and N0M0 patients. In this respect, SAA provided an accurate detection of distant metastases with the area under the ROC curve of 0.86. SAA was identified as a significant independent factor of survival in RCC patients using the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. SAA could be a useful analyte in predicting the survival outcome of RCC patients.

The goal of this paper is to present an approach of the multimodel control for a nonlinear system with a real-time implementation for a wrist of a robot. The objective of this method is to blend the control laws provided by several local controllers. The new idea is to have as a local controller, a fuzzy linearization with pole placement compensation. First, they are needed to be identified. We then use them for the multi-model control by applying a fuzzy switcher (Takagi Sugeno system).

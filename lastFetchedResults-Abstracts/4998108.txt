We consider multicast transmissions in a wireless ad hoc network where nodes randomly compete for access to a shared channel. Our goal is in optimizing a weighted proportional fairness objective of the network throughput. We consider two different forms of multicast: non-guaranteed and guaranteed. In both cases, we characterize the multicast throughput and provide schemes to compute the optimal channel access probabilities.

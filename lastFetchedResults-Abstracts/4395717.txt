A bi-level framework planning model for active distribution network is established, considering the active management and user demands. The minimum annual comprehensive cost is taken as the objective for the upper-level planning model and the minimized disconnected output of DG and load removal is taken as the objective of lower-level planning model. Besides the common constraints, effects of DG on the reliability of distribution network are also considered. Load uncertainties and intermittent output of DG such as wind farm and photovoltaic generation are also taken into account. The upper level of the planning model is solved by partheno-genetic algorithm (PGA) and the lower level is solved by prime-dual interior point method. The reasonableness and effectiveness of the proposed planning model are validated by simulation results of a 29-bus distribution network.

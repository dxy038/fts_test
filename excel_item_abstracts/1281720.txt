Curcumin, a natural and crystalline compound isolated from the plant Curcuma longa with low toxicity in normal cells, has been shown to protect against carcinogenesis and prevent tumor development. However, little is known about antimetastasis effects and mechanism of curcumin in lung cancer. Rac1 is an important small Rho GTPases family protein and has been widely implicated in cytoskeleton rearrangements and cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis. In this study, we examined the influence of curcumin on in vitro invasiveness of human lung cancer cells and the expressions of Rac1. The results indicate that curcumin at 10 μM slightly reduced the proliferation of 801D lung cancer cells but showed an obvious inhibitory effect on epidermal growth factor or transforming growth factor β1-induced lung cancer cell migration and invasion. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that the suppression of invasiveness correlated with inhibition of Rac1/PAK1 signaling pathways and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and 9 protein expression by combining curcumin treatment with the methods of Rac1 gene silence and overexpression in lung cancer cells. Laser confocal microscope also showed that Rac1-regulated actin cytoskeleton rearrangement may be involved in anti-invasion effect of curcumin on lung cancer cell. At last, through xenograft experiments, we confirmed the connection between Rac1 and the growth and metastasis inhibitory effect of curcumin in vivo. In summary, these data demonstrated that low-toxic levels of curcumin could efficiently inhibit migration and invasion of lung cancer cells through inhibition of Rac1/PAK1 signaling pathway and MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression, which provided a novel insight into the molecular mechanism of curcumin against lung cancer.

Glycyrrhizin, the major bioactive component of Glycyrrhiza uralensis, is widely used as a natural sweetener. Recently glycyrrhizin has been shown to have anti-tumor activity, highly active in inhibiting replication of HIV-1 and SARS-associated virus and exhibits a number of pharmacological effects. The principle objective of the current study was to evaluate the effects of different spectral quality including red, blue, white and UV-B radiation on the production of glycyrrhizin, in a controlled environment. Plants were grown under artificial lights with elevated CO2 concentration and both the pot and hydroponic plants were assigned to red and blue light treatments and those grown under white fluorescent lamps were used as control. In a separate experiment, pot plants were exposed to ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation (wavelength: 280–315 nm). The net photosynthetic rates (NPR) of the leaves reduced significantly immediately after exposure to the high intensity UV-B radiation (3 days at 1.13 W m−2). In case of the low intensity UV-B radiation (15 days at 0.43 W m−2), NPR was also reduced, but the rate of reduction was significantly slower than that of the high intensity treatment. The concentrations of glycyrrhizin quantified in the root tissues were highest in the plants grown under red light in both hydroponic and pot systems and the concentration increased linearly from 1- to 3-month-old pot plants. Both the low and high intensity of UV-B exposure increased the concentration of glycyrrhizin in the root tissues of 3-month-old pot plants, the values being nearly X1.5 those of the control. The results also indicate that the glycyrrhizin concentrations of 3–6 months old pot plants were similar or even higher than the previously reported values for 3–4 years old field-grown plants and confirm that high concentration of glycyrrhizin production is possible within a very short production period under controlled environments.

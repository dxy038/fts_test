We propose a bidirectional reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) based wavelength-division-multiplexing passive optical network (WDM-PON) utilizing a differential phase shift keying (DPSK) signal for down-link and an on-off keying (OOK) signal re-modulated for up-link with high extinction-ratio in both directions. A 20 km range colorless WDM-PON without dispersion compensation was demonstrated within low penalty for both 10 Gbit/s downstream and 5 Gbit/s upstream signals. We investigate the impacts of wavelength and the injection power to the RSOA on upstream data. The BER performances of our scheme show that the performance of our scheme is as good as those in case of continuous wave (CW) light injected RSOA. So our scheme is a practical solution to meet the data rate and cost-efficient of the optical links simultaneously in tomorrowÂ´s WDM-PON access networks.

This paper describes the problem caused by near-field sound sources. Formerly, the authors proposed a 2-ch passive subtractive beamformer with a single sharp notch for noise reduction. It is obvious that the single sharp notch is insufficient for dealing with near-field, non-point sound sources. To solve this problem, this paper presents the hybrid subtractive beamformer that is realized as a cascade connection of single subtractive beamformers. The number of connections depends on frequency to minimize the negative effect caused by spatial aliasing when an objective signal is assumed as a wide-band speech signal. The experimental results verifies that the hybrid beamformer has an advantage in reducing signal distortion over the original single subtractive beamformer.

Advances in wireless technology and availability of portable devices with networking capabilities have enabled ubiquitous Web accessibility. This has created the need to provide advance Internet services to mobile users without causing service failures due to connection migration or handoffs. However, scarcity of wireless resources restricts the provision of multimedia services in wireless networks. We address the issue of managing wireless resources to support Web-based multimedia document services including MPEG-4-based applications, in wireless networks with a high degree of user mobility. In particular, we formulate the resource management problem in wireless networks as an optimization problem with an objective function comprising different quality of presentation parameters.

In this paper, reliability study of potential wind generation in Texas has been conducted with the objective of providing some insights into issues that one faces in making various choices. Through comparison between potential onshore and offshore wind farm sites, offshore wind farms prove to have slightly lower reliability due to higher variation of wind patterns. The study also includes the impact of wind farm location, which could be of importance in making operational and planning decisions.

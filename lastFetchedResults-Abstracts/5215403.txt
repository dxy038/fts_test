The objective of this paper is to identify a suitable coating material in order to tune the microwave radiation and produce absorption losses for Wi-Fi devices. It is also desirable to obtain high absorption losses outside the Wi-Fi microwave frequency range of 2.4 GHz. Literature reviews of several types of material are described and compared for the use of the selected material in order to coat a Wi-Fi device for the desired absorption losses for that device. The selected material for the Wi-Fi device is usually a metal material or a combination of metals like Aluminium in polymer matrix with different types of composites. The choice of materials will aim to target the tuning of the electromagnetic spectrum at a frequency in the range of 2.4 GHz. The paper focuses on two groups of polymer materials; conducting material as a result of composites like Carbon Nanotube Composites (CNC) or other metal composites. The second group is the Intrinsic Conducting Polymer (ICP) which conducts as a result of doping with other materials. A third group is the highly conductive metals like copper and aluminum. The metals are used as a reference comparator to the other two groups.

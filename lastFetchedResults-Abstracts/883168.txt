Objective: Suicide is the 13th leading cause of death worldwide and is influenced by cultural, psychological and
social aspects. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of suicide in Bandar Abbas in 2009.
Methods: In a cross-sectional study in 2009, all suicidal patients who were referred to the emergency room (ER) of
Shahid Mohammadi Hospital of Bandar Abbass were enrolled. Fully trained medical interns of the ER first collected
demographic data of the suicidal patients. Then the data, including their reason for attempting suicide, how they
attempted suicide, previous suicide attempts, history of substance use, and the size of the family, were collected by
direct interviewing the patient. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS-16 software.
Results: About 405 patients were enrolled in the study consisting 172 men (44.2%) and 226 (55.8%) women. Mean
age of the participants was 24.29Â±5.5 years. Most of the suicidal patients were 18 to 26 years old (64.2%). Thirtyeight
percent of the women and 62% of the men were addicts. Eleven patients (2.71%) died, including eight men
and three women. The most prevalent method of suicide leading to death was drug toxicity.
Conclusion: Teaching problem-solving skills is an important way to control suicide. Identifying the risk groups,
paying closer attention to the 18-26 age group, and moral support of the patients with previous unsuccessful suicide
attempts might decrease the suicide rate.

Considering the uncertainties of the electronic reconnaissance satellite(ERS) area census in space-frequency domain, the decision elements´ models and the uncertain factors´ quantitive description methods of the ERS area census problem were proposed. A target existing probability forecasting technique based on Bayesian decision-making was put forward, and a multi-objective constrained programming model is established, which aimed to optimize the objectives of the information detecting reward and the front interception reward. Based on the specific characteristics of the problem, we propose a multi-satellite cooperate area census multi-objective evolution algorithm(MSCAC-MOEA) was put forward to improve the pareto optimal solutions, and an initial feasible solution construct algorithm was designed based on the determining of time feasibility, which prevented the algorithm from converging too slowly. The simulation instances proved that the technique could effectively deal with the ERS area census problem and the performance was well.

Kerman is considered an industrial city where different factories and mines are active. The objective of this study was to investigate the concentration of major heavy metals in atmospheric dust in Kerman city and their spatial and temporal variability. Dust samples were collected monthly from 35 different locations distributed over the urban area of Kerman for 7 months from May to November 2012 (a total of 245 samples). After each sampling, samplers were washed and samples were weighed to calculate the rate of dust deposition. Besides, 60 surface soil samples from the non-urban area outside the city and 35 samples from inside the city were taken. After sample preparation, the total concentration of major heavy metals including Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, and Mn was determined by an atomic absorption spectrometer following the digestion of soil and dust samples with 6N HNO3 solution. The results indicated that the concentration of heavy metals in dust was significantly higher than that in soil samples from inside and outside the city. The spatial and temporal distribution of heavy metals in dust as well as the correlations among the heavy metals showed that Cu, Pb, and Zn in dust originated from the same source while the other 2 elements (Ni and Mn) derived from a different source. Cupper, Pb, and Zn in dust seem to derive from industrial complexes and traffic while Ni and Mn appear to come from natural soils. The spatial variability of heavy metals concentration in dust was higher in the western area of Kerman urban area. Topography appears to play a significant role on the distribution of heavy metals in dust. Therefore, it is necessary to understand and control the sources of dust in Kerman for its sustainable management and a healthy environment.

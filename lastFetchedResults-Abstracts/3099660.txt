Introducing voltage stability into optimal reactive power planning, and a mathematical model of multi-objective optimal planning for reactive power is established, in which the network loss, investment of reactive compensation equipment, voltage level and static voltage stability margin are considered. In this paper, firstly singular value decomposition method is applied to identify weak bus as candidate nodes for installing new reactive compensation equipment; then the optimal nodes and capacity of reactive power compensation are obtained by solving the model with fuzzy method and simulated annealing particle swarm optimization (SA-PSO) algorithm. The proposed method has significant improvement in decreasing network loss, improving voltage stability and voltage quality of the whole power system, which is proved by the simulation results of IEEE 14-node system.

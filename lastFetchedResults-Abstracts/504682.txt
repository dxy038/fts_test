The objective of this investigation was a study of inheritance of the quantitative traits in bread wheat by using Generations Mean Analysis (GMA). Two inbred lines (Falat & Line 30) were crossed to produce the Fj generation. The resulting Fi plants were selfed and backcrossed to both parents to produce F2 and backcross generations respectively. All the generations (Parents, Fj, F2, BQ and BC2) were planted in Agricultural Faculty Experimental Station of Tehran University, using a Randomized Complete Block Design of three replications. GMA was performed, through scaling test which essays all generations simultaneously. In most cases a digenic epistatic model was sufficient to explain variations in generation means. Gene effects including mean effect, additive, dominance, epistasis effects of additive * additive, additive * dominance and dominance x dominance were observed. For plant hight and 1000 seed weigh the additive- dominance effects and for other traits the epistasis effects (specially additive * additive and dominance * dominance) were distinguished as the most important effects in controlling the heritability of these traits.The highest (76%) and lowest (40%) narrow sense heritabilities were obtained for plant hight, and spike weight, respectively.

Background and objective: Prevention of health inequalities
requires attention towards the social determinants of health
(SDH). Today, the efforts of countries to reduce health
inequalities is throught paying attention to the social
determinants of health. The unequal distribution of health
in the developing countries is one of the main challenges
of health systems which lead to inequality in social status
and living conditions. This study aimed to determine the
challenges and solutions of social determinants of health in
Iran based on expert views.
Methods: This study was a qualitative and phenomenological
study. The study population consisted of 24 policy makers
and experts from the fields of SDH. Purposive stratified nonrandom
sampling was used in this study. Semi-structure
interview was used for data collections. Thematic analysis
with Nvivo software was used for data analysis.
Results: Most experts believed that the economic problems
were the major challenges. Lack of long-term planning about
social determinants of health, lack of social responsibility
and supervision among organizations in the country, the
absence of community-oriented individual and organizational
perspective and finally clinical approach in health system
were the causes of the failure of implementintion of SDH.
The most important solution for solving the problem were
setting up the health equity monitoring system for identifying
the evidence required to justify the policy makers, review the
current structure of the office of SDH and conducting further
research on the social determinants of health.
Conclusion: Paying attention to the SDH can improve health
in the community. Promotion of intersectoral collaboration and
emphasis on structural determinants and social determinants
of health play an important role in reducing health inequalities.
It is essential to take this approach by the policy makers; and
health in all policies finds own places

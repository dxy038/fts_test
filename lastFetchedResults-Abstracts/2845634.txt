Cloud Computing is becoming a viable computing solution for services oriented computing. Several open-source cloud solutions are available to these supports. Open-source software stacks offer a huge amount of customizability without huge licensing fees. As a result, open source software are widely used for designing cloud, and private clouds are being built increasingly in the open source way. Numerous contributions have been made by the open-source community related to private-IaaS-cloud. OpenNebula - a cloud platform is one of the popular private cloud management software. However, little has been done to systematically investigate the performance evaluation of this open-source cloud solution in the existing literature. The performance evaluation aids new and existing research, industry and international projects when selecting OpenNebula software to their work. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the load-balancing performance of the OpenNebula cloud management software. For the performance evaluation, the OpenNebula cloud management software is installed and configured as a prototype implementation and tested on the DIU Cloud Lab. In this paper, two set of experiments are conducted to identify the load balancing performance of the OpenNebula cloud management platform- (1) Delete and Add Virtual Machine (VM) from OpenNebula cloud platform; (2) Mapping Physical Hosts to Virtual Machines (VMs) in the OpenNebula cloud platform.

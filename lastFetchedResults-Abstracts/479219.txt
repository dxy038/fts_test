Background: Aspergillosis is an opportunistic fungal disease caused by different species of Aspergillus. Clinical manifestation and severity of disease related to physiological conditions of host, involved organs and Aspergillus species. Cinnamomum zeylanicum is an evergreen tree 10-15 meter length and belongs to Lauraceae family. It grows in Srilanka. Its essential oil has antimicrobial activity.
Objective: Study of Antifungal activity of this essential oil against clinical isolates of Aspergillus and determination of MIC.
Methods: Broth microdilution method was used in this research .Essential oil of Cinnamomum zeylanicum was extracted by means of Clevenger apparatus then its MICs on clinical isolates of Aspergillus were calculated by broth microdilution method. 
Results: Number of samples was twenty seven. MICs are: eight isolates: 1.18 ?g/ml, 
six isolates: 0.59 ?g/ml, four isolates: 0.29 ?g/ml, five isolates: 0.14 ?g/ml and four isolates: 0.07?g/ml
Conclusion: In view of the fact that Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil was effective against all isolates in this research, we recommend the investigation of its antifungal properties Invivo.

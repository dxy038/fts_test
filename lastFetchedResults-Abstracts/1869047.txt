To develop a new recombinant BCG (rBCG) vaccine, we constructed rBCG that expresses the full-length Gag protein of simian immunodeficiency virus (rBCG-SIVGag) at a level of 0.5 ng/mg after 3 weeks of bacterial cell culture. Intradermal (i.d.) inoculation of guinea pigs with 0.1 mg of rBCG-SIVGag resulted in the induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to both purified protein derivative (PPD) of tuberculin and SIV Gag p27 protein; responses that were maintained for the duration of the 50-week study. In contrast, guinea pigs orally vaccinated with 160 mg of the same antigen exhibited a long-lasting DTH response to the SIV Gag p27 protein, but mounted no response to PPD. Proliferative responses to SIV Gag p27 and PPD antigens were detected in both i.d. and orally immunized animals; however, the levels of PPD-specific responses were significantly higher in guinea pigs immunized by the i.d. than the oral route. A significant increase in the level of PPD- and SIV Gag p27-specific IFNÎ³ mRNA expression was also detected in both immunization groups receiving rBCG-SIVGag. In addition, both i.d. and oral immunization with rBCG-SIVGag induced PPD- and SIV Gag p27-specific serum IgG responses. Insertion of the SIV gag gene into BCG did not appear to change the ability of rBCG-immunized animals to elicit PPD-specific immune responses. These results indicate that rBCG-SIVGag has the ability to effectively induce long-lasting, cell-mediated and humoral immunity against both viral and bacterial antigens in guinea pigs, suggesting that rBCG-Gag has the potential to elicit immunities specific not only for tuberculosis but also for HIV at human doses.

Objective: The cerebellum is a key structure involved in coordinated motor planning,
cognition, learning and memory functions. This study presents a permanent model
of a toxin produced cerebellar lesion characterized according to contemporary motor
and cognitive abnormalities.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, slow administration of quinolinic acid
(QA, 5 ?l of 200 ?mol, 1 ?l/minute) in the right cerebellar hemisphere (lobule VI) caused noticeable
motor and cognitive disturbances along with cellular degeneration in all treated animals.
We assessed behavioral and histopathological studies over ten weeks after QA treatment. The
data were analyzed with ANOVA and the studentâ€™s t test.
Results: The QA treated group showed marked motor learning deficits on the rotating rod
test (p?0.0001), locomotor asymmetry on the cylinder test (p?0.0001), dysmetria on the
beam balance test (p?0.0001), abnormalities in neuromuscular strength on the hang wire test
(p?0.0001), spatial memory deficits in the Morris water maze (MWM, p?0.001) and fear conditioned
memory on the passive avoidance test (p?0.01) over a ten-week period compared with
the control animals. Histopathological analysis showed loss of Purkinje cells (p?0.001) and
granular cell density (p?0.0001) in the lesioned hemisphere of the cerebellum.
Conclusion: Results of the present study show that QA can remove numerous cells which
respond to this toxin in hemispheric lobule VI and thus provide a potential model for functional
and cell-based studies.

As the social renewability of water resources was rarely considered in city water resources assessment, we proposed a new assessment model: ANN-based assessment model of social renewability of city water resources. And the model was applied to analyze and assess main cities in the Yellow River basin. Each process of social cycle of city water resources considered, the assessment results could well reveal the potential utilization of city water resources, and could indicate the shortcomings of water resources utilization of the target city; thus, the assessment results could play a certain role in assistant decision-making. Furthermore, an assessment model now in common use: grey relational analysis (GRA) method, was selected to validate the established model. The validation results showed good relevance between the two methods. The practice in this paper revealed that the ANN-based assessment model of social renewability of city water resources is vivid, objective, precise and rational, possessing certain versatility and practicability, as well as broad application prospects.

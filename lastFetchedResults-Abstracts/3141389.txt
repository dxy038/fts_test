This paper provides insights into the impact of weight factors in multi-objective geometric programming (MOGP) optimization. Optimization of the weight factors is also considered. Generally, solving the multi-objective problem via geometric programming requires multiple objectives be combined into a scalar objective by weighing the individual objectives with arbitrary, fixed weight factors. On the contrary, this paper considers weight factors as optimization variables as well. As a result, the achieved solution becomes closer to the ideal multi-objective optimum than the fixed-weight MOGP.

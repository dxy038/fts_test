The paper gives insights about the potential of developing and implementing a computer assisted examination (CAA) system at the University of Mauritius and, as well as identifying a number of issues concerning the future development of the CAA system. The use by staff of technology to deliver assessments across the intranet in support of the teaching of the different modules across the faculties could benefit university students. This paper describes a project to investigate the issues surrounding potential use of objective tests delivered by computer assisted assessment (CAA) at the University of Mauritius. The proposed CAA system encompasses the use of computers to deliver, mark and analyse assignments or examinations. The combination of assessment and technology means that the successful implementation of the CAA involves a diverse collection of people from across the university including staff developers, academics, computing services personnel, and quality assurance staff. The proposed software, which provides a suite of tools for creating, storing, and deliver of assessment content illustrates the ways in which lecturers can conduct effective assessment to better meet the needs of students learning at the University of Mauritius.

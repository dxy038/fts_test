Robust state-feedback model predictive control (MPC) of discrete-time periodic affine systems is considered. States and inputs are subject to periodically time-dependent, hard, convex, polyhedral constraints. Disturbances are additive, bounded and subject to periodically time-dependent bounds. The control objective is given in terms of periodically time-dependent costs. First, maximum robust periodic controlled invariant sets are formally characterized and subsequently employed in the design of least-restrictive robustly strongly feasible periodic MPC problems. Finally, the proposed methods are applied to controlling room temperatures in buildings.

The paper concerns the synthesis of supervisory controllers for a class of continuous-time hybrid systems with discrete-valued input signals that select differential inclusions for continuous-valued state trajectories and event-valued output signals generated by threshold crossings in the continuous state space, the supervisor is allowed to switch the input signal value when threshold events are observed. The objective is to synthesize a nonblocking supervisor such that the set of possible sequences of control and threshold event pairs for the closed-loop system lies between given upper and lower bounds in the sense of set containment. We show how this problem can be converted into a supervisor synthesis problem for a standard controlled discrete-event system (DES). A finite representation may not exist for the exact DES model of the hybrid system, however. To circumvent this difficulty, we present an algorithm for constructing finite-state Muller automata that accept outer approximations to the exact controlled threshold-event language, and we demonstrate that supervisors that solve the synthesis problem for the approximating automata achieve the control specifications when applied to the original hybrid system

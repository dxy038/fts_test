The real and reactive power service by local devices plays an important role in continuous electric energy supply and energy management of the distribution system under peak load or over load conditions. The compensating devices are greatly utilized to provide the necessary real and reactive power support and to share the peak load demand. This paper presents optimal location and sizing of Distributed Generation (DG) and capacitor in distribution network to provide the necessary active and reactive power support, to minimize the system real and reactive power loss and to maintain the network voltage level within a desired range. The main objective of this paper is to minimize the cost of service provided by these local devices. This paper proposes Weight-Improved Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (WIPSO) for optimal location and sizing of compensating devices. The proposed method is efficiently examined in test system and comparative studies before and after installation of Distributed Generators and capacitors is made. Results illustrates improvement in network voltage profile, reduction in system real and reactive power loss and reduction in cost of service provided by these local devices.

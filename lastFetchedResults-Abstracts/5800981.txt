In this paper we propose a new technique for designing feedback control of a DC motor speed using fractional order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID controller). DC motor is often used in robotics and other fields of control and therefore speed control is very important. FOPID controllerÂ´s parameters are composed of the proportionality constant, integral constant, derivative constant, derivative order and integral order, and its design is more complex than that of conventional integer-order proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers. Here the controller synthesis is formulated as a single objective optimization problem and based on Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE) criterion. A modified Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm is been used to tune the FOPID controller parameters.

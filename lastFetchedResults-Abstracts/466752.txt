Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes after anterior colporrhaphy with the use of 3 different surgical techniques. Study Design: One hundred fourteen women with anterior vaginal prolapse were randomly assigned to undergo anterior repair by one of 3 techniques: standard, standard plus polyglactin 910 mesh, or ultralateral anterior colporrhaphy. Before and after operation, patients underwent physical examination staging of prolapse; the International Continence Society system was used. Symptoms were assessed by questionnaire and visual analog scales. We defined “cure” as satisfactory (stage I) or optimal (stage 0) outcome at points Aa and Ba. Results: Of 114 patients who were originally enrolled, 109 patients underwent operation, and 83 patients (76%) returned for follow-up. Mean age (± SD) was 64.7 ± 11.1 years. At entry, 7 patients (7%) had stage I anterior vaginal prolapse; 35 patients (37%) had stage II anterior vaginal prolapse; 51 patients (54%) had stage III anterior vaginal prolapse; and 2 patients (2%) had stage IV anterior vaginal prolapse. At a median length of follow-up of 23.3 months, 10 of 33 patients (30%) who were randomly assigned to the standard anterior colporrhaphy group experienced satisfactory or optimal anatomic results, compared with 11 of 26 patients (42%) with standard plus mesh and with 11 of 24 patients (46%) with ultralateral anterior colporrhaphy. The severity of symptoms that were related to prolapse improved markedly (preoperative score, 6.9 ± 2.7; postoperative score, 1.1 ± 0.8). Twenty-three of 24 patients (96%) no longer required manual pressure to void after operation. Conclusion: These 3 techniques of anterior colporrhaphy provided similar anatomic cure rates and symptom resolution for anterior vaginal prolapse repair. The addition of polyglactin 910 mesh did not improve the cure rate compared with standard anterior colporrhaphy. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185:1299-306.)

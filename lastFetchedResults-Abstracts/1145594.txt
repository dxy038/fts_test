This paper presents the results of objective tests performed on 13 personal active noise reduction devices (earmuffs, headphones, headsets and insert earphones) divided into four groups based mainly on structure, using an acoustic test fixture (ATF). Each device was examined on its attenuation of broadband noise, overload response, internally generated noise, attenuation of impulse noise, and stability to movement. The results show a large range of responses between devices in terms of attenuation and overload, and highlight distinctive differences between the device groupings.

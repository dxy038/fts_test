The problem of non-fragile (or resilient) <i>L</i> <sub>2</sub>-<i>L</i> <sub>infin</sub> control for a class of singular systems with time-varying delay is considered via observer-based state feedback control. The objective is to design an observer-based feedback controller with additive gain variations such that, for all admissible observer and controller gain variations, the closed-loop system is regular, impulse free and stable with a prescribed <i>L</i> <sub>2</sub>-<i>L</i> <sub>infin</sub> performance index satisfied. In terms of linear matrix inequalities, a new delay-dependent stability criterion is derived. Based on the obtained criterion, the non-fragile observer and controller design method is proposed. Numerical example and simulation results are included to show the effectiveness of the proposed results.

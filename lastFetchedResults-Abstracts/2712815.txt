Spectroradiometric field surveys, especially when addressed at heterogeneous targets and within a complex environmental context, require careful organization and structuring. This work focuses on a proposal of an operational workflow that holds together different aspects of in situ spectral data acquisition, from planning to data analysis, and is ancillary to environmental analysis based on remote sensing. The main objective is the enhancement of the information coming from acquired spectra, which is accomplished through a set of established guidelines for: campaign planning, measurement collection, and data management. The feasibility and advantages of such approach are demonstrated through a real case scenario, covering two spectroradiometric campaigns aimed at geolithology studies and performed in September 2010 and 2011 in the Dolomites (Northern Italy), where complex environmental and variable atmospheric conditions, as well as, large target variability and spectral heterogeneity occur. The workflow here adopted allowed us to face all the challenges in order to usefully accomplish our campaigns. Issues commonly arising in spectroradiometric field activities are easily foreseen, tackled and mitigated, if necessary, while preserving a high degree of flexibility and generalization for exploiting the workflow over heterogeneous areas and application fields.

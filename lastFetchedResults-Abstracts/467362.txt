Objective: There are many young women undergoing irradiation or chemotherapy without having the option of preserving their ovarian function. Our purpose was to review the literature on laparoscopic ovarian transposition, to evaluate its efficacy, and to provide clinical opinion on the subject. Study design: We evaluated the English articles on laparoscopic ovarian transposition identified through a MEDLINE search. We also report a case of laparoscopic ovarian tranposition in a 28-year-old woman with rectal cancer. Results: Laparoscopic ovarian transposition in women <40 years old is associated with preservation of ovarian function in 88.6% of cases. During and afer irradication, our patient never missed her menstrual periods. Conclusion: Despite its simplicity and efficacy, this procedure is underused. We encourage clinicians to discuss and propose it to their patients. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:367-70.)

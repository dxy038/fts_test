This paper reports a new structural method to mathematically represent and quantify a tissue for the purpose of automated and objective cancer diagnosis and grading. Unlike the previous structural methods, which quantify a tissue considering the spatial distributions of its cell nuclei, the proposed method relies on the use of distributions of multiple tissue components for the representation. To this end, it constructs a graph on multiple tissue components and colors its edges depending on the component types of their endpoints. Subsequently, it extracts a new set of structural features from these <i>color graphs</i> and uses these features in the classification of tissues. Working with the images of colon tissues, our experiments demonstrate that the color-graph approach leads to 82.65% test accuracy and that it significantly improves the performance of its counterparts.

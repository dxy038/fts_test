Background and Objective: Instability and deterioration of some drugs, vitamins and fatty dairy products in a liquid phase is one of the difficulties in the long-term storage, especially in the case of bulk products. Besides, some of these powder materials do have no enough compressibility to change them in a tablet dosage form and may need technological modification. In present study yogurt was used as a suitable model for the evaluation.
Subjects and Methods: The liquid fresh yogurt was lyophilized at -40  and 0.03 Tor pressure. The dry powder was homogenized by a 12 mesh size sieve. Carr’s compressibility index, Hausner ratio and the angle of repose tests were applied to evaluate porosity, density and therefore the flowability of yogurt powder. Study of deformation of particles during forcing was done by calculation of elastic recovery index. 
Results: Carr’s compressibility index and Hausner ratio were 15% and 0.94, respectively. The range of repose angle was between 19-20 . The elastic recovery was obtained 60%. Hardness of tablets increased by decreasing compression velocity, therefore yogurt powder might have a plastic deformation. Tablets with low fat yogurt showed very good compressibility with 6-12 Strong-Cab hardness units. 
Conclusion: With respect to selection of the conditions and proper drying method (Liyophilization process), and also to rely on measurable indexes such as: density, porosity and finally compressibility of the powder, preparation of a solid tablet from liquid yogurt for therapeutic and nutritious uses, is possible.

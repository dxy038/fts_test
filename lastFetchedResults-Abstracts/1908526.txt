Expectant treatment with curative intent for treatment of low-risk prostate cancer faces 3 challenges in the PSA era: (1) appropriate patient selection, (2) adequate surveillance strategies, and (3) identification of triggers for definitive intervention when cure is still possible. Men 65 years or older with T1c disease, prostate-specific antigen density &lt;0.15 ng/ml/cm3, and favorable biopsy characteristics per the Epstein criteria currently appear to be the safest candidates for expectant treatment. Changes in biopsy characteristics are the most objective trigger for definitive therapy currently in use. Outcomes data are still required to determine the safety of expectant treatment for localized disease.

In this paper, the method of min-max feasible cooperation-based distributed model predictive control (FC-MPC) for linear system with bounded persistence disturbance, control constraints and coupling is presented. The stability analysis is based on the input-to-state stability (ISS) theory rather than the classical Lyapunov theory because of the existence of disturbance as the external input. The objective function is chosen as the ISpS-Lyapunov function and then the input-to-state practically stability is obtained. An example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of this method.

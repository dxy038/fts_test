This paper describes an efficient implementation of a load balancing algorithm based upon a process migration mechanism, and the notion of CPU-queue length which indicates the workload at each processor. The main objective is to reduce the message overhead in conservative simulation. The algorithms were tested on four simulation workload models to study the the scalability of our algorithm on an Intel Paragon multicomputer architecture using 64 processors. A significant decrease in run time and the message overhead associated with the conservative simulation was obtained with the use of the proposed dynamic load balancing algorithm as compared to the use of a static partitioning algorithm

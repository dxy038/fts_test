Hardware Software partitioning is one of the most significant part of Hardware Software co-design of embedded systems, which is directly related to performance and cost. A lot of works have been done such as the simulated annealing algorithm, greedy algorithm and evaluation algorithm. In this paper, a new hardware software partitioning method based on Immune Algorithm was introduced. The model of the embedded system was constructed by Improved Directed Acyclic Graph (IDAG) to obtain the objective function for hardware/software partitioning. Compared with other algorithm, it could provide an effective tool for measuring the performance of different objective functions, and improve the designing efficiency. Also, a proof was given to show the algorithm had weak convergence in probability.

To ensure multi-objective control system simultaneously achieving the multiple control objectives, "point" control objectives are released and replaced with "interval" control objectives. Here, a two layer optimization scheme, compatible control, is proposed for multi-objective control system. The first layer proposes compatible optimization to obtain the compatible and acceptable interval control objectives, which ensures the controllability of the multi-objective control system. The second layer designs the controller by on-line minimization of the synthetical performance index, the constraints ensure the solvable online optimization and the controller satisfying the practical demand

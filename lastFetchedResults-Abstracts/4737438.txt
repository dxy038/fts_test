With the development of the urban grid, there are increasing numbers of grid bidirectional power supply and Multi-power supply modes. Loop Closing operation in Distribution Network becomes more and more frequent. This paper focuses on loop closing operation in Distribution Network with impact current calculation methods. We make a research on cyclized loop automatic search; generate the deployment of the integrated model, closing loop layout show and the impact of the closing loop current calculation method. As a result, we come out the impact of current calculation methods in deployment of the integrated model. The method avoids the analysis based on the separate distribution network model, eliminates the error by transmission and distribution model of alternating iterations, and thus to ensure high accuracy.

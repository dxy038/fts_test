This paper presents the study of vocal videostroboscopic videos to detect morphological pathologies using an active contour segmentation and objective measurements. The ad-hoc designed active contour algorithm permits to obtain a robust and fast segmentation using vocal folds images in RGB format. In this work, we have employed connected component analysis as a post-processing tool. After the segmentation process the image is analyzed and the pathology can be localized automatically and we can extract some features of each fold (such as the size of the polyp or cyst, the glottal space, the position...).

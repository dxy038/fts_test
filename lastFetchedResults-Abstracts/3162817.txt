Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are mainly characterized by their limited energy source mainly from the sensor nodes. Hence, the need for energy efficient sensor nodes is becoming increasingly more important since it impacts upon the operational lifetime. One way to improve the sensor network performance is to integrate a beamforming method in all sensor nodes. This paper presents a method of optimizing sensor node coordination in order to reassign the nodes in linear array arrangement to form a linear antenna array. This linear sensor node array (PSO-LSNA) which is optimized by using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), is constructed within random sensor node deployment. The new cost function is defined, with the objective of minimum side lobe level (SLL). The performance of this newly proposed method (PSO-LSNA) is compared with the current LSNA. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better beamforming performance over its comparative.

This paper presents a new approach of combining stereo vision and dynamic vision with the objective of retaining their advantages and removing their disadvantages. It is shown that, by assuming affine cameras, the stereo correspondences and motion correspondences, if organized in a particular way in a matrix, can be decomposed into: the 3D structure of the scene, the camera parameters, the motion parameters, and the stereo geometry. With this, the approach can infer stereo correspondences from motion correspondences, requiring only a time linear with respect to the size of the available image data. The approach offers the advantages of simpler correspondence, as in dynamic vision, and accurate reconstruction, as in stereo vision, even with short image sequences

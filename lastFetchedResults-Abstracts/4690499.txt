Rapid changes in the field of engineering technology have increased the need for universities to provide engineering and engineering technology students with meaningful and relevant practical experiences, however, limited available resources in the provision of laboratory hardware and infrastructure have been the principal impediment in achieving this objective. Such hardware limitations have been increasingly marginalizing the quality of engineering and engineering technology education. E-learning can be used to help universities and technical colleges overcome this problem. One approach that can be implemented to overcome this problem is to expand e-learning activities in programs with limited resources to take advantage of online computer-based technology. In this model, remote instrumentation technology and the internet are merged to interface students with the physical world.

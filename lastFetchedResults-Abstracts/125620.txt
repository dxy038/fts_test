The objective of the present study was to compare the success rate of extra-amniotic saline with traction on the cervix with folly catheter for termination of second trimester pregnancies. A randomized trial of extra-amniotic saline infusion versus traction on the cervix with folly catheter was performed on 200 patients with gestational age of 14-28 weeks who required induction of labor for either maternal or fetal indications. One hundred patients(extra-amniotic saline infusion) and 100 patients(traction on the cervix with folly catheter) who were similar in age, gestational age, parity, past vaginal delivery, and live or dead fetus were assigned randomly and alternately. The success rate was not statistically significant but the duration of induction was significantly shorter for extra-amniotic saline infusion(P=0.02). Maternal complicaions were minimal and not significantly different. In conclusion, extra-amniotic saline infusion is as effective as traction on the cervix but faster than it. Both methods are safe, and cheap which are tolerated by the patients very well. Extra-amniotic saline infusion should be seriously considered as a first priority in case other methods are not accessible.

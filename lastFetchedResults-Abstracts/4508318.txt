In this paper we propose a new method in order to replace the traditional network planning procedure. The new method is based on optimization of multicriteria, binomial objective function. The constraints of the objective function are formulated using a penalty method and genetic algorithms are used for solving the optimization problem. Numerical examples are presented in order to demonstrate the proper operation of the proposed method. An application to solve network planning problems in urban areas is presented

This paper presents a new approach for phasor measurement units (PMUs) placement within transmission networks considering risk of observability. To such aim, probabilistic effects of uncertainties imposed to the transmission networks are modeled via Monte-Carlo simulations. Then, risk of observability is introduced as a new objective function and applied to the PMU placement problem. The proposed objective function accompanied by the prevalent cost function leads the transmission network to face with different reliability and observability levels based on its operation point of view. Detailed numerical results and comparisons presented in the paper show that the proposed approach could noticeably improve the quality of problem solutions and can be used as an effective tool for PMU placement within real-life networks.

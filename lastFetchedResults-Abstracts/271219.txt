Development of a micromechanics model capable of providing overall macroscopic
responses for directionally fiber-reinforced composites undergoing matrix cracking (in terms of
microgeometric features) is the principal objective of this paper. It is shown that fiber bridging plays
an important role, and the effective moduli of a composite may be significantly inlluenceel by the
crack size. Bridging effects are negligible for inl%itesimally small cracks (or a -+ 0), and closed-form
effective moduli are obtained via standard micromechanics approach for a hybrid composite system
with two distinct inclusion phases (fibers and cracks). When crack size exceeds a threshold value u*
(a$ being the crack size for saturated bridging), the bridging effect is significant, and a closed-form
solution for effective moduli is again possible using a self-consistent approach accommodating
bridging effects within the micromechanics framework. In the transition regime (0 < a < a,),
however, the effective moduli become crack-size dependent. A full three-dimensional bridging
solution, involving discrete fibers and penny-shaped cracks, is developed to numerically determine
the effective moduli in this regime. The procedure also allows numerical determination of the
saturated crack size, 4. The important of crack-size dependence is then discussed. It is observed that
the effective longitudinal modulus for a silicon carbide reinforced intermetallic may be significantly
underestimated by standard micromechanics model. In the transition range (0 < u < 3, the present
model also provides an avenue for estimation of crack sixes based on observations of overall macromoduli
of damaged composite systems. 0 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

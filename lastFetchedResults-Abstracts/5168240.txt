Interactive techniques encourage the decision maker to exploit both the problem and its preference structure in mathematical programming models in which multiple objective functions are explicitly considered. In this context a key issue is the assessment of solution stability regarding model changes. In this paper we propose an interactive approach aimed at assessing the stability of efficient solutions to multiple objective linear programming problems with respect to the expansion of the decision space through the introduction of new decision variables.

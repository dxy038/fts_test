Facing the fact that science textbook describes content of scientific and technological inventions in exposition mode mostly, so that elementary pupils are difficult to comprehend. Story with a series of drawings to represent abstract scientific concepts can enhance learning, especially for elementary students. This study was carried out with an objective to discover whether females and males students significantly varied in their attitude after retelling local and global e-stories of science fair and inventions via comic. The study included twenty-four subjects comprising equal number of male and females of 10-11 years of age from a public school in a rural community. An analysis of covariance was used to correct for initial differences of prerequisite scores and attitudes towards science activities among treatment groups. While significant difference of Image of ScientistsÂ´ Job (p &lt;; 0.05) exists in local vs. global stories, no significant differences were observed between attitude of male and female participants. Practical implications and recommendations for future research on e-story approach are identified.

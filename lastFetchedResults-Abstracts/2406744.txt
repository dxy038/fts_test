Objective
Epilepsy is a serious, potentially life-shortening brain disorder that occurs in
patients of all ages and races. A total of 2â€“4% of people have experienced
seizures at least once in their lifetime. Although treatment usually begins after
a seizure, it is an important question whether the first cases of seizure do need
to be treated by antiepileptic drugs. In this manner, we compare the recurrence
rates of epilepsy in first seizure patients treated with sodium valproic acid as an
antiepileptic drug versus a placebo.
Material & Methods
In a randomized clinical trial study, 101 first seizure patients were randomly
divided into two groups: one group was treated with antiepileptic drugs (sodium
valproate 200mg, three times a day) and the other group was given a placebo.
The recurrence rate of seizures was evaluated and compared between the groups
after 6 months of follow up.
Results
Eight recurrence cases were detected. All recurrence cases came from the placebo
group, with four patients suffering an additional seizure after four months and
between 4-6 month follow up. A comparison of recurrence rate detected a
statistically significant difference between the drug group and placebo group.
Conclusion
Our data shows that the recurrences occurred only in the placebo group with
the difference between the recurrence rates in the placebo versus drug-treated
was significant. Our results suggest that drug therapy for people after their first
seizure attack might reduce the probability of seizure recurrence.

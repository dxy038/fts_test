Since uncertainties in variables are unavoidable, an optimal solution must consider the robustness of the design. The gradient index approach provides a convenient way to evaluate the robustness but is inconclusive when several possible solutions exist. To overcome this limitation, a novel methodology based on the use of first- and second-order gradient indices is proposed introducing the notion of gradient sensitivity. The sensitivity affords a measure of the change in the objective function with respect to the uncertainty of the variables. A Kriging method assisted by algorithms exploiting the concept of rewards is employed to facilitate function predictions for the robust optimisation process. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed through a series of numerical experiments. A modification to the correlation model through the introduction of a Kriging predictor and mean square error criterion allows efficient solution of large scale and multi-parameter problems. The three-parameter version of TEAM Workshop Problem 22 has been used for illustration.

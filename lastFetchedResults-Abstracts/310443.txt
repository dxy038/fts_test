Objective. To determine the progression of thoracolumbar disc degeneration in young fast bowlers in cricket.

Design. Prospective fast bowling technique and MRI follow-up study.

Background. Previous studies on high-performance young fast bowlers have found that lumbar spine pathology was related to the mixed bowling technique.

Methods. Nineteen young male fast bowlers (mean age 13.6 years) underwent MRI scans to detect the presence of intervertebral disc abnormalities. Subjects were also filmed laterally (200 Hz) and from directly above (100 Hz) whilst bowling two maximum velocity deliveries (session 1). Subjects were tested using an identical methodology 2.7 years later (session 2).

Results. At session 1, the incidence of thoracolumbar disc degeneration was 21%; however, at session 2, the incidence significantly (P = 0.008) increased to 58%. Furthermore the increase in the incidence of back pain between session 1 and session 2 was also significant (P = 0.002). The progression of disc degeneration was found to be significantly (P = 0.015) related to the group of fast bowlers who utilized the mixed technique during both session 1 and 2 when compared to those who used this technique during one session only.

Conclusions. Thoracolumbar disc degeneration and back pain increase significantly during the time period examined in this study. Further, bowlers who utilize the mixed bowling technique stand a greater chance of developing degenerative changes of the spine.

The current generation of optical networks based on a fixed wavelength grid and on fixed-rate transponders would impose relevant limitations for future transmission rates exceeding 100 Gb/s, thereby limiting the number of potential implementations and making a new generation of elastic optical networks (EON) necessary. To this regard, flexible-grid (Flexgrid) transmission and switching technologies could significantly increase both transport network scalability and flexibility. Further benefits would come from multilayer interworking mechanisms enabling direct control of bandwidth-variable transponders (BVT) based on electronic switching technologies (IP/MPLS, OTN, etc.) for optical bandwidth optimization purposes. The development of data and control plane solutions based on EONs enabling adaptive network and service interworking is the main objective of the ICT project IDEALIST. The paper describes the data plane architecture of a future EON based on the vision of the IDEALIST project.

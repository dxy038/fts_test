Study Objective: To evaluate the colposcopic findings of cervical alterations in the young sexually active female.
Design, Setting, Participants: Colposcopic examination and follow-up of 51 young sexually active females aged 15â€“20 yr was conducted due to abnormal cytology or a suspicious abnormality of the cervix. The study was conducted at the Colposcopy Units of the 1st and 2nd Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Athens, Greece.
Interventions: Colposcopic examination, LEEP, conization.
Mean Outcome Measures: Biopsy, human papillomavirus (HPV) typing.
Results: Colposcopic examinations were within normal limits in 8 of 51 (15.7%) cases. Cervical alterations were related to HPV infection in 14 cases (27.4%), to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I in 15 (29.4%) cases, to CIN II in 13 (25.5%) cases, and to CIN III in 1 (2.0%) case. Of all CIN I cases, 8 of 15 (53.3%) were HPV positive, and HPV type 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, and 11& 16 were found. In CIN II cases, 5 of 13 (38.4%) were HPV positive, and HPV type 11, 16, 18, and 11 & 31 were found. In the CIN III case, only HPV type 16 was found.
Conclusions: Our findings strongly confirm the necessity of obtaining cervicovaginal smears on all sexually active gynecologic and obstetric teenage patients. Colposcopy plays a major role in the evaluation of the cervix and in the treatment that should be given for any individual CIN lesion.

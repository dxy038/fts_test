This paper presents an optimal controller design of cascade PI controllers for a buck converter using both particle swarm optimization and adaptive tabu search methods. The averaging model of the power electronic system derived from the generalized state-space averaging method is used as an objective function instead of the model from software packages. The simulation results show that the proposed method can efficiently obtain the best performance of the output waveform compared with the classical method. Moreover, this approach is convenient and flexible for electrical engineering to design the controller of power electronic systems with good performances.

The objective of this research was to characterize the dielectric and induced piezoelectric properties of W<sup>6+</sup>-doped, 0.87 Pb(Mg <sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>-0.13PbTiO<sub>3</sub> relaxor ferroelectrics. The induced k<sub>t</sub>Â´s depended strongly on the W<sup>6+</sup> amount and electric field, maximizing at a value of 0.58 for an applied field of 6 kV/cm and a 1% doping level. In addition, only slight variations in the sintering temperature (&#177;10&#176;C) had a pronounced effect on the properties, decreasing the k<sub>t</sub> by as much as 10%

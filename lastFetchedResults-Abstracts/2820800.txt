This paper presents the application of multiple-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm for solving the static reactive power dispatch (RPD) problem. The optimal RPD problem is a nonlinear multi-objective optimization problem which involves the simultaneous minimization of two objective functions. The first function is the total real power losses in transmission lines. While the second one is the voltage deviation at load buses. This optimization is done by considering functional equality and inequality constraints. Since the problem is treated as a true multi-objective optimization problem, different trade-off solutions are provided. The decision maker has an option to choose a solution among the different trade-off solutions provided in the pareto-optimal front. The three-machine nine-bus system is used and the results show the effectiveness of MOPSO and confirm its potential to solve the multi-objective RPD problem.

Introduction: The immune system's reaction to stress, especially exercise is one of the most important subjects in medical sciences. It has been already shown that the effect of physical activity depends on several factors such as: intensity of activity, duration and also distance and frequency of training. In this study maximal exhausting training was chosen as a kind of training, which is usually used by athletes.
Objective: The experiment was designed regarding the effect of a maximal aerobic training with a %90 heart rate on serum immunoglobulin G and A.
Materials and Methods: Twenty-one students were randomly selected and divided into two groups; experimental group (n=11) and control group (n=10). The mean age, weight and height for these groups were respectively (21.9), (22.7) years, (70), (68) kg, (174.5) and (170.2)cm. The Vena blood sample of subjects was taken both before and immediately after training. Then the levels of IgG and IgA more measured by the method of SRID.
Results: Statistical analysis using T-student showed that the means of serum IgG and IgA were significantly decreased (p<0.01).
Conclusion: The results indicated that a single maximal aerobic training (%90 HR) had significant effect on serum IgG and IgA in male collegiate students. The obtained data can be related to elevation in cortisol or other hormones and also glutamin activity after training.

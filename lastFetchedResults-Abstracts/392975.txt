Objective
It was reported that salivary secretion increased in 30 volunteers with administered nizatidine. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether or not nizatidine enhances salivary secretion and improves the function of salivary glands in patients with dry mouth.
Methods
Both basal and stimulated salivary secretions were measured before and after the administration of nizatidine for a month in 18 healthy adult volunteers and 38 patients with dry mouth. In 6/38 patients, salivary gland scintigraphy was performed.
Results
After the administration of nizatidine for a month, salivary secretions significantly increased in the control and dry mouth patient groups compared to the pretreatment baseline. In addition, 25 of 38 dry mouth patients showed subjective improvements of oral dryness. In 3/4 patients, the function of salivary glands was improved on salivary gland scintigraphy.
Conclusion
Nizatidine may reactivate salivary gland cells and be useful in the treatment of patients with dry month.

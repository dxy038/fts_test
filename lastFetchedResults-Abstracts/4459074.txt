In response to the escalating energy crisis and related pollution problems, sustainability has thus become a major driving force in energy policy, leading to different strategies and incentives. The presented paper will apply a multicriteria methodology taking as basis fuzzy multi-rules and multi-sets to provide an appropriate evaluation of the projects from the clean development mechanism (CDM). The main objective of the paper is to select the most appropriate CDM project, according to four parameters simulated in three different scenarios. In addition, it is presented the key points between the incentives used to CDM projects and sustainability, relating these points with the proposed methodology outcome. As regards Fuzzy Logic purpose, by using the MATLAB<sup>&#174;</sup> Software it is applied the Mamdani System as fuzzification process and the Center of Gravity Method as defuzzification process.

Selection of Logistics Service Provider is the precondition and foundation of supply chain operation. It is an important aspect to choose the best supplier for supply chain management. But in the selection course of suppliers, some index canpsilat be expressed by certain number, just only expressed by linguistic words, under this situation, we must use fuzzy decision making method. In this paper, we set up fuzzy RBF neural network model, which uses triangular fuzzy numbers as inputs, to select the best Logistics Service Providers. Another important feature of the model is that the weights of the inputs fully reflect the effect of the decision-makerpsilas preferences for uncertainty on decision results. Further, attribute weights determined by neural networks have the advantages of both subjective and objective weights. Due to the fact that ideal solution samples are introduced into the training samples, the decision results tends to be more in agreement with the decision-makerpsilas intensions and, therefore, more scientific. Numerical illustrations prove the new model to be effective.

Background and Objective: Contamination of water and soil with heavy metals results from industrial activities is one of the important dangers that threatens natural ecosystems and human being. Because these metals do not degrade and due to their biological accumulation property in tissues, they enter to food chain and lead to different diseases. For these reasons, fish are among the organisms that are exposed to biological accumulation of these metals. The aim of this study was to evaluate health quality of consumable fish by Khorramshahr people.
Subjects and Methods: In this study we collected 30 Otolithes rubber and 30 Pampus argenteus fish species from the fish market of Khorramshahr. After chemical digesting of muscle tissue, concentration of lead, cadmium and nickel were measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma (model, USA).
Results: Average concentration of  lead, cadmium and nickel were estimated in Otolithes rubber respectively 1.89, 0.58 and 2.20 µg/g dry weight and in Pampus argenteus respectively 1.52, 0.48 and 1.08 µg/g dry weight unit.
Conclusion: The results of this study in comparison with standards of WHO showed that average concentration of these three metals in muscle tissue of both fish was higher than allowed limit of WHO that can pose danger to human health.

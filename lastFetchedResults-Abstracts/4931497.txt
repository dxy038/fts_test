A chaotic optimization algorithm (COA) based approach for the robust coordinated design of the UPFC power oscillation damping controller and the conventional power system stabilizer has been investigated in this paper. Chaotic Optimization Algorithms, which have the features of easy implementation, short execution time and robust mechanisms of escaping from local optimum, is a promising tool for engineering applications. The coordinated design problem of PSS and UPFC damping controllers over a wide range of loading conditions and system configurations is formulated as an optimization problem with the time domain -based objective function which is solved by a COA based on Lozi map. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through nonlinear time-domain simulation and some performance indices studies under over a wide range of loading conditions.

Chest pain of esophageal and cardiac origin is often difficult to distinguish due to similar sensations and localization. We have shown that spasm-like contractions of the spinotrapezius muscles evoked by noxious cardiac stimulation could potentially sensitize muscle afferent fibers and produce angina-like referred pain. In this study, we proposed that a similar type of spinotrapezius contraction evoked by esophageal stimulation could produce nociceptive responses with similar quality and localization as evoked by cardiac stimulation. An objective of this study was to show convergence of pathways to the spinotrapezius muscles by measuring electromyographic (EMG) activity between the cardiac– and esophageal–motor reflexes. We also investigated afferent pathways of esophageal–motor reflexes by disrupting or activating the left sympathetic chain and vagus nerves; these pathways form the afferent limbs of the cardiac–motor reflexes. Results showed that more than 95% of animals responding to noxious cardiac stimulation also responded to esophageal distension. Transection of the left sympathetic chain to reduce upper thoracic visceral afferent innervation significantly decreased cardiac-evoked EMG activity or total motor unit potentials (t-MUP). In contrast, however, the transection did not significantly decrease t-MUP evoked by esophageal distension. Bilateral vagotomy and vagal afferent stimulation increased and decreased the cardiac-evoked t-MUP, respectively. However, the same vagal manipulations did not influence t-MUP evoked by esophageal distension. This study demonstrated that the spinotrapezius muscle could be activated by noxious stimulation of two different visceral organs. The spinotrapezius muscle contractions evoked by esophageal distension are produced in part by activation of esophageal afferent fibers found in upper thoracic sympathetic nerves, but not by activation of the vagus nerves.

The research objectives of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms is to make the populations fast convergence and evenly distributed in the question of the optimal noniferior domain. The paper defines and uses loosing density to maintain a good spread of solution in the population,and defines the fitness of the individual through Pareto strength and loosing density. Test results show that the new approach is feasible and effective.

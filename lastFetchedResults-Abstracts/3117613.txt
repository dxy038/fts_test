Mobile agents need to communicate and interact with each other to perform a global task. Coordination models deal with interactions between concurrent entities. A context-aware objective coordination model (COCM) is proposed for mobile agent applications. The context aware coordination model transfers interactions between agents from globally coupling interactions to locally uncoupling tuple space interactions. Programmable tuple space is introduced to solve the problems of context related coordination because of mobility and data heterogeneity in mobile agent systems. Furthermore a sample system on information retrieval in mobile agent applications is carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed model.

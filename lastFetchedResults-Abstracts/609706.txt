SECI and knowledge will be a four-step process explains how to use the new organization was created. This theory of the coversion process  from  tacit  knowledge  to explicit  and viceversa  based on the idealism  agent. Ontological  view of the theory  is numynalysty  and  doesnt   realistic  reality of  objective.On the other hand in the theory  of knowledge human presented as understandable and active stock and  he is the  creator  of the information.

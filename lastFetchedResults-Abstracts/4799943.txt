The Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) representing the major third generation mobile communications system is currently under development. One important aspect for the implementation of UMTS is the evolution from existing fixed and mobile telecommunications systems towards the support of UMTS capabilities. In this context the EURESCOM Project P507 &#8220;Mobility Applications Integration in Intelligent Networks&#8221; has investigated in particular a set of scenarios for the evolution from different initial network situations towards the target UMTS, including the fixed network, cordless terminal mobility, GSM, cable networks/wireless local loop, mobile satellite networks and a stand alone UMTS scenario. The objective of this project was an assessment of the technical feasibility as well as an evaluation of the suitability of the identified scenarios. The paper presents the basic results of this project

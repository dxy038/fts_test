Objective This study examines gender
differences in posttraumatic vulnerability in the face
of the terror attacks that occurred during the Al-Aqsa
Intifada. In addition, the contribution of level of expo
sure, sense of safety, self-efficacy, and coping strategies
is assessed. Method Participants were 250 men and
262 women, who constitute a representative sample
of Israel’s adult population. Data were collected via a
structured questionnaire consisting of 51 items that
were drawn from several questionnaires widely used
in the study of trauma. Results The findings indicate
that women endorsed posttraumatic and depressive
symptoms more than men and that, generally, their
odds of developing posttraumatic stress symptoms
are six times higher than those of men. Results also
revealed that women’s sense of safety and self-efficacy
are lower than men’s and that there are gender differences
in coping strategies in the face of terror.
Conclusions Gender differences in vulnerability to terror
may be attributable to a number of factors, among
these are women’s higher sense of threat and lower
self-efficacy, as well as their tendency to use less effective
coping strategies than men. Level of exposure to
terror was ruled out as a possible explanation for the
gender differences in vulnerability

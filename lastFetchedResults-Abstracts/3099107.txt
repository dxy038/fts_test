The objective of this research is to investigate and provide a proof-of-concept demonstration of how to approach the biosensor fusion process as a systems optimization. Recent work on biosensor fusion is disjointed and compartmentalize at each technical challenge of a very complex problem. Here we try to take a systems approach in deciding the following questions: Where to locate sensors? What sensors to locate? How to configure sensors? When to locate the sensors or extract the data? The answer to all this questions will be done by trying to consider all aspects of the Fusion process. Here we have derived an optimal and heuristic for solving the biosensor location problem with an ontological approach toward sensor management.

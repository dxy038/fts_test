Introduction & Objective: Since pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy of depression are symptomatic treatments, in this study we used 3 methods of drug therapy, group cognitive therapy and desensitization by reprocessing eye movements to compare the efficacy of the mentioned treatments in reducing depression in the Iranian veterans.
Materials & Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, 60 veterans with upper than 25% damage were selected from among all those who were supported by Martyr foundation of the southern and southwestern areas of Tehran. The samples were randomly put in 4 groups of drug therapy, group cognitive therapy, desensitization by reprocessing eye movements and control. The first group, drug therapy group, took SSRIS antidepressants (Flyvkztyn, fluvoxamine and sertraline) or an effective dosage of a drug combination such as Litume. The second and third groups, once a week for two months, took part in structured classes which lasted 1/5 hours. The control group received no intervention. Data gathering device was depression questionnaire of Beck with 21 items. Data was analyzed by covariance analysis.
Results: Covariance analysis showed that after adjusting pretest scores, there was a significant difference in the mean scores of the groups at post test (001/0 = p, 590/12 = (55, 3) F). Examining the adjusted mean scores revealed the superiority of desensitization by reprocessing eye movements in reducing depression over the two methods of drug therapy and group cognitive therapy. Drug therapy and group cognitive therapy had the same effect against depression. Compared with control group, symptoms of depression in experiment groups had greater reduction at post-test.
Conclusion: The results of the study demonstrated that drug therapy, group cognitive therapy and desensitization by reprocessing eye movements are effective in reducing depression in veterans.

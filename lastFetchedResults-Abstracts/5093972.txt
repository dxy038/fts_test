Objective: To discuss the biological mechanism of allergic asthma by proteomic techniques. Method: 24 Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: control group, restraint group and asthma model group. The nanoliter two-dimensional liquid chromatography (nano-2D-LC) is used to study differential protein expression in asthmatic serum of rats. Results: The model group compared with the restraint group, appeared a peak for the No.13 peak (94.731min); 3 disappearance of the peak for the No.1 peak(77.489min), 2 peak (78.418 min) and No.5 peak (80.533min), which suggested that some peptides may be related to the pathogenesis of asthma; compared with the control group, 4 new peaks of the restraint group appeared for the No.2 peak (78.418 min), No.4 peak (79.398min), No.5 peak (80.533min) and No.7 peak (81.824min), and disappeared a peak for the No.3 (78.804min), which indicated those 5 polypeptides may be concerning bound stress stimuli. Conclusion: The study suggests that the pathogenesis of allergic asthma is closely related to abnormal expression of proteins, but animal experiments need to pay attention to distinguish the correlated proteins caused by stress factors.

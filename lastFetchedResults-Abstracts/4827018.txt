As can be deduced from the work carried out in different projects, the objective of our 3D modelling laboratory is to examine the capacity of 3D laser scanner systems to model archaeological artefacts and compare the results to those obtained by photogrammetry, and to optimise registration by combining and innovating in both technologies. Another archaeological area which we have begun to investigate could be termed "The geodesic approach to imaging artefacts and obtaining two-dimensional graphic documents." Since millimetric precision can now be achieved in 3D imaging of artefacts by short-range scanners, the problem that now makes a geodesic approach advisable is the conflict between 3D results and the 2D tracings made on site by archaeological teams. As in the geodesic sciences, with regard to the problems involved in representing the Earth\Â´s surface on a flat surface, our objective is to discover how tracings made form artefacts can be studied in combination with 3D model projections. The method used for obtaining tracings will be studied and, if possible, a non-orthogonal 3D model projection process obtained from scanner systems will be developed. This paper presents the first part of the research as an introduction, describing how the laser scanner systems, short and long range equipments, have been applied in a post-glaciar engraved rock. As a new method of automatic data acquisition for use in archaeological research, the operation of the equipment is briefly described and results are presented from its application, opening the door to the new research line that joins geodesy and archaeology.

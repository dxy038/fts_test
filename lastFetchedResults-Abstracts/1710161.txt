BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Probiotics have beneficial effects on the host by improving the intestinal microflora. The role of intestinal microflora in obesity-related disorders such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) largely is known. There are evidences for the possible effects of probiotics products in NAFLD. This study aimed to investigate the effects of probiotic yogurt intake compared to conventional yogurt on anthropometric parameters in patients with NAFLD. 
METHODS: In present double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial, 72 NAFLD patients with body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 Kg/m2 were studied. Subjects were randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group (n=36, in each group) and consumed daily 300 g of probiotic yogurt or 300 g of conventional yogurt for 8 week, respectively. Dietary intakes, weight, height and waist circumference were measured at the beginning and end of the study and BMI were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. Data were analyzed by chi-squared test, independent sample t-tests, analysis of covariance and paired t-tests. (IRCT: 201210313664N8)
FINDINGS: In probiotic yogurt group significant reductions were observed in weigh (84.32±13.2 vs. 82.58±13.33 Kg) and BMI (30.1±3.61 vs. 29.48±3.7 Kg/m2; p < 0.001 for both). Changes percent in weight and BMI were 1.07% compared with the control group (p < 0.004 and p < 0.005, respectively). Waist circumference significantly was decreased in both of groups (97.4±8.45 vs. 95.71±8.36 cm in probiotic yogurt group and 98.38±10.58 vs. 97.04±10.56 cm in conventional yogurt group; p < 0.002 for both) but these changes were not different between two groups. 
CONCLUSION: The result of this study showed that probiotic yogurt consumption lead to reduction of weight and BMI in NAFLD patients and may be useful in weight management in these patients.

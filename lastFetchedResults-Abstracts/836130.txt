The family Cyprinidae is the biggest family of freshwater fishes in the world. Previous systematic studies on the genus and species of Cyprinidae were mainly based on morphological characters. But nowadays molecular data are used for these purposes extensively. The main objective of this study is determining phylogenetic relationships of 5 species of Caspian Sea Cyprinids including:  Vimba vimba persa, Rutilus frisii kutum, Barbus capito, Rutilus rutilus caspicus and Cyprinus carpio inferred from mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequencing. For this purpose 3 adult fish of each species were from Anzali wetland. 2 g of each specimen's dorsal fin was removed and stored in 96% ethyl alcohol. Genomic DNA was extracted and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was conducted on them using one pairs of cytochrome b primers. After electrophoresis, PCR product and primers were sent to Genfanavaran Corp. for sequencing. The phylogenic relationships were assessed with Mega 4. The results of this study showed that both Cyprinus carpio and Rutilus rutilus caspicus are located in the same cluster and evolutionary distance of these two species is very low. Rutilus frisii kutum with a little more evolutionary distance was located in a distinct cluster. Vimba vimba persa and Barbus capito also were located in other distinct clusters. On the other hand, all these five species were located in a separate cluster from Sander lucioperca which confirm the common ancestor for these five species. As a conclusion the results of this study showed that sequencing mitochondrial cytochrome b gene is a reliable method to investigate phylogenetic relationships among Iranian cyprinids.

The objective of distributed tracking is to operate a production system as closely as possible to an idealized regime obtained by a continuous-flow relaxation of the actual (discrete) production control problem. The stability and performance of a large class of distributed tracking policies called &#8220;nonidling-nonexceeding (NINE)&#8221; were investigated in an earlier paper (1994). In this work we focus on the most natural tracking policy in this class and find a tight bound on its performance for a single machine and a sufficient condition for its stability for multiple-machine systems. This condition is considerably less stringent than the one available for general NINE policies

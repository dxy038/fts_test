We have developed a monitor that acquires, classifies, annotates and displays patient cardiorespiratory data in an on-line and fully automated manner. The monitor is compact, portable and battery-operated; it applies automated methods that detect apnea and classify cardiorespiratory state on-line from non-invasive measurements of patient respiratory movements, blood oxygen saturation and heart rate, logging the raw and processed data. The monitor provides continuous, on-line, objective, standardized cardiorespiratory classification and has a graphical display and interface for patient monitoring by a clinician; it has immediate application in the clinical setting

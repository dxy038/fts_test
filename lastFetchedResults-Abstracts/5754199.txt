In this paper, conventional power system stabilizer (CPSS) is designed to damp electromechanical oscillations. CPSS parameters settings are computed using linear control theory. A new technique based on Genetic Algorithms (GAs) is proposed to optimize the parameters settings of CPSS. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem, the objective is to compute the optimal parameters settings such that damping ratio maximized to predetermined value. The performance and robustness of optimized PSS (OPSS) is then, tested on multi-machine system and compared with CPSS. Simulation results show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed OPSS over CPSS.

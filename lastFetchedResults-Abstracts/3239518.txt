Remote vehicle monitoring system keeps track of vehicle and also monitor the fleet level of the vehicle status. Here two problems are dealt with. First one is the anywhere any time monitoring of the vehicle status cannot be done through manual monitoring and the second one is the system behavior change according to user changes. The novelty of the proposed approach is twofold. First our proposal allows the ability to visualise the real position of vehicles and to take decisions according to realtime information through web based application. Second we develop a novel web based approach to model dynamic behaviors of interacting context-aware web services and aiming to process effectively. It takes an advantage of contexts change and realize behavior adaptation of web services and further to facilitate the development of user interface application of web services. An advanced self-adapting algorithm is developed that can automatically detect the changes in a system execution context and decide how the system should behave according to the changes in context. The objective of this project is to provide an adaptive environment which suits the system to change its behavior depending upon the contexts that ensures the challenges of context aware web services. It is an application development project which is fully related with software.

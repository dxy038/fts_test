Background and Objective: Exercise activities have an important role in increasing lean body mass and quality of life in the elderly. Skeletal muscle through the release of myokines have a significant role in muscle growth and improves metabolic condition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the comparison of order of concurrent training on anthropometric characteristics, serum IL-15 levels and insulin resistance index (HOMA) in post-menopausal women.

Materials and Methods: Twenty eight healthy post-menopausal women (age: 61.25±0.72 years, height: 156±0.02 cm, weight: 71.70±1.09 kg and BMI: 28.35±0.52) were randomly divided into three groups, strength + endurance (S+E) (n=10), endurance + strength (E+S) (n=9) and control (n=9). Training program was done eight week, 3 times per week. Endurance training were performed on a cycle ergometer (intensity: 61-88 % MHR) and strength training involved selected upper and lower body workout (intensity: 40-75 1RM, 8-18 repeat). Height, weight, BMI, WHR and serum levels of IL-15, glucose and insulin were measured and recorded before and after performing protocol. Univariate (covariance) test was used for analyzing of data.

Results: There were no significant differences between experimental groups and control group for insulin (p=0.37). But, there were significant differences in body mass (p=0.02), BMI (p=0.03), fasting glucose (p=0.001), IL-15 (p=0.04) and HOMA (p=0.028).  Significant differences were not seen between experimental groups.

Conclusion: Concurrent training distinct from order of it, increases muscle growth factor (IL-15) and improves glucose metabolism in premenopausal women, so these women can take advantage from concurrent training with any order.

A compact slot loaded koch fractal microstrip patch antenna with bidirectional radiation characteristics is presented. Applying the fractal shape in radiation element with slots on the middle and four corner edges of the radiation element makes the antenna to reduce the size and creates bidirectional radiation characteristics. The proposed 2<sup>nd</sup> order Koch fractal microstrip patch antenna is operating at 1.53GHz and slot loaded Koch fractal patch antenna operates at 1.27GHz. A patch size reduction is large for the proposed bidirectional antenna, compared to the conventional regular size square patch directional antenna. Modeling, simulation and experiments are presented. Measured and simulated results confirm that the antenna is miniaturized and it gives bidirectional radiation performance.

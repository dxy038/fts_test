The objective of this work is to present new condensation heat transfer coefficients measured inside a single square cross section minichannel, having a 1.18 mm side length, and compare them to the ones previously measured in a circular minichannel. Tests have been performed with R134a at 40 °C saturation temperature, at mass velocity ranging between 200 and 800 kg m−2 s−1. As compared to the heat transfer coefficients measured in the circular cross section channel, for the same hydraulic diameter, in the square minichannel the authors find a heat transfer enhancement at the lowest value of mass velocity, which must be due to the effect of surface tension. No heat transfer coefficient increase has been found at the highest values of the mass velocity where condensation is shear stress dominated.

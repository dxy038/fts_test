We demonstrate imaging of microscopic objects using a lensless in-line 3D digital holographic microscope at vacuum UV wavelength of 193 nm. The absence of microscope objective and a separate reference beam simplifies the setup and reduces the number of UV components required. We also discuss the space-bandwidth considerations in the design of such a system. Experimental results using human blood cells and latex beads are presented.

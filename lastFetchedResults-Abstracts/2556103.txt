Background and Objectives: Dust deposition widely occurs in arid to semiarid areas of the world. Since dust particles are fine-sized, they have a high adsorption potential and; therefore, can easily carry the contaminants. Therefore, heavy metals could be distributed in large scales by adsorbing into airborne dust particles. Dust causes great damages to humans in urban regions. The objective of this research was to assess the temporal and spatial distribution of magnetic susceptibility (MS) and its correlation with selected heavy metals in atmospheric dust of Kerman.
Materials and Methods: Dust samples were taken monthly for a period of 7 months from 
35 locations distributed over the city of Kerman from April 20 to November 20, 2012 (a total 
of 245 samples) using glass traps installed on the roof of one-story buildings. The magnetic susceptibility of dust samples was determined using a MS2B sensor. Also, the total concentration of Mn, Pb, Ni, Cu and Zn was determined using an atomic absorption spectrometer following the sample extraction with 6N HNO3.
Results: Temporal distribution of magnetic susceptibility showed that the highest MS values belonged to October (389×10-8 m3.kg-1) and the least values to July (269×10-8 m3.kg-1) and August (261×10-8 m3.kg-1) and these values followed the same trend as the temporal variability of Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations. Also, the spatial patterns of variables indicated that the highest MS was found in dust samples collected from the western sites of Kerman city where the concentration of Cu, Pb and Zn in dust was also high.
Conclusion: Topography appears to play a significant role on the distribution of heavy metals and MS values in dust, particularly in the western areas of Kerman city. Considering the role of human activities in increasing pollutants concentration in Kerman, proper management practices should be exercised to reduce air pollution resulting from various industries.

In order to represent the optical scattering properties of the complex surfaces, a semi-empirical model for bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) based on micro-facet theory was proposed, with which optical scattering properties of a certain kind of material are decided by parameters. In order to prove the model, the experiment system to measure the bidirectional reflectance distribution function has been designed, where a 905nm pulsed laser diode is used as the light resources, a PIN photodetector is used to measure the echo signal, and the reflection from an aluminum sample is measured. For the complex nonlinear relationship between the experiment data and modeling parameters, genetic algorithm was used to retrieve the model parameters. The results prove that calculation of the model complies with experiment data. It can be used as a reference for target feature extraction and recognition in the future.

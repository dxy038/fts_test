This paper describes an encryption system for analog signals based on permutation of samples. The scrambling algorithm is based on the permutation of the samples and provides highly secured scrambled signal by permuting a large number of those samples. The algorithm for generation the permutation matrices is explained. Important items to be considered in designing the system are discussed such as choice and construction of permutation matrices, and configuration of the practical scrambling system. C programming language was used for simulation. The results of simulation and tests shows that proposed scrambling achieve extremely high-level security. The method of choice and generation of permutation matrices, Tompkin-Paig algorithm and maximum length shift register are discussed. Simulations of different parts of the system, include scrambler, descrambler and generation of permutation matrices programs are provided. Miscellaneous methods of objective tests are described. Theoretical and simulation results of these tests are also provided.

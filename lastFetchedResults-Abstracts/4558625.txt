The ongoing work presented in this paper is aimed at bringing self-configuration capabilities into next generation radio access networks. We present the main concepts and architecture of our prototype. We also introduce briefly a novel strategy for foreseeing the outcome of enforcing policies integrating behaviour discovery techniques and finite state calculus into the conflict detection and resolution process. The main objective of this approach is to avoid instability problems of a distributed rule-based system

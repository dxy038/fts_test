For the nonlinear constrained optimization problems, election-survey algorithm is combined with dynamic penalty function method to get the optimum in order to demonstrate solving capability of the algorithm. The tests of classic function and engineering optimization application model show that the election-survey algorithm can constringe rapidly to global optimal solution and achieve better optimization solution of objective function. It is feasible and effective in solving nonlinear constrained optimal problems, and available for engineering optimization.

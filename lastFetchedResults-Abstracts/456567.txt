Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and total cholesterol (TC) are the primary clinical parameters of interest for any cholesterol intervention. Clinicians are interested in how the reduction of these lipid parameters as well as increases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) relate to changes in coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. The objective of this analysis was to estimate the additional CHD risk reduction that could potentially be provided by co-administration of ezetimibe with statin therapy. Data from four double-blind placebo controlled clinical trials were used to predict the level of CHD risk reduction that might be achieved by co-administration of ezetimibe with statin therapy when compared to those receiving statin as monotherapy. Patients without a previous history of CHD were included in the analysis. Projected CHD risk reduction was calculated as percent change in projected CHD risk from baseline to 12 weeks based on observed lipid levels at those time points. For all the studies combined greater reductions in percent change in 5-year CHD risk were observed for patients receiving ezetimibe and statin as co-therapy, 53.4%, when compared to those receiving statin alone, 39.7%. Co-administration of ezetimibe with statin therapy provides an additional 13.7% reduction in predicted 5-year CHD risk when compared to statin monotherapy. Reductions in 5-year CHD risk for each of the statin studies ranged from 16.1% for lovastatin to 9.8% for atorvastatin. Co-administration of ezetimibe with statins could significantly reduce CHD events in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of diazepam, L-alanyl-L-glutamine (ala-gln) or diazepam combined with ala-gln on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) free amino acid profiles. In a parallel study the effects on PMN immune functions were also documented for the first time. The incubation of whole blood with diazepam led to significant changes in PMN free glutamine, aspartate, glutamate, ornithine, arginine, citrulline, taurine and methionine as well as branched chain and neutral amino acid concentrations. Ala-gln caused significant increases in PMN glutamine and alanine and asparagine, aspartate, glutamate, ornithine, arginine, serine and glycine profiles. Regarding PMN immune functions, diazepam significantly decreased superoxide anion (O2−) and hydrogen peroxide production (H2O2) and myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) while ala-gln significantly increased PMN immune functions. Ala-gln supplemented to diazepam largely reversed the changes in PMN amino acid profiles and PMN immune functions brought about by diazepam. Overall, diazepam or ala-gln lead to significant changes in PMN free amino acids. Important PMN immune functions also seem to be affected. In regards to the results, there is significant relevance to the pharmacological regimens which enhance the supply of diazepam or ala-gln in whole blood suggesting that considerable changes in PMN “labile free amino acid pool” occur. These regimens often follow beneficial nutritional therapy or maleficent pharmacological stress and may be one of the determinants in cell nutrition which influence PMN function. It is partially through its effect on PMN labile free amino acid pool that ala-gln supplemented to diazepam may maintain PMN immune functions in vitro.

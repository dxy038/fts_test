Background  Objectives: Systematic monitoring of exposure levels for radiation workers and other employees who might recive radiation is the main objective of dosimetry. Biodosimetry is the choice method to assess radiation dose of those exposed unplanned. Biodosimetry may be performed by three techniques: clinical methods, biological methods by genetic and cytogenetic analysis (including dicenteric assay, micronuclei assay, translocation analysis (FISH) and PCC analysis) and biodosimetry based on physical factors (including EPR and OSL). The ideal biodosimetry method is the technique which that offers accurate estimation of accidental or unplanned doses immediately following to exposure, in emergency cases. Other characteristics of an ideal biodosimetry method are high sensitivity, coverage to a wide range of doses, ability to distinguish between acute and chronic exposure. The aim of this study was to comparison of various biodosimetry methods used currently.

Material  Methods: In this study, relevant articles on biological dosimetry have been reviewed. Then, specific keywords were selectedÂ  based on the aim of study and the most recent publication in this field, were collected.

Results: Gene expression methods have high sensitivity and low specificity. Dicentric chromosomes in human lymphocytes is still as ideal method of biodosimetry methods. However FISH and EPR techniques Because of the time stability of response, has recently been used widely.

Conclusion: Evaluation of various biodosimetry techniques is evident biodosimetry is a practical method, but no single technique may be appropriate to apply for all applications. However, combined methods (especially physical and biological methods) can be helpful.

The 8th abdominal segment of Heliothis virescens (Fabricius) larvae contains aerating trachea and tracheole tufts that end in the hemocoel of the 8th segment, unlike the tracheae that invade tissues in other segments. These tracheal tufts from the 8th abdominal segment extend to the tokus region, which along with the telson cavity is known to act as a “lung” for hemocytes in Calpodes ethlius and a few other lepidopteran larvae. The goal of this research was to study the effects of these tracheal tufts in the 8th abdominal segment on parasitoid development inside the host larvae, H. virescens. The first objective was to determine if the eggs of the parasitoid, Toxoneuron nigriceps, are predominantly located among the tracheal tufts of the 8th abdominal segment compared to other body cavity regions irrespective of their oviposition site or the position of the host larvae. The results showed that several hours after oviposition most of the eggs are found in the 8th abdominal segment irrespective of the oviposition site or the position of the host larvae. The second objective was to study the effect of varying oxygen concentrations in vitro on various developmental stages of the egg. The results showed that decreasing oxygen concentrations adversely affects the parasitoid egg development in vitro. A third objective was to determine the oxygen concentration in 8th abdominal segment of the host larvae and compare it to other regions of the body using an oxygen sensor placed in vivo. The results suggested relatively high concentration of oxygen in the 8th abdominal segment compared to other regions of the host, thus supporting our hypothesis that the increased oxygen level in the 8th abdominal segment is important to the development of the parasitoid eggs.

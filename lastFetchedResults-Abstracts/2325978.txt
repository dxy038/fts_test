Context and Objective: Community-based police, as a performative model,
was born within the American police system. This model, with the belief
that fighting crime and disorder is the duty of every member of the society,
emphasizes the utilizing of social force in policy making and executing police
programs. After the success of this model in the US, other police systems also
followed suit and made it operational through special operations.
Methodology: The methodology for this article is descriptive-analytical and
library-based sources are used for data collection.
Findings: The study of the survey of the evolution of community-based
police shows that this model emerged after the police passed through political
and reformation periods. In this model: people have an active role in police
activities, the police priorities are attending to the needs of society members,
increasing feeling of security, and the decrease of fear of crime, and success
assessment criteria of the police have changed. The successful execution of
this model requires fundamental changes in the attitude of people, targets and
structure of the police which can face opposition in some cases. In spite of the
opposition, this model has found its place in different systems.
Results: The successes of community-based policing have led it to be called
a proper police model. This model tries to get the community and the police
closer to each other. Therefore, despite the definitions and topics, any program
following this model is considered an aspect of community-based police.
However, with violent and terrorist attacks, there have been doubts about the
model but it is still as important.

The present paper outlines an application of genetic algorithm based strategies to a class of optimization tasks associated with the design of steel reinforced concrete structures. In this particular case, the principal design objective is to minimize the total cost of a structure. The resulting structure, however, should not only be marked with a low price but also comply with all strength and serviceability requirements for a given level of the applied load. To solve such a complex optimization problem with a number constraints calls for an efficient and yet reliable optimization technique. Here, the problem is addressed with the help of the augmented simulated annealing method. As an example, a simple continuous steel reinforced beam is analyzed to assess applicability of the proposed approach.

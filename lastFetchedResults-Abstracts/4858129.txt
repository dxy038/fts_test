In this paper we present an abstract metamodel with formally defined semantics for transaction level modeling (TLM). Our objective is to capture the essence of TLM and different modeling styles in a manner which is as independent of the implementation language and simulation mechanism as possible. Such a metamodel can be used as a guideline for design of modeling libraries, modeling languages, and study of different simulation schemes. The proposed metamodel is the basis of our ongoing work in construction of TLM-specific modeling libraries and high-performance simulation kernels. As an example, we capture the the simulation semantics of two modeling styles proposed by the OSCI TLM standard.

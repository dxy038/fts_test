Backgrounds and Objectives: Water contamination with arsenic has been recognized as a serious problem and its epidemiological problems to human health have been reported. The objective of this study was to explore the possibility modified wheat straw using sodium bicarbonate for removing arsenic from aqueous solution.
Materials and Methods: Adsorption process was accomplished in a laboratory-scale batch with emphasis on the effect of various parameters such as pH, contact time, arsenic concentration and adsorbent dosage on adsorption efficiency. In order to understand the adsorption process, sorption kinetics and equilibrium isotherms were also determined.
Results: It was found that adsorption of the arsenic was influenced by several parameters such as arsenic initial concentration, adsorbent dosage and solution pH. Maximum absorption efficiency was achieved at pH 7. As expected the amount of arsenic adsorbed on wheat straw incresed as its concentration went up. Among the models tested, namely the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin Radushkevich isotherms, the adsorption equilibrium for arsenic was best described by the Langmuir and Freundlich models. It was also found that adsorption of arsenic by wheat straw followed pseudo second-order kinetics. Mean free energy of adsorption (15.8 kJ mol1) indicates that adsorption of arsenic by wheat straw might follow a chemisorption mechanism. Desorption studies show that arsenic ions are strongly bounded with the adsorbent and exhibit low desorption. Conclusion: It is concluded that that adsorption by modified wheat straw is an efficient and reliable method for arsenic removal from liquid solutions.

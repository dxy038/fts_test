A novel objective approach to assessing the relative perceptual quality of MPEG-encoded video sequences is presented. Quality comparison of the original and filtered MPEG-encoded video sequences is performed directly in the frequency domain. Experimental results show a very good correlation between the objective quality measurement and the human subjective perception. This objective approach provides a sensible and meaningful automated quality measure for MPEG compression. The approach should become a viable tool to aid MPEG encoding optimization

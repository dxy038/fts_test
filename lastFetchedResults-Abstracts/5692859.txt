Environmental issues and the need to reduce energy consumption for lowering operating costs have pushed power efficiency to become one of the major issues of current research in the field of wireless networks. The objective of the Green Radio research programme (Core 5) of Mobile VCE is to deliver reduced power consumption of radio access networks. This paper attempts to show that an efficient exploitation of multiple antenna techniques and multiuser diversity in both the time, frequency as well as the space domain can significantly ease the power requirements of a base station, whilst maintaining the same levels of service. Different MIMO transmission and preceding schemes proposed for LTE, achieving varying degrees of multiuser diversity are examined.

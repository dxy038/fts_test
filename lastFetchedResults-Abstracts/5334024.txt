This paper presents an application of the particle swarm optimizers to multi-objective problems in design of switching inverters. In the algorithm, the particles represent switching angles and move to optimize two objectives: minimizing the total harmonic distortion and setting the desired total power. This two-objective problem is important to realize smooth speed control of ac machine drivers. Performing basic numerical experiments, we have confirmed that the method can find efficient switching angles that realize efficient operation.

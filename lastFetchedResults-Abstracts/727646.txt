Nitrofuranyl isoxazolines with increased proteolytic stability over nitrofuranyl amides were designed and synthesized leading to discovery of several compounds with potent in vitro anti-tuberculosis activity. However, their in vivo activity was limited by high protein binding and poor distribution. Consequently, a series of non-nitrofuran containing isoxazolines were prepared to determine if the core had residual anti-tuberculosis activity. This led to the discovery of novel isoxazoline 12 as anti-tuberculosis agent with a MIC90 value of 1.56 Î¼g/mL.

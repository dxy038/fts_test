
Background and Aims: Traumatic dental injuries (TDIs) are of the most common dental problems in children and adolescents, which usually occur in the anterior segment and have a significant role in patient&rsquo;s physical and psychological health. Immediate intervention for damaged teeth can elevate the success rate of treatment in TDI. Thus, general dentists&rsquo; knowledge and their effective intervention in TDI are important factors in prognosis of traumatized teeth. The objective of this study was to assess the general dentists&rsquo; knowledge and awareness regarding the diagnosis and management of traumatic dental injuries.

Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the questionnaire data were collected from 130 general dentists, including the demographic data and general dentists&rsquo; knowledge about TDIs. The data were analyzed using the Student t-test and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Spearman&rsquo;s and Pearson&rsquo;s correlation coefficient.

Results: The mean score of general dentists&rsquo; knowledge was 8.5 &plusmn; 1.5 (total score:10) and it was the same between both males and females (P=0.083). Dentists&rsquo; work place does not have any influence in their knowledge (P=0.133). Also, there was no statically significant relationship between the age, job experience and dentists&rsquo; knowledge (P=0.805). The relationship between the frequency of TDI managed cases and dentists&rsquo; knowledge was not significant (P=0.507).

Conclusion: Considering that the overall knowledge of general dentists regarding the management of TDI was sufficient, it could be a good opportunity in treating these injuries. As TDI is a developing science, it is important to motivate general dentists being up to date regarding this matter.

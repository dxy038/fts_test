Microwave propagation experiments were performed on two separate line-of-sight paths across the Bay of Fundy on the east coast of Canada. The main objective was to investigate the mechanisms of anomalous propagation observed on such oversea paths. An interferometer which employs a wide frequency sweep of 1 GHz (from 9.5 to 10.5 GHz) was used. The parameters studied include the amplitude, angle-of-arrival (AOA), and relative delay time of the received rays. The behavior of these parameters during quiet and disturbed periods are compared and discussed in detail. Statistical results on the ray parameters and on the received signal level are also presented. Explanations for the various experimental observations are offered; these were arrived at by using a ray tracing method combined with refractivity profile modeling. It was found that the observed propagation anomalies result from interactions between specular reflection and atmospheric layer formations.

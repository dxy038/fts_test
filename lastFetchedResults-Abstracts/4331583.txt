The deformation of seamless steel pipe rolling process is complex due to material and geometrical nonlinearity, so itÂ´s hard to design pass and optimize rolling schedule. With the analysis of rolling for PQF, a method of pass design and optimization method based on the finite element modeling is presented. On the basis of pass design, the finite element simulation model is established. Considering the checking condition of pass design and rack load balanced allocation, the paper establishes an appraisal model based on the finite element modeling to evaluate pass design. Finally, as the evaluation function serves as the objective function, the paper uses particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize specific elongation. These not only develop new products but also enhance the state rolling process characteristics (dimensional accuracy and internal and external surface quality).

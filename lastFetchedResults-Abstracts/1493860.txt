Soil degradation processes may be of various kinds, including soil compaction. The present study was carried out with the objective of assessing the sensitivity of agricultural or recently abandoned soils in Maputo province of Mozambique to compaction. The assessment is based on the maximum of bulk density attained using the Proctor test (MBD).

s study the soil texture is expressed by silt plus clay (S + C) or clay (C). The relations between the soil texture and MBD, and between soil texture and critical water content (CWCâ€”soil water at which MBD is attained) were determined. Selected soils range from 10 to 74% of S + C and 9 to 60% of C.

sults suggest there is a relationship between the considered parameters, being that between S + C and MBD or CWC, the best. For MBD the relationship is represented by two quadratic equations with the boundary in between these being a S + C value of 25% and C value of 20%.

on the obtained results, one can conclude that the selected parameters may be a useful basis for estimation of the sensitivity to compaction of the Maputo province's soils. It is recommended that similar studies be carried out for soils under forest land and for soil of other provinces to establish the national physical degradation hazard as a function of soil parameters determined routinely and at low cost. The suggested parameters are texture and soil organic matter (SOM).

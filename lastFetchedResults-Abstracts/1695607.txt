The main objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between information technology knowledge and empowerment of teachers. Accordingly, a correlational descriptive research method was adopted. The research population consisted of all teachers employed in Bojnurd city (n=1100) out of which 287 subjects were selected through stratified random sampling. The research instruments included Spreitzerâ€™s empowerment questionnaire with a reliability of 0.82 as well as the researcher-made questionnaire in the field of information technology with a reliability of 0.71 based on Cronbach Alpha coefficient. In order to examine research hypotheses, Pearson correlation coefficient was used. Further, to determine the affecting variables and demonstrate the direct and indirect effects of independent variables on dependent variables, multivariate regression was employed. The results revealed that there were significant relationship between teachers' empowerment with using internet, using education courses, teachers' ability to transfer information, ability to manage databases, ability to share information, and, in general, familiarity with information technology. Also findings suggested that taking the training courses, the ability to transfer information and the attitude toward the information exchange played a decisive role in empowerment of teachers.

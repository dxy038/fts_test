The job-shop scheduling problem (JSP) is one of the hardest problems (NP-complete problem). In a lot of cases, the combination of goals and resource exponentially increases search space. The objective of resolution of such a problem is generally, to maximize the production with a lower cost and makespan. In this paper, we explain how to modify the objective function of genetic algorithms to treat the multi-objective problem and to generate a set of diversified "optimal" solutions in order to help decision maker. We are interested in one of the problems occurring in the production workshops where the list of demands is split into firm (certain) jobs and predicted jobs. One wishes to maximize the produced quantity, while minimizing as well as possible the makespan and the production costs. Genetic algorithms are used to find the scheduling solution of the firm jobs because they are well adapted to the treatment of the multi-objective optimization problems. The predicted jobs was inserted in the real solutions (given by genetic algorithms). The solutions proposed by our approach are compared to the lower bound of the cost and makespan in order to prove the quality and robustness of our proposed approach

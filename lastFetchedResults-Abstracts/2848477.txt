In order to overcome the fuzziness of subjective evaluation ensuring that the steering column switches operating performance evaluation is objective and reasonable. A comprehensive evaluation model on the basis of the traditional gray theory comprehensive evaluation method is proposed based on DengÂ´s correlation, absolute correlation and relative correlation. Combined with subjective evaluation data, the calculated correlation among evaluation factors and the steering column switches operating performance, and the correlation of the evaluation factors as weights, achieves a quantitative objective steering column switches operating performance evaluation.

We proposed a bidirectional 60 GHz multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) wireless communication system. In this system, MB-OFDM signals can be transmitted bidirectionally on 60 GHz band. We measured the transmission´s packet error rate (PER) of the system in different distances (1m-5m) and modes (data rates of 53.3 Mbps to 480 Mbps; using various MB-OFDM time-frequency codes (TFC)) to show the system´s transmission performance. Furthermore, we demonstrated the system with the form of teleconference based on Ethernet.

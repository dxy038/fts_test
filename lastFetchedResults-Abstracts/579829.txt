Objective
Primary brain tumors are the most common solid neoplasms of childhood, 
representing 20% of all pediatric tumors. The best current estimates place the 
incidence between 2.76 and 4.28/100,000 children per year. Compared with 
brain tumors in adults, a much higher percentage of pediatric brain tumors 
arise in the posterior fossa. Infratentorial tumors comprise as many as two thirds 
of all pediatric brain tumors in some large series. Tumor types that most often 
occur in the posterior fossa include medulloblastoma, ependymoma, cerebellar 
astrocytoma and brainstem glioma. 
Materials & Methods 
All pediatric cases of posterior fossa tumor that were considered for surgery 
from 1981 to 2011 were selected and the demographic data including age, 
gender and tumor characteristics along with the location and pathological 
diagnosis were recorded. The surgical outcomes were assessed according to 
pathological diagnosis.
Results 
Our series consisted of  84 patients (52 males,  32 females). Cerebellar 
symptoms were the most common cause of presentation (80.9%) followed 
by headache (73.8%) and vomiting (38.1%). The most common histology 
was medulloblastoma (42.8%) followed by cerebellar astrocytoma (28.6%), 
ependymoma (14.3%), brainstem glioma (7.2%) and miscellaneous pathologies 
(e.g., dermoid,  andtuberculoma) (7.2%). 
Conclusion
The diagnosis of brain tumors in the general pediatric population remains 
challenging. Most symptomatic children require several visits to a physician 
before the correct diagnosis is made. These patients are often misdiagnosed 
for gastrointestinal disorders. Greater understanding of the clinical presentation 
of these tumors and judicious use of modern neuroimaging techniques should 
lead to more efficacious therapies

We show a design of thruster for an X4-AUV robot, which has four thrusters. The objective in this paper is to prove the availability of this design in reality. At first, we describe the structure of underwater robots, then show the whole design of the thruster. At the last, the experimental results show us the thrust generated by one of the thrusters.

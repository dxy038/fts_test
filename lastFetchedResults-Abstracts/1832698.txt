The present study examined the role of identity statuses in predicting attitudes toward love among married people. For this purpose two hundred married people (96 males and 104 females) from five different regions across Qazvin City were selected by convenient method. They answered the 24-item love attitude scale of Hendrick & Hendrick and the 32-item Extended Objective Measure of Ego Identity status-2nd version (EOM-EIS-2). The result from administrating the Pearson's correlation test and analysis of stepwise regression showed that there is direct correlation between achievement of identity with the types of love attitudes like Eros, Storage, Agape and Pragma. There were significant correlations between Moratorium with Ludus and Agape, and between foreclosure identity status and Storage. The results also showed that achievement and foreclosure identity statuses were able to predict love attitudes in married women and achievement identity status was able to predict the attitudes toward love in married men. So, the predictive role of identity statuses for love attitudes of married men and women was confirmed. This research demonstrated that identity statuses were correlated with love attitudes as a basis of intimacy and thus it reconfirms Erikson's theory about the role of identity in the formation of the fundamental basis of intimacy (love) in married people, so a strong ego development is basic to form mutual successful relationships.

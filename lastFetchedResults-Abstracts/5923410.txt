A cycle economy, as a paradigm for industry in the 21/sup st/ century, depends on economical and responsible treatment of limited resources. The objective is to achieve more use with fewer resources. Adaptation by maintenance, repair, remanufacturing, upgrading or downgrading, enlargement and reduction, re-arrangement or modernization extends the usage phase of products. Disassembly and re-assembly processes are major elements of adaptation processes and contribute significantly to increase the use-productivity of resources. The adaptability of a product at the end of its life cycle is significantly influenced by its design. Thus, methodologies and metrics to assess and quantify a productÂ´s adaptability are required. A dedicated Methodology for Assessing the Adaptability of Products (MAAP) has been developed and is described in detail. Improvement potential within the design of the product, its components and joints can be derived with this method. Its applicability is assessed in a case study using cellular phones as product examples.

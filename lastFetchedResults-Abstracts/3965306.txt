This study presents an efficient method for the multi-objective reconfiguration of radial distribution systems in fuzzy framework using adaptive genetic algorithm. The initial population for genetic algorithm is created using a heuristic approach and the genetic operators are adapted with the help of graph theory to generate feasible individuals. This avoids tedious mesh check and hence reduces the computational burden. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on 70-bus test system and 136-bus real distribution system. The simulation results show that the proposed method is efficient and promising for multi-objective reconfiguration of radial distribution systems.

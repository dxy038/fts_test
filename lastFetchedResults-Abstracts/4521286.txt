There are various security policy models available to deal with the challenges in multiple domain networks. Applying role based access control (RBAC) is one the widely accepted and currently deployed access control model in multiple domain environments to support mobility constraints of users between domains, inter domain services and its access rights. The objective of this paper is representing various access permissions of multiple domain role based access control model using formal concept analysis (FCA) which is one of the widely used mathematical frameworks for knowledge representation and conceptual analysis. To succeed this objective, we deduce a dyadic formal context from the quadratic security context of inter domain role based access control model. We present the implementation of inter domain role based access control security policy with service access matrix and permission assignment relation. The analysis proves that it is possible to simplify the complex quadratic inter domain security context into simple dyadic context and apply it in the multiple domain networks.

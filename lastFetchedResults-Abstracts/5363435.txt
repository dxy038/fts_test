This paper introduces a kind of immune genetic algorithm which regards objective function as antigen, solution as antibody and updates the population using evolutionary strategy. After economic emission load dispatch which belongs to multi-objective constrained optimization problems is discussed, main processes of immune genetic algorithm to solve this matter is given. Through tests a power system model with five coal-burning generating units, feasibility and validity of this algorithm is proved. And by comparing with genetic algorithm and Hopfield neural network, optimization and quick constringency of this algorithm to solve similar problems are proved

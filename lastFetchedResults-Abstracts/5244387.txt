This paper reports two novel algorithms based on time-modulo reconstruction method intended for detection of the parametric faults in analogue-to-digital converters (ADC). In both algorithms, a pulse signal, in its slightly adapted form to allow sufficient time for converter settling, is taken as the test stimulus reliving the burden placed on accuracy requirement of excitation source. The objective of the test scheme is not to completely replace traditional specification-based tests, but to provide a reliable method for early identification of excessive parameter variations in production test that allows quickly discarding of most of the faulty circuits before going through the conventional test. The efficiency of the methods is validated on a 6-bit flash ADC.

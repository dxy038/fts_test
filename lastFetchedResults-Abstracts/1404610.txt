Background and purpose: Hepatotoxicity and elevated serum aminotransferase is a severe side
effect of anti-Tuberculosis therapy and some cases could even develop hepatitis. This study aimed at
determining the prevalence of drug induced hepatitis and predisposing factor after anti-Tuberculosis
therapy in Razi hospital.
Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional study we used the medical records of all
confirmed cases of tuberculosis admitted at the infectious disease ward of Ghaemshahr Razi hospital
between 2006-2011. Variables included age, sex, type of TB, other medications, basal levels of liver
enzymes, enzyme changes during treatment, and co-infection (such as hepatitis B - HIV). The diagnosis
of drug induced hepatitis was done with at least five-fold increase of aminotransferase levels. Data was
analyzed using SPSS17, chi square tests and Fisher's exact test.
Results: Of 230 patients, 56.5% were male. The frequency of pulmonary TB and extra
pulmonary TB was 91.7% and 8.3%, respectively. Standard treatment was used in 92.5% of patients with
tuberculosis. 23.5% of patients had an underlying disease. Prevalence of drug-induced hepatitis in this
study was 9.5%. There was no significant correlation between gender, type of tuberculosis and type of
drug treatment with drug-induced hepatitis, but there was a significant relationship between age and druginduced
hepatitis.
Conclusion: The results showed that old age was the only significant risk factor for druginduced
hepatitis in the treatment of tuberculosis, hence, elderly patients must be placed under regular
clinical and laboratory evaluation.

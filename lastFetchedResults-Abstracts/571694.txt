John  Lock  is  considered  one  of  the  most  prominent  theorists  on  property  in 
bourgeois society. His intellectual and, to some extent, moral views are applied to 
the rationalization of inequality within the nation and the efficiency of colonialism 
and  dominance  in  the  international  community  within  the  system  of  liberal 
economy  and  capitalism.  This  article  analyses  the  Britain’s  economic  condition 
during  John  Lock’s  life  time  and  explain  how  the  landlord  system  and  the 
establishment of centralized government and bourgeois class deteriorated. Hence, 
the  main  objective  in  this  article  is  how  John  Lock  with  his  theory  of  “Labor-
value”  and  the  linkage between  two  concepts of  liberty  and  capital  accumulation 
could  provide  philosophic  and  moral  rational  for  capitalists  grip  on  the  poor 
internally and  the success of British colonialism  in  international community. This 
paper also intends, by decoding the theory of “Labor-value “to show how and why 
property  and  respect  for  the  right  of  property  owners  has  become  one  of  the 
fundamental pillars of liberal economy and the development of liberal system.

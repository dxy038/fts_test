In this paper, the driving manner and design method are discussed for the elbow joint of one kind of robot artificial limb. On the basis to satisfy ergonomics, some technical parameters required for the riving manner is make out for the elbow joint. In order to ensure implement for diverse requests, optimization design is adopted in this case. Based on the peculiarity of structure and movement, variables, constraint functions and objective function are all projected reasonably. Complex method is handled to optimize the parameters. Finally, with graphics simulation, it is proved that optimization results suffice the practice requirement commendably.

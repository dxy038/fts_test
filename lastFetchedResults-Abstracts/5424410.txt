During the last few years, an increase in the development and research activity on 3D applications, mainly motivated by the rigorous growth of the game industry, is observed. This paper deals with assessing user satisfaction, i.e. a critical aspect of 3D software quality, by measuring technical characteristics of virtual worlds. Such metrics can be easily calculated in games and virtual environments of different themes and genres. In addition to that, the metric suite would provide an objective mean of comparing 3D software. In this paper, metrics concerning the graphical representation of a virtual world are introduced and validated through a pilot experiment.

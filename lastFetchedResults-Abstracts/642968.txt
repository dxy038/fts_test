Objective
I determined the presence of information on certain nutritional indicators in hospital records of patients with newly diagnosed cancer in Connecticut who were members of U.S. minority groups that tend to experience language barriers to health care.
Methods

For 989 Hispanic and Asian American adult patients with newly diagnosed (in 2002â€“2003) cancer identified in the statewide population-based Connecticut cancer registry, recording of information on nutritional indicators (weight/height, mention of recent weight loss or malnutrition, serum albumin and prealbumin) in hospital records was determined.
Results

For the hospital admission closest to the date of cancer diagnosis, 92% had weight and height recorded. Recent weight loss was mentioned for only 21.5% and was less frequent (12.7%) among 237 preferring English versus 28.2% of 418 preferring Spanish and 28.6% preferring an Asian language; the association with language category persisted when other variables were considered. Malnutrition was mentioned for only 2.8% of 989 patients, serum albumin level was found for 50.8%, and prealbumin for only 8.9%.
Conclusion

Aside from weight/height, assessment of nutritional status appeared to be limited; mention of weight loss was infrequent, although an unexplained difference was detected by language category that requires confirmation.

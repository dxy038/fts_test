Urban land use planning which is one of the main components of urban planning typically defined as a multi-objective planning problem in optimal use of urban space and existing facilities. Among numerous land use maps, urban planners are usually interested in choosing the map which is contiguous to the optimal land use map of an interested vision. Reference point multi-objective optimization algorithms provide possibility of introducing the optimal values for different objectives as a reference point and producing optimal solutions near to reference points. In this study, the implementation and efficiency of Reference-Point-Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (R-NSGA II) for urban landuse allocation is investigated and a method for chromosomes coding is proposed. Maximizing compatibility of adjacent land use, land suitability, accessibility to roads and main socio-economic centers, and minimizing resistance of land use to change are defined as the main objectives. Then the optimal values of objectives were introduced to the algorithm as reference points. Consequently, planners will be able to select within proposed land use maps according to their priorities. The results of land use allocation modeling for Shiraz city in 2011 indicate that the decision maker is able to choose a better decision with more reliability comparing to situations with a single solution. This achievement indicates proposed model ability for simulation of different scenarios in land use planning

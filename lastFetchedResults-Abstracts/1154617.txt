The objective of the present study is thus to investigate the effect of particles velocity, temperature on the cored wire coatings properties. The results of a systematic investigation of the influence of different nozzles configurations on the coatings properties are presented, including the gas dynamics properties of the spray jet were calculated by using the CFD code, temperature, velocity and diameter of the particles in-flight measurements and the effects on the particles properties on coating adhesion, pores and oxide content. The microstructures of arc spray coatings using a newly developed thermal spray nozzle, was studied and compared with those of regular arc sprayed coatings. The test results showed that coatings had better properties than those of regular arc sprayed coatings.

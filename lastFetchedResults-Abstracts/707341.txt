This study evaluated a continuing education program for paramedics about children with special health care needs (CSHCN). Pretraining, posttraining, and follow-up surveys containing two scales (comfort with CSHCN management skills and comfort with Pediatric Advanced Life Support [PALS] skills) were administered. Objective measures of knowledge were obtained from pre- and posttraining tests. Differences in average scores were assessed using t-tests. Response rates for paramedics completing the program ranged from 94% for the posttraining survey, 81% for the initial comfort survey, 56% for the knowledge pretest, and 56% for the follow-up survey. PALS comfort scores were significantly higher than CSHCN comfort scores both before and after training, both P< .01. Posttraining surveys showed an increase in CSHCN comfort, P< .01. The follow-up surveys showed a significant decline in CSHCN comfort, P = .05. Scores on the tests showed a similar pattern, with a significant increase in knowledge from pre- to posttraining (P = .02) and a significant decrease in knowledge from posttraining to follow-up (P< .01). Comfort was significantly higher for standard pediatric skills than for specialized management skills. Completion of the self-study program was associated with an increase in comfort and knowledge, but there was some decay over time

Solar cells combined with power management algorithms enable the dynamic scheduling of Wireless Sensor Networks applications in a reference period, where the objective of the scheduling is to maximize the application quality level while conserving an energy level sufficient to constantly maintain the sensor operation. With the purpose of fulfillment of its activities the sensor may have alternative different applications with different costs and quality levels, which are intended to express how much the application meets the user requirements. In this paper we propose an algorithm that aims to find a (sub)optimal scheduling that maximizes the overall quality of service for two networked, solar cells powered sensors, and keeps the system energy neutral, thus ensuring that the system works uninterruptedly.

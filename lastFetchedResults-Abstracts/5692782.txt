In this communication we analyze the feasibility of experimentally implementing arbitrary three-dimensional vectorial distributions in the focal area of a converging lens. The analysis is carried out using the framework of the closest electromagnetic field to a target vectorial function. An optical setup based on the use of liquid crystal devices and an objective lens is also discussed.

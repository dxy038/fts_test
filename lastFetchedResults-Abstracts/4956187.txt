In this paper the results of electrical induction furnace developed in Chile are presented. The development is based on a U.S. Invention Patent No. 6,466,467, whose objective is varying the inverter frequency according the natural resonant frequency of the load, cycle by cycle. In this scenario several equipments have been built on a power range of 250 kW. By using a melting crucible it was possible to successfully melt about 1000 kg of minerals.

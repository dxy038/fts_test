Relaxation techniques for solving nonlinear systems and global optimisation problems require bounding from below the nonconvexities that occur in the constraints or in the objective function by affine or convex functions. In this paper we consider such lower bound functions in the case of problems involving multivariate polynomials. They are constructed by using Bernstein expansion. An error bound exhibiting quadratic convergence in the univariate case and some numerical examples are given.

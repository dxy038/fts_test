Mathematical models for the internal forces of double-crane and double-rope system are established. The lifting-point positions are taken as design variables. The objective function is to minimize the maximum moment in the process of hoisting long posts. The constraints are imposed by the penalty strategy. And get the optimization solution through grid method and genetic algorithm. The best rope system is determined by comparing the computational results of initial rope systems under respective best lifting-points. In the end, the correction and efficiency of the scheme are proved by a calculation example. The results indicate that the peak of maximum moment is decreased by about 30% through choosing the optimum rope system, lifting-points and rope length.

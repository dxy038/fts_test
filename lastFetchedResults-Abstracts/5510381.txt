The CLIC test facility 3 (CTF3) has the objective to demonstrate the remaining feasibility issues of the CLIC two-beam technology for a future multi-TeV linear collider. One key issue is the efficient generation of a very high current ´drive beam´ that serves as the power source for the acceleration of the main beam to high energy. This large current beam is produced by interleaving bunches in a combiner ring using transverse deflecting RF cavities. The 84 m long CTF3 combiner ring and the connecting transfer line have been recently installed and put into operation. The latest commissioning results will be presented.

This paper presents a model to assess the efficiency of knowledge transfer within an organization. First, a literature review of knowledge transfer management with a practical contribution to the shop-floor activities is presented. Second, a model of the knowledge transfer process with five distinctive phases is suggested. Third, an efficiency index is proposed to provide an objective numerical measure of the process. The numerical index is defined as a function of three attributes: process delay; effort; and width. Its properties and limitations are discussed. Several pilot studies have been launched to test the validity of the model. One pilot is introduced in this paper

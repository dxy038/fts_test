In this paper, we develop a coordinated ramp control strategy based on second order sliding mode control. As in the well known ALINEA procedure, the developed feedback control law uses as control objective the desired density downstream the ramp. The ramp metering controller is developed on the basis of a first order traffic flow model. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through a simulation study case and field data test. Both behaviors of first order and second order sliding mode controllers are discussed

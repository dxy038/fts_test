Bus passengers normally could be divided into those who are on the bus and those who are at the roadside bus-stop waiting for the bus. Both kinds of passengers should be at least in equal importance. This paper has described how to supply an improved environment to passengers at roadside, and how to estimate the passengers waiting at the bus stop and combine them into the weight coefficient of objective function on the detected and predicted bus message through some kinds of AVL technologies and prediction models. The bus priority signals then can be adjusted on the obtained function.

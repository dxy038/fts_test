In this paper a branch and bound algorithm is presented for solving blocking flowshop scheduling problem. We consider the total completion time and total weighted completion time as objective function. Our proposed algorithm is the first one that addressed to these criteria. Besides, new machine based lower bounds are derived. Computational experiments show the effectiveness of the branch and bound algorithm to solve large scale instances.

Currently most quantum key distribution (QKD) experiments are focusing on efficient long-distance implementations. Yet the recent development of miniaturized photonic modules and integrated quantum optics circuits could open new perspectives toward secure short-distance communication for daily-life applications. Here, we present the design of a new integrated optics architecture with an effective size of 25 mm &#215; 2 mm &#215; 1 mm. Our objective is to obtain an ultraflat microoptics QKD add-on suitable for integration into handheld platforms such as smartphones. In this context, we evaluated the suitability of various optical subsystems. We tested an array of four vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL) with highly similar emission properties capable of producing subnanosecond near-infrared pulses at 100-MHz repetition rate. As short pulses exhibit a low polarization degree, their polarization can be externally controlled by a micropolarizer array. The fabrication of such elements is quite straightforward using standard lithographic techniques and extinction ratios up to 29 dB have been measured. To guarantee spatial indistinguishability of the qubits, we investigate the option of using low-birefringence, single-mode waveguide array manufactured via femtosecond laser micromachining.

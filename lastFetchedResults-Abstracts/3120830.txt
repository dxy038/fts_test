This paper reports on the solution adopted at the Southern scenario demonstrator of the R&amp;D project FENIX for the effective integration of distributed energy resources (DER) into power system operation. DER reactive power production, on load tap changers (OLTC) and shunt capacitors are optimally coordinated to alleviate/eliminate distribution network constraints. This general objective is defined within an optimal power flow (OPF) algorithm targeting other goals such as network losses reduction or influencing transmission network nodeÂ´ voltages. A commercial distribution management system (DMS) is adapted to integrate the voltage VAr control (VVC) module and the whole system is brought into operation with real time measurements and commands send on open loop basis.

The objective of this work is to suggest criteria and guidelines that can be used to design inclusive technological solutions to support human activity sharing in the context of Ambient Intelligence. These guidelines derive from the analysis of previous works in related fields such as cognitive engineering, usability, inclusive design and accessibility. The first step of this work was the definition of a number of principles that enable humans to interact with the environment and with other people through the environment. Each principle is further defined by a number of guidelines that more concretely explain how to satisfy it. The modular organization of the guidelines enables them to be applied for two purposes: the first six principles can be used to guide the design of a generic inclusive Ambient Intelligence system, all together are specifically oriented to the design of human activity sharing systems.

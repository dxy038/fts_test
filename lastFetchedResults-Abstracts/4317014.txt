The basic objective of economic dispatch of electric power generation is to schedule the committed generating unit outputs so as to meet the load demand at minimum operating cost while satisfying all unit and system equality and inequality constraints. Due to increasing concern over the environmental considerations, society demands adequate and secure electricity not only at the cheapest possible price, but also at minimum level of pollution. The problem has been formulated as multi-objective optimization problem with competing fuel cost and emission objectives. In a multi-objective optimization problem, there may not exist one solution that is best with respect to all objectives. Usually, the aim is to determine the tradeoff solution which is a set of nondominated solution points, known as Pareto-optimal solutions. A Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) have demonstrated an ability to provide accurate and feasible multiple Pareto-optimal solutions in one single run and also to maintain population diversity in the set of the nondominated solutions.

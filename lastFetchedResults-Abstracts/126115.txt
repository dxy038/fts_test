Introduction: Health is a turning point of nursing care and nursing education. Nursing instruction program provides a context for the students to examine their life styles and create the appropriate changes in their health and assume the professional responsibility in order to be a good model with regard to health behavior.
Objective: In this descriptive- comparative research, we studied the first and last- year nursing students of Guilan Nursing Faculties and their health styles.
Materials and Methods: 130 students were selected by stratified random sampling from nursing schools of Rasht, Anzaly, Somesara, Langrood and Lahijan. Data were collected by a questionnaire.
Results: Results indicated that the majority of students (58.5%) had risky condition in eating habits. Most of the first- year (58.5%) and last- year (47.7%) students had risky condition in exercise and other activities. 44.6% of them had risky condition in stress control. 78.5% of first-year and 69.2% of last year students had good condition concerning the way of safety maintenance. There was a significant difference between these two groups (p<0.00001). The condition was excellent concerning smoking habits and alcohol consumption.
Conclusion: It can be conluded that both first and last- year students did not have appropriate condition regarding the health styles and as the behaviors of health and treatment staff are considered a pattern for others, this problem requires further study and investigation.

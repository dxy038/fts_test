The main objective of this paper is a presentation of an improved probabilistic approach for estimating the additional operating reserve in modern power systems with a large share of renewable energy sources. A reliable operation of modern power systems can be ensured by application of the proposed method. Results show that the power-generation reliability in modern power systems and consequently the required additional operating reserve significantly depend on the variable and uncertain power generation of the renewable energy sources.

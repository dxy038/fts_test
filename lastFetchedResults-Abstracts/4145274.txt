The main objective of the website for the Castle and Town of Colditz is to attract visitors to the town and so contribute to the local economy. There is a virtual tour of the town and its castle, instructions how to get there, where to stay and what else there is to see in the region. If there is a general lesson applicable to most websites, it is the need to have a very clear set of objectives from the outset. The Colditz website is meeting its objectives and is proving a useful adjunct to more conventional means of marketing of the town.

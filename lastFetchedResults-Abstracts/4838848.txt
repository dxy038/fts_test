The radio architecture of the UMTS is composed of two modes: the FDD mode (WB-CDMA) and the TDD mode (TD-CDMA). Both must be included in the future mobile terminal to provide all services promised by the 3G. A work of reconfiguration will take into account the specificity of these two modes and will improve their switch. This processing simplification of these two modes can be envisaged to facilitating their implementation and cohabitation in the same terminal. For the TDD mode, the receiver called "Ts-structure" (L.Ros et al., July 2001) has been chosen for his good performance and low complexity. For the FDD mode, up to now, the conventional receiver is the Rake. Sometimes, the channel profile will oblige to add an equalizer in order to improve the Rake performance. The objective of this paper is to present a FDD equalizer with architecture similar to the equalizer TDD "Ts-structure".

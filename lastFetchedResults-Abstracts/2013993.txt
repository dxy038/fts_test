Robust control design of vehicles addresses the effect of uncertainties on the vehicleâ€™s performance. In present study, the robust optimal multi-objective controller design on a non-linear full vehicle dynamic model with 8-degrees of freedom having parameter with probabilistic uncertainty considering two simultaneous conflicting objective functions has been made to prevent the rollover. The objective functions that have been simultaneously considered in this work are, namely, mean of control effort (MCE) and variance of control effort (VCE).The nonlinear control scheme based on sliding mode has been investigated so that applied braking torques on the four wheels are adopted as actuators. It is tried to achieve optimum and robust design against uncertainties existing in reality with including probabilistic analysis through a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) approach in multi-objective optimization using the genetic algorithms. Finally, the comparison between the results of deterministic and probabilistic design has been presented. The comparison of the obtained robust results with those of deterministic approach shows the superiority robustness of probabilistic method.

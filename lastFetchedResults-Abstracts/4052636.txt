The following network computing problem is considered. Source nodes in a directed acyclic network generate independent messages and a single receiver node computes a target function <i>f</i> of the messages. The objective is to maximize the average number of times <i>f</i> can be computed per network usage, i.e., the &#8220;computing capacity&#8221;. The network coding problem for a single-receiver network is a special case of the network computing problem in which all of the source messages must be reproduced at the receiver. For network coding with a single receiver, routing is known to achieve the capacity by achieving the network min-cut upper bound. We extend the definition of min-cut to the network computing problem and show that the min-cut is still an upper bound on the maximum achievable rate and is tight for computing (using coding) any target function in multi-edge tree networks. It is also tight for computing linear target functions in any network. We also study the boundÂ´s tightness for different classes of target functions. In particular, we give a lower bound on the computing capacity in terms of the Steiner tree packing number and a different bound for symmetric functions. We also show that for certain networks and target functions, the computing capacity can be less than an arbitrarily small fraction of the min-cut bound.

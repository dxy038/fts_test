Economic load dispatch means that the generator´s real and reactive powers are allowed to vary with in certain limit so as to meet a particular load demand with minimum fuel cost. In this paper a Multi -Objective Economic Emission Load Dispatch problem is solved to minimize the emission of nitrogen oxides(NOx), oxides of other fuels that release during generation of electricity and fuel cost considering both thermal generators and Wind turbines. The effect of Wind power on overall emission is also investigated here using Quadratic programming by wolf´s method. This method have better convergence characteristic. Wolf´s method is an extended simplex procedure which can be applied to Quadratic programming problems in which all the problem variables are non negative.

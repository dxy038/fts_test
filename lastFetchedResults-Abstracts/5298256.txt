Though effective testing the signal from the cab and some mount positions in usual different speeds, the signals´ frequency components and vibration systems´ transmission characteristics were analyzed, and the their correlations were studied, the modal characteristics of cab and frame system were calculated and tested, the results that the most main excitation source is the wheel, and transmission characteristics of the spring and frame system are worse are Acquired. Some proposals reducing the excitation power by doing the dynamic balance to tires, deceasing the stiffness of springs and increasing the stiffness of frame system are carried out on the real truck, and in the usual speeds the road experiments´ effects of objective and subjective are great, the achievements are met of factory, which also proves the ideas of studying and solving the truck vibration are effective and could be valuable reference for the same engineering problems.

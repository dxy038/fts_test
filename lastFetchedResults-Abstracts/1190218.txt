A robust scheduling method is proposed to solve uncertain scheduling problems. An uncertain scheduling problem is modeled by a set of workflow models, and then a scheduling scheme (solution) of the problem can be evaluated by workflow simulations executed with the workflow models in the set. A multi-objective immune algorithm is presented to find Pareto optimal robust scheduling schemes that have good performance for each model in the set. The two optimization objectives for scheduling schemes are the indices of the optimality and robustness of the scheduling results. An antibody represents a resource allocation scheme, and the methods of antibody coding and decoding are designed to deal with resource conflicts during workflow simulations. Experimental tests show that the proposed method can generate a robust scheduling scheme that is insensitive to uncertain scheduling environments.

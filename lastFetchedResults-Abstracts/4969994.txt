The paper presents recent results obtained with FBAR and SMR BAW resonators for radiofrequency microelectronics applications within three European projects. The design and implementation of an RF front-end for WCDMA applications using an above-IC BAW band-pass filter is reported (SoC integration) from MARTINA European project. The second European project (MIMOSA) proposes a SiP integration to make an ISM-band wake-up radio receiver using a selective low-noise amplifier (LNA). The selectivity is assured by a SMR-type BAW bandpass filter. The CMOS IC chip and the BAW filter are connected together by wire-bonding or by flip-chipping. The objective of the third European project (MOBILIS) is to develop a robust and cost-effective integrated high-power RF filtering technology and demonstrate the feasibility of a mixed SoC (nanometric CMOS/system integration) and SiP (BiCMOS/power-BAW) RF power transmitter. The targeted transmitter is based on a digital radio transmitter architecture and addresses both the WCDMA and DCS standards. Finally, some solutions are proposed to address the BAW technology future challenges in terms of high frequency applications (&gt; 10 GHz), multi-standard reconfigurability, one-chip radio and combined ladder-stage with lattice stage

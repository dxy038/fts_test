The objective of this study was to investigate MRI methods for monitoring focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) of breast tumors. To this end, the mammary glands of sheep were used as tissue model. The tissue was treated in vivo with numerous single sonications which covered extended target volumes by employing a scanning technique. The ultrasound focus position was controlled by online temperature mapping based on the temperature dependence of the relaxation time T1. This approach proved to be reliable and offers thus an alternative to proton resonance frequency methods, whose application is hampered in fatty tissues. FUS-induced tissue changes were visible on T2- as well as on pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted images. According to our initial experience, noninvasive MRI-guided FUS of breast tumors is feasible.

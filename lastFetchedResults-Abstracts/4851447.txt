Combinatorial optimization problems with multiple objectives are, in general, more realistic representations of practical situations than their counterparts with a single-objective. The bi-objective minimum spanning tree problem is an NP-hard problem with applications in network design. In this paper a transgenetic algorithm is applied to this problem. A computational experiment compares the proposed approach with a memetic algorithm. The comparison of the algorithms is done with basis on three indicators and statistical tests.

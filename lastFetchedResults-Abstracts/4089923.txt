The objective of this paper is to investigate the polarizing properties of the photonic crystal fiber with two high-index cladding defects. Using an intuitive field-distribution model, we demonstrate the origin of polarizing based on the coupling effects between the core and the defects. Considerably differential confinement losses and relatively broad operation bandwidths are achieved for the two orthogonal polarizations. Moreover, the fiber allows accurate control as both the operating wavelength and the bandwidth can be tuned continuously by modifying the refractive index of defects. The effects of changing the hole-filling fraction of the fiber and the positions of defects on the polarizing properties are also discussed.

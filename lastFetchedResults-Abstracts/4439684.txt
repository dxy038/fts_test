High frequency (HF),(3-30)MHz, and Very high frequency (VHF),(30-300)MHz, radio are the backbones of communication systems from many years. They are playing a major role in country wide communication system. Unfortunately there is no direct interface between these two radio frequencies. A lot of research work had been done to create a patch between HF radio and VHF radio. The main idea in this paper is to design an automated patch system to interface between HF and VHF radios. De-noising mechanism is used for noise reduction and a noise check mechanism is also used to ensure reliable communication. The patch system would be a bidirectional communication system to provide an interface between HF and VHF frequency ranges, and will not depend on any external signal rather will take the help of an internal signal to provide the interfacing.

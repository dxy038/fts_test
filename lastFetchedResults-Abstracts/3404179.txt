It was the objective of the program described to develop and produce designs for a complete line of equipment suitable for application in the high frequency (2.0 - 30 mc) radio spectrum and utilizing single sideband (SSB) suppressed carrier emission. The units developed as a result of this program form the basic building blocks of an integrated communications system including a stable frequency generator, a single sideband generator, linear power amplifiers, and a receiver. Physically, the unit requires considerably less space than existing comparable installation. Emphasis has been placed on reliability and simplicity of installation, operation and maintenance. The unit provides continuous coverage over its frequency range with a minimum of switching. Sliding contacts have been completely eliminated in the design.

The optimum split of a cycle time for a controlled traffic intersection within an urban network is determined for four objective functions. These are total delay, total number of stops, fuel consumption, and carbon monoxide minimization. It is shown that for each objective function, an optimum value of green split that minimizes the function exists. An expression for the optimum green is derived in each case. It is further shown that these optima do not coincide. A method of determining optimum green split based on a parameter defined as a flow factor is also introduced. This method is a function of the serviceability of the intersection with respect to minimizing total delay incurred by all vehicles at the intersection during one cycle.

Water resources limitation, unsuitable distribution, special different uses increasing,
caused water use management is important. One of the main problems, is determining
of optimum crop pattern regard to crops water requirement. In this research, Linear
Programming., Nearly Optimal Linear Programming and Fuzzy Logic Linear
Programming for determining crop optimum pattern in Jahrom is used. Net income
calculated for wheat, barley, corn, sugar beet, tomato and cotton. Water efficiency
assumed 40%. Crop optimum pattern is studied in two causes: 1) water use averaging by
Farmers 2) crops water requirement. Results showed, that this causes (2), increased
return program. For Nearly Optimal Linear Programming and Fuzzy Logic Linear
Programming is flixible for determining crop pattern. In Fuzzy Logic Linear
Programming assumes is inserted in objective function and resource limites. Fuzzy
Logic Linear Programming is more flexible than Linear Programming and Nearly
Optimal Linear Programming.

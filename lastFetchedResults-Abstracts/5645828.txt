The objective of this paper was to comparatively analyze the difference of pavement temperature of bride deck and road pavement. The asphalt pavement temperature of road pavement and bride deck were tested in Guozigou area of Xinjiang, China. And the air temperature, wind speed, humidness and sunlight radiation were collected. Further, the distribution features of asphalt pavement of bridge deck and road pavement were comparatively analyzed. At last, the predictive model of pavement temperature field for bridge deck and road pavement was set up. The results show that the pavement temperature and air temperature change synchronously. The pavement temperature of bridge deck is usually 66 <sub>~</sub>13&#176;C higher than the air temperature, and keeps close to it in winter. Compared with road pavement temperature, the temperature of bridge deck is characterized by being higher lowest-temperatures in winter, greater in temperature changes and lasting for longer time when it keeps its high temperature in summer. The predictive model of pavement temperature field for bridge deck and road pavement is proposed utilized linear function with five factors, namely air temperature, wind speed, humidness, sunlight radiation and pavement depth. The developed model was proved to be more accurate and closer to the measured temperature compared with LTPP and SHRP model.

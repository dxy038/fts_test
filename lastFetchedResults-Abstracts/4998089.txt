The main objective of this paper is the implementation of context management (CM) application that was standardized by ICAO, using a system based on the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), to make available to airplanes and airports their communication applications. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used as a tool to modelling the system. This work also describes the implementation and architecture of CORBA done by Washington University, with performance tests. These tests were done in two different communications systems. The velocity of network and computers were the greatest differences between the systems. The tests showed that the systemÂ´s performance is strongly dependent on network infrastructure and computers.

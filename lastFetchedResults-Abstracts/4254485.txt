In recent years, more and more metropolitan young-old retirees (from 55 to 70) choose to live out their lives in rural areas as seasonal migrants. Seasonal migration of metropolitan retirees to rural areas nearby is helpful not only in utilizing the facilities in low season of rural leisure destinations, but also in mitigating the stress of resource shortage in taking care of the aged in metropolitan cities. The objective of this study was to identify characteristics of seasonal migration, modes of formation and development of rural retirement destinations and impacts of such migration on the rural communities. Data were collected from seasonal migrants, local residents and village officials in rural retirement destinations in Yangtze River Delta, China via questionnaires and interview. The results of this study showed that better natural environment and lower living cost at rural destinations are two important reasons for the migration; There were mainly three modes in forming the rural retirement destinations: self-organizing mode in rural villages, Lianzhong mode propelled by companies and attraction of nursing homes in rural areas. Most local residents benefit from serving the seasonal migrants. However, there are still some issues to be addressed, and suggestions as well as arena for future research are discussed at the end of this paper.

To ensure effective shop floor production, it is vital to consider the capital investment. Among most of the
operational costs, resource must be one of the critical cost components. Since each operation consumes
resources, the determination of resource level is surely a strategic decision. For the first time, the application
of Lot Streaming (LS) technique is extended to a Resource-Constrained Assembly Job Shop Scheduling
Problem (RC_AJSSP). In general, AJSSP first starts with Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) and then
appends an assembly stage for final product assembly. The primary objective of the model is the minimization
of total lateness cost of all final products. To enhance the model usefulness, two more experimental
factors are introduced as common part ratio and workload index. Hence, an innovative approach with
Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed. To examine its goodness, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is the
benchmarked method. Computational results suggest that GA can outperform PSO in terms of optimization
power and computational effort for all test problems.

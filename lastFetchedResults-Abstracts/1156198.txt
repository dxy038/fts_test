With rapid progress in ultra-short laser technology, two-photon photopolymerization (TPP) has been introduced into the domain of microfabrication. Its characters and process are described in this paper, as well as its experimental system. Through suitable experiments, it is identified that the spatial resolution of this technique can be increased as the scanning speed of focal spot and numerical aperture of objective lens rise, or as the laser power decreases. Finally, the paper presents some microstructures fabricated by this technique, such as micro-impeller, photonic crystal, micro-wells array, and so on, which illustrate its practicability in fabricating microâ€“nanostructures.

A series of acyclic deoxy carbohydrate derivatives from easily available carbohydrate enals 1, 2, 3 or 5 were prepared involving the Baylis–Hillman reaction. These newly formed carbohydrate based Baylis–Hillman adducts and their amino derivatives were evaluated for their antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Among the compounds evaluated for their antimycobacterial activity, compound (10) showed the desired activity in the range of 3.125 μg/mL.

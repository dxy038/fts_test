In this paper, we study a supply chain scheduling problem that simultaneously
considers production scheduling and product delivery.		Jobs have to be
scheduled on a single machine and delivered to  customers for further
processing in batches. The objective is to minimize the sum of the total
weighted number of tardy jobs and the delivery costs. In this paper, we present a
heuristic algorithm (HA) and a branch and bound (B&B) method for the
restricted case, where the tardy jobs are delivered separately, and compare these
procedures with an existing dynamic programming (DP) algorithm by
computational tests. The results of computational tests show significant
improvement of the B&B over the dynamic programming algorithm.

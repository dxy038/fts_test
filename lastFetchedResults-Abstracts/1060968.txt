The usage of polymers in bearings has been increasing in recent years due to certain valuable tribological properties, including their ability to self-lubricate and their resistance to corrosion. These advantages encourage manufacturers to use polymer bearings in corrosive and lubricant-free work environments as well as applications in which weight reduction is desirable. The objective of this study is to compare the performance of polymer with metal in rolling contact. This is carried out by monitoring the acoustic emission, vibration and operating speed of metal and polymer bearings during their operation.

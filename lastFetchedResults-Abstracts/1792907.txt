A general technique for integrating through parameter space in order to determine how the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the time-dependent or time-independent SchrŸêdinger equation change with parameter values is outlined, and its application to laser field amplitude, frequency, and phase (in a bichromatic field) are presented. The enhanced efficiency of this method provides 3-D plots of the objective versus pairs of laser parameters (frequency and phase, amplitude and phase) thereby permitting a visual determination of suitable field parameters which will help achieve desired populations in a multi-level system using a bichromatic field. Applications charting the field parameters for selective vibrational excitation of hydrogen fluoride are presented.

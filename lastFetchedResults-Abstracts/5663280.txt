In this paper, the shortest path planning problem with maximal visual coverage in the raster terrain is studied with the proposal of a multi-objective evolutionary planner. By using a problem-specific representation of candidate solutions and genetic operators, our planner can handle the objectives of the visual coverage and the path length and find the non-dominated solutions efficiently. Utilizing an external archive, our algorithm may effectively obtain the approximate Pareto front with wide distribution to provide multiple candidates for decision-maker.

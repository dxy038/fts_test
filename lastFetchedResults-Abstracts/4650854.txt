This paper states an idea that is to be researched. Users losing control over information, private or public are omnipresent. Private information is in the hands of governments, corporate bodies or individuals, who should not have gained access to it in the first place. Individuals as well as companies are paying for services with their privacy. Public information is generated, used, sometimes abused without a democratic system of checks and balances. Media distributes information, which is often better labeled as propaganda in the negative sense. The internet, combined with our desktop computers and mobile devices are partly to blame for such a loss of control, but they also provide the possibility to alleviate, if not dissolve such problems. The Internet itself is hardly controllable by governments or individuals. Therefore, the internet is a perfect medium to liberate information, but the pure mass of information can also reduce the usefulness for the users. This paper proposes a network tool combination that supports users in creating linked and rated information. On the retrieving end this information shall be leveraged by the users to inform themselves and remain objective, knowledgable and organised.

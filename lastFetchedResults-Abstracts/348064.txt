Objective: To report an hitherto undescribed presentation of Motor Neuropathy with Multifocal Conduction Block (MMNCB).
Methods: Description of two patients presenting with complete paralysis of the 3 heads of the trapezius muscle (case one) and progressive weakness of finger extension (case 2).
Results: Nerve conduction studies (NCS) established that the corresponding nerves were distally inexcitable. In the affected muscles, no voluntary activity was elicited in both patients with spontaneous activity noted in patient 2. Systematic NCSs documented an asymptomatic, partial conduction block (CB) in a median nerve forearm segment in both patients. Neurophysiological follow-up after a dramatic response to intravenous immunoglobulins demonstrated recovery of the initially unobtainable motor responses.
Conclusions: This indicates that a complete, distal CB of the motor fibers destined to the trapezius muscle in patient 1, and to the extensor indicis proprius in patient 2, had caused the heralding deficits.
Significance: These findings underscore the possibility of distal CB in this disorder and the need for extensive NCSs, including asymptomatic nerves, for an accurate diagnosis.

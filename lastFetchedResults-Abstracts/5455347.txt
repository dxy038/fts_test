The rapid developments in the field of biochemical sciences, immunology, molecular biology and semiconductor microfabrication technology has led to the concept of microdiagnostic kits. The diagnostic principle of nanomechanical deflection of the microcantilever due to adsorption of the antigen 85 complex on its upper surface is employed for the diagnosis of TB. The deflection of the microcantilever would be measured in terms of piezoresistive changes by implanting boron at the anchor point. Such a biomicroelectromechanical system (BioMEMS) based microdiagnostic kit is highly specific as complementary biochemical interactions take place between TB antigens and the antibodies against them immobilized on the upper surface of the microcantilever. Measurement of antigens up to picogram levels can be done using this technique. The paper discusses the various aspects of the development and production of microcantilever based microdiagnostic kit for tuberculosis.

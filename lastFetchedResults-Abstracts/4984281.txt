Financial prosperity in wafer fabrication suggests that we must consolidate assets of contiguous and mature technology wafer fabs. Many complex challenges arise in fab consolidations. With transparent results to customers being the main objective, one intricate issue is the transfer of a technology. During the 4th quarter of 1996, Motorola Bipolar-3 (BP3) experienced a significant increase in request for product, particularly MOSAIC 1 technology. The demand exceeded BP3Â´s capacity. Since Motorola Bipolar-2 (BP2) ran similar processes and had excess capacity, it was decided to qualify the MOSAIC 1 technology in BP2. Since these two manufacturing areas do not have identical equipment and processes, it was extremely difficult to transfer and match processes and technology between these two fabs. This paper depicts a systematic approach in transferring MOSAIC 1 technology from BP3 to BP2. Novel techniques were applied that can be the framework for future transfers, which include development and use of the concept of virtual flow, and thorough documentation of the transfer. In addition, this paper provides a unique solution to the problems incurred with a particular device. The outcome, ahead of schedule, was a successful qualification of the device

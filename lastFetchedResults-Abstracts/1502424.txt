The work reported here is aimed at the supply of large TiAl components having complex shapes and high dimensional precision, so as to expand the applications for TiAl alloys. The fabrication of such components requires rough forming by hot forging, followed by machining, a method which cannot be used with conventional TiAl alloys. Accordingly, a new Ti–42Al–5Mn (at.%) alloy, which featuring capabilities for hot forging and machining was developed, and in this study hot forging and machining tests were performed from an industrial perspective. As a result, it was ascertained that the objective components could be fabricated using this new alloy.

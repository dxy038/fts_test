Objectives: The present study was aimed at evaluating telomere length in blood and in different
vascular tissues with or without atheroma, in 3 groups of subjects: a group of atherosclerotic subjects who
underwent surgery (Atherosclerosis-Surgery), a second group of subjects with asymptomatic atherosclerotic
carotid plaques but who did not undergo cardiovascular surgery (Atherosclerosis-No surgery), and a third
group of subjects without atherosclerotic disease (Controls). The main objective was to determine if there is
in vivo regulation of telomere length in situ by atherosclerotic lesions. Methods: A total of 84 subjects
(mean age 69Â±8 years) were studied. Blood and arterial tissue telomere lengths were determined by
Southern blotting. Personal medical history (diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia),
family medical history, drug intake, and lifestyle were evaluated in the entire population through the use of
a questionnaire. Results and Conclusion: Arterial segments which did not develop atherosclerosis such as
the saphenous vein and internal mammary artery, had longer telomere length than aortic segments. On the
other hand, telomere length was shorter in aortic tissues which presented atherosclerotic lesions compared
to corresponding tissues without atherosclerotic lesions. These results also suggest tissue regulation of
telomere size by local factors likely related to oxidative stress responses

Any error detecting or correcting code must meet specific code distance criteria to be able to detect and correct specified numbers of errors. Prior work in the area of error detection and correction in linear digital systems using real number checksum codes has shown that at least two checksums are necessary for error correction in linear digital filters and that a fair amount of computation on the two checksums must be performed before "perfect" error compensation can be achieved. In this paper, it is shown that a single checksum can be used to perform probabilistic error correction in linear digital filters with the objective of improving filter SNR in the presence of repetitive injected errors. This approach is designed to partially correct the errors. Comparison against a system with no error correction shows up to 7 dB SNR improvement using the proposed method

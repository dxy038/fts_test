This paper presents a linear time complexity scheduling algorithm developed for military satellite broadcast systems carrying heterogenous traffic types. The objective of the algorithm is to maximise the total military value of information delivered by the system. To achieve this, each task to be scheduled is categorised as either a discrete-benefit or a contiuous-benefit. The categories describe the proportion of total data that must be delivered before an increase in value is achieved. Each discrete-benefit task is described by a time-value function which defines the value in completing that task at any instant. Continuous-benefit tasks are described by a bandwidth-value function which relates the value of that task as a function of instantaneous bandwidth assigned to it. The total military value as a function of bandwidth assigned to each task can be readily computed as the sum of discrete-benefit and continuous-benefit values. The total military value can then be maximised using dynamic programming techniques. Simulation results presented in this paper show the efficacy of the algorithm compared to other common schemes.

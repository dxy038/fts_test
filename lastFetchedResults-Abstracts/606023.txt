Objective(s): As part of a study on health perception among Iranian people, the happiness with affected factors was assessed.
Methods: This was a population-based study. A random sample of individuals aged between 18 and 65 years were entered into the study. Respondents were asked to rate a 5-point happiness scale indicating their own present happiness status. The data were analyzed descriptively. In addition logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between independent variables and happiness.
Results: In all 27,883 individuals took part in the study. The mean age of respondents was 32.7 (SD=11.8) years. Overall 39.3% rated their happiness as 'neither much/nor low', 35.4% as 'low/very low" and 3% as "very much". The findings showed that in addition to some demographic variables such as employment and income, the self-rated health was the most significant contributing factor to happiness [OR=7.82, 95% CI=5.32-11.48, P < 0.0001].
Conclusion: The findings suggest that improving daily living conditions might help to improve happiness among the Iranian population.

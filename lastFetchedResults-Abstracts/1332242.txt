The objective of this paper is to study the vibration characteristic for a sandwich beam with silica/polymer blend as principal material, and pure polymer matrix as surface laminate. It is anticipated that high stiffness and structure damping of viscoelastic layer can be obtained by taking advantage of fascinating network of densely packed between silica and polymer matrix. Spherical particles of size 12–235 nm at various filler fraction (10–50 wt.%) and three different polymer matrices, polyacrylate, polyimide and polypropylene, were selected as the matrix materials. The mechanical damping and stiffness of the sandwich cantilever beam are recorded by using a Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analyzer (DMTA). The silica’s small particle size feature and strain difference between principal and surface layers could highly enhance the energy dissipation ability of the beam structure. A numerical model is then developed and validated for the vibration of a symmetric elastic–viscoelastic sandwich beam. Experimental results show that the structure deformation for these sandwich beams with contiguous and constraining layers are in reasonable agreement with the prediction of the model. Both higher resonant vibrations are well damped in accordance with the symmetric motion of the elastic layers and relative little motion of the constraining layer.

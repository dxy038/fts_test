Now days the Distribution Network Organizations (DNOÂ´s) have set some rules to maintain the voltage at a specified level to control the increase of voltage variations and controls the power factor. The main objective of this paper is that in cases of weak networks the voltage level is maintained by the distributed generation (DG) by importing or exporting active and reactive power. To control the voltage/power factor, a distributed generation (DG) is connected to the distribution system (taking 2-bus system) and - the study is performed with the constant loading condition with (i) Automatic Voltage Control (ii) Automatic Power factor Control (iii) Automatic voltage and power factor control and (iv) Fuzzy Logic based Power Factor Control using Matlab/simulink.

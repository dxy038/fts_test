The DARPA Combat Hybrid Power Systems (CHPS) program was established to investigate hybrid electric power systems that might provide all the energy and power needs of improved future combat vehicles-specifically the transient, continuous and pulsed power necessary to drive advanced weapons systems, mobility systems, communications systems and protective systems. By exploiting the benefits of hybrid power, power management and power sharing, it may become possible to design future combat vehicles with advanced weapons and protection systems, while reducing logistical requirements (by increasing efficiency) and reducing overall weight and volume. This paper describes the CHPS program goals and accomplishments as well as provides insight on how the CHPS approach to design of future vehicles is an essential step toward demonstrating lightweight, future ground combat vehicles capable of improved mobility, lethality, survivability and susceptibility. As the United States Army begins its transition between interim and objective forces, the latter of which will consist of the emerging Future Combat Systems (FCS) program, CHPS tools and technology allow for a true understanding and incorporation of hybrid power technology.

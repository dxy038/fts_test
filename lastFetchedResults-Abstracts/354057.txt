Objective. –  The feasibility of gene transfer to myocardial tissue using viral vectors was investigated over the last few years. In this study we report gene transfer using a recently described improved of Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1)-derived amplicon vectors and demonstrate that these vectors are a powerful and potentially very interesting tool for gene transfer into neonatal primary as well as in adult cardiac myocytes.

Methods and results. – Non-pathogenic HSV-1 amplicon vectors simultaneously expressing GFP and LacZ were constructed using a novel helper system that yields essentially helper-free vector particles. These vectors were used to infect either cultured primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes or adult cardiac tissue. Transgenic expression was quantified using a FACS (GFP) or X-gal staining (LacZ). Infection of primary cardiomyocytes showed efficient transduction even at very low multiplicity of infection (MOI), and expression increased with the infectious dose. By investigating release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or spontaneous beating of the cells, we failed to detect cytotoxic effects in cardiomyocytes infected at high MOI. Thin slices of adult cardiac tissue placed in medium containing vectors also showed very good levels of transduction, without any evidence of toxic effects.

Conclusions. – Helper-free amplicon vectors very efficiently transduce genes into cardiomyocytes. Our results indicate similar or better transduction efficiencies than those reported using other vector systems. Furthermore, the very high transgenic capacity of amplicon vectors (up to 150 kbp) makes these vectors a unique and very suitable system to transduce large genomic sequences into cardiomyocytes.

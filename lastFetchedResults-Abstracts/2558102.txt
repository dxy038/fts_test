Background: Health care workers (HCW) are at high risk of contracting various infectious
diseases and play a dual role in the transmission of infections in health care facilities.
Objective: To determine the seroprotection against hepatitis B, measles, rubella, and varicella
among HCWs in a community hospital in Qatar.
Methods: This is a cross-sectional survey conducted in a 75-bed community hospital in
Dukhan, Qatar. From August 2012 to December 2015, 705 HCWs were tested for the presence
of IgG antibodies for measles, rubella, and varicella, and also for hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg). They were also asked about previous history of hepatitis B vaccination.
Results: 595 (84.4%) HCWs received a full hepatitis B vaccination schedule; 110 (15.6%)
received a single dose. The full schedule was reported with higher frequency by nurses
(90.2%) compared to physicians (74.1%) or technicians (79.7%). Those aged â‰¥30 years
(90.4%) and <20 years of work experience had received a full vaccination schedule more
frequently than younger and less experienced HCWs. Female HCWs (87.8%) received full
schedule more frequently than males (78.8%). 73.4% of the staff had seroprotection against
heaptitis B, with the lowest anti-HBsAg titers observed in physicians (58.8%) compared with
other categories; males (64.9%) were less protected than females. The seropositivity was
85.6%(95% CI 82.4% to 88.4%) for measles, 94.7% (95% CI 92.2% to 97.3%) for rubella,
and 92.2% (95% CI 89.7% to 94.7%) for varicella.
Conclusion: HCWs, particularly physicians, are not enough protected against hepatitis B.
The seroprotection against measles, rubella, and varicella.

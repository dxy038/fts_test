This paper proposes a methodology that can be used to design plans for evacuating transit-dependent citizens
during no-notice disasters. A mixed-integer linear program is proposed to model the problem of
finding optimal evacuation routes. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total evacuation time
and the number of casualties, simultaneously. A traffic simulation package is used to explicitly incorporate
the traffic flow dynamics into our model in order to generate solutions which are consistent with the
dynamics of traffic network. Due to the long running time of CPLEX, a Tabu search algorithm is designed
that finds evacuation routes for transit vehicles. Computational experiments demonstrate that the solutions
found are of high-quality. Numerical experiments are conducted using the transportation network
of the city of Forth Worth, TX to illustrate the modeling procedure and solution approach.

In this work, we develop a discrete control scheme based on an approximate feedback linearization method and the reversing trajectory method. This allows estimating and enlarging the asymptotic region of stability around the operating points. The main objective of the very work is to implement the methodology of feedback linearization techniques for controlling nonlinear discrete time systems. The presented approach is applied to a control problem in a CSTR. The simulation results, demonstrate the increasing effectiveness and the interesting local performance of the proposed approach.

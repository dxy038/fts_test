The global energy consumption is expected to grow in a faster rate than the population growth. By 2030, an increase of 53% of global energy consumption and 39% of greenhouse gases emissions from fossil fuels is anticipated. Therefore, it becomes a global agenda to develop clean alternative fuels which are domestically available, environmentally acceptable and technically feasible. As an alternative fuel, biodiesel seems as one of the best choices among other sources due to its environment friendly behavior and similar functional properties with diesel. The main objective of this paper is to discuss the impact biodiesel from different edible, non-edible and waste cooking oils feedstocks on combustion characteristics, engine durability and materials compatibility with biodiesel. Moreover, this paper reviews some other important related aspects to biodiesel such as biodiesel development, biodiesel feedstocks, biodiesel standards and advantages and challenges of biodiesel.

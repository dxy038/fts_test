In this paper we consider the circuit assignment algorithm for dynamic traffic in unidirectional WDM/SONET ring networks. Our objective is to minimize the cost of electronic add/drop multiplexers (ADMs) in the network, while being able to support any offered traffic matrix in a rearrangeably non-blocking manner. The only restriction on the offered traffic is a constraint on the number of circuits a node may source at any given time. We provide a lower bound on the number of ADMs required and give conditions that a network must satisfy in order for it to support the desired set of traffic patterns. Circuit assignment and ADM placement algorithms that perform closely to this lower bound are provided. These algorithms are shown to reduce the electronic costs of a network by over 30%. Finally, we discuss extensions of this work for supporting dynamic traffic in a wide-sense or strict sense non-blocking manner as well as the benefits of using a hub node and tunable transceivers

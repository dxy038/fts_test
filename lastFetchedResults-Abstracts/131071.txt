Introduction & Objective: In order to decrease the worries and anxieties in the patients undergoing general anesthesia before and after the surgery, the specialists in this field use benzodia zepins drugs specially diazepam. This was because these drugs have relaxation and forgetfulness effects.
Materials & Methods: This study is a clinical trial done in a randomized double-blind form. In order to determine the effects of diazepam on memory power, the Wechsler test was applied on 40 patients (37 male, 3 female) referring to the Amir-AL-Momenin (NAHAJA) hospital in Bushehr city during the year 1382.
Results:The results showed that there was no difference between the average total marks in case and control groups before and after using anesthesia. This means the drug diazepam had no effect on memory power as a whole. There was significant difference between pre and post -anesthesia scores in recall, number repetition and logic memories in case group, but there was a significant difference only for recall memory in control group(p<0/05).
Conclusion:ln this investigation it was found out that the drug diazepam has no effect on memory function and the anesthesia especially forgetfulness which has been mentioned in the medical test may not be so correct and needs more investigation.

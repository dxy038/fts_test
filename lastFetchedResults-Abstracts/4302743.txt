The paper presents a new approach to elimination of broadband noise and impulsive disturbances from archive audio recordings. The proposed adaptive Kalman-like algorithm, based on a sparse autoregressive model of the audio signal, simultaneously detects noise pulses, interpolates the irrevocably distorted samples and performs signal smoothing. It is shown that bidirectional (forward-backward) processing of the archive signal improves smoothing efficiency and allows one to localize noise pulses more accurately, leading to noticeable performance improvements compared to unidirectional processing.

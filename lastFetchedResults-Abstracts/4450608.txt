GATE (Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission) is a Monte Carlo simulation platform for nuclear medicine imaging, based on the Geant4 toolkit package. This tool was used to construct a full and realistic simulator for the ECAT EXACT HR+ scanner, with the objective of optimising data acquisition protocols, image quantification and reconstruction techniques. In this study, we will compare the performances of the simulator against experimental data obtained with the HR+ scanner in order to validate its use for PET imaging systems simulations. Simulated and measured data were found to be in good agreement. An example of a coupling PET and MRI system is also simulated with GATE and we give some results about the image resolution for this multimodality device.

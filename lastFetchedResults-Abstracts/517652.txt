Objective

Febrile convulsion (FC) is a common cause of seizure in young children, withA an excellent prognosis. In addition to genetic predisposition and infections,FCs are generally thought to be induced by metabolic and elemental changesA during fever such as Zinc (Zn) deficiency. Regarding the high prevalence ofA febrile convulsions and the role of Zn deficiency, we investigated the role of ZnA in FC patients in Isfahan, Iran. A 

Materials and Methods

In a controlled cross sectional study, 90 patients aged 9 months to 5 yearsA were studied in a period of 12 months. They were assigned to three groups. Thirty patients were included in the Febrile Seizure group, thirty febrile childrenA without convulsion or previous history of convulsion were included in theA febrile group and thirty afebrile healthy ones were enrolled as controls. Venous blood was obtained and Zn concentration in serum was measured usingA Graphite Furnance Atomic Absorbance Spectrophotometering (GF-AAS). 

Results A 

Patients and the control groups had no difference in either mean age or sexA distribution. No significant relationship was observed between serum Zn levelA and age or sex among patients in the FC group and two other control groups.A A 

Conclusion

Our findings showed that Zinc level was significantly lower in the febrile seizureA group compared to two other groups. We tried to categorize various conditionsA in a more practical form. Also, Zinc is in close relationship with socioeconomicA level of the individuals which was well considered in the current survey.

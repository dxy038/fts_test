A design method for a hierarchical control structure is introduced. The structure involves two different levels of control, namely, a coordination level and an execution level. At the coordination level a fuzzy controller is used to identify the status of the system under control and to activate appropriate local control modules, located at the execution level. The design of the fuzzy system is based on the control requirements and on the response of the local control elements. Simulation results show that the controller can satisfy the control objective

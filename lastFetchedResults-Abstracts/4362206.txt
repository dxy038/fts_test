Simulation models can be time-consuming to build and often multiple models are built to simulate similar systems that have small differences. While developing a model to evaluate the impact of maintenance functions on the day-to-day operations of an Air Force Wing, thought was given to how the same concepts could be applied to other military and commercial maintenance operations. This simulation was designed specifically to support a model of Air Force Wing operations and the maintenance functions associated with them. The secondary objective was to ensure the simulation could evolve into a generic model with applications across the military and in the commercial world. This paper discusses considerations and challenges in designing and moving to a generic model. The current version of the model from the user´s and modeler´s view is also presented

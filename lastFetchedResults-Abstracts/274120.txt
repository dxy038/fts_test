The classical generalized self-consistent model (GSCM) is recognized to be suitable and efficient for estimating the effective
moduli of an isotropic composite consisting of an isotropic host matrix and an isotropic inclusion phase. The present
work aims to enlarge the scope of the GSCM so that it becomes applicable to a good number of important situations where
the phases cannot be differentiated as the host matrix and inclusions. This objective is achieved first by inserting into the
unknown effective medium a coated composite sphere whose core is made of the unknown effective medium and whose
coatings are formed of the constituent phases and then by imposing an energy equivalency condition. The equations thus
obtained to characterize the effective bulk and shear moduli involve a microstructural parameter which turns out to be
capable of describing in some sense how far a microstructure is from the host matrix/inclusion morphology. The

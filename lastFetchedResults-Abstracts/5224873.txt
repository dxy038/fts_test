Clothing comfort is a state of satisfaction indicating physiological, psychological and physical balance among the person. Though objective experiments are easy to measure, subjective experiment is rated an end-use performance test to collect the comfort sensation of wears. In this paper, objective and subjective experiment have been done with 20 knitted fabric samples. Objective experiments includes thermal insulation, touch feeling of warm or cool Q-max, air permeability, water-vapor permeability, wicking, moisture regain rate, evaporation rate experiment. Subjective experiment with four processes is taken and questionnaire is designed to test comfort sensation of knitwear fabric. Based on experimental data, a multiple regression model for predicting comfort sensations of knitted fabric in sports condition with objective properties is established.

Perhaps, the main common aspect in three
fundamental perspectives, namely that of art
work, artist and audience, is their united
convergence in expressing this general
axiom: “The Art is Expression”. This
essential “Expressive” dignity in many ages
and in various cultures can be diverted to
“Expressionism”. For example, Opera Music
was the conscious representation of reality,
or Romantic Music in the 19th century, was
generally a transparent explanation of composer’s
emotions. According to many thinkers,
Expressionism in music occurs when
the music is entitled with optional name or
accompanied with poems or images. This
abstracted meaning of Expression (Expressionism)
is related with General meaning of
Expression.
This Paper, will first present the
ontological study of “Expression” and
“Expressionism” foundation in music based
on descriptive approach. Then, the mentioned
descriptive variables are being described in
visual Arts. For earning a more exact study,
two new terms of “Subjective Expression”
and “Objective Expression” are generated by
the author and possible interaction between
these two terms in fine arts is being argued.
Moreover, the subject of transition of
expression will be described in music and the
author will offer new survey about
“Satisfying Parity” in musical cognitions.
Consequently, it is concluded that the
music is more talented than other arts in
transforming and devolving the “objective
expression” and “subjective expression” to
each other.
This might be concluded that, due to
volatile- synchronic essence of music, it is
different from other visual art.

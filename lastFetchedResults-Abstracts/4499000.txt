In this paper new methods for error concealment of shape information are proposed for compressed MPEG-4 bit-streams transmitted over error prone channels. For the spatial domain, the proposed approach employs Bezier curve fitting to approximate and outline the VOP. For the temporal domain, the proposed approach uses the weighted side matching criterion to reconstruct the VOP. Better subjective and objective qualities than previous works is obtained.

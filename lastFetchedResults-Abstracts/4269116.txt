Insight from the oldest inventory model, economic order quantity (EOQ), reveals that efficiency-service tradeoff should be recast into a multi-objective context. In this paper, a nonredundant triobjective inventory control model and corresponding solution approach based on Lagrange method are presented to obtain nondominated control policies achieving tradeoffs among objectives. Evolutionary computation, NSGA-II, is also used to build the optimal tradeoff surface under stochastic demand. Results show that NSGA-II is highly competitive with the lengthy successive approximation in terms of accuracy and diversity. It can provide more tradeoff options to the decision makers.

This paper proposes the use of service symmetry and network duplex mode, in addition to existing radio access technology (RAT) selection criteria, in making RAT selection decisions in heterogeneous wireless networks (HWNs). It then evaluates the effect of using the two criteria on call blocking/dropping probability in HWNs. The main objective of the proposed algorithm is to reduce new call blocking probability and handoff call dropping probability in HWNs. An analytical model is developed for the RAT selection algorithm, and its performance is evaluated in terms of new call blocking probability and handoff call dropping probability. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated for three different scenarios, in order to study the effect of RAT flexibility, with regard to uplink and downlink resources allocation in HWNs. Simulation results for the three scenarios are compared. Results show that RAT flexibility affects call blocking/dropping probability in HWNs.

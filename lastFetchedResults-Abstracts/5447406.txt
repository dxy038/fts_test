This paper proposes a coding tree unit (CTU) level rate control for HEVC based on the Laplace distribution modeling of the transformed residuals. Firstly, we give a study on the relationship model among the optimal quantization step, the Laplace parameter and the Lagrange multiplier. Based on the relationship model, the quantization parameter for each CTU can be dynamically adjusted according to the distribution of the transformed residual. Secondly, a CTU level rate control scheme is proposed to achieve accurate rate control as well as high coding performance. Experimental results show that the proposed rate control scheme achieves better coding performance than the state-of-the-art rate control schemes for HEVC in terms of both objective and subjective quality.

In this paper, the numerical analysis of a multistage formulation of the distribution expansion problem developed is presented. The approximate objective function is employed without sacrificing optimality. A complete nonlinear mathematical programming optimization is employed to identify the global optimum. The algorithm is applied here to two practical test cases. Details of the input data and configuration of test systems as well as the solutions are listed and discussed. Computational considerations are addressed.

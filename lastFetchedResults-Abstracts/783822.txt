Objective To test the hypothesis that the socio-cultural
transition in the 1990s in Eastern Europe was associated
with an increase in admissions for eating disorders (ED).
Method Cases of ICD-9 and ICD-10 ED in 1981, 1986
and 1992–2005 and first admissions for ICD-10 anorexia
nervosa (AN) in 1994–2005 were retrieved from the Czech
national register of hospital admissions. Age- and sexadjusted
admission rates (per 100,000) were calculated and
time trends tested by Poisson regression.
Results The admission rate for ED in females aged 10–39
quadrupled from 2.6 (95% CI 2.1–3.0) in 1981 to 10.6 (95%
CI 9.8–11.5) in 2001, and remained elevated till 2005. The
rate of first-time admissions for AN in 10- to 39-old females
increased from 4.5 (95% CI 3.6–5.4) in 1994 to 7.5 (95% CI
6.3–8.6) in 1999, followed by a non-significant decrease.
Conclusion Temporal association of an increase in
admissions with socio-cultural transition suggests that risk
of severe ED including AN is culture-dependent

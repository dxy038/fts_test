The objective of this study was to determine the effects of selenium (Se) supplementation of mature ewes in the period from
day 214 to day 90 post mating on Se status, productivity and viability of ewes and their offspring. Multiparous crossbred ewes
(n582) were randomly assigned to receive a standard dried grass-based diet (control) or dried grass diet supplemented with 1 g
of selenised yeast (SelplexR ), providing 0.5 mg Se per ewe per day. After day 90 post mating, all ewes were offered grassbased
diets supplemented with a standard multivitamin and mineral mix, up to lambing. Ewes that were fed additional Se had
increased (P,0.001) activity of glutathione peroxidase enzyme (GPx) and increased plasma Se concentrations throughout the
treatment period. At lambing, GPx activity of supplemented ewes was higher (P,0.001) than that of controls. Twenty-four
hours after birth, lambs of ewes given Se had higher (P,0.001) concentration of Se in plasma, greater (P,0.001) activity of
GPx and better (P,0.01) immune status. Lambs of ewes that received supplementation showed a faster progression to stand
than control lambs (P,0.05), independent of maternal behaviour which was not affected. Supplementation reduced perinatal
lamb mortality (0.04 v. 0.17; P,0.05). However, overall mortality from birth to weaning was unaffected (P.0.05).
Supplemented ewes weaned lambs on average 2 kg heavier than control ewes, due to the higher (P,0.05) growth rates
achieved by their offspring. In conclusion, for ewes with a marginal Se status, an organic source of Se supplemented throughout
pregnancy, compared with supplementation only in the last trimester, positively affected measures of lamb viability and survival

Introduction: Old age is associated with falling risk. Falling is important since it affects more than 60% of the elderly population, causing health, psychosocial and economical problems. The objective of this study was to find links between falling risk and some biomechanical parameters such as balance performance, functional mobility and quality of Gait. Methods: Fifty-nine women and Eighteen men of between 60 to 80 years old from a local pension in Isfahan of iran were collected. Using Romberg’s test in opened eyes conditions and Up-and-Go test, their balance performance and functional mobility were evaluated respectively. Using Berg questionnaire and Tineti gait score, the falling risk and the quality of gait were evaluated respectively. Data are presented as mean and standard deviation (±SD). The independent t-test was used to compare the variables of the two groups. Pearson correlation for any possible correlations between variables was used. Results: Falling risk is related to balance performance deficit. Increase on the balance ability was associated with decrease on the body sway during gait. Functional mobility and postural control were higher in men than the women (p=0.02 and p=0.001 respectively).  However, falling risk was similar in both groups (p=0.1). Conclusion: although there is not significant different on risk of fall between men and women, both groups are in higher risk of fall. Body sway was greater in women. Balance and functional mobility were better in men. Other parameters should be examined for falling risk.

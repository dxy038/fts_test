Abstract This paper considers the problem of monitoring the mean of a normally distributed process variable
when the objective is to effectively detect both small and large shifts in the process mean. A generalized likelihood
ratio (GLR) control chart with a variable sampling size and sampling interval (VSSI) scheme is proposed to quickly
detect a wide range of shift sizes. The performance of the VSSI GLR chart is evaluated and the results shows that
the VSSI feature can greatly reduce the expected detection time. Design methodology for the VSSI GLR chart is
provided so that practitioners can easily use this chart in applications. An illustrative example is given to explain
how to apply the VSSI GLR chart.

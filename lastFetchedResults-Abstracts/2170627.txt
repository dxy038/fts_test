The objective of this study was to determine the effect of aerosolized sanitizers on the inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes biofilms. Biofilms were formed on a stainless steel and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) coupon by using a mixture of three strains each of three foodborne pathogens. Six day old biofilms on stainless steel and PVC coupons were treated with aerosolized sodium hypochlorite (SHC; 100 ppm) and peracetic acid (100, 200, and 400 ppm) in a model cabinet for 5, 10, 30, and 50 min. Treatment with 100 ppm PAA was more effective than the same concentration of SHC with increasing treatment time. Exposure to 100 ppm SHC and PAA for 50 min significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced biofilm cells of three foodborne pathogens (0.50 to 3.63 log CFU/coupon and 2.83 to more than 5.78 log CFU/coupon, respectively) compared to the control treatment. Exposure to 200 and 400 ppm PAA was more effective in reducing biofilm cells. Biofilm cells were reduced to below the detection limit (1.48 log CFU/coupon) between 10 and 30 min of exposure. The results of this study suggest that aerosolized sanitizers have a potential as a biofilm control method in the food industry.

Objective. To provide an overview of curriculum issues in changing from amalgam to tooth-coloured materials.

Key points. Changing from amalgam to tooth-coloured materials in teaching the restoration of posterior teeth may be found to have a considerable enriching effect on the dental curriculum. Subject to meeting a number of prerequisites, the change from amalgam to tooth-coloured materials may cause relatively little curriculum disruption, with the added bonus of a consequential shift from reparative to preservative, minimal invasive dentistry.

Conclusion. Changing from amalgam to tooth-coloured materials may enrich the typical dental curriculum.

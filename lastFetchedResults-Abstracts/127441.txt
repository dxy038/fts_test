BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Thiopental sodium is not an ideal intravenous drug for inducing general anesthesia and compared to intravenous anesthetic drugs like propofol has a long standing recovery time. The aim of this study was to compare the recovery duration of propofol and thiopental sodium in ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy). METHODS: In a clinical trial, 70 patients aged between 15-40 years old in A.S.A class 1 & II were selected for ECT. They were randomly divided into two groups of 35 patients. After patient monitoring, 2-3 mg/kg thiopental sodium or 1-1.5 mg/kg propofol (randomly in each patient) and then 0.5 mg/kg succinylcholine were administered. Patients were ventilated with mask and oxygen (%l 00). After ECT, seizure and recovery durations were recorded. During these procedures, blood pressure and heart rate were recorded before and after anesthetic induction and 1 and 5 min after ECT.
FINDINGS: Mean recovery duration of propofol and thiopental sodium were 5.49+2.57 min and 6.4+3.69 min, respectively (p=0.233). Also, seizure duration of propofol and thiopental sodium were 32.06+13.78 sec and 35.06+10.08 sec (P=0.302). Hemodynamic changes (systolic blood pressure) in two groups were not significant except at 1 minute after seizure (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: According to the results, there was not a significant difference between two groups in seizure and recovery duration. But propofol can prevent increasing hemodynamic response to ECT better than thiopental sodium. In patients with hypertension or restriction of thiopental sodium, propofol can be a suitable replacement.

In this paper, design and performance analysis of Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm in tuning Linear Auto Disturbance Rejection Controller (LADRC) for Load Frequency Control (LFC) of multi-area power systems is investigated. The LADRC does not need a detailed mathematical model of controlled plant and the performance of controller is related to two tuning parameters. The design problem is formulated as an optimization problem and DE is employed to search for optimal controller parameters by minimizing the time domain objective function. A method to analyze the stability of a multi-area power system under a decentralized LFC is p resented accounting the inherent structure of the multi-area power system. Decentralized LFC tuning on a three-area power system shows that the proposed method is easy to apply for multi-area power systems and good damping performance can be achieved.

This paper presents a fuzzy-logic approach to the energy management of an embedded fuel cell system. The main objective is to study one of the most technological bolts to be overcome for embedded fuel cell systems: their energy optimization. To reach this aim, experimentally validated models of a low power 5 kW proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and its most power hungry ancillary (the FC air supply system) are described. All simulation results have been performed using Matlab/Simulink&#174; environment. Two fuzzy controllers are proposed for both the internal air supply control loop and also for the whole embedded energy management strategy.

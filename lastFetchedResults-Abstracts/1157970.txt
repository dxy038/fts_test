The objective of this research was to study the effect of sanding on surface roughness of rubberwood. Surface roughness was measured using stylus profilometer. Sessile water drop technique was used to determine contact angle of the surface. The results indicated that sanding process could improved surface roughness. Lower grit size gave rougher surface. The radial surface of rubberwood was found to be rougher compared to tangential surface. The roughness value across the grain was higher compared to the longitudinal section. The contact angle on the tangential surface was higher compared to the radial surface and this indicated that the radial surface was rougher than the tangential surface.

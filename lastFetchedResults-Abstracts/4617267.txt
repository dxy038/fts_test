Aiming at the iterations consuming problem of the fuzzy c-mean clustering segmentation algorithm(FCMCS), a new method of fuzzy clustering segmentation algorithm of the infrared images is proposed. The FCM determines the threshold values of the type of clustering through the iterative optimization of the objective function. The modified algorithm based on the fuzzy entropy constraint gives the derivation process, the new clustering center and membership are also obtained. The results show that the modified algorithm is effective, it has fewer iterations and guarantee the real-time.

The concentrations of several selected organic hazardous substances were investigated in domestic graywater. In total, 41 of 81 organic hazardous substances were found in concentrations above the detection limits (nonylphenol and octylphenol ethoxylates, brominated flame-retardants, organotin compounds, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, phthalates, linear-alkyl benzene sulfonate, and triclosan). Moreover, total solids, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD7), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen, total phosphorus, potassium, and sulphur were investigated and presented for graywater. Another objective was to suggest potential household sources for a selected number of organic hazardous substances. The present and past investigations reveal households to be obvious contributors of organic hazardous substances to municipal wastewater, and that graywater is an important media in this transport. The spreading derives from diffuse household sources like everyday activities (laundry, cleaning, etc.), the wearing down of things such as pipe material and interior fittings, and from airborne deposition.

Character Recognition is a process of understanding a human readable text document by machines. Today many researchers in the academia and industry are interested in this direction. This paper describes a novel method of Character Recognition. The main objective of this is to use the Radon Transform and Principal Component Analysis to obtain a set of invariant features, on basis of which a character will be recognized. The results found from the various experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.

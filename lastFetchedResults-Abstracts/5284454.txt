The main objective of this paper is to provide insights into the role of sensor technology in general, as well as into the value of Sensor Information Systems in particular, within the context of the data centers infrastructure management. The paper explores the current practices of sensor applications and Sensor Information Systems in the context of data centers. This has been done with the objective to identify the actual value recognized from using Sensor Information Systems within the current IT infrastructure management practice, which is an unexplored phenomenon. This leads to the introduction of the Data Center Sensor Information Systems (DCSIS) approach. Using content analysis of data gathered from five case studies, the study evaluates the practical value that DCSIS can add to the organizations as well as to data centers infrastructure management practice. The paper concludes by showing how DCSIS can bring operational, economic, environmental, business management and strategic value. This leads to elaboration on the contributions that DCSIS can make towards the management of organizationsÂ´ IT infrastructure.

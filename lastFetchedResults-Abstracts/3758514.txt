How space technologies and new integrated telecommunication networks can mitigate the impact of natural and man-made disasters. The objective is to design new, potentially attractive telecommunication architectures to better manage a disaster scenario. The strengths and the weaknesses of the proposed space-based telecommunication architectures for the emergency and recovery will be outlined also, to individuate the needs for an optimal provision of information and accessibility of space-related services in case of disaster.

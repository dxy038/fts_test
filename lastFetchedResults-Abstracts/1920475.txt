Long-term survival in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors is complicated by an increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) due to radiation-induced endothelial damage. Our objective was to quantify total coronary artery calcium (CAC) in long-term HL survivors who had survived ≥15 years after treatment and relate it to the presence of verified CAD. Forty-seven HL survivors 50 ± 7 years of age who had survived 22 ± 3 years after mediastinal radiotherapy underwent CAC scoring (Agatston and volume scores) in a multidetector computed tomographic scanner. Total volume score was higher in 7 patients (15%) with verified CAD (median 439, range 8 to 2,057) compared to those without (median 68, 0 to 767, p = 0.022). Ten patients had CAC scores &gt;200. Of these 10, 5 had undergone revascularization of coronary arteries. None of the 8 patients with a CAC score 0 had symptomatic CAD. In conclusion, postirradiation CAC can be quantified by CAC score and this may be a simple and suitable method to screen for CAD in long-term HL survivors. Patients with a CAC score &gt;200 often have clinically significant CAD, and further investigation including angiography may be justified. Lower CAC scores, however, do not exclude CAD and further studies should be undertaken to define the best algorithm for follow-up of this patient group.

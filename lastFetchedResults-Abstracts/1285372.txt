Our work on antitubercular agents led to the identification of BM 212 as a lead compound among a series of pyrrole derivatives with good in vitro activity against mycobacteria and candidae. Further studies led us to synthesize additional pyrroles bearing the thiomorpholinomethyl moiety and different aryl substituents at N1 and C5. Some of them revealed very active, prompting us to design the new pyrrole derivatives 5â€“20 in the hope of increasing the activity and better understanding the influence of ortho halogens on the antimycobacterial activity. Microbiological data showed interesting in vitro activity toward Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria.

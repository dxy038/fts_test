Cataloging is at its most interesting when it is comprehended
as part of a larger, meaningful, objective. Resource description is
a complex task; but the essence of librarianship is curatorship of a collection,
and that sense of curatorial responsibility is one of the things that
makes resource description into cataloging–that is, professional responsibility
is the difference between the task of transcription and the satisfaction
of professional decisions well-made. Part of the essential
difference is comprehension of the cultural milieu from which specific
resources arise, and the modes of scholarship that might be used to
nudge them to reveal their secrets for the advancement of knowledge. In
this paper I describe a course designed to lend excitement and professional
judgment to the education of future catalogers and collection
managers by conveying the notion that all documents are, in fact, cultural
artifacts. Part of a knowledge-sensitive curriculum for knowledge
organization, the purpose of this course is to go beyond the concept of
documents as mere packets of information to demonstrate that each is a
product of its time and circumstances. Bibliographic skill leads to
greater comfort with the intellectual and cultural forces that impel the
creation of documents. Students become comfortable with the curatorial
side of cataloging–the placement of each document in its cultural milieu
as the goal of resource description, rather than the act of description itself

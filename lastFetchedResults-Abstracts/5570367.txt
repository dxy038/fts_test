The evolution of telecommunications is characterized by an increase of availability of bandwidth and the user mobility. It takes to a revolution in offers of the service quality. The notion of quality of service (QoS) becomes then an important concept if one wants to transport information with a maximum of reliability. The most important metrics of QoS are the rate, the delay (as well as the jig) and the rate of losses. In this paper, a routing protocol that integrates this concept of QoS is conceived and is given back efficient in NS-2 to study its performances. The initial objective of our work was to conceive a reliable protocol that distributes packets sent by one or several senders to several recipients with an elevated percentage of success. Qos-AODV is conceived in order to extricate profit of that is made in the AODVprotocol. It uses the different tables of neighbors, of topology and for routing, in order to minimize the delay and the traffic of control. The results show that QoS is essential for multicast routing in ad hoc networks.

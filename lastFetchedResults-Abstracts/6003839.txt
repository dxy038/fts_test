In the kernel methods, it is very important to choose a proper kernel function to avoid overlapping data. Based this fact, in this paper we mainly utilize a unified kernel optimization framework on the hyperspectral image classification to augment the margin between different classes, and under the kernel optimization framework, to employ the Fisher discriminant criteria formulated in a pairwise manner as the objective functions to optimize the kernel function in Kernel-based nonparametric weighted feature extraction. The experimental results display the superiority of the optimizing kernel function over the RBF kernel function with 5-fold cross-validation method, especially, in the small sample size problem.

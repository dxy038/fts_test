Da'I al-Islam, an Iranist who has developed Persian in the Subcontinent, has left a number of works on literary and linguistic issues. In 1968, he delivered a speech at Heydarabad University dealing with the choice of Latin script for Persian. His objective was to show whether this common interest to write Persian in the Latin script was based on scientific grounds or simply a poor imitation of the European model. In this lecture, he first describes the letters of Persian and Latin scripts and then concludes that both languages have shortcomings, which make them unable to fully reflect the sounds of Persian. He argues that no script is appropriate for writing Persian and that there is no alternative to the Arabic script. Finally, he shows the advantages of the Arabic script, as used in the art of calligraphy, but also states that the Pahlavi Script should have been amended and not changed with the Arabic script.

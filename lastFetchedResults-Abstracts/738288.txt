Objective
To describe the patterns and predictors of weight change among U.S. adults aged 70 and over.
Method

The study is a retrospective cohort study of 7441 community-dwelling U.S. adults aged 70 years and over during 1993â€“2002. We examined changes in weight for men and women, and by race/ethnicity groups. We used multivariate linear regression analysis to determine predictors of weight change while controlling for key covariates at baseline.
Results

The mean body weight decreased in both genders and all ethnic groups. Unadjusted average weight loss was 3.41 kg for men and 3.29 kg for women over nine years. Black women had higher mean body weight at baseline and were more likely to report weight gains of 5 kg or more. Multivariate analysis showed that age and baseline weight were major predictors of weight loss. Physical activity was associated with less weight loss among men.
Conclusion

The trends of weight change among U.S. adults aged 70 and over were more prone to weight loss than weight gain, with substantial variations. Public health messages regarding weight control should take into account the heterogeneity of this population and target weight loss as well as weight gain to meet diverse needs of the population.

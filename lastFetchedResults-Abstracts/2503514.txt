Abstract 
Introduction: Oxygenation decreases during the early period after the open heart surgery. In order to Prevention of this disease and treat, the studies have been performed in the early mobilization with postoperative rehabilitation program. 
Objective: To evaluate the early mobilization as an intervention on the respiratory condition of the patients after the coronary artery bypass surgery.
Materials and Methods: A clinical trial with eighty Eighty patients after coronary artery bypass surgery were divided Random fix block in two groups of forty people. In the intervention group, in addition to the usual hospital practice and active movement on the bed, they walked a distance of twenty meters in two intervals: the first one, twenty- four hours after the surgery and removing the endotracheal tube and the second one, after six hours in the ICU. Blood gas analysis, expiratory peak flow and CXR were evaluated before and after the mobilization. All assessments of the intervention group were performed for the control group. Data were analyzed by the statistical software with SPSS version 20 and Significant level p < 0/05.
Results: Based on statistical results, most measured parameters in the control group were improved. After the second time, the early mobilization indicates a significant difference in Arterial blood oxygen saturation(SaO2) rate in the intervention group 95/77±2/14 and the control group 94/2±3/03 per cent(p=0/009); peak expiratory flow rate in the intervention group 167/2±49/1 and the control group137±40/55 lit/min(p=0/004); and  Arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) rate in the intervention group 76/59±7/18and the control group71/4±9/63 mmHg =p)0/008).
Conclusion: The early mobilization after the coronary artery bypass surgery indicates an improvement in oxygenation with the evaluation results.

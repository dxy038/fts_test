TEAM workshop problem 22 for SEMS is multi-objective optimization problem with many design variables and nonlinear constraints. In order to guarantee reliable performances, the reliability-based design optimization along with accurate prediction of the effects of uncertainties has to be executed. In this paper, multiplicative decomposition method is applied to perform reliability analysis for reliability based design optimization.

Protein profiles of cytologic samples from the cervix were studied using High Performance Liquid Chromatographic (HPLC) separation combined with ultra-sensitive laser induced fluorescence (LIF) detection. HPLC-LIF protein profiles of samples from clinically normal subjects, individuals suffering from cervical cancer (different stages), and subjects who had other gynecological problems related to cervix, like erosion of cervix and Nabothian cyst, but no malignancy, were subjected to Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The application of HPLC-LIF protein profiling combined with PCA was found to be a highly efficient method for discrimination of different classes of samples with high sensitivity and specificity. Diagnostic accuracy and optimal threshold – decision criterion – for objective discrimination were estimated using sensitivity–specificity pairs and Youden's index (J) plots.

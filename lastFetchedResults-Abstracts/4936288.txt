This paper presents a method for environmentally constrained economic dispatch in power systems. Economic dispatch problem is basically an optimization problem where objective function may be highly nonlinear, non-convex, non-differentiable and may have multiple local minima. Therefore classical optimization methods may be trapped to any local minima and may not be able to reach the global minima. In this paper a multiobjective optimization technique using bacteria foraging optimization (BFO) has been proposed to solve this complex problem. The proposed method is tested on the IEEE 30 bus, IEEE 118 bus and one practical 390 bus NREB (Northern Region Electricity Board, India) system and simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

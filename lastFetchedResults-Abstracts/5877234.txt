Different propagation mechanisms of the transmitted signal take place from the surrounding objects in an indoor scenario. The prediction of the reflection phenomenon is one of the important parameter of the ultra wideband (UWB) channel modeling. This paper presents a model of wave propagation in indoor environments for multiple reflections of UWB signal inside the building wall. The main objective of this work is to provide an analytical approach for obtaining the non-line of sight (NLOS) components reflected through the wall structure. The reflection of UWB signal in varied scenarios of indoor environment is investigated under different thickness and electrical parameters of the wall.

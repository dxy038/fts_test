The image quality obtained by a radiographic equipment is very useful to characterize the physical properties of the image radiographic chain, in a quality control of the radiographic equipment. In the radiographic technique it is necessary that the evaluation of the image can guarantee the constancy of its quality to carry out a suitable diagnosis. In this work we have designed some radiographic phantoms for different radiographic digital devices, as dental, conventional, equipments with computed radiography (phosphor plate) and direct radiography (sensor) technology. Additionally, we have developed a software to analyse the image obtained by the radiographic equipment with digital processing techniques, as edge detector, morphological operators, statistical test for the detected combinations.. The design of these phantoms let the evaluation of a wide range of operating conditions of voltage, current and time of the digital equipments. Moreover, the image quality analysis by the automatic software, let study it with objective parameters.

In this paper, a double-objective optimal method based on the genetic algorithm is proposed. The method is used for optimal design of the hybrid permanent magnet synchronous motor with two objective functions. The rare earth permanent magnet material Nd-Fe-B is the major part of the rotor, the magnets are placed in hybrid type, including radial and tangential position. The optimum results for the 7.5 kW and the 9 kW permanent magnet synchronous motors show decrement in available material cost of motors.

The radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic field of magnetic resonance (MR) scanners can result in significant tissue heating due to the RF coupling with the conducting parts of medical implants. The objective of this paper is to assess the safety of a generic deep brain stimulator (DBS) during MRI scans based on a combined numerical and experimental procedure described in [1]. The evaluation is performed for 1.5 T MR scanners using a generic model of a deep brain stimulator with a helical lead. The results show that the approach is technically feasible and provides sound and conservative information on the potential heating of implants.

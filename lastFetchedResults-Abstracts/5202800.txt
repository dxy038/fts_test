The objective of this paper is to further extend the application of the Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity-Based Control (IDA-PBC) technique to the 2D-SpiderCrane mechanism with both kinetic and potential energy being shaped. An earlier effort had focused exclusively on potential energy alone. By shaping the total energy and by adding appropriate damping we achieve almost global asymptotic stability of the desired equilibrium.

In chloride containing environment, chloride permeability of concrete is an important parameter affecting the service life of concrete structures. The primary objective of this experimental study was to study the effect of cement types on the resistance of concrete against chloride penetration for given compressive strength classes. These cements included two different types of granulated blast-furnace slag cement (CEM III/A 32.5N and CEM III/A 42.5N), a sulfate resisting cement (SRC 32.5), and a Portland cement blended with fly ash; all of which compared to an ordinary Portland cement (CEM I 42.5R). For each binder type, four concretes at different strength classes were produced and as a result 20 mixtures were obtained. Rapid chloride ion penetration tests according to ASTM C 1202 were conducted. In addition, electrical resistivity and capillary water absorption tests were carried out. In order to characterize the concrete quality, compressive strength of the specimens were also obtained. The test results clearly demonstrated that the blast-furnace slag cements have the highest resistance against chloride penetration, while the pure Portland cement and sulfate resisting cement have the lowest resistance. Concretes produced with the sulfate resisting cement had substantially higher capillary sorption compared to other mixtures. Test results confirmed the strong relationship between the chloride permeability and electrical resistivity.

We use the Multi Agent System paradigm to model and analyse Home Automation System performance in exploiting limited resources such as electricity and hot water. In this paper we evaluate several approaches to the optimisation of Home Automation System performance using Tabu Search, and Single and Multi-objective Genetic Algorithms. The results show that the Genetic Algorithms achieve faster convergence than Tabu Search. Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm provides a diverse set of solutions for the decision maker.

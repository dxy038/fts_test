In this paper, a high performance single phase transformer-less online uninterruptable power supply (UPS) is proposed. The use of the bidirectional buck-boost converter with high conversion ratio not only reduces the number of batteries but also ensures a transformer-less system. The rectifier has capability of power factor correction and provides regulated DC link voltage whereas the inverter provides a regulated sinusoidal output voltage to the load. In order to control the transient effect, efficient control scheme is adopted in the system. The overall efficiency of the system is improved with significant reduction in size and weight of the system due to decrease number of batteries. Qualitative analysis and experimental results obtained with a 500VA prototype shows a normal efficiency of over 94% and an input power factor of over 99%.

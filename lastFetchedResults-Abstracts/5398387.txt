In this paper, an implementation of a transport protocol to be used in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) is presented. The objective of the protocol is to guarantee reliability by recovering lost packets while dealing with the limited energy, processing and memory capabilities of the devices typically used in these networks. The implemented protocol was Distributed Transport for Sensor Networks (DTSN) and the target device was the embedded device Silex SX-560 using WiFi technology. The implementation was done in C language under the Linux operating system. Following the requirements of the project, additional mechanisms were implemented to enhance the protocolÂ´s performance for multimedia data and to provide a certain level of security (authentication and integrity) to the control packets. Results show that the implementation is semantically correct and the protocol is efficient in reducing the total number of transmissions, maintaining a low overhead.

Modern power systems are becoming increasingly complex to operate. Training departments need more tools to help them in the process of training operators. In addition, they also need more help in evaluating the training session. This creates an iterative process, whereby instructors can evaluate feedback and modify the training program appropriately to cover any holes identified, or identify the weaknesses of each trainee and help them perform better. The dispatcher training simulator (DTS) has already been recognized throughout the industry as one of the best tools to perform operator training. The authors have recognized that the actual philosophy of operator training will vary from utility to utility and will always be subjective in nature. However, one common factor in most training programs is the need to collect objective data which can be used to analyze trainee/training effectiveness and present this information in the form of a report. In this paper, the authors present a design and the results of a prototype implementation which will go a long way towards helping the instructor gather relevant data to evaluate the behavior of a power system during a training session. The training philosophy of a particular electric utility (Virginia Power) has been presented and the tool has been set up for it. The utilization of standard tools and methodologies in the design of this tool help in the ease of integration and usefulness of its outputs

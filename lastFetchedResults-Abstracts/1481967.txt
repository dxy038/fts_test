Modified atmosphere packaging with carbon dioxide is effective for prolonging shelf-life of fresh meat. Addition of carbon monoxide to the system provides the advantage of enhancing meat colour. The study objective was to determine the effect of CO2-MAP + 0.4% CO, vs. 100% CO2-MAP, on the bacteriology and colour of retail-ready fresh pork stored for 8 weeks in a master-package system. Total plate counts were not affected and listeria was present on meat from both treatments. Colour was enhanced with the inclusion of CO, while no effect on lipid oxidation was observed. Use of CO in MAP provides sufficient storage life and product colour quality to permit shipment of fresh pork to distant markets. However, given the stable fresh colour of CO-treated meat and the lack of inhibition of pathogen growth by CO, there is concern that CO-MAP under certain conditions may pose a food safety risk.

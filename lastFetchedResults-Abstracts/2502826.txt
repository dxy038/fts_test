The aim of our study is to survey epidemiologic factors in pa-tients with urinary stones referring to educational hospitals of Hamadan during 2010-2013.     
Materials & Methods: In this analytic-cross-sectional study, we studied 500 cases of urinary stones referring to educational hospitals of Hamadan. The data were collected from electronic patient records system of laboratory. The results were registered in a check list and analyzed by spss16 and descriptive statistical indicators.
Results: The patients were between 0.5-84 years. The average age of them was 40.36 years. In our study of 500 cases, 348 cases were male (69.6%) and 152 cases were female (30.4%). The male to female ratio was 2.3 to 1. Urinary stones were more prevalent   in 25- 45 year old men and 30-50 year old women. Among 500 patients, 466 cases had only one type of renal stones and 34 cases had 2 types. The calcium oxalate was the most common stone (386 cases, 72.5%). The other  common stone types were uric acid (130 cases, 24.3 %), cystine  (14 cas-es,2.6 %) ,calcium carbonate (3 cases,0.5 %)  and  calcium phosphate (1 case,0.1 %)

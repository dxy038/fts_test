Objective: To determine the age of menopause and to find out the prevalence and risk estimation of osteoporosis in outpatient setting. Material and Methods: Two hundred and forty postmenopausal women were recruited in a descriptive study. Postmenopausal women visiting outpatient department in Police & Services Hospital Peshawar, N.W.F.P. as patients or their relatives were interviewed on the pattern of preset questionnaire. The study period was from 1st Oct 2006 to 30th March 2007. The proforma covering demographic variables, social history, past medical history, drug history, age of menarche, age at menopause, reproductive history, family history of osteoporosis, was set up. The bone mineral density of heel was measured by bone densitometer Osteoporosis was defined on basis of WHO criteria. Results: The mean age of menopause observed was 49.1Â±5.8 years. Early and late onset of menopause was associated with development of osteoporosis, while normal onset of menopause was found to be linked with osteopenia or bone mineral density remained normal. Only 14.48% women had normal bone mineral density. Approximate forty four percent postmenopausal women were suffering from osteopenia and 24.5% were having T-score in osteoporotic range. Conclusion: There is intense need to make women aware of osteoporosis, and its complications in form of fractures and lack of mobility. Osteoporotic bones can never be restored, so there should be early screening of menopausal women.

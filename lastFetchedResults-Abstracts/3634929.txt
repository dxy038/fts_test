The main objective of this correspondence is to clarify several comments made by K. Zhou et al. (see ibid., vol.20, no.2, p.511-3, Mar. 2005) about our original work (see ibid., vol.19, no.4, p.1060-8, Jul. 2004) without the aim of generating any controversy. Furthermore, we would like to recognize K. Zhou et al. as pioneers in applying the repetitive control technique to the power electronics field.

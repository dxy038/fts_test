In this paper, we illustrate how the notion of shadowing can be applied to the prediction problem for dynamical systems. We start with the assumption that we observer a sequence of states from a dynamical system and that we have identified a reasonably accurate model of the system. Our objective is to use this model in a type of observer design where the error between predicted and real values is fed into the observer in order to correct the prediction and increase the shadowing length.

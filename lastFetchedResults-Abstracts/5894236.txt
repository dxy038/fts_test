By adding the mechanism of temporal integration and internal noise into the framework of the previous proposed basic objective discrimination model (ODM), a modified ODM for triangle orientation discrimination threshold measurements is achieved. Validation experiments results show that the performance curves of the modified ODM fit those of the civilian observers well. The correlation coefficients between data from the modified ODM and civilian observers are over 0.9, indicating that the modified ODM can predict the human performance well and can be used for TOD curves measurements instead of civilian observers.

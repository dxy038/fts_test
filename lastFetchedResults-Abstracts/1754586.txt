The nematode Angiostrongylus cantonensis causes eosinophilic meningoencephalitis in humans and thus alternative methods of control should be studied. The objective of this work was to evaluate the predatory capacity of eight fungal isolates of the species Duddingtonia flagrans (AC001, CG768 and CG722), Monacrosporium thaumasium (NF34), M. sinense (SF53) and Arthrobotrys robusta (I31), A. cladodes (CG719) and A. conoides (I40) on first-stage larvae (L1) of A. cantonensis under laboratory conditions. The treated groups contained 1000 conidia of the fungal isolates and 1000 A. cantonensis L1 in Petri dishes containing 2% water-agar medium (2% WA). The control group (without fungi) contained only 1000 A. cantonensis L1 in 2% WA. Evidence of predation was observed at the end of 7 days. Percentage reductions in L1 were: AC001, 82.8%; CG768, 71.0%; CG722, 72.8%; NF34, 86.7%; SF53, 89.7%; I40, 48.3%; CG719, 84.7%; and I31, 80.4%. No significant difference was observed (p &gt; 0.01) between the actions of the isolates used; however, a difference was noted (p &lt; 0.01) in relation to the control group. The results of the present work, confirm previous reports of the effectiveness of the fungi D. flagrans, M. thaumasium, M. sinense and A. robusta in controlling larvae of potentially zoonotic nematodes, this being the first report on A. cantonensis L1.

This paper focuses on the optimization of a linear actuator by the &#8220;output space mapping (OSM)&#8221; method. The underlying objective of this work lies in the minimization of the time required for the achievement of this optimal design. Indeed, in addition to the sole costs of optimization processes strictly speaking, the time needed for the developpement of the models is taken into account. In the context of OSM, two different finite-element models of the same actuator are used. This paper presents these modeling solutions and considers their corresponding accuracy. Results of this multi-objective optimization method are presented and compared with those obtained by the sequential simplex (SS) method based solely on the fine model. Both approaches give similar results. However, the comparison of their performances clearly shows that the OSM algorithm is an effective technique for reducing the computation time of optimization studies, even in the case of relatively simple electromagnetic structures. Hence, this approach leads to an original and effective optimization methodology.

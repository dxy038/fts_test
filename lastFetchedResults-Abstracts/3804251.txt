In this paper the application of decision trees for on-line preventive dynamic security of isolated power systems is presented. Decision trees provide the necessary computational speed for on-line performance and the flexibility of providing preventive control. Emphasis is placed on the on-line use of the decision trees to test the dynamic security of each generation dispatch scenario and thus to provide corrective advice via generation redispatch. Moreover, the algorithm implemented provides the flexibility of displaying the cost of each redispatch. In this way, the method can help in objective decision making. Results from the application of the system on actual load series from the island of Crete, where the proposed system is in trial operation, are presented.

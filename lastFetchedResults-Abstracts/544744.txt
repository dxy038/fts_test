The Joint Milliarcsecond Astrometry Pathfinder Survey (JMAPS) is a small, space-based, all sky, visible wavelength, astrometric and photometric survey mission for 0th through 14th I-band magnitude stars with a planned 2013 launch. The primary objective of the JMAPS mission is the generation of an astrometric star catalog with 1 milliarcsecond (mas) positional accuracy or better and photometry to the 1% accuracy level or better at 1st to 12th mag. A 1-mas all-sky survey will have a significant impact on our current understanding of galactic and stellar astrophysics. JMAPS will improve our understanding of the origins of nearby young stars, provide insight into the dynamics of star formation regions and associations, investigate the dynamics and membership of nearby open clusters.

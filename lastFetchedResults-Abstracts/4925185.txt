This paper evaluates the benefits of energy storage systems applied to renewable intermittent sources like wind. With this objective, a 144 MW Portuguese wind farm is used as a case-study. The storage system design and evaluation processes use a computational tool developed in MatLab to simulate the wind farm operation with an energy storage system and computes the remuneration tariff. The energy storage design settles on a system of 5 MW with 30 MWh. The simulation results show a 2.1% gain in wind farm tariff and a improved adjustment on generation to the typical electricity demand curve. Considering the storage system design and an available storage technology survey, one concludes that redox flow batteries are the best suited to application, in spite of their present prices being not the most advantage.

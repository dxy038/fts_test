This paper presents a linear matrix inequality (LMI) framework to design robust model predictive control (MPC) for a class of continuous-time nonlinear uncertain systems. The controller design is formulated as an optimization problem of the &#8220;worst-case&#8221; objective function over an infinite moving horizon. A sufficient state feedback synthesis condition is provided in the form of LMI optimization and is solved online at each time step. A simulation example is showed the effectiveness of the proposed method.

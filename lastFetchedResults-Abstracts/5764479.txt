Wireless mobile communication has evolved from 2G to 3G and B3G, and the advent of many new services raises the need to construct the service model. Since traffics in broadband networks are often the mixture of different services, modeling of hybrid-service is very important for network planning, performance evaluation and resource management. However, most of the existing study on service model is mainly focused on single service model. This paper presents an investigation of state of arts in hybrid-service modeling, and some research challenges are also discussed, with an objective to hope to find some feasible ways for further research of hybrid-service modeling.

Objective: To study the effects of providing simple instructions for partial sleep deprivation on the necessity for sedation in children and adolescents undergoing electroencephalography (EEG).
Methods: Children and adolescents below 18 years undergoing non-urgent routine EEG were studied for the need for sedation during the EEG test. Two consecutive 3-year periods were reviewed. During the first 3 years no instructions for sleep deprivation were given, and during the second 3-year period, simple instructions were given to the patient or parents of young children to have less sleep prior to the EEG test. This was achieved by using the same sleep deprivation schedule irrespective of the age of the patient.
Results: In the first 3-year period between January 1996 and December 1998, 785 non-urgent routine EEG recordings were performed in which only 146 (19%) pediatric patients managed to fall asleep without the need for any sedation within 30 min of being ready for the sleep recording. When partial sleep deprivation was implemented in the 3-year period between January 2000 and December 2002, 449 (55%) out of 821patients undergoing the test fell asleep in the laboratory without sedation, an overall increase of 36%. Analyzing the different age-specific groups, the maximal increase in the success for natural sleep following partial sleep deprivation was 44% for pediatric patients aged above 10 years.
Conclusions: Simple instructions for partial sleep deprivation prior to the EEG reduced the need for sedation in children and adolescents undergoing the test.

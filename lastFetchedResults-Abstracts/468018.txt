OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to compare the use of a combination of methotrexate and mifepristone with methotrexate alone in the medical management of ectopic pregnancy.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a preliminary nonrandomized phase II study. All patients with progressing ectopic pregnancy meeting criteria for medical management were included. Treatment consisted of 50 mg/m2 of methotrexate injected intramuscularly and 600 mg of mifepristone, administered orally, compared with a previous group who received only 50 mg/m2 of methotrexate injected intramuscularly.
RESULTS: Of the 30 patients treated with the combination, there was only 1 failure, whereas medical treatment had failed for 11 of 42 patients treated with methotrexate alone.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of mifepristone and methotrexate decreased the risk of failure in medical treatment of ectopic pregnancy. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:640-3.)

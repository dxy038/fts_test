This paper focuses on vehicle warning system based on fuzzy decision making for lane departure and forward collision avoidance for dealing with driver assistant system. The proposed system is composed of vision-based preprocessing and a fuzzy decision making. The objective of vision-based preprocessing part is lane tracking and forward vehicle detection, and provides the necessary information for fuzzy decision making to trigger the warning device. The fuzzy decision making unit can adjust the fuzzy decision rule base follow the driving behavior to increase the warning strength for lane departure and/ or forward collision.

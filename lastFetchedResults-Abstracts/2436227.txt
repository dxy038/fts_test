This paper incorporates the concept of efficiency defined by data envelopment analysis (DEA) into locationâ€“allocation models in a fuzzy environment. It is shown how this incorporation can influence the pattern of facility location and the assignment of demands. Due to two major shortcomings, called low discrimination power and unrealistic weight distribution associated with classic form of DEA, a multi-criteria DEA is applied. Since the proposed model results in a fuzzy multi-objective non-linear programming, we present a solution procedure based on a modification of fuzzy parametric programming (FPP) and minimum deviation method.

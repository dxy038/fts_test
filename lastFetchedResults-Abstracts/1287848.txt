Background & Objective: Learning style is a distinct behavior for gaining knowledge and skills through study or experience. Personality is a series of relatively stable characteristics which distinguish a person from others. The key to involving learners in the learning process is their preferences and learning styles, and identifying factors affecting these variables. In this regard, the predictor variables of learning styles must be accurately identified so as to improve educational conditions. This study aimed to determine factors predictive of learning styles of the students of Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Iran. In addition, the impact of demographic factors on their characteristics will be discussed.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Data collection was performed by a questionnaire including demographic data, personality test (NEO), the Learning style inventory, and the Kolb Learning Style Questionnaire. For data analysis, central tendency and dispersion measures, chi-square, Spearman correlation coefficient, and logistic regression tests were used.
Results: The results show that most of the participants in this study were single women. Mean age of participants was 21.41 ± 2.96 years. Most students (44.31%) used assimilating learning style. Based on the results of these personality types, nearly a third of students (28.2%) were of the conscientious (responsible) character type. The results showed that only gender is a predictor of learning styles.
Conclusion: More attention to students' learning styles results in the perfect use of teaching practices, and increasing and enhancement of students’ capabilities. Moreover, by identifying students' preferred learning styles and changing teaching methods, the students' enthusiasm for learning can be increased.

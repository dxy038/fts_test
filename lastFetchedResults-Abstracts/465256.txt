OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the perioperative morbidity after hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy as primary treatment of endometrial cancer and to analyze the recurrence and survival of patients classified as having surgical stage I disease who did not receive adjunctive teletherapy.
STUDY DESIGN: Over a 10-year interval 444 patients underwent extensive surgical staging for corpus cancer. Perioperative events were recorded prospectively. Outcome events were updated after the last year of study.
RESULTS: After patients with high-risk histologic types of cancer were excluded, 396 patients were evaluable. The risk of extrauterine disease, detected in 21.8% of patients, increased with increasing lack of tumor differentiation. The associated surgical morbidity, including blood loss (mean 336 ml), surgical site infection (3.5%), thromboembolic events (1.5%), and urinary injury (0.6%), and deaths (0.6%) did not differ from those in reports of women undergoing lesser operative procedures. Late complications, includiing lymphocyst (1.2%), leg edema (1.8%), and hernia (2.9%), were infrequent. Recurrence and survival analysis indicated a calculated 5-year survival of 97% of all patients with surgical stage I disease. There was a significant survival difference related to grade and stage for women in whom disease was confined to the uterus. Overall survival in patients with stage IA (100%) was significantly different (p< 0.0001) from that of patients with stage IB (97%) and stage IC (93%). All recurrences included a distal component.
CONCLUSION: Extensive surgical staging including lymphadenectomy can be performed safely. Our results suggest that the risk of pelvic recurrence is not increased and the risk of survival is not compromised in those women not receiving adjunctive teletherapy. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;176:777-89.)

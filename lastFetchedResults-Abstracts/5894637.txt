Vibration analysis is important for electronic packages used in automotive, military, and other applications. For a high-I/O area-array package such as the Ceramic Column Grid Array (CCGA) package, the package can have a significant effect on the vibration characteristics of the system, which will in turn affect the solder joint fatigue life. The effect of solder joint stiffness and CCGA package mass on the natural frequency and mode shapes is investigated in this paper. The objective is to develop an experimental and a modeling approach that can accurately determine the solder joint behavior of electronic components under vibration conditions. In particular, this paper discusses the out-of-plane sinusoidal vibration experiments at 1G, 3G, 5G, and 10G, the analytical modeling, and the numerical modeling for a 42.5mm &#215; 42.5mm &#215; 4mm 1089 I/O CCGA package on a 133 mm &#215; 61 mm &#215; 2.8 mm FR4 board.

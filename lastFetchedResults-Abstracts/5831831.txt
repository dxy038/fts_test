This paper presents a method of fixed-point reconnaissance path planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV). In this method, Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) is introduced into reconnaissance UAV path planning algorithm, and targets value, effective reconnaissance path and other factors that impact UAV path planning are included in the objective function of PSO. The optimal solution of reconnaissance path is obtained by optimizing of PSO. At last, the simulation is carried out and satisfactory results are achieved.

Organizations worldwide are increasing their focus on sustainability as a way to pursue growth and add value in their business. In line with expanding regulatory and voluntary initiatives in sustainable procurement, professional IT buyers are seeking reassurance that the IT products they buy are designed using the social, economic and environmental principles of sustainable development. It is important that the environmental aspects of IT product design do not present trade-offs in manufacturer social responsibility, worker conditions and other practices that can, in turn, affect corporate reputations and value. One challenge is how to work with industry and other stakeholders to drive product design and manufacturing in a direction that reflects these sustainable development goals. Therefore TCO Development has broadened its criteria scope in the new generation TCO Certified programme for computers and displays, to include enhanced Corporate Social Responsibility - CSR - requirements. The objective is twofold: to provide buyers with a third party verification of CSR, performance and environmental features in IT products, as well as challenge industry to make further advances in sustainable practices and product design.

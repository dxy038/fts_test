Background: Epidemiological studies suggest that calcium intake is associated with obesity.   
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the association between calcium intake and body mass index (BMI) in adolescent girls.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 863 middle and high school students that were selected by multistage cluster sampling method in Zanjan, 2008. Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, the Food Frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and the General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ). Calcium intake was calculated using EPI6 software. Data were analyzed using chi-square test, Pearson's correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis.
Findings: Calcium intake was inadequate in 73.8% of the students and the mean BMI was 20.1Â±3.5 linear regression analysis showed that calcium intake did not predict body mass index.
Conclusion: With regards to the results and since the lack of calcium intake as a valuable nutrient in the female students could put them at risk of diseases such as osteoporosis, educating adolescents and families in order to change their life style is suggested.

As a key technology in 4G-LTE, heterogeneous networks can effectively extend the coverage and capacity of wireless networks by deploying multiple micro-nodes on top of the conventional macro base stations (BS). The deployed micro-nodes differ in transmission power and processing capabilities, leading to new challenges in interference management, mobile association, and radio resource management (RRM). In this paper, we consider RRM for heterogeneous networks with relays (RN) where the RNs have full RRM capabilities and can be viewed as micro BSs. A radio resource allocation framework is proposed with the objective to ensure proportional fairness among the UEs. An asymptotically optimal solution is derived by applying the gradient-based scheduling scheme and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for optimality. To implement RRM in networks with RNs, the resource consumption in the backhaul links, which depends on the demand of the UEs associated with the RN, should be counted at both the BS and the RN. The derived resource allocation scheme gives insight on the optimal radio resource allocation for heterogeneous networks with RNs.

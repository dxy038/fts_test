Simulation tools have being innovated through the use of virtual reality technology. Virtual reality involves an advanced style of human-computer interfaces which enables the user to enter, be present, interact, and explore the real world. This presence is achieved by three-dimensional graphical representation and control, and non-conventional devices, such as gloves and head-mounted displays. The main objective of this paper is to present the VR-SIM, a virtual reality simulation tool, which is intended to support software engineers in the validation of RTS. The following topics are covered: characteristics and overview of the tool; detailing of the virtual reality component; and examples of use

This paper presents the main features of the EU R&amp;D project ENERsip. The main objective of this FP7 ICT project is to design, develop, and test an adaptive service-oriented M2M-based platform that enables optimizing, in near real-time, and saving energy by remotely monitoring, controlling and coordinating power generation and consumption within neighborhoods with energy-positive buildings. The paper describes the system architecture designed to meet such requirements, putting special emphasis on the M2M communication infrastructure. The novel services that will be delivered on top of such M2M communication infrastructure and the potential users who will enjoy them are also presented. Finally, the ENERsip platform validation plan is outlined.

The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of transform domain adaptive algorithms in suppressing acoustic echo in fullband and subband acoustic echo cancellers (AEC). The subband AEC considered consists in main and auxiliary subbands designed to provide a numerically efficient subband structure. Comparison results between the fullband using the transform domain LMS adaptive algorithm and subband cancellers are provided

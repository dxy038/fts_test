Communications in single channel single interface ad hoc network suffer from channel access contention, which results in bandwidth scarcity. One way to overcome this problem is through the use of multiple channels multiple interfaces (MCMI). In this paper, we present a dual-interface multiple channels destination-sequenced distance-vector (DSDV-M) routing protocol, which is the extension of the DSDV routing protocol to MCMI version. The objective of the proposed algorithm is to reduce the channel interference so that multiple transmissions can occur concurrently, thus increasing network capacity. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against channel scheduling algorithms; the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is able to exploit the availability of multiple channels multiple interfaces to improve network capacity. In addition, we are also able to gain greater than twice the throughput of DSDV with single channel single interface.

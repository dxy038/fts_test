Blue tongue disease is a non-contagious, viral disease of ruminants, mainly sheep and less frequently cattle, goats, buffalo, deer, dromedaries and antelope. That is mainly transmitted by insects and cause lesion in the mouth, nasal mucosa, and limb, also existing reports of create abortion in some animals. Camel might be reservoir of BTV without showing of any clinical sings so it can be spread the virus among other regions and animals. The objective of this study was genomic detection of bluetongue virus in one humped camels slaughtered in central part of Iran. In order to detection of S7 sequence of bluetongue virus genome in 110 one humped camels that slaughtered in Najafabad abattoir, specimens were prepared. For preservation of coagulation heparin was added to blood samples and they transported to laboratory in cool box. RNA was extracted by acid guanidinium-isothiocyanat and phenol chloroform method and they were detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All PCR products were separated by 1.5% agarose gels electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. After that, they were analyzed by using gel documentation. The results of tests showed that all of samples were negative. Fortunately, it shows that in this studied area in our country, this infectious cannot be exist or transient infection in camel does not persist for a long time. As BTV infection was reported in some provinces, we highly recommend to expand study on camel infection with BTV.

This work studies a transportation problem called as lane reservation problem, which is to complete some special transportation tasks within pre-given deadline by optimally selecting lanes to be reserved from the network and designing source-destination paths for the special tasks. Because of the exclusive use of the reserved lanes by the special tasks, negative impact such as increase of travel time on adjacent general-purpose lanes is caused on normal traffic. Then, the objective of the lane reservation problem is to minimize the total negative impact caused by the reserved lanes. To solve this problem, a tabu search based algorithm is developed. Numerical computational results on randomly generated instances show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared with a referenced IP solver CPLEX 12.5.

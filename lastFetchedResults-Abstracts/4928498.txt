In this paper we present the results of an experimental analysis of the behavior and performance of VoIP calls using different codecs in a wireless mesh network (WMN) based on the IEEE 802.11g standard. Most measurements were done during the rainy season in a Brazilian Amazon region. We assessed the call quality of codecs using real measurement conditions showing the codecs coding performance over wireless mesh networks. Both between unidirectional and bidirectional transmissions were studied.

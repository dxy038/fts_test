This work proposes a formulation to calculate the transmitter power needed to cover cells of different sizes whilst maintaining the average signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constant, and near the maximum, for two long-term evolution (LTE) systems operating over non-contiguous frequency bands, 800 MHz and 2 GHz, with an integrated common radio resource management (iCRRM) entity, in the context of spectrum aggregation in an LTE-Advanced scenario. The iCRRM entity is able to switch users between the two LTE systems. We address a formulation based on the computation of the average received power and average co-channel interference in cellular topologies with frequency reuse pattern K=3, keeping the presence of coverage holes insignificant, whilst considering the COST-231 Hata path loss model. We have verified how the normalized power increases as the cell radius increases. The objective of applying this formulation in the dimensioning process is to save power for shorter coverage distances.

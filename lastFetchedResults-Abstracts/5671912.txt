This paper addresses the problem of tracking several non-rigid objects over a sequence of frames acquired from a static observer using boundary and region-based information under a coupled geodesic active contour framework. Given the current frame, a statistical analysis is performed on the observed difference frame which provides a measurement that distinguishes between the static and mobile regions in terms of conditional probabilities. An objective function is defined that integrates boundary-based and region-based module by seeking curves that attract the object boundaries and maximize the a posteriori segmentation probability on the interior curve regions with respect to intensity and motion properties. This function is minimized using a gradient descent method. The associated Euler-Lagrange PDE is implemented using a Level-Set approach, where a very fast front propagation algorithm evolves the initial curve towards the final tracking result. Very promising experimental results are provided using real video sequences

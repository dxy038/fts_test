OBJECTIVE: Flow-induced vasodilatation may contribute to lowering of peripheral resistance to pregnancy. This study investigated modulation of flow responses by 17β-estradiol. STUDY DESIGN: Small mesenteric arteries from prepubertal female Wistar rats were pretreated for 3 hours with 17β-estradiol (10-7 mol/L) with 17α-estradiol (10-7 mol/L) or vehicle (0.1% dimethylsulfoxide). Responses to intraluminal flow were evaluated with use of a pressure arteriograph. RESULTS: After pretreatment with 17β-estradiol arteries relaxed to flow, whereas those treated with vehicle or 17α-estradiol did not (percent change in diameter at maximum flow rate after 17β-estradiol 38.7% ± 5.7%, n = 10, vs 1.1% ± 4.3%, n = 10 after vehicle; p < 0.01). Endothelium removal or pretreatment with either a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor or a novel soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor diminished the response to 17β-estradiol. CONCLUSION: 17β-Estradiol stimulated nitric oxide–mediated flow-induced relaxation. Through this pathway 17β-estradiol could play an important role in the control of vascular tone.(Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;177:8)

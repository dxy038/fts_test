Assembly logistics involves the material flow that is closely related to the assembly process of products. The optimisation of assembly logistics is of great significance for shortening the delivery period whilst improving the operating efficiency of the assembly lines. However, due to the uncertainties caused by the stochastic arrival sequence of customer orders in a build-to-order environment, it becomes difficult to find the optimal solution to assembly lines with pure mathematical methods. The objective of this paper is to optimise assembly process from the logistics simulation perspective. This paper begins with the analysis of logistics activities that occur at the assembly lines of a specific auto plant. Using the methodology of business process reengineering, several assembly lines are reengineered according to the assembly processes, product models and time of delivery. Secondly, a logistics simulation model of the assembly lines is established and major control variables of the model are specified. Taking an actual customer order for example, the paper finally presents the optimal operation parameters of the assembly lines based on the results of logistics simulation with the help of an interactive 3-dimensional animation and visualised analytical tool. The simulation results indicate that the operating efficiency of the optimised automobile assembly lines has been improved greatly; the occupation time of finished products warehouse and the time of delivery are shortened dramatically.

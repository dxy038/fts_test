This work is devoted to the description of an algorithm for automatic quadrilateral mesh generation. The
technique is based on a recursive decomposition of the domain into quadrilateral elements. This automatically
generates meshes composed entirely by quadrilaterals over complex geometries (there is no need for a previous
step where triangles are generated). A background mesh with the desired element sizes allows to obtain
the preferred sizes anywhere in the domain. The  nal mesh can be viewed as the optimal one given the
objective function is de ned. The recursive algorithm induces an e cient data structure which optimizes the
computer cost. Several examples are presented to show the e ciency of this algorithm

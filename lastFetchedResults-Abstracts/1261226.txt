Objective To modify the excised larynx bench apparatus to accommodate experiments with rabbit larynges. Study Design Methodological study using exآ vivo rabbit larynges. Methods Rabbit larynges (nآ =آ 5) were dissected and mounted on a custom-made phonatory apparatus. The arytenoids were adducted by rods, and humidified air was passed through the larynx to elicit vocal fold vibration. Acoustic, aerodynamic, electroglottographic (EGG), and videokymographic data were collected for each larynx. The same data were collected for five canine larynges for the purpose of comparison, and coefficients of variation were calculated for each parameter in both models. Results Reliable phonation was achieved in each larynx. Acoustic fundamental frequency (F0), percent jitter, percent shimmer, signal-to-noise ratio, pressure and flow at phonation onset and offset; and F0, closed quotient, speed quotient, jitter, shimmer, and contact quotient, as recorded by EGG; and mucosal wave amplitude and phase difference are reported for rabbit larynges. Coefficients of variation for each parameter are similar in magnitude between the two models. Conclusion We developed a method for recording reliable acoustic, aerodynamic, videokymographic, and EGG data from rabbit larynges. When data obtained from leporine larynges were compared with data from canine larynges, the intralarynx variability of rabbit larynges was found to be similar to that of canine larynges.

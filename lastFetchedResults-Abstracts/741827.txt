Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the relation between hyperhomocysteinaemia and ischemic heart disease in a cohort of Sri Lankan patients with ischemic heart disease. Method: Serum homocysteine, cysteine and cysteinylglyceine were measured in 54 patients with a definite diagnosis of ischemic heart disease and compared with those of an age and sex matched control group. Results: Patients with coronary ischaemia had significantly higher mean concentrations of homocysteine and its metabolite cysteine (P<0.01). Of the 54 patients with ischemic heart disease 14 (35%) had fasting homocysteine concentrations above the 90th percentile of the controls (odds ratio 3.2, 95% CL 1.0â€“11.3). Conclusion: Hyperhomocysteinaemia is associated with a three fold increase in coronary risk.

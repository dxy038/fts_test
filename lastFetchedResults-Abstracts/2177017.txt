Purpose: Recent developments in the field of cell therapy have led to a renewed interest in
treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the early death of transplanted
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in stressful microenvironment of a recipient tissue is a
major problem with this kind of treatment. The objective of this study was to determine
whether overexpression of a cytoprotective factor, nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2
(Nrf2), in MSCs could protect rats against AKI.
Methods: The Nrf2 was overexpressed in MSCs by recombinant adenoviruses, and the
MSCs were implanted to rats suffering from cisplatin-induced AKI.
Results: The obtained results showed that transplantation with the engineered MSCs
ameliorates cisplatin-induced AKI. Morphologic features of the investigated kidneys showed
that transplantation with the MSCs in which Nrf2 had been overexpressed significantly
improved the complications of AKI.
Conclusion: These findings suggested that the engineered MSCs might be a good candidate
to be further evaluated in clinical trials. However, detailed studies must be performed to
investigate the possible carcinogenic effect of Nrf2 overexpression.

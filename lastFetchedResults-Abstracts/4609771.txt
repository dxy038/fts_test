The paper presents the DER aggregation solution that was deployed and tested in the frame of the Reflexe demonstrator project. This project brings together a consortium of industrial partners and research laboratories with the objective of examining all aspects of aggregating commercial and industrial flexibility in order to provide energy and ancillary services to the grid through the market. In particular, the battery management system developed in the project allows a back-up battery to be directly integrated into the aggregator´s portfolio. This system increases the battery´s cost effectiveness by providing an asset that has very valuable flexibility characteristics. To aggregate the battery´s flexibility with other demand response in optimal bids, flexibility scheduling algorithms were also developed. Different objective functions were implemented to obtain bids with specific market characteristics. The results from real-life activations conducted during winter 2013 on a portfolio of eight sites, including a Zebra battery, are presented.

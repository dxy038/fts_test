Mobile communication is an important class of application in multimedia. Terminals in such applications are usually subject to different motions such as tilting and jitter, translating into a global motion in the scene due to the motion of the camera. This component of motion can be extracted by appropriate methodsÂ´ detecting the global motion in the scene and can be seen as a preprocessing stage. The compression of visual information in the framework of mobile communication is discussed. The most important objective in any compression algorithm is that of compression efficiency. The mobile wireless channel is a noisy fading channel characterized by long burst of errors. Thus video coders for use on these channels, in addition to being efficient in terms of compression have to be robust to error encountered on the channel. Considering the limitations of the existing standards when used in mobile environment, this is an area of active research.

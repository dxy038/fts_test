This document focuses on the application of GeoVisualAnalytics to the public health sector. The intention is to show how to design and implement innovative geo-business intelligence methods and procedures to be used in the public health sector for decision support in analysis and planning processes. We address the specific requirements from the health care application domain including the consideration of its various stakeholders and end users. The targeted user groups mainly include smaller corporations, medical associations and the public at large. The technical objective of our research is to develop a public health sector specific GeoVisualAnalytics solution. In this paper we focus on the integration aspect of the various components. Our widget approach to address the demand for flexibility and extensibility is presented and first results of our prototype are shown.

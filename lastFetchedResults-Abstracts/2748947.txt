This is the second in a two-part series of papers on transmission order (TO) optimization in the presence of channel allocation (CA), i.e., joint optimization of the TO selection and CA problem, for interfering bidirectional wireless links. Part I of this paper thoroughly analyzes the joint optimization problem from a game theoretic perspective for a general deterministic setting. Here in Part II, we present novel distributed and centralized CA-TO algorithms, together with their performance analysis, for Device-to-Device (D2D) communications underlaying cellular networks based on the findings in Part I of this paper. Here, TO is a novel dimension for optimization. In Part II, we propose and analyze novel two distributed and one centralized joint CA-TO algorithms. Our investigations show that: i) our algorithms contain many of the existing TO algorithms and CA algorithms as its special cases and can thus be considered as a general framework for the joint CA and TO optimization. The computer simulations for TDD-based D2D communications underlaying cellular network show that the proposed distributed and centralized joint CA-TO algorithms remarkably outperform the reference algorithms.

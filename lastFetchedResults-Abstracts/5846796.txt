Highway alignment selection involves multi-objective decision-making, and it is uncertain and fuzzy. Traditional interactive highway CAD system based on geometric model and numerical calculation model cannot solve multi-objective alignment selection problem. This study introduced GIS-based spatial data mining and multi-objective intelligent evolution algorithms into highway alignment selection process, and put forward GIS-based spatial environment knowledge model, obtained environment knowledge of alignment from spatial data mining using Component Object Mode technology; constructed a multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II based alignment optimization model, which theoretically solved key technical problems during modeling process, such as genetic coding, determination of objective functions, design of genetic operators and implementation of evolution algorithms. We completed the development of intelligent highway alignment selection system on the basis of the above models, and the result showed that the final optimized plan can effectively take terrain, geology, ecology and safety into consideration, and is intelligent and pragmatic as an initial plan of interactive design.

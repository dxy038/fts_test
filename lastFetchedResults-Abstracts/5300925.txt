The objective of the work to be presented in this panel is to deal and discuss real time issues regarding the dynamic security assessment combined with the PMU (phasor measurement units) utilization. In particular, the work focuses on suitable methods for predicting the system trajectory in the multidimensional angle space and for assessing the transient stability margin in the real time for all contingencies. The classical numerical methods can be used to achieve accurate results for the CCT (critical clearing time) estimation despite they are time-consuming and not quite appropriate for real time applications. The direct methods proved to be adequate for real-time analysis since the necessary information concerning the dynamic security can be obtained without the explicit solution of the set of differential equations associated to the system

Background and Objective:  To compare the trend of increase of growth indices among infants with low birth weight and infants with normal birth weight in the first 6 months of life. 
Subjects and Methods: One hundred and thirty five low birth weight infants and 135 infants with normal birth weight were compared during a one-year study period 2009) and their demographic data included birth body weight, length and head circumference at birth, 2, 4 and 6 months of life, type of diet, birth number, sex, type of their mother's marriage and educational state were collected by a questionnaire trend of increase of growth indices among
Results: In first 6 months of life, in the LBW group the mean body weight was 5127±1076 g (p=0/001), mean body length was 17.8±3 cm (p=0.013) and mean head circumference was 9.1±1 cm (P < 0.001), which was more than group with normal birth weight. In both groups, the average body weight, length and head circumference in males was higher than females. In the LBW group, the mean body weight in infants fed with breast milk was higher than infants fed with formula milk at age of 2 months.
Conclusion: This study showed that although mean increase of growth indices in infants with low birth weight is similar to average growth state in infants with normal birth weight, but still growth of this group at end of 6 months of age is less than group with normal birth weight.

This paper deals with the suitability of using a single multi-dialectal acoustic modeling for all the Spanish variants spoken in Europe and Latin America. The objective is two fold. First, it allows to use all the available databases to jointly train and improve the same system. Second, it allows to use a single system for all the Spanish speakers. The paper describes the rule- based phonetic transcription used for each dialectal variant, the selection of the shared and the specific phonemes to be modeled in a multi-dialectal recognition system, and the results of a multi-dialectal system dealing with dialects in and out of the training set.

Reviews the European Union Research programs in the area of personal mobile telecommunication systems and their position in the context of European telecommunications research and development. The ACTS program call for proposals was launched in 1994, and proposals are to be submitted by March 1995. This program will provide a unique opportunity for organizations to participate in, and influence, the development of future global third-generation advanced personal mobile communications systems. It is hoped that projects will be actively supported by telecommunications operators, equipment manufacturers, service providers, research institutes, universities and leading-edge users. The participation of users reflects the policy that ACTS projects must be user-driven to ensure that the research and development program benefits directly the application of the technology, and ensures that the projects are responsive to user requirements. By their very nature, mobile communications markets are global, which implies that different world regions need to cooperate, particularly in the area of standards development and frequency allocations, to ensure the widespread availability of advanced and affordable wireless services and applications. National and regional borders must be transcended, interconnection of networks, and interoperability of services and applications must he encouraged, all with the objective of ensuring, through the convergence of the telecommunications, computer and audio-visual industries, the enhancement of the quality of life in the mobile information age

Objective: To investigate the association between various anthropometric indexes of obesity with
arterial hypertension in elderly from Barbados (Bridgetown) and Cuba (Havana). Design: Cross-sectional
data were extracted from the Survey on Health, Aging and Well being in Latin America and the Caribbean
(SABE). Sample Size: In Bridgetown and Havana, respectively, 1508 and 1905 subjects (≥ 60 years) were
examined, and were selected by a controlled sampling design. Measurements: The occurrence of
hypertension was assessed by self-report. Multiple measurements of adiposity were used including body
mass index (BMI ≥ 28 kg/m2), waist hip ratio (WHR = > 0.95 men; > 0.80 women), waist to height ratio
(W/ht. = > 0.50) and waist circumference - WCL (> 88 cm, women; > 102 cm, men) e WCOK (> 90.3 cm,
women; > 91.3cm, men). Binary logistic regression analyses (Odds Ratio) were used to measure strengths of
relationships. Results: In the elderly of Bridgetown, the final design (adjusted for age, education, race,
smoking, regular physical activity and diabetes) shows that, in men, WCOK and W/Ht were associated with
hypertension, and in women, WCL and WCOK were the indexes associated. In the Cuban elderly, the final
design shows that, with the exception of WHR, all indicators were associated with hypertension. WCOK and
W/ht were the indexes most strongly associated with the outcome. Conclusion: The explanatory power of
anthropometric indicators when determining the outcome differed between men and women, as well as
between cultural groups living in relative proximity (Barbadians and Cubans)

Success of two-phase anaerobic systems for primary and secondary sludge treatment has been reported based on both directly and indirectly measured volatile solids (VS) reduction, total gas and methane generation, COD reduction, etc. The objective of this research was to determine whether phase separation increases directly measured VS reduction compared to conventional anaerobic sludge digestion. Two-phase and conventional digesters were operated with sludge feeds from three sources; both 1:1 sludges (primary:waste activated, solids basis) and 100% waste activated sludges (WAS) were studied. The maximum difference between VS reductions in conventional and two-phase systems was about 8.7% with waste activated sludge. The increase in volatile solids reduction in two-phase systems with the 1:1 sludge ranged from 1.9 to 6.0% as compared to conventional systems. This relatively small increase in VS reduction may not be worth the additional cost of operating two-phase digesters at full scale.

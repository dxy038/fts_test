The main objective of this paper is the presentation of a methodology for the seismic safety assessment of low rise reinforced concrete (R.C.) buildings damaged by the Bam Earthquake. This method utilizes the characteristics of force-displacement for the lowest story level or considers the weakest story in any given building for its primary analyses. Evaluation is based on the strength and ductility parameters in two levels of earthquake motions, namely: strong earthquake and very strong earthquake. Failure mechanism for the structure is established based on the bending, shear, or shear bending modes.
In this paper, the basis of the evaluation method is explained. Then, characteristics of two damaged buildings during the Bam earthquake such as: vertical and lateral load resisting system, loading, and other parameters are presented based on the site visit in order to evaluate the vulnerability. Detail of observed damages is explained with photos. Analytical studies including nonlinear dynamic modeling and seismic evaluation of the sample buildings will be presented in the next part

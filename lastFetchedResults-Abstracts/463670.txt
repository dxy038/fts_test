OBJECTIVE: We determined the diagnostic vaue of transvaginal ultrasonography for endometrial and intrauterine abnormalities in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding.
STUDY DESIGN: Between June 1, 1992, and June 1, 1993, 279 consecutive patients underwent transvaginal ultrasonography. Findings were compared with the final diagnosis established by diagnostic hysteroscopy and histologic examination.
RESULTS: Transvaginal ultrasonography demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.96 and a specificity of 0.89. With a pretest probability (prevalence) of 0.42, this resulted in posttest probabilities of 0.03 in the case of a normal sonogram and 0.87 for an abnormal sonogram. The corresponding likelihood ratios were 0.04 and 9.09, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Transvaginal ultrasonography seems to be an effective procedure to exclude endometrial and intrauterine abnormalities. Its use could be implemented as a routine first-step procedure in patients with abnormal uterine bleeding, and it selects those in need of further diagnostic evaluation in the case of an abnormal or inconclusive sonogram

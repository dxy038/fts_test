The EMIME project aims to build a personalized speech-to-speech translator, such that spoken input of a user in one language is used to produce spoken output that still sounds like the user´s voice however in another language. This distinctiveness makes unsupervised cross-lingual speaker adaptation one key to the project´s success. So far, research has been conducted into unsupervised and cross-lingual cases separately by means of decision tree marginalization and HMM state mapping respectively. In this paper we combine the two techniques to perform unsupervised cross-lingual speaker adaptation. The performance of eight speaker adaptation systems (supervised vs. unsupervised, intra-lingual vs. cross-lingual) is compared using objective and subjective evaluations. Experimental results show the performance of unsupervised cross-lingual speaker adaptation is comparable to that of the supervised case in terms of spectrum adaptation in the EMIME scenario, even though automatically obtained transcriptions have a very high phoneme error rate.

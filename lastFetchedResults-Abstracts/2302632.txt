The objective of this study was to describe the ambient levels of particulate matter (PM) and its influence to air quality situation on the dry Mediterranean island of Cyprus. From October 2002 to August 2003 PM10 and PM2.5 samples were collected at 31 different sampling sites in Cyprus. In addition, continuous measurements of PM10 were carried out from 2003 to 2007 at a traffic and a rural site. It can be recognised that at all traffic and at some residential and urban background sites, the actual EU limit values have been exceeded. Special events e.g. long-range transport of Sahara dust storms were recorded over urban as well as rural areas in the order of 6â€“8 events per year, with a major frequency in summer and spring periods. The comparison of the PM10 concentrations in Cyprus cities with values of other European cities demonstrates the PM10 problem in Cyprus, especially in the dry summer season, when no rain is cleaning the air and the dry surfaces. This underlines the necessity of PM abatement strategies.

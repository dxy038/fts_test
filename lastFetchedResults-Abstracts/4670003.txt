A math model on planetary gear is built based on deterministic optimization method. The minimum volume of planetary gear is chosen as optimization objective. Teeth number of sun gear, face width, module and gear number are chosen as design variable. Applying Monte Carlo method robustness on the planetary gear is analyzed. Robustness analysis is included in probability distribution of objective and constraints, while design variables are considered as independently random variables of normal distribution. It is shown that planetary gear based on the deterministic optimization method is not robust when design variables show a slight variation. Precise of design variables is set up again based on the robustness analysis conclusion, and robustness on planetary gear is improved to meet design requirements.

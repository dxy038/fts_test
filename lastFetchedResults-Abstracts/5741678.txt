As demand for grid and cloud computing solutions increases, the need for user oriented software to provide access to theses resources also increases. Until recently the use of computing resources was limited to those with exceptional knowledge of the system design and configuration. With the advent of grid middleware projects this started to change allowing for new users not familiar with the complex grid infrastructure and client software to use the systems for their own research. The Cyberaide Gridshell demonstrated this by developing a user friendly interface to submit jobs to a grid. Following this theme it is our objective to create a tool that will take another step further by abstracting the creation and configuration of the infrastructure and system software away from the end-user. This will be achieved through the use of cloud resources provided by VMware virtualization and deployment via a web interface. We will show the benefits of deploying cyber infrastructures, like clusters and grids, on a cloud design by demonstrating the ease of cyber infrastructure deployment and the versatility of the systems that can be spawned on demand.

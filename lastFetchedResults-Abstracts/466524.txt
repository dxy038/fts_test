Objective: To describe the lateral attachment of the rectovaginal fascia to the pelvic sidewall. Study Design: A descriptive study was performed with use of 10 embalmed female cadaveric pelves, each sectioned in the midsagittal plane. The lateral attachments of the pubocervical fascia and the rectovaginal fascia to the pelvic sidewall were examined. Results: The rectovaginal fascia attaches to the pelvic sidewall along a well-defined line. It extends from the perineal body toward the arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis with which it converges approximately midway between the pubis and the ischial spine to form a y configuration. This point of convergence occurs an average of 4.8 cm from the ischial spine, 3.75 cm from the pubic symphysis, and 4.15 cm from the posterior fourchette. Conclusion: The rectovaginal fascia supports the posterior compartment analogous to the pubocervical fascia in the anterior compartment. Moreover, landmarks are identified that will aid suture placement during repair of posterior compartment defects. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185:41-3.)

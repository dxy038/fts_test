Grid-side converter in double fed wind power generation system is the research object of this paper. Firstly the key issues of the grid-side converter are analyzed in this paper. Based on the key issues, a new DSP-based implementation method of the grid-side converter is proposed. The mathematical model of DFIG and dq-coordinates mathematical model of grid-side converter is established in this paper. Based on the mathematical models, control strategy and objective for grid-side PWM converter is proposed. Software design of the control system is explained in detail, including overall structure, flow charts and detail problem during the process of realizing the control strategy. Simulation platform for 11 kw double feed wind power generation system is built. Experiment for grid-side converter is carried out based on the platform. Experimental result has fully proved the validity of control strategies and satisfactory control performance has been achieved. Experimental waveforms are given in the paper.

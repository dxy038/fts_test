Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine whether cell-free fetal DNA is detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid of women during pregnancy and after delivery.
Study design
Cerebrospinal fluid was collected from 39 women who underwent an indicated spinal anesthesia procedure. Twenty-six samples were from women who carried at least 1 male fetus, and 13 samples were from women with only a female fetus. DNA was analyzed with the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction for DYS-1 (which represented male fetal DNA) and β-globin (which represented maternal and fetal DNA).
Results
β-Globin DNA was detected in all cerebrospinal samples. DYS-1 gene sequences were detected in 4 cerebrospinal fluid samples from women who had male fetuses (2 samples were from women who underwent cesarean delivery of singleton pregnancies, 1 sample was from a triplet pregnancy, and 1 sample was from a woman after delivery). No male DNA was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of women who carried female fetuses.
Conclusion
Male fetal cells and/or cell-free fetal DNA is detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid of some pregnant women or some women after delivery

Any type of development such as dam construction can impose many different environmental effects due to the especial condition of local environmental components and the condition of dam establishment place. If the environmental effects do not characterized in all environmental levels, it might have many irreparable influences. Biological considerations are among the best methods to survey the environmental status of the working area and the examination of these environmental effects. The objective of this research was to study the effects of dam construction on the water quality of Taleghan River. So biological sampling of the community of macrobenthic-invertebrates was carried out via qualitative and quantitative methods at 6 sites and 3 successive seasons before and after the Dam's outlet. According to the data series of each site, the value of Hilsenhoff Index (Family Biotic Index; FBI) was obtained. The seasonal results have shown that, water quality in the study period was mostly unpolluted. But result of the closer sampling data in outlet of the Dam showed that, the FBI value reached to 4.62 and 4.95, respectively for middle and end of spring months. Decrease of this value showed that water quality fall down after May.

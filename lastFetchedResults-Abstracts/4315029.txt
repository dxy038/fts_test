An operation model is proposed in this paper for an electronic market enabled supply chain with uncertain variable costs. The supply chain consists of multi-supplier and multi-customer, suppliers can provide many kinds of product to different customers directly or through electronic market. Uncertain variable costs are described as symmetrical and limited intervals. A robust operation model for this supply chain is constructed by using the robust optimization method based on interval analysis. The operation model is a multi-objective programming problem satisfying several conflict objectives, such as meeting the demands of all customers, minimizing the total system cost, the availabilities of supplierspsila capacities not below a certain level, and robustness of decision to uncertain variable costs. The result of a numerical example proved that the solution of the model is the most conservative. However, it can ensure the robustness of the operation of the supply chain effectively.

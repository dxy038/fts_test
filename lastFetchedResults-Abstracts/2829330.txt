Available transfer capability (ATC) is the measure of transfer capacity remaining in the physical transmission network for further reliable power transfer between two areas in power system. With high penetrations of wind power integrated into the power system, the research concerning impacts of wind powerÂ´s uncertainty and intermittence on ATC has become increasingly urgent. This paper proposes a probabilistic power flow method with a correlated wind power model to evaluate the impact of high penetrations of wind power on power system ATC. The proposed probabilistic power flow model nullifies the power imbalance using a set of conventional generation through specified sharing factors. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimal power flow (MOPF) model is proposed to consider the ATC requirement in the traditional generation cost minimization optimal power flow (OPF). Finally, the proposed model and algorithm are validated by an analysis of the IEEE 39-bus system.

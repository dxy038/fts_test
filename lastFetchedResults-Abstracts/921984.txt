Abstract

Objective
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the etiology and frequency of neonatal seizure in hospitalized neonates.

Materials and Methods
In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, we evaluated 1295 neonates with seizures admitted to neonatal and NICU wards in our center. Data was collected on age, sex, birth weight, serum levels of calcium, glucose, and sodium, CT scan findings, history of maternal opium abuse, blood and cerebrospinal fluid culture, and analyzed using SPSS 13.

Results
Of a total of 1295 patients, 34 (2.62%) had seizure. Mean age was 14.03 Â± 10.05 days (range, 1 to 29 days); twenty-five (73.5%) neonates were boys and 9 (26.5%) were girls. Of 34 neonates with neonatal seizures, 12 (35.3%), 11 (32.4%), 9 (26.5%), 7 (20.6%), and 3 (8.8%) had hypocalcemia, asphyxia, hypoglycemia, intracranial hemorrhage, and hypernatremia, respectively.

Maternal addiction, meningitis, and sepsis were found in 3 (8.8%), 1 (2.9%) and 1 (2.9%) of neonates, respectively.

Conclusion
The incidence rate of neonatal seizure in the neonates in our NICU and neonatal ward was 2.62%. Common causes of seizure in this study included hypocalcemia, asphyxia, hypoglycemia, intracranial hemorrhage, and hypernatremia. Maternal ddiction, meningitis and sepsis had the lowest prevalence.

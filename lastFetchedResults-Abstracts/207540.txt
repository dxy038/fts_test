This article examines how education could support
the formation and establishment of identities. It
focuses on museum education and in particular
artist interrogations of museum narratives. These
interventions into museum pedagogy are critical
reworkings of the presentation of cultural histories
in dominant narratives. The aim of this research is
to examine the consequences of these interventions
for pedagogy in the museum site, when
linear narratives are subject to reconstruction by
individual agencies. The complexities of museum
pedagogy are revealed and analysed in order to
identify models of teaching and learning that are
inclusive. The work of Fred Wilson, artist and curator
of an installation project at the Maryland
Historical Society in Baltimore, USA, is applied to
explore notions of cultural capital and cultural
empowerment through education in the museum.
Throughout the article is concerned with investigating
how the individual subject is formed and
informed through the narrative. Analogies are
drawn with the view that the curriculum may
not be a neutral and objective selection of knowledge
and that in the same way it is worth
investigating this claim to enquire whether institutional
presentations of history are equally
subjective. If museum education projects are set
by curators and education officers to meet certain
curriculum requirements then there must be questions
raised about the structure of narratives and
the process by which they are disseminated. This
article is an exploration of these actions with farreaching
applications, to ascertain whether they
can successfully promote social justice in education
and empower the individual or whether they
serve to polarize essentialism and multiculturalism.

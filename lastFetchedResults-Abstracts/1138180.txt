The objective of this paper is to propose a novel press system with six links for precision deep drawing, and verify its feasibility. First, the system is presented and its advantages are discussed. Then, the kinematic analysis of the system is obtained by examining the geometry of the design. Moreover, kinematic dimensions of the variable coupling are found by using optimization method. Furthermore, the proposed approach is illustrated by a design example, its solid model for the proposed design is established, and then kinematic simulation is performed by ADAMS software. Finally, a prototype and an experimental setup are established, and the experiment is conducted. The results show that the proposed new mechanism is feasible and of reasonable accuracy. In addition, it has the advantages of easy manufacture, lower cost, higher precision, and easy adjustability.

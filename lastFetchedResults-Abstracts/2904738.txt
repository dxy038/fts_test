In this paper, while considering the impact of antenna correlation and the interference from neighboring users, we study the problem of channel estimation and training sequence design in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) two-way relaying (TWR) systems. To this end, we propose to decompose the bidirectional transmission links into two phases, i.e., the multiple access (MAC) and the broadcast (BC) phases. By deriving the optimal linear minimum mean-square-error estimators, the corresponding training design problems for the MAC and BC phases are formulated and solved. Subsequently, algorithms and, in some special cases, closed-form solutions for obtaining the optimal training sequences for channel estimation in TWR systems are derived. Moreover, to further reduce channel estimation overhead, the minimum required length of the training sequences are determined. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed training designs in improving channel estimation performance in TWR systems.

Based solely on the personal criteria and experience of the staff, the environmental authorities in Mexico decide if any proposed productive project requires an environmental impact study. If the staff requires one, it can be assigned at three different levels: general, intermediate, and specific. The differences in time and cost to develop each level of study are large. There is no quantitative tool in Mexico to support, with objective criteria, the decisions of the environmental authority staff. Therefore, final decision is subjected to multiple pressures and interpretations. We propose a new quantitative method to support, objectively, the decision of the environmental authorities. The method is based on ecological criteria with a quantitative scale, and it is directed toward harbor and port projects. Supported by this method, the environmental authorities in Mexico can accurately determine if a new project requires an environmental impact study. If the project requires one, the method determines the level required. This method can be easily adapted to any other productive activity, and to any other country.

Our objective is to study the design and layout of production lines in which a single product in high volume or a family of similar products are to be assembled. A particular robust configuration is used to arrange the workstations in circular form. The advantages of this arrangement are described and some of the combinatorial phenomena that occur are discussed. The performance of such circular assembly lines is analysed by means of a simulator

In this paper, wavelet based speech enhancement is considered. In this method, the noisy signal transfers to the wavelet domain. Then, by applying a thresholding algorithm, the wavelet coefficients can be improved. Finally, using the inverse wavelet transform, the enhanced signal can be obtained. We have presented a new method for the thresholding algorithm. We compared our algorithm with some of the most popular methods by several experimental tests. Both subjective and objective tests show better performance and achievement.

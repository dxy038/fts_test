Awkward arrangement of documents in an HTML tree can discourage users from staying at a Web site. The authors have developed an algorithm for dynamically altering the organization of pages at sites where the main design objective is to give users fast access to requested data. The algorithm reads information from the HTTP log file and computes the relative popularity of pages within the site. Based on popularity (defined as a relationship between number of accesses, time spent, and location of the page), the hierarchical relationships between pages are rearranged to maximize accessibility for popular pages

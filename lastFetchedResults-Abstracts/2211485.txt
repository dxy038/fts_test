Background and Objective: Emphasizing on technology progress and growth in medical sciences on cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, unfortunately, the survival rate of patients and the resuscitation outcomes are still poor. Accordingly, it seems that education for nursing promotion in emergency department is paramount importance. Thus, the present study was conducted on evaluating the effect of competency-based-Training program on resuscitation outcomes.
Material and Methods: This pre-experimental study was carried out in medical-training hospitals of Golestan University of Medical Sciences, 2011. The nurses selected via convenience sampling were allocated to case (n=15) and control group (n=15). The instruments were the forms of registration and report of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. Competency-based-Training program was conducted for case group. The data recorded in before program and after four months was analyzed by SPSS16 software, using descriptive (Frequency, mean, standard deviation) and inferential statistics (Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, Chi-square).
Results: The short and long term resuscitation outcomes in case group were increased from  8.8% and 4.6% to 20% and 15.6%, respectively.  wilcoxon test showed that the difference was significant (p=0.001).Also, Mann-Whitney test revealed that  the difference between short and long term resuscitation outcomes was  significant between two groups following 4-months (P=0.03).
Conclusion: Based on the results ,  competency-based-Training program  can be effective in short and long term resuscitation outcomes. Hence,  it is recommended that this program be performed   to upgrade nursing level.

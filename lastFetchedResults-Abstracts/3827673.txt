A multihop, wavelength division multiplex (WDM) based network, BanyanNet, is proposed for the realization of terabit lightwave networks, BanyanNet can he considered as a the bidirectional equivalent of the popular ShuffleNet. Exploiting its representation, we developed a fast, decentralized, bidirectional routing algorithm for BanyanNet. The performance of BanyanNet is compared to that of the ShuffleNet and bilayered ShuffleNet. For N=p<sup>m</sup>&#215;k networks, the p=2 BanyanNet provides better performance in channel efficiency, total and user throughput than the corresponding ShuffleNet, and offers more flexible network configurations than the bilayered and p=4 ShuffleNet

Objective To estimate work loss days due to absenteeism
and presenteeism associated with commonly occurring
mental and physical disorders.
Methods In a nationally representative face-to-face survey
(Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2)
including 4,715 workers, the presence of 13 mental and 10
chronic physical disorders was assessed using the Composite
International Diagnostic Interview 3.0 and a physical
disorder checklist. Questions about absent days due to illness
and days of reduced quantitative and qualitative
functioning while at work were based on the WHO Disability
Assessment Schedule. Total work loss days were
defined as the sum of the days of these three types of loss,
where days of reduced functioning were counted as half.
Both individual and population-level effects of disorders on
work loss were studied, taking comorbidity into account.
Results Any mental disorder was associated with 10.5
additional absent days, 8.0 days of reduced-qualitative
functioning and 12.0 total work loss days. For any physical
disorder, the number of days was 10.7, 3.5 and 11.3,
respectively. Adjusted for comorbidity, drug abuse, bipolar
disorder, major depression, digestive disorders and panic
disorder were associated with the highest number of
additional total work loss days. At population-level, major
depression, chronic back pain, respiratory disorders, drug
abuse and digestive disorders contributed the most. Annual
total work loss costs per million workers were estimated at
€360 million for any mental disorder; and €706 million for
any physical disorder.
Conclusions Policies designed to lessen the impact of
commonly occurring disorders on workers will contribute
to a reduction in absenteeism and presenteeism. As the
indirect costs of (mental) disorders are much higher than
their medical costs, prevention and treatment of these
conditions may be cost-effective

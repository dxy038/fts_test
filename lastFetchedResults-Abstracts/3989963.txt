Most event-triggered controllers available nowadays are based on static state-feedback controllers. As in many control applications full state measurements are not available for feedback, it is the objective of this paper to propose event-triggered dynamical output-based controllers. The fact that the controller is based on output feedback instead of state feedback does not allow for straightforward extensions of existing event-triggering mechanisms if a minimum time between two subsequent events has to be guaranteed. Furthermore, since sensor and actuator nodes can be physically distributed, centralized event-triggering mechanisms are often prohibitive and, therefore, we will propose a decentralized event-triggering mechanism. This event-triggering mechanism invokes transmission of the outputs in a node when the difference between the current values of the outputs in the node and their previously transmitted values becomes &#8220;large&#8221; compared to the current values and an additional threshold. For such event-triggering mechanisms, we will study closed-loop stability and <i>L</i><sub>&#8734;</sub>-performance and provide bounds on the minimum time between two subsequent events generated by each node, the so-called inter-event time of a node. This enables us to make tradeoffs between closed-loop performance on the one hand and communication load on the other hand, or even between the communication load of individual nodes. In addition, we will model the event-triggered control system using an impulsive model, which truly describes the behavior of the event-triggered control system. As a result, we will be able to guarantee stability and performance for event-triggered controllers with larger minimum inter-event times than the existing results in the literature. We illustrate the developed theory using three numerical examples.

Although deaths from tuberculosis (TB) are increasing, TB-related sudden death (TBRSD) is rarely reported in the literature. We present a case report of fatal pulmonary TB with extrapulmonary extension in a patient infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a review of published reports of TBRSD in MEDLINE (1966 to October 2000). Forty-six cases of TBRSD were reported. The most common cause of TBRSD was tuberculous bronchopneumonia in 30 (64%) patients, followed by hemoptysis in 14 (30%) patients. Tuberculous myocarditis and isolated TB of the adrenal glands are seldom causes of TBRSD. The early detection of TB, use of directly observed therapy, and individualization of treatment can be helpful in decreasing the incidence of TBRSD. (Heart LungÂ® 2001;30:388-91.)

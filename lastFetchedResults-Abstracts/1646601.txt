Semi-active systems are attractive for structural control applications because they offer some of the best features of both passive and active systems. This paper examines a passive tuned liquid column damper which is converted into a variable-damping semi-active system. Different semi-active algorithms based on the clipped-optimal and fuzzy control strategies are studied using numerical examples. The main objective of this paper is to study the effectiveness of different control algorithms for semi-active tuned liquid dampers for structural control applications.

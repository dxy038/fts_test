Material procurement is the very first link in the course of construction project, which relates to project cost, quality, and time limit and so on. Therefore, the selection of supplier is particularly important. In this paper, a two-stage model of supplier selection in project has been constructed by rough set and multi-objective liner programming based approach. The application of rough set based multi-attribute decision making can overcome the impact of prior information and preferences of decision maker to evaluate supplier objectively, and simplify the complexity of the evaluation through attribution reduction. Multi-objective liner programming model can uses the preference weight of each objective of decision maker resulting in choosing the best supplier and deciding optimal order quantity.

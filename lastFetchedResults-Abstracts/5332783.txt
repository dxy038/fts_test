In this paper, the structure and performance of basic bidirectional associative memory (BAM) are examined and a BAM model with robust EBP (error backpropagation) algorithm (BAM-EBP) is proposed. In the BAM-EBP model, hidden layers are introduced in the net structure and an improved EBP algorithm is applied. The simulation of the basic BAM and BAM-EBP models in application to fault diagnosis for a control system and the comparison between the two models are carried out. The analysis and results show that both models were effective, but the BAM-EBP has better performance especially in fault tolerance, storage capacity, application adaptability. Future efforts on the theory exploration and application issues are addressed

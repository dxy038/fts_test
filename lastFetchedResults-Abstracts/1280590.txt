Previous work demonstrated that feeding commercial preparations of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) [a 50:50 mixture of c9,t11 and t10,c12 CLA (cCLA)] partially overcame lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced growth depression. The objective of this study was to determine which CLA isomer was responsible for the reduction of LPS-induced growth depression. Dietary cCLA supplementation for 3 weeks protected mice from LPS-induced weight loss 24 h after injection compared to mice fed isocaloric and isonitrogenous control diets supplemented with either corn oil (CO) or a mixture of CO and olive oil. Dietary c9,t11 or t10,c12 CLA led to body weight loss intermediate to controls and cCLA. After LPS-induced weight loss, the t10,c12 CLA fed mice regained weight faster than the control or c9,t11 CLA fed mice. Dietary t10,c12 CLA and cCLA reduced plasma tumor necrosis factor 2 h after LPS stimulation. While neither c9,t11 nor t10,c12 CLA isomers alone protected from immune-induced weight loss, the t10,c12 CLA isomer induced compensatory gain.

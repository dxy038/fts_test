The objective of this article is to improve the performance of thermally powered adsorption/cooling systems by selecting a new adsorbent/refrigerant pair. Adsorption equilibrium data of R134a onto granular activated carbon (AC) and Unitika activated carbon fiber (ACF) of type (A-20) have been measured experimentally using Rubotherm ISOSORP 2000 within evaporation temperatures range between −20 and 40 °C and adsorption temperatures range from 30 to 80 °C. Experimental data have been correlated using various popular isotherm models. The isosteric heat of adsorption of the assorted adsorbent/refrigerant pairs has also been extracted from the present experimental data.

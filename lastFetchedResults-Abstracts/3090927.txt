This paper presents an optimum design procedure of linear motors to reduce the weight of the machines with the constraints of thrust and detent force using response surface methodology (RSM). RSM is well adopted to make the analytical model of the minimum weight with constraints of thrust and detent force, and it enables objective functions to be easily created, and a great deal of computation time can be saved. Therefore, The usefulness of this method is verified through the comparison of the performances of the optimal model and those of the initial model.

Algorithm of retrieving the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) from transient temperature measurements is presented. The unknown distributions of two types of boundary conditions: the temperature and heat flux are parameterized using a small number of user defined functions. The solutions of the direct heat conduction problems with known boundary temperature and flux are expressed as a superposition of auxiliary temperature fields multiplied by unknown parameters. Inverse problem is formulated as a least squares fit of calculated and measured temperatures and is cast in a form of a sum of two objective functions. The first results originates from an inverse problem for retrieving the boundary temperature the second comes from the inverse problem for reproducing the boundary heat flux. The final form of the objective function is obtained by enforcing constant in time value of the heat transfer coefficient. This approach leads to substantial regularization of the results, when compared with the standard technique, where HTC is calculated from separately reconstructed temperature and heat flux on the boundary. The validation of the numerical procedure is carried out by reconstructing a known distribution of the HTC using simulated measurements laden by stochastic error. The proposed approach is also used to reconstruct the distribution of the HTC in a physical experiment of heating a cylindrical sample using an impinging jet.

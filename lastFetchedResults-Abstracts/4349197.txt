The ISO/IEC Standard Committee has adopted a packet format known as the transport stream (TS) for sending MPEG-2 encoded data over communication networks. During the past year the ATM Forum established a sub-working group to examine issues connected with the transmission of MPEG-2 TS packets over ATM networks. The objective of this paper is to summarize the present state of this work and also to point out the design issues that had to be resolved. In particular we describe the issues of MPEG-2 system clock recovery in the presence of network jitter and encapsulation of TS packets in AAL5 PDUs.

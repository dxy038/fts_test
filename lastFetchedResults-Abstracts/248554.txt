A new approach to process optimal design in non-isothermal, non-steady-state metal forming is presented.
In this approach, the optimal design problem is formulated on the basis of the integrated thermo-mechanical
Ãžnite element process model so as to cover diverse objective functions and design variables, and a derivativebased
approach is adopted for conducting optimization. The process model, the formulation for process
optimal design, and the schemes for the evaluation of the design sensitivity, and an iterative procedure for
optimization are described in detail. The validity of the schemes for the evaluation of the design sensitivity is
examined by performing a series of numerical tests. The capability of the proposed approach to deal with
diverse process parameters and objective functions is demonstrated through applications to some selected
process design problems.

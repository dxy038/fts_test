Compliance with oncoming emission directives demands a great effort from researchers on the development of effective procedures and tools to cope with the technological exigencies. The first aim of this work focuses on the development of methodologies and tools related to the combustion characterisation in turbocharged diesel engines with EGR systems during transient operation by combining experimental data and calculation models. The final objective is to obtain a phenomenological combustion simulation during transient operation worthwhile to be used in 1-D gas dynamic codes.

The work is divided into two parts. This first part provides a description of the full-load transient test at constant engine speed and tackles the measurement and post-processing of the main instantaneous magnitudes defining the engine transient behaviour. Information regarding devices for measuring during transient operation is provided. Every recorded magnitude is subjected to its specific post-processing according to physical phenomena affecting the measurement in order to reach the synchronisation among all the signals. This thorough analysis configures a compact procedure incorporated as a subroutine into a computational code. Resulting data serve as the input data of a combustion diagnostic code that provides the rate of heat release (RoHR) for every engine cycle of the transient process.

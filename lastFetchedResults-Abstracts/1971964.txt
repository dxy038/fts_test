Literature indicates a need for a user-friendly food quality management system (FQMS) customized to the requirements of food small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for improving product and process quality and enhancing customer satisfaction. Application of quality management system within discreet and process industries is evident. However, there are limited studies that focused on the implementation of a quality management system (QMS) among SMEs operating in the food sector. This study explains the results of a feasibility study on FQMS among European Food SMEs. The objective of this study is to diagnose the status of the FQMS, and to find out what motivates and hinders the successful implementation of FQMS in SMEs. The findings show that none of the food SMEs involved in this study implements FQMS in its true form. The size of the company is a significant factor with respect to quality management implementation, as medium-sized companies were more mature in FQMS implementation compared to their small and micro counterparts. The confectionery, chocolate and meat sectors are more advanced than bakery, packaged fruits and vegetables sectors, with respect to the implementation of quality management tools and techniques. The study revealed that the most important benefits of a quality management system were reduction in cost of production and increased productivity. The key barrier to implementation of FQMS was “lack of knowledge and training” among food SMEs.

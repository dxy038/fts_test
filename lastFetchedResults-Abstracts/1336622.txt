Design has progressed on the vacuum vessel, FW/blanket and Divertor for the Reduced Technical Objective/Reduced Cost (RTO/RC) ITER. The basic functions and structures are the same as for the 1998 ITER design [K. Ioki et al., J. Nucl. Mater. 258–263 (1998) 74]. Design and fabrication methods of the components have been improved to achieve ∼50% reduction of the construction cost. Detailed blanket module designs with flat separable FW panels have been developed to reduce the fabrication cost and the future radioactive waste. Most of the R&amp;D performed so far during the Engineering Design Activities (EDAs) are still applicable. Further cost reduction methods are also being investigated and additional R&amp;D is being performed.

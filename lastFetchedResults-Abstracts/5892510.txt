This paper presents a software framework of smart management systems of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging services. The proposed management system aims at the economic operation of a micro grid-like public charging facility with multiple on-site renewable energy generations (e.g, rooftop photovoltaic panels). The overall objective is to maximize the charging facilityÂ´s net revenue by optimizing the day-ahead energy schedule and by controlling the real-time PEV charging process. The user-friendly graphical interface is developed to facilitate the information-directed operations for the charging facility operator. The proposed system can be extended and tailored to economic operations of other microgrid-like systems.

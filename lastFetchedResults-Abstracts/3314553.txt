BACKGROUND: There is a large body of literature on research about fault management in grid computing. Despite being a well-established research area, there are no systematic studies focusing on characterizing the sorts of research that have been conducted, identifying well-explored topics as well as opportunities for further research. OBJECTIVE: This study aims at surveying the existing research on fault management in grid computing in order to identify useful approaches and opportunities for future research. METHOD: We conducted a systematic mapping study to collect, classify and analyze the research literature on fault management in grid computing indexed by the main search engines in the field. RESULTS: Our study selected and classified 257 scientific papers and was able to answer five research questions regarding the distribution of the scientific production over the time and space. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the selected studies focus on fault tolerance, with very few efforts towards fault prevention, prediction and removal.

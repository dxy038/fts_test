Abstract
Objective: The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the Stress Appraisal Measure-Revised (SAM-R, Rowley, Roesch, Jurica & Vaughn, 2005) among Iranian university students. Method: A total of 300 university students (138 male, 162 female) completed the SAM-R, the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire (AEQ, Pekrun, Goetz & Perry, 2005) and the Academic Self-Efficacy Beliefs Questionnaire (ASEBQ, Zajacova, Lynch & Espenshade, 2005). The exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis methods and internal consistency were used to compute the SAM-R's factorial validity and reliability, respectively. Additionally, to examine the construct validity of the SAM-R, the correlation between different dimensions of SAM-R with positive and negative achievement emotions and academic self-efficacy beliefs were assessed. Results: The results of principal component analysis (PC) and varimax rotation replicated three-factor structure of the threat, challenge and resources in our study sample. Goodness-of-fit indices of confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the three extracted factors. The correlation analyses between different dimensions of SAM-R with positive and negative achievement emotions and the total score of academic self-efficacy provided initial evidence for the SAM-R convergent validity. Internal consistency for the threat, challenge and resources dimensions was 0.88, 0.82 and 0.79, respectively. Conclusion: Taken together, our findings provide evidence for the validity and reliability of the SAM-R as an instrument for cognitive appraisal among Iranian university students.

The radial primary distribution feeder capacitor size and location optimization conducts calculations with the objective to minimize the total cost. It also provides a solution regarding the capacitor size and its location. On this purpose we use EDSA Technical 2000 program for an example primary distribution feeder from a radial distribution system. The paper presents also the results of EDSA Technical program performing calculations for a distribution system load flow. On the other hand, the installation of a capacitor requires an investment cost. Therefore, a compromise should be made in order to determine the size and the location of a capacitor on the primary distribution feeder. The objective of simulation is to minimize the total cost of the substation KVA charge, of energy loss cost and of capacitor investment.

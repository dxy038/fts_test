The objective of this paper is to define and categorize health information in order to build a systematic scheme for managing this type of information. To achieve this, health information is approached through answering the question: What is personal information? As a result, health information is classified into different types according to its proprietor (the subject of the personal information). The health-information categorizations are utilized to personally manage health information where the user is actively involved in the recordkeeping and associated transactions of his/her health information. An experimental tool called MYHEALTH is implemented to utilize the system.

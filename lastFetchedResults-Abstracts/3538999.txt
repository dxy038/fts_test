The Rayleigh-Schroedinger power expansion of perturbed eigenvalues is used to determine propagation constants in wall-impedance waveguides, the final objective being a design procedure for trunk-communication waveguides. Examples of applications, where corrections up to the fifth order are accounted for, include ideal helix waveguides and thickly dielectric-lined circular waveguides.

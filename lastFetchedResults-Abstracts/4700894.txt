Summary form only given. There have been papers indicating that the maximal ratio combiner device can result in energy savings in wireless ad hoc networks by using hitch-hiking. We study the min-energy broadcast with hitch-hiking problem, an idealized version of broadcast using hitch-hiking, a problem studied experimentally in the INFOCOM 2004 paper of Agarwal et al. min-energy broadcast with hitch-hiking captures the maximum savings one can achieve in broadcasting using maximal ratio combiners. We show that the optimum of the classical min-energy broadcast problem is at most O(log<sup>2</sup> n) times the optimum of min-energy broadcast with hitch-hiking, where n is the number of nodes in the networks. We show that this bound is tight up to a constant. Moreover, the same bounds hold for Unicast. In the special case when the nodes are on a line and the power requirement for node u to reach node v is d(u, v)<sup>K</sup>, where d(u, v) the Euclidean distance between u and v and k is the signal attenuation exponent, which is assumed to be in between 2 and 5, we show that the optimum of the min-energy broadcast problem is at most a constant times optimum of min-energy broadcast with hitch-hiking. A formal definition of min-energy broadcast with hitch-hiking is given below. The input consists of a complete directed graph G = (V, E) with power requirement function c : E rarr R<sup>+ </sup>, and a source s epsi V. The output consists of a permutation tau =&lt; v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, ..., v <sub>n</sub> &gt; of V with v<sub>n</sub> = s and power assignment p(v) of every vertex v. For every 1 les i les i &lt; j les n, define q(v<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>j </sub>) = p(v<sub>i</sub>)/c(v<sub>i</sub>)<sub>j</sub>). An output is feasible if for every j &gt; 1 we have Sigma<sub>i = 1</sub> <sup>j - 1 </sup> q(v<sub>i</sub>v<sub>j</sub>) ges 1. The objective is to minimize Sigma<sub>i = 1</sub> <sup>n</sup> p(v<sub>i</sub>)

The objective of this paper is to discuss the position sensor correction methods for PMSM servo system, and both the software method and the hardware method are considered. The position sensor is a key equipment in the servo system and its effects on the vector control and the overall performance of servo system are introduced first. Then the software method and the hardware method to correct the position sensor with zero position are investigated respectively, and the performances under two methods are compared. The results show that both methods are effective to eliminate the rotor position error. Finally, a prototype with incremental encoder position sensor is developed and the results validate the analysis in this paper.

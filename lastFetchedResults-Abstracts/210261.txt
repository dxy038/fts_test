Background: Despite being the largest rotator cuff tendon of the shoulder, the function and clinical
relevance of subscapularis pathology has been largely ignored in the literature. Although more recent studies
have focused on subscapularis tears, all have reported on techniques of open repair. The advent of arthroscopy
and arthroscopic repair techniques has opened new frontiers in the diagnosis and repair of tom rotator cuff
tendons, including the subscapularis. In this article, we review the short-term results of arthroscopic
subscapularis repair.
Methods: Ten patients with subscapularis tendon tear of the rotator cuff were analyzed in 8 men and 2
women with an average age of 49.7 years who had an average delay in treatment of 23.5 months. The clinical
outcome, including the UCLA score was assessed prospectively for all patients with 3 month intervals.
Results: The score for pain improved from 1.75 to 9 points (p<0.001): and the UCLA score, from 8.8 to
30.6 points (p<0.001). Four patients had 12 and six had 6 months offollow-up.
Conclusions: Arthroscopic repair of subscapularis tendon tear resulted in significant subjective and
objective improvement and high patient satisfaction.

A description is given of a project whose objective is to specify and construct a pilot metropolitan area network based on fiber distributed data interface (FDDI). The testing phase began in May 1989 and the full pilot network consisting of four class-A stations was operational in July. FDDI has been chosen because there is an immediate need for connecting local area networks (LANs) together and distributed queue dual bus (DQDB) is not available yet. The pilot network is a 34 km long dual network using single mode fiber and single mode to multimode (SM/MM) converters. Currently the network consists of four Ethernet to FDDI bridges. The goal is to develop testing and measurement methodology for FDDI based networks

High-efficiency light absorbing and emitting nano-structures are important for a large range of opto-electronics device and systems applications, ranging from solar cells and light detectors to advanced light emitter-based applications. This work focuses on the subject of novel semiconductor quantum-dot-based plasmonic nano-particles. They have attracted significant attention recently as key building blocks for numerous nonlinear optical applications. The objective of this research is to develop computational modeling and simulation tools to analyze and optimize such plasmonic quantum dot (PQD) nano-structures. It includes computational predictions of the fields within the quantum dot/dielectric shell/metallic nano-shell structures, investigation of multi-scale and multi-physics phenomena, and further optimization of such structures over a broad parameter space.

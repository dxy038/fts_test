The objective of our study was to develop dynamic collaboration between a human and a robot. Most conventional studies have created pre-designed rule-based collaboration systems to determine the timing and behavior of robots to participate in tasks. Our aim is to introduce the confidence of the task as a criterion for robots to determine their timing and behavior. In this paper, we report the effectiveness of applying reproduction accuracy as a measure for quantitatively evaluating confidence in an object arrangement task. Our method is comprised of three phases. First, we obtain human-robot interaction data through the Wizard of OZ method. Second, the obtained data are trained using a neuro-dynamical system, namely, the Multiple Time-scales Recurrent Neural Network (MTRNN). Finally, the prediction error in MTRNN is applied as a confidence measure to determine the robotÂ´s behavior. The robot participated in the task when its confidence was high, while it just observed when its confidence was low. Training data were acquired using an actual robot platform, Hiro. The method was evaluated using a robot simulator. The results revealed that motion trajectories could be precisely reproduced with a high degree of confidence, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method.

Leg disorders in broilers are important welfare and economic issues for the poultry industry. Common problems are tibial dyschondroplasia, angular bone deformities, i.e. lateral or medial deviation of the distal tibia or proximal metatarsus, and rickets. Although many of the problems can be reduced or eliminated by slower growth rate, this does not necessarily mean that rapid growth and heavy birds will result in leg disorders, as these problems are today generally more related to interactions between genetic, management and nutritional factors. The objective of the current paper is to provide an overview of nutritional factors that influence leg abnormalities in broiler chickens. Deficiencies and excesses of vitamins, minerals and minor nutrients may affect leg health. Nutrients of major concern are Vitamin D, calcium and phosphorus. Other vitamins, such as A, E, C, folacin and several B-vitamins are also of importance. Further, a number of minor elements, which have been shown to influence leg disorders, either in the field or under experimental conditions, are reviewed. Complex interactions between various nutrients may further complicate formulation of broiler diets for optimal leg health.

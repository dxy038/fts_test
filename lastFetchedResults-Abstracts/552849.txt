The SEE COAST concept is designed with the objective to characterize extrasolar planets and possibly Super Earths via spectro-polarimetric imaging in reflected light. A space mission complementary to ground-based near IR planet finders is a first secure step towards the characterization of planets with mass and atmosphere comparable to that of the Earth. The accessibility to the Visible spectrum is unique and with important scientific returns.

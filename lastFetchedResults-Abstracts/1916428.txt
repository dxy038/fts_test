BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Transhiatal esophagectomy with cervical esophaghogastric anastomosis is the most common surgical method for treatment of esophageal cancer. Leakage and stricture is more frequent compilations of this method. Some studies suggest more benefit of linear stapled anastomosis than Sewn anastomosis. Due to the fact that this approach has been very limited in Iran, The aim of this study was to evaluate results of three linear stapled esophagogastrostomy.
CASES: First patient was a 77 year old man who underwent anastomosis using linear stapler because of esophageal cancer and was discharged after 12 days without any complication. The second patient was an 81 years old man with complaint of dysphagia and esophageal cancer diagnosis underwent the same surgery and was discharged 13 days after surgery without any complication. Third one was a 73 year old woman who underwent an operation after four chemotherapy sessions that were discharged from hospital 18 days after surgery without complications.
CONCLUSION: Results of this study provide more advantages and fewer side effects of linear stapled anastomosis than the manual method. However, case-control studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis

The Rapid Prototyping of Application Specific Signal Processors (RASSP) program is an Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)/Tri-Service project which entered a full-scale development program in August 1993. RASSP is a Technology Thrust 7-&#8220;Technology for Affordability&#8221;-initiative. The objective of the program is to provide drastic improvements in productivity for signal processor development and commensurate improvements in quality, performance, reliability, maintainability, and cost. The RASSP methodology, tools and infrastructure are applicable to other types of electronic design in addition to signal processor development. However, signal processing was chosen as the focus area based on criticality to most sensor systems. This paper deals with the Martin Marietta prime implementation program. The focus is on the enterprise integration environment and interface to manufacturing-which provide the base infrastructure for multidiscipline-concurrent engineering. Discussion of key methodology concepts and the model-year architecture approach, which are key enablers for the 4&#215; productivity improvement, are also included

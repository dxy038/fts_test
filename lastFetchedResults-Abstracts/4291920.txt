According to the characteristics of aero-engine´s accelerating process, the control parameters and constraints are determined for the optimal acceleration control. A non-linear programming model is established to the optimal acceleration control for a certain turbofan engine, which high pressure rotor speed and high pressure turbine inlet temperature, are as the objective function of accelerating control. From two factors, increasing the diversity of particle swarm and accelerating the convergence speed, the particle swarm algorithm has been modified. By judging the particle properties, the particle swarm algorithm has be expanded from the feasible region to the entire solution space. The optimization simulation of control laws is performed using the modified particle swarm optimization for a turbofan engine´s accelerating process. Results show that the algorithm has a strong border search capability and the engine´s accelerating abilty has been enhanced.

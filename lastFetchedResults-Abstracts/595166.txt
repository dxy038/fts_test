Objective: To study the effects of fluoxetinean antidepressant drug on courtship behaviour of Drosophila melanogaster.Material and Methods: Larval and adult feeding methods were used for administration of the drug. LC50 of fluoxetine for these two protocols were estimated, then, three sub lethal concentrations (0.02, 0.04 and 0.06% for larval feeding and 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6% of fluoxetine for adult feeding method) were administered. Following combinations of crosses (control, male, female and both treated groups) in parents were made for observing the effect of antidepressant drug on the courtship behavioural elements such as, courtship latency, matting latency and copulation duration. The F1 and F2 progeny obtained from inbreeding of the above combinations were also used for observation.Results: Courtship latency, matting latency and copulation duration were increased in all treated batches of parents for both larval and adult feeding methods. In larval feeding for treated batches, ANOVA (F value) of Courtship Latency was 19.055 & 1.863; of Mating latency was 0.644 & 0.174 and Copulation Duration was 1.145 & 7.135 for parents and F1 generation respectively.In Adult feeding for treated batches, ANOVA (F value) of Courtship Latency was 4.804 & 18.593; Mating Latency was 0.353 & 8.459 and Copulation Duration was 5.362 & 0.711 for parents and F1 generation respectively.Conclusion: The courtship behaviours are affected by treatment of Fluoxetine; however the drug has no effect on courtship in most of groups and treatments of F1 and F2 progeny.

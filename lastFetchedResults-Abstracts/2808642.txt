Bidirectional Z-source inverter can be applied to the main line traction services which give the same performance as voltage source inverters. This paper investigates the amount of energy that is fed into the electric traction system by the Z-source inverter fed locomotives. The speed control method adopted is variable voltage variable frequency in the constant torque region and field weakening in the constant power mode. The simulation analysis shows that the current fed back during regenerative braking is very near to the value obtained by calculation. Regenerated power obtained is also at par with the calculated value.

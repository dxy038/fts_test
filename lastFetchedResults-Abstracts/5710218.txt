This paper presents weapon target assignment (WTA) algorithms for space-based interceptors in boost phase defense of ICBMs. The objective is to develop effective (including both solution optimality and computation efficiency) algorithms for the large-scale, many weapon on many target assignment problem. Both static and dynamic WTA problems are considered. We first develop an Iterative LInear NEtwork programming algorithm (ILINE) for static WTA problems by combining the features from a greedy heuristic algorithm, the Maximum Marginal Return algorithm (MMR), and a near optimal algorithm, the Nonlinear Network Flow algorithm (NNF). An Open Loop Feedback algorithm (OLFB) is then developed to tackle a dynamic WTA problem where the defense has complete knowledge of the current state of the attack and no knowledge of the future. The key ingredient of this algorithm is the iterative use of a static WTA algorithm in conjunction with a minimum marginal gain threshold to allocate interceptors over time. ILINE, NNF and MMR are evaluated not only against static problems but also through their respective application in OLFB to dynamic problems. Results show that ILINE is a quite competitive algorithm in terms of solution quality and computation time for large-scale WTA problems.

This paper addresses the job shop scheduling problem with the due date-based objectives including the tardy rate, mean tardiness, and the maximum tardiness. The focused approach is dispatching rules. Sixteen dispatching rules are selected from the literature and used as the benchmarks. Their features and design concepts are also discussed. Then a dispatching rule is proposed with the goal as achieving good and balanced performance when more than one objective is concerned at the same time. The experimental results verified its superiority, especially on the tardy rate and mean tardiness

Summary form only given. The results of experiments carried out on a small plasma focus device (DPF-2.2) with 2.2 kJ and 230 kA under low repetitive rate as 1/60 pps are presented. The objective of these experiments was to investigate the neutron emission characteristics. In order to obtain time-integrated, time-resolved neutron and current, di/dt measurements, the diagnostics used during these experiments were: silver activation detector (SAD), scintillator-photomultiplier (ST-PMT) and integrated, resolved Rogowski coils. The signals were recorded at the same instant for per shot. Due to decay time of the activated silver (110Ag, /sup 108/Ag) it could hardly used at a repetitive rate higher than 1/60 pps.

For many years, NASA and the science community have been asking for a Mars sample return (MSR) mission. There have been numerous studies to evaluate MSR mission architectures, technology needs and development plans, and top-level requirements. Because of the challenges, technologically and financially, of the MSR mission, NASA initiated a study to look at MSR propulsion technologies through the In-Space Propulsion Technology (ISPT) project office. The objective of the ISPT project is to develop propulsion technologies that enhance or enable NASA science missions, specifically for the planetary science division, by increasing performance while reducing cost, risk, and/or trip times. The largest propulsion risk element of the MSR mission is the Mars ascent vehicle (MAV). In preparation for the procurement of the MAV system development and flight tests, a survey of the propulsion options was conducted and a technology development approach has been established. The results of the MAV system trades and development plan are presented.

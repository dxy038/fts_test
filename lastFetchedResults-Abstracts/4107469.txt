The Multi-Role Combat Aircraft Tornado is probably the most spectacular example to date of a complex man-machine system in which design and manufacture are widely dispersed. Even sub-assemblies of this system are extremely complex relative to the technology of just a few years ago. This makes life extremely difficult for an engineer involved in the procurement of the sub-assembly, especially as the overall objective can soon be submerged in a mass of detail. Starting with a review of desirable dynamic properties of the machine, as seen by the man, typical human operator transfer functions which have found use in closed-loop control system design are presented. Some ways in which microelectronics can reduce pilot work load are then discussed with the object of conveying to the design engineer some of the reasoning behind the performance specification he is trying to meet. Examples include helicopter stability augmentation systems and spacecraft terminal phase control.

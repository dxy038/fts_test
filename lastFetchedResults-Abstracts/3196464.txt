The objective of this research is to analyze humanoid´s jumping and landing motions on a view point of arms´ dynamical coupling onto jumping. Humans seem to use arms´ swinging for walking or running effectively and jump highly by swinging up arms high. So, we gave input torques to arms in such a way as to swing arms similar to humans, and changed timing to start swinging them, comparing them with humanoid´s motion that does not swing the arms through numerical simulation. Then we have confirmed that appropriate swinging motions of arms help the jumping to be higher than those without arms´ swinging.

A new suspension using double-wishbone and torsion bar spring type structure is designed for four-wheeled independent steering and driving electric automobile. Firstly, the simplified geometric model is built, and the ADAMS is used to set parametric model. The design takes wheel alignment parameters and vehicle roll center as the evaluation objective and optimizes the suspension guide mechanism. By doing this, a prototype model is manufactured to the design requirement.

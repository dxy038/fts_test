Recently, much work has been done in feasibility studies on services offered to moving objects in an environment equipped with mobile telephony, network technology and GIS. However, despite of all work on GIS and databases, the situations in which the whereabouts of objects are constantly monitored and stored for future analysis are an important class of problems that present-day database/GIS has difficulty to handle. Considering the fact that data about whereabouts of moving objects are acquired in a discrete way, providing the data when no observation is available is a must. Therefore, obtaining a "faithful representation" of trajectories with a sufficient number of discrete (though possibly erroneous) data points is the objective of this research.

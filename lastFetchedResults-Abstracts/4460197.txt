An NNFLC has been studied and designed employing the technology of current-mode multivalued CMOS and analog E<sup>2</sup>PROM. The NNFLC uses a neural network for knowledge memory instead of an if-then knowledge. This NNFLC behaves more intelligently than any traditional fuzzy logic control system. A single-chip application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) realization of such NNFL has been designed. The circuit has a systolic mesh structure with single clock control, bidirectional data flow, and an analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converting interface

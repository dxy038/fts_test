Advanced composite structures are becoming increasingly popular because of their high specific strength and stiffness, as well as ability to provide improved performance through passive morphing via intrinsic bend–twist deformation coupling. Self-adaptive composite structures tend to be more susceptible to geometric, material, and loading uncertainties because of their complex configuration, manufacturing process, and dependence on fluid–structure interaction (FSI) response. The objective of this work is to quantify the effects of material, geometric, and loading uncertainties on the response of self-adaptive composite propellers and overall system reliability. A fully-coupled, 3-D boundary element method–finite element method is used to compute the dynamic FSI response. Variability in propeller performance is estimated by considering variations in operating conditions, as well as blade geometry and stiffness. Modeling uncertainties are considered by employing various mechanistic-based failure initiation models. Random variations in material strengths are implemented and an estimate of the structural reliability is determined. The results indicate that adaptive composite structures that depend on FSI are more sensitive to natural, random variations than equivalent rigid, isotropic structures. Therefore, it is necessary to quantify the effects of material, geometric, and loading uncertainties on the responses, safe operating envelopes, and reliability of self-adaptive composite structures.

The aim of the paper is to discover the spatial distribution of agricultural mechanization and investigate the possible influential factors of spatial disparities of agricultural mechanization in China. The statistic data at provincial-level in the year of 2009 were collected to achieve the objective. Method of exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) is applied to examine the spatial structure and spatial distribution of agricultural mechanization. With global and local spatial autocorrelation analysis, it can be drawn that there is evidence of spillover in the agriculture mechanization among different provinces. Further, we use spatial regression models to analyze the influential factors. The result shows that rural per capita net income, educated population, and per capita cultivated land have significant influence on present spatial disparities of agricultural mechanization in China.

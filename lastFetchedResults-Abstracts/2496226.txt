Objective
Developmental delay screening is essential in pediatric medicine. The purpose
of this study was to estimate the developmental delay in apparently normal
children at entry to kindergarten.
Materials & Methods
 In this cross- sectional study conducted in 2013, the developmental status of a
sample of children who entered to kindergarten at the age of 4-60 months were
evaluated by the Persian version of ages and stages questionnaires (ASQ) in
Isfahan county, central Iran.
Results
Totally 680 children were enrolled, 11.8% of them were suspected to delayed in
at least one domain and 1.3% and 1.2% in two and three domains, respectively.
Developmental delay was in the following items: 5% in problem solving; 4.9%
in fine motor; 3.2% in gross motor, 2.2% and 1.2% in personal â€“ social and
communication domains, respectively.
Conclusion
Considerable proportions of apparently normal children who are entering
kindergarten had developmental delay, which could be detected by evaluation
with appropriate screening tools.

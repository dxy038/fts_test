Objective The present paper investigated
the relationships between several personality
constructs and the use of outpatient mental health
services. Methods Respondents were from the National
Comorbidity Survey (NCS) Part II data set
and included those with a past-year mood, anxiety,
alcohol/substance use disorder (n = 1750). Bivariate
logistic regressions were used to examine associations
between participantsâ€™ self-reports of personality
traits and outpatient mental health service
utilization. Similar multivariate analyses were used
to investigate these associations after adjusting for
sociodemographic variables and the presence of
psychiatric disorders and their comorbidity. Results
The bivariate and multivariate analyses revealed
significant positive associations between
outpatient mental health service utilization and both
Powerful Others Locus of Control and Self-criticism.
Conclusions These findings suggest that personality
traits may play a role in treatment seeking behaviors
for mental health problems over and above the
presence of psychiatric disorders alone. The
assessment of relevant personality constructs has
the potential to inform and improve treatment
outreach efforts

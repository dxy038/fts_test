Field in situ gamma radiation exposure rates and laboratory measured radioactivity contents of 1500 Spanish soils were compared. The main objective was to determine if published theoretically derived conversion factors would yield accurate quantitative activity concentration (Bq kgâˆ’1) for the data carried out in different surveys developed by our laboratory during the last ten years. The in situ external gamma dose rate results were compared to laboratory gamma analysis of soils samples gathered from each site, considering the concentrations of seven radionuclides: 40K, 214Pb, 214Bi, 212Bi, 212Pb, 208Tl and 228Ac. The coefficient of correlation found between these variables indicate a good relationship. A discussion of the factors contributing to the uncertainties as well as measurement procedure are also given in this paper.

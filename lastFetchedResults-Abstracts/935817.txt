The objective of this study was to evaluate the semen quality from five workers in a lead battery manufacturing factory. Blood and semen samples were taken to measure lead concentrations. These samples were compared with samples from eight workers not exposed to lead, based on age, marital status and duration of marriage. Results showed lead concentrations in blood and semen were significantly higher in the exposed group. However, comparisons based on sperm count, motility and viscosity showed no significant differences. There was a significant negative relationship for the exposed group between motility and blood-lead and semen-lead concentrations. Comparing sperm count and blood-lead and semen-lead concentrations, there was a non-significant negative relationship. Semen-lead concentrations and semen pH were significant factors that explained the semen count and semen motility results. Prolonged exposure to lead may have harmful effects on the body's reproductive functions.

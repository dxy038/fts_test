Ultra-wide band (UWB) technology has been documented to be reliable transmission scheme for wireless communication with high data rate in short data range. It consists of more than 20% of its central frequency. UWB can be characterized with Ultra-short duration pulses, which has excellent immunity in interference from other radio signals. Pulse shaping and baseband modulation schemes are two of the main determinant factors for its performance evaluation. The objective of this paper is to examine different types of pulse shaping and modulation schemes for UWBs performance evaluation. By considering the natural aspects of UWB, three different types of pulses and three different types of modulation schemes are considered for this study. Our results show that the shape of the waveform affects the bit error rate (BER) performances of pulse position modulation (PPM) scheme in both channels while it has a small effect on the performance of on off keying (OOK) and binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation schemes. The BER performance of BPSK modulation scheme using RZ-Manchester pulse turned out to be the best in both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels.

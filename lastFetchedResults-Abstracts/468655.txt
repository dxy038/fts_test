OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess changes in menstrual pattern, quality of life, and patient satisfaction after thermal balloon ablation for abnormal uterine bleeding.
STUDY DESIGN: One hundred forty-one women who underwent thermal balloon ablation in our institution initially had their charts reviewed for demographics, procedure data, clinical history, and follow-up. Thereafter, a telephone interview was conducted to assess postprocedural menstrual pattern, quality of life, and patient satisfaction. Data were compared with the use of appropriate tests for categoric or continuous variables and logistic regression.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 18 months, and a telephone interview was obtained for 119 of 141 patients. A reduction in days per cycle (9.6 vs 3.1 days, P<.0001) and in pads per day (12.8 vs 2.5 pads/d, P<.0001) and an improvement in self-reported quality of life scores (2.8 vs 9.0, P<.0001) were observed after thermal balloon ablation. Hysterectomy was required in 21 of 141 patients (15%). Assessment of the level of satisfaction showed that 96% of patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the procedure. No major complications or deaths were related to thermal balloon ablation.
CONCLUSION: Thermal balloon ablation is a safe and efficient method to treat abnormal uterine bleeding. It reduces the menstrual flow, improves the quality of life, and remarkably fulfills expectations in selected patients.

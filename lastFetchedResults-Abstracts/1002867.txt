The objective of this study was to exploit the advantages of stripping chronopotentiometry (SCP) and stripping chronopotentiometry at scanned deposition potential (SSCP) for trace metal speciation analyses by using thin-film mercury screen-printed electrodes (TMF-SPE). At first, the SCP parameters were optimised for TMF-SPE, in order to reach the complete depletion regime. It has been shown that a stripping current higher than or equal to 10 Î¼A allows this regime to be attained without removing oxygen from the solution.

In the above paper, <img src="/images/tex/4729.gif" alt="^1"/> Bahl et aL described a bidirectional search algorithm for computing the free distance of convolutional codes. There are some flaws in that algorithm. This correspondence contains a corrected version of the algorithm together with a proof that the corrected version always computes the free distance for noncatastrophic codes.

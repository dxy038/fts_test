The purpose of this paper is to present a method for synthesizing a class of second-order RC driving-point impedances with minimum total capacitance using equal-valued capacitors. This method has practical applications for the design of the passive portions of integrated circuits, in which cost minimization is a main objective. A network topology satisfying the requirements of equal and minimum total capacitance is developed, and specific element values in this topology are derived to match the desired impedance. Certain realizability conditions for this synthesis are derived.

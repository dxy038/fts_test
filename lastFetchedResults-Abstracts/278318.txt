In recent years metal-free ceramic systems have become increasingly popular in dental practice because of their superior aesthetics, chemical durability and biocompatibility. Recently, manufacturers have proposed new dental ceramic systems that are advertized as being suitable for posterior fixed partial dentures (FPDs). Reports indicate that some of these systems have exhibited poor clinical performance. The objective of this study was to use the viscoelastic option of the ANSYS finite element program to calculate residual stresses in an all-ceramic FPD for four ceramic–ceramic combinations. A three-dimensional finite element model of the FPD was constructed from digitized scanning data and calculations were performed for four systems: (1) IPS Empress® 2, a glass-veneering material, and Empress® 2 core ceramic; (2) IPS Eris™ a low fusing fluorapatite-containing glass-veneering ceramic, and Empress® 2 core ceramic; (3) IPS Empress® 2 veneer and an experimental lithium–disilicate-based core ceramic; and (4) IPS ErisTM and an experimental lithium–disilicate-based core ceramic. The maximum residual tensile stresses in the veneer layer for these combinations are as follows: (1) 77 MPa, (2) 108 MPa, (3) 79 MPa, and (4) 100 MPa. These stresses are relatively high compared to the flexural strengths of these materials. In all cases, the maximum residual tensile stresses in the core frameworks were well below the flexural strengths of these materials. We conclude that the high residual tensile stresses in all-ceramic FPDs with a layering ceramic may place these systems in jeopardy of failure under occlusal loading in the oral cavity.

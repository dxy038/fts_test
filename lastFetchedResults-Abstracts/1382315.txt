The simultaneous twoscale analysis of unidirectionally fiber reinforced composite structures with attention to damage evolution is the objective of the contribution. The heterogeneous microstructure of the composite represents the microscale, whereas the laminate or the structural component are addressed as the macroscale. The macroscale is conventionally discretized by the finite element method (FEM). The generalized method of cells (GMC) in its efficient stress based formulation serves as the discrete microscale model. The stiff and brittle fibers behave linearly elastic. The epoxy resin is described by the nonlinear-elastic model of Ramberg–Osgood. By introducing microcrack models, the damage of the epoxy matrix under combined tensile and shear loading is taken into account. The cell boundaries of the micromodel are used to locate microscopic cracks deterministically. Interface models for the representation of damage in the matrix phase as well as for the weakening of the fiber–matrix-bond are used. This approach circumvents the need for the regularization, as it would be necessary for continuum damage models with softening characteristics. Hence, the micromodel is numerically stable and convergent. The GMC allows to obtain the consistently linearized constitutive tensor in the case of nonlinear material behavior in a simple and straight forward manner which is easily implemented in comparison to micromodels based on the finite element technique. The damage evolution on the microscale manifests itself macroscopically in the degradation of the homogenized stiffnesses.

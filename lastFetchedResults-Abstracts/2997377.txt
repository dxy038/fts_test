Understanding of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) phenomena in power electronics allows research laboratories to develop new software that are now being commercialized. Industrial people are more and more interested in such products because of their time-to-market and cost constraints. Convivial GUIs and numerical prototypes introduced in the major industrial companies make EMC engineers feel the need to evaluate such numerical codes. In this paper, the authors present some of the results Schneider Electric obtained in an evaluation of different EMC software. The main objective of the evaluation was first to simulate conducted and radiated emissions of an inverter and then to compare the results to experimental measurements

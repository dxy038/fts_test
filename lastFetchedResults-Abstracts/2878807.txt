In order to distribute the rudiments of plant systems and renewable energy systems, a T-S-K fuzzy logic approach is taken in combination with multiple objective genetic algorithm approach. These approaches overcame non linearity in the water-energy dynamic and in the dynamic of easterly wind and shortwave solar flux present on a global scale. Hence system blocks for plant and renewable systems are presented. Increased rationality of the MOGA is shown with use of increased orders of differentiation. Consequently algorithms for plant systems and renewable systems presented orthogonal distribution with use of a domain flipping function. Furthermore, convergence between the two system blocks is identified with use of Lyapunov stability and sliding mode combinatorial technique effectively coupling the elements of each system block.

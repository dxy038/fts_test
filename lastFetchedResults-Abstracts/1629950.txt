The objective of this study was to improve the water-solubility and photostability of cilnidipine by complexing it with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD or HP-beta-CD). The interactions of cilnidipine and HP-β-CD were characterized by ultra violet–visible (UV/VIS) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transformation-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy to verify the formation of cilnidipine-HP-β-CD complex inclusion. Moreover, the binding sites in the HP-β-CD structure were also tracked through 1H NMR spectroscopy analysis. All the characterization information proved the formation of cilnidipine-HP-β-CD inclusion complex, and the results demonstrated the superiority of the inclusion complex in dissolution rates and photostability; in addition, the apparent solubility of cilnidipine was increased more than 10,000-fold in the presence of HP-β-CD. The stability constant (1:1) was found to be 50,116 M−1, suggesting a high tendency of the drug to enter the HP-β-CD cavity. These results identified the cilnidipine-HP-β-CD inclusion complex as an effective new approach to design a novel formulation for pharmaceutical application.

Aimed on the multi-objective design problem of hydrodynamic sliding bearing in gearbox, a general finding solution method was introduced to high dimension multi-objective reliability optimization problem with hybrid discrete variables and the multi-objective was transformed into single object to be found with improved synthetic degree of grey incidences. The method could reasonably deal with value adopting problems of hybrid discrete variables in optimization design. An equal probability chaotic emigration operator was introduced for carrying out improvement on the fundamental genetic algorithm, and the grey compound genetic algorithmic program for the multi-objective optimum design with hybrid discrete variables was developed. The multi-objective reliability optimum design example of hydrodynamic sliding bearing in gearbox showed that this algorithm has no special requirements on the characteristics of optimal designing problems, it has a fairly good universal adaptability and a reliable operation of program with a strong ability of overall convergence.

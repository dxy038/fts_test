Objective: To study the drug resistance of C. albicans biofilm at different stage of C. albicans biofilm formation to Chinese medicinal herb Sophora flavescens and liquorice. Methods: The morphology of the biofilm at different development stages(2, 4, 8, 24, 48h)in glass slide was observed under the inverted microscope. The drug resistance of dissociative C. albicans was detect with NCCLs microdilution and the changes of C. albicans drug resistance in biofilm were tested with XTT reduction method. Results: Drug resistance of C.albicans increased with the biofilm maturation significantly ( P&lt;;0.05). Compared with planktonic C. albicans strains, The drug resistance of biofilm is 100 times. Conclusion:There is positive correlation between drug resistance and biofilm maturation of C. albicans.

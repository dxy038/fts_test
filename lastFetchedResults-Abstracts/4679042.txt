The objective of this paper is to show a methodology to estimate transmission line parameters. The method is applied in a single-phase transmission line using the method of least squares. In this method the longitudinal and transversal parameters of the line are obtained as a function of a set of measurements of currents and voltages (as well as their derivatives with respect to time) at the terminals of the line during the occurrence of a short-circuit phase-ground near the load. The method is based on the assumption that a transmission line can be represented by a single circuit &#960;. The results show that the precision of the method depends on the length of the line, where it has a better performance for short lines and medium length.

This paper presents a combined economic and emission dispatch (CEED) model incorporating the wind power which minimizes both the cost and the emission objectives. Considering the stochastic nature of wind power, cost due to both the underestimation and the overestimation of wind power and the fuel costs are incorporated into the cost objective. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, group search optimizer with multiple producers (GSOMP), is adopted to solve the CEED model on a modified IEEE 30-bus system incorporating two wind units. The simulation results show that the CEED model is well solved by the GSOMP and some conclusions are obtained.

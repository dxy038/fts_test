Introduction & Objective: Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a major cause of blindness in premature newborns. It accounts for 4% of childhood blindness in developed countries and up to 40% in developing countries. The aim of this study is to report the refractive and anatomical outcome of patients who had undergone laser photocoagulate on for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).
Materials & Methods: In this cross sectional study, a total of forty eyes of twenty patients who had undergone transscleral diode laser photocoagulation for ROP between 2004-2008 were studied for the following measures: grade of ROP pre- and postoperatively, birth weight, gestational age, perioperative and postoperative complications, and current refraction.
Results: Mean birth weight of patients was 923±271 gr and mean gestational age was 27.3±2.6 wk. All eyes had threshold ROP and responded to laser treatment with regression of ROP. Perioperative complications included hemorrhages in 15% that resorbed spontaneously. The mean age of patients at the time of examination for this study was 4.13±1.30 yr and their anatomical status of retina was normal. Strabismus (more than 20 prism diopter) was found in 10% of patients. The spherical equivalent of refraction at the time of examination was -2.31±3.38 diopter.
Conclusion: Photocoagulation for ROP in our patients resulted in regression of threshold ROP. In addition, the analyses of refractive outcome demonstrated a predominance of myopia and astigmatism.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to compare intra-anal electromyographic biofeedback alone with intra-anal biofeedback that was augmented with electrical stimulation of the anal sphincter in the treatment of postpartum fecal incontinence. A secondary aim was to examine the impact of the treatment on continence-related quality of life.
Study design
Sixty symptomatic women were assigned randomly to receive intra-anal electromyographic biofeedback or electrical stimulation of the anal sphincter once weekly for 12 weeks and to perform daily pelvic floor exercises between treatments. Therapeutic response was evaluated with a symptom questionnaire to determine continence score, anal manometry, and endoanal ultrasound scanning. Quality of life was assessed before and after treatment with a validated questionnaire.
Results
Fifty-four women completed the treatment; 52 women (96%) had ultrasonic evidence of an external anal sphincter defect. After the treatment, both groups demonstrated significant improvement in continence score (P< .001) and in squeeze anal pressures (P< .04). Resting anal pressures did not alter significantly. Quality of life improved after the completion of physiotherapy, but there were no differences in outcome between intra-anal electromyographic biofeedback and electrical stimulation of the anal sphincter.

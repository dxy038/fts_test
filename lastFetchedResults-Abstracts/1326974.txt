Information technology applications have proven effective in the maintenance of constructed facilities. The objective of the study is to enhance building maintenance using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. A data management module is first developed to collect building usage and maintenance data. A statistical module is then established to graphically display the collected data. To ensure that building functions perform normally, maintenance activities are arranged using a scheduling module. These three modules are integrated into a web-based RFID building maintenance system. System performance is validated using a real building. Experimental results show that integrating RFID technology with a web-based system, database, and scheduling theory can improve facility and equipment maintenance efficiency.

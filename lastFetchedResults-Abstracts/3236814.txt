It was developed an Interoperability Test Platform (ITP) which is capable of interoperability, functional and penetration tests in equipment applied to Smart Grids and their protocols. One of the implemented protocols is the ABNT NBR 14522, which has several particularities related to the Brazilian energy market which make it of special interest for evaluation. The main one is that there isnÂ´t so far a test environment for it. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the protocol simulation and monitoring resources of ITP through conformance, interoperability and functional test scripts for the ABNT protocol. ITP has also the capability to test Zigbee and DNP3 protocols and some results on them will also be presented.

A set of four experiments was conducted to evaluate tactile localization and tactile pattern recognition on the torso. A one- dimensional eight-tactor display and a two-dimensional 16-tactor display were used to present tactile cues to the waist and back respectively. The results from the spatial localization experiments indicated that a display with eight tactors mounted circumferentially around the waist can provide tactile cues that are perceived very accurately in terms of the location of stimulation. In contrast, the 16-tactor array on the back was found to be inadequate to support precise spatial mapping, but an array with fewer elements could provide such spatial cues. The second set of experiments evaluated tactile pattern recognition around the waist and on the back with the objective of determining what types of tactile stimuli could be useful for creating tactons. The tactile display used in these experiments stimulated the skin at a fixed frequency and amplitude and varied the number and location of tactors simultaneously active to convey information. For both the waist and back, tactile patterns were identified with high accuracy, 99% and 95% correct response rate respectively. These findings suggest that simple navigational and instructional commands can be presented factually on the torso.

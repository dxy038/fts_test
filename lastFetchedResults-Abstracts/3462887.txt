In developing a hard disk drive servo system, there are multiple design control objectives to be met simultaneously. While some of the objectives are constraint objectives, others are simply optimization objectives. In this paper, we investigate a new multiobjective genetic algorithm (GA) for tuning servo controller parameters such that the resultant performance can satisfy all the desired requirements. Unlike the conventional single-objective GA, this new approach is able to place higher priority on the constraint objectives than the optimization objectives. Experimental results that are based on a commercial hard disk drive are presented

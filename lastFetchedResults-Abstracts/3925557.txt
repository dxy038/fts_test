We experimentally demonstrate a bidirectional hybrid orthogonal frequency-division-multiplexing wavelength-division-multiplexing passive optical network (OFDM-WDM-PON) system. The proposed scheme uses OFDM signals occupying different portions of the available signal spectrum for uplink and downlink signal transmissions to reduce the effects of Rayleigh backscattering, chromatic dispersion, and power fading. A 40-Gb/s downlink signal transmission based on a single sideband modulated OFDM signal, and a 10-Gb/s uplink signal transmission using remodulation of a reflective semiconductor-optical-amplifier are realized.

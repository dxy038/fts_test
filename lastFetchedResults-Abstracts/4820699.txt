TanDEM-X is a spaceborne mission consisting in two satellites that are operated simultaneously for bistatic SAR acquisitions. The main objective of the mission is the systematic acquisition of a global and homogeneous digital elevation model (DEM) in bistatic stripmap mode. The close formation of the satellites makes the system very flexible and allows the commanding of a diversity of challenging experimental modes as bistatic spotlight or alternating bistatic stripmap modes. This paper gives an overview of the TanDEM-X experimental modes, focused on the analysis of already executed scientific orders, giving an overview of the different possibilities in commanding and image acquisition geometries. Also a first image characterization of the modes is included, in terms of image quality assessment and performance compliance.

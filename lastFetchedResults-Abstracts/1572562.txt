To develop sound air quality plans, regional authorities should have instruments that link the complex behaviour of pollutants both in time and space with costs of emission reduction. The problem is particularly important for ground level ozone which forms kilometres away, hours later from the emission of its precursors. To approach this problem, a method (1) to identify local pollutant-precursor models on the basis of results from a large photochemical model (CALGRID), (2) to integrate them in a multi-objective mathematical program, together with an estimate of the emission reduction costs, is suggested. The method has been used to assess action priorities in Lombardy (Northern Italy). This area, characterised by a complex terrain, high urban and industrial emissions and a dense road network is often affected by severe photochemical pollution episodes during summer.

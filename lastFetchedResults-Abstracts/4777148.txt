Water pollution in Taihu Lake has become one of the most serious environmental problems that draws public attention and needs to be solved as soon as possible. It was well known that forest could play an important role to control soil &amp; water erosion, uptake extra soil nutrients as well. However forest coverage is rather low and woodlands are extensively managed in the headwaters region. Thus the fertilizer loss resulted from the erosion of soil and water in sloping field has acted as an important role in the course. In view of the situation, enhancing forest establishment and management is significant. The primary objective of applying hedgerows is to control soil &amp; water erosion, and improve farming conditions on slope field in headwater region of Taihu Lake basin. While building riparian forest buffer zone is helpful to protect riverbank, uptake nutrients, hold up pollutants and provide habitat for wildlife. The planting techniques of hedgerows in slop fields and riparian forest buffer zone along channels were discussed in the paper, which is considered as a vital measure to control agricultural non-point source pollution.

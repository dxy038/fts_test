Basically from the viewpoint of Berkeley, abstract ideas are not logically possible, since they are out of any objectivity. Let’s take the abstract idea of color as an example: it is neither white, nor black, nor red, nor green, etc. Therefore this idea does not actually exist or it would be contradictory. Besides, none of the functions pertaining to abstract ideas are acceptable. First of all, abstract ideas are not really applicable to man, because the majority of people easily start up chatting with one another, without being slightly aware of the ideas. Second, abstract ideas have no role in science development and knowledge, for universal laws and ideas of science occur by means of Berkeley’s alternative i.e. particular ideas representation, not via abstraction. Third, abstract ideas do not bring general names and particular objects interconnected. Because if general names were provided through abstraction, they would be devoid of objectivity, hence they won’t be relevant with particular objects.
However Berkeley believes in particular ideas representation instead of abstraction doctrine. In his view when a general name is stated, only brings a particular evidence into mind which stands for all other evidences. In other words it is impossible for us to have a general, non objective and abstract (comprehensively abstract) idea in our mind. 
In fact - and according to Berkeley’s words – every idea is particular. But it seems that Berkeley’s alternative is not that applicable, Because there we should have general and prime ideas as a requisite.

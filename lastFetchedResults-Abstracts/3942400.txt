The redundancy optimization problem is formulated as an integer programming problem of zero-one type variables. The solution is obtained making use of an algorithm due to Lawler and Bell. Objective function and constraints can be any arbitrary functions. Three different variations of the optimization problem are considered. The formulation is easy and the solution is convenient on a digital computer. The size of the problem that can be solved is not restricted by the number of constraints.

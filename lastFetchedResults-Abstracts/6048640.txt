A production scheduling system able to consider the most relevant characteristics associated with transport manufacturing tasks has been developed. Once the main restrictions associated to these tasks (number, location and characteristics of available AGV, autonomy limitations, etc.) have been introduced, the system simultaneously optimises production and transport task schedules, taking into account the overall production policies and a common objective function (i.e., tardiness, makespan, etc). Decision making related with the transport system is then integrated and co-ordinated with the overall plant decision-making

Objective
Blood pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) level increases in case of myocardial ischemia and myocardial volume or pressure overload. The aim of this study is to measure changes in blood pro-BNP level during the course of panic attack with symptoms of chest pain and/or dyspnea.
Methods

Patients who were admitted to the emergency room with panic attack have been regarded as the study group. Blood pro-BNP level has been measured during follow-up of the patients upon admission and 2h later.
Results

Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate were significantly decreased (p < 0.0001) during follow-up of the patients (ages between 18 and 43 years; mean 26 ± 6.13 years). Paradoxically, blood pro-BNP level of patients was significantly increased during the same period (52.86 ± 59.73 versus 50.97 ± 57.42 U/L; p < 0.0001).
Conclusion

Blood pro-BNP level has increased among patients who have complained chest pain and/or dyspnea as symptoms of panic attack. It is thought that chest pain and dyspnea in the course of panic attack may not be purely psychological.

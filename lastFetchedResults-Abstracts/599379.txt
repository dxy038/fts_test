This paper presents the application of hybrid particle swarm optimization technique to find optimal location of unified power flow controller to achieve optimal power flow. Objective function in the OPF, that is to be minimized, are the overall cost functions, which include the total active and reactive production cost function of the generators and installation cost of UPFCs. The OPF constraints are generators, transmission lines and UPFCs limits. We propose HPSO algorithm to consider the objective function and all equality and inequality constraints. Simulations are performed on 4 bus test system and modified IEEE 14 bus system for optimal location of UPFC and the results obtained are encouraging and will be useful in electrical restructuring.

The study was conducted in Adama and
Bishoftu towns, on carcass samples of Arsi breed cattle with
objective of evaluating proximate qualities with standard
procedures. Beef sample was aseptically collected from
longissimus dorsi chuck proximate composition analysis.
Breed type was determined by phenotypic traits and age was
determined with dentition. The production system being
practiced by the animals selling and buying farmers were
subsistence production systems. There was no variation in
proximate qualities due to age and production system effect
and their interactions (P  >  0.05). The protein and fat content
of longissimus dorsi chuck of Arsi cattle were 22.10 and 6.86,
respectively

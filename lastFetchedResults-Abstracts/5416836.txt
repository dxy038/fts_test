The main objective of the present work is to show the results of the harmonic content registered and measured at different points of the Bolivian distribution system. So far, the effects of nonlinear loads in most of the distribution system have been disregarded. Another collateral aim of the work is to show both the existence and the instants when resonance, as a result of the harmonics present in the network, occurs. The results obtained will enable distributors to focus strictly on this area. It is also intended to let users know that they should be aware about their responsibility so that the electrical system is not polluted

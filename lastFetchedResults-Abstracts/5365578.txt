The present article refers to the study of the ride comfort of two-wheeled vehicles that represents an increasingly relevant aspect of the dynamic of the vehicle. The aim of the work is to develop a methodology to evaluate the ride comfort starting from data acquired during on road experimental tests. At the same time an investigation on a statistical population of drivers has been carried out in order to obtain a feedback about subjective perception of comfort for each tested vehicle. Several methods were proposed to indentify objective indexes of comfort, including also analysis procedures proposed by International Standards. The obtained results were compared with the results coming from the subjective perception. At the end both the pros and cons of each proposed method were discussed.

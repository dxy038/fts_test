Mining area environmental impact of a variety of uncertainties, from the engineering point of view can be divided into land pollution, water pollution, air pollution, noise pollution and solid waste pollution. In the paper, an evaluation index system of mining area is established by using the unascertained method and AHM. And the evaluation factor set and weight set is analyzed by AHM algorithm. According to the system, the unascertained measure and AHM is introduced. And the procedure of comprehensive evaluation is analyzed based on the unascertained measure and AHM. This method can get an objective evidence to evaluate the environment quality.

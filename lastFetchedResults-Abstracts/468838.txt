Objective
The purpose of this study was to measure the risk of reoperation for surgically treated pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence in a community-based population.
Study design
A 5-year prospective, observational study was conducted of women who had undergone pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence surgery in 1995. The cohort of 376 women was identified by International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, and current procedural terminology codes in 149,554 reproductive-aged women within the Kaiser Permanente Northwest membership.
Results
Thirty-six women underwent 40 cases of reoperation. By survival analysis, 13% of women underwent reoperation by 71 months. Having undergone previous pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence surgery increased the risk of reoperation to 17% compared with 12% for women who underwent a first procedure (log rank, P = .04). No association was observed with age, body mass index, parity, previoushysterectomy not for prolapse, vaginal versus abdominal approach, severity of prolapse, ethnicity, chronic lung disease, smoking, previous corticosteroid use, and estrogen status.
Conclusions
Future reoperation is a significant risk of morbidity for women who undergo pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence surgery.

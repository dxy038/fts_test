This panel paper addresses applications of intelligent techniques on flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices in terms of steady state and transient improvement of power systems. Taking advantages of the FACTS devices depends greatly on how these devices are placed in the power system, namely on their location and size. In a practical power system, allocation of the devices depends on a comprehensive analysis of steady-state stability, transient stability, small signal stability and voltage stability. Moreover, other practical factors such as cost and installation conditions also need to be considered. Thus, allocation could be a multi- objective problem where finding a solution is not simple by analytical methods. Therefore, controlling of FACTS devices using heuristic methods has been paid attention, to assure the security of the system in terms of voltage and angle stability. This paper aims to show that, due to many attractive features of intelligent techniques, the heuristic methods are becoming popular for solving complex problems such as applications of FACTS devices in terms of steady state and transient improvement of transmission systems.

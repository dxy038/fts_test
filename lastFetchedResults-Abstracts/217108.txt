Background: Low birth weight (LBW) is one of the major determinants of neonatal survival as well as postnatal morbidity.
Objective: The main objective of the present study was to determine neonatal mortality rate (NMR) in LBW infants in Yazd, Iran.
Materials and Methods: In a prospective-cohort study, all births in the maternity hospitals of Yazd, Iran in 2004 were evaluated and mortality rate in LBW population over the course of the first month of extra uterine life was determined. Results: In total, 8.4% (507 of 6016 births) of all newborns were LBW and 18.7% (95/507) of all LBW neonates died. Neonatal mortality rate in Yazd was 24/1000 live births .Two- third (95 /143) of all neonatal deaths occurred in LBW. Neonatal mortality
rate (NMR) inLBW, Moderately low birth weight (MLBW), Very low birth weight (VLBW) and Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) were 23, 11.5 , 62.5 and 117 times more than that of normal weight newborns, respectively. Nearly 65% of all LBW neonatal deaths occurred in first 24 hours after birth. Overall NMR, Early Neonatal mortality rate (ENMR) and Late Neonatal mortality rate (LNMR) in LBW were 187, 118 and 9.8 in 1000 live births, respectively. The main causes of mortality among LBW
in order of prevalence were respiratory distress syndrome (ROS) (59%), asphyxia (20% ) , septicemia (12%) and congenital malformation (9%).
Conclusion: Neonatal mortality rate in Yazd is high and LBW accounted for two-third of neonatal deaths. Therefore, effort should be intensified to implement effective strategies for the reduction of LBW births and improving the care of these vulnerable neonates.

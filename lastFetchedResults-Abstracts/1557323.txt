This paper presents a mathematical model of trade-off relations arising in third party logistics using Pareto optimal solutions for multi-objective optimization problems. The model defines an optimal set of distribution costs and service levels constituting a trade-off relation. An analogy to the concept of the indifference curve in the field of economics is discussed. Numerical experiments for a simplified problem are performed, demonstrating an increasing process of the utility of logistics.

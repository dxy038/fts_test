The objective of this research is to develop and assess a pattern analysis for land cover maps. The selective landscape metrics (PD, CONTAG, PAFRAC, and SHDI) have been computed for the multi-temporal land cover maps based on Landsat MSS/TM remote sensing during 1978-2004. Our study systematically explores and compares trends and patterns of urban sprawl across the town level in Wujiang.

To date, designed topologies for DC-AC inversion with both voltage-buck and boost capabilities are mainly focused on two-level circuitries with extensions to three-level possibilities left nearly unexplored. Contributing to this area of research, this paper presents the design of a number of viable buck-boost three-level inverters that can also support bidirectional power conversion. The proposed front-end circuitry is developed from the Cuk-derived buck-boost two-level inverter, and by using the "alternative phase opposition disposition" (APOD) modulation scheme, the buck-boost three-level inverters can perform distinct five-level line voltage and three-level phase voltage switching by simply controlling the active switches located in the designed voltage boost section of the circuits. As a cost saving option, one active switch can further be removed from the voltage-boost section of the circuits by simply re-routing the gating commands of the remaining switches without influencing the ac output voltage amplitude. To verify the validity of the proposed inverters, Matlab/PLECS simulations were performed before a laboratory prototype was implemented for experimental testing.

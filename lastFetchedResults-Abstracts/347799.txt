Objective: This study aimed to investigate changes in spatio-temporal, event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) patterns recorded with respect to the more akinetic versus the less akinetic side during performance of a visuo-guided targeting movement when compared to an index finger extension.
Methods: Twelve de novo parkinsonian patients were recorded. ERD/ERS in mu and beta frequency bands was computed from 21 source derivations.
Results: When the index finger extension was performed with the less akinetic limb, mu ERD focused over contralateral central region appeared 2 s before movement. With the targeting movement, additional pre-movement mu ERD was observed over the parietal region, as well as earlier ipsilateral mu ERD. When the same movements were performed with the more akinetic limb, we observed delayed mu ERD over contralateral regions, earlier ipsilateral mu ERD and a lack of contralateral parietal mu ERD before the targeting movement. Following index finger extension for the less akinetic limb, a focused contralateral central beta ERS was recorded, increasing and spreading after the targeting movement. In contrast, for the more akinetic limb, beta ERS was dramatically attenuated and remained unchanged after the targeting movement.
Conclusions: These results confirm the fact that motor programming is delayed, and provide some insight into what may well be impaired sensorimotor integration in Parkinson's disease.

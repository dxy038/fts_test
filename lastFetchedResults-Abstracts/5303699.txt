The investigation was undertaken with the objective of exploring the extent to which semi-insulating materials can be formulated by blending the conducting polymer polyaniline (PANI) with conventional thermoplastics. By varying the doping level and amount of PANI in the blend, the electrical properties of the material may be adjusted whilst retaining the attractive mechanical properties and ease of processing associated with the thermoplastic host

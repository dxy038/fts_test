Objective
This study examined temporary restorative resins that use non-phthalate ester plasticizers.
Methods

Three non-phthalate plasticizers were tested: tri-ethyl citrate (TEC), tri-butyl citrate (TBC), and di-butyl sebacate (DBS). The experimental resins were compared with resins that use a phthalate ester plasticizer (di-butyl phthalate, DBP) and commercial products (Dura Seal, Plast Seal, and Fit Seal). For the experimental resins, the ratio of plasticizer to PMMA/MMA resin was varied from 30 to 60% (wt). The mechanical properties of the experimental resins were evaluated using a modified diametral compressive strength and the resistance to explorer insertion.
Results

The strengths of the experimental resins with plasticizer concentrations ranging from 40 to 50% (TEC, TBC, and DBP) or from 30 to 40% (DBS), by weight, were equivalent to the strengths of commercial temporary restorative resins. A similar tendency was seen for the resistance to explorer insertion.
Conclusions

The results suggest that new temporary restorative resins can be prepared by choosing the appropriate proportions of resin monomer and non-phthalate ester plasticizer.

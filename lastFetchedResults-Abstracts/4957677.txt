We investigate an outage optimal adaptive resource allocation scheme for the upstream of two-hop OFDMA based decode-and-forward cooperative relay systems. The objective of this work is to design resource allocation strategy, which addresses the needs of the users minimizing their outage probability. This scheme utilizes the subchannel-pairing and proportional fairness in two-hop multiuser multirelay network to achieve the user required percentage throughput ( i.e., if the userÂ´s application can tolerate 5% outage then guaranteeing the 100% availability is actually a wastage of scarce radio resources). Using outage optimal resource allocation scheme, we achieve the complimentary fairness along with the required data rate on each node. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieve better throughput-fairness trade-off compared to proportional fair scheduling (PFS) and MaxMin resource allocation schemes.

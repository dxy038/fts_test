 Background Accidents are the most frequent reason for admission to
                            hospitals and the second most common cause of mortality.
                            Accident-related injuries can cause severe financial loss in
                            communities. Understanding the causes and prevalence of accidents is
                            necessary to prevent such losses. Objectives The objective of the
                            present study was to reveal the causes of accidents leading to admission
                            to the emergency ward of Shahid Beheshti hospital, the referral and
                            educational hospital of the Kohkilooyeh and Boyerahmad provinces in
                            Yasuj. Methods The present research was a cross-sectional study of the
                            information of 583 patients who were admitted to the emergency ward of
                            Shahid Beheshti hospital due to accidents. Data were extracted from the
                            medical records of patients admitted to the emergency ward of the
                            hospital during the calendar year March, 2011 to March, 2012. The data
                            were then analyzed using SPSS 19. Results Among the 583 patients
                            admitted to the emergency ward due to accidents, 396 (68%) were male and
                            187 (32%) were female, with a mean age of 28 years (25 - 55 years). 257
                            patients (44.1%) were admitted to the emergency ward from 6 pm to 12 pm
                            and Wednesday with 97 cases (17.7%). Only 176 patients (31.2%) used
                            insurance services during hospitalization. The most common causes of
                            accidents leading to admission were traffic accidents (66.4%), falls and
                            collisions (29.06%), and fights (2.17%). The average hospital fee was
                            630,253 rails. Conclusions The findings of the present study show that
                            patients 24 - 44 years of age were the most likely to experience
                            accidents such as traffic accidents, falls, and fights which inflict
                            irreversible damage on communities and families and cause financial and
                            mental suffering due to the loss of man power. Most of these accidents
                            could be prevented by improvements in public training, driverâ€™s
                            education, modification of areas where accidents frequently occur, and
                            enforcement of safety measures.

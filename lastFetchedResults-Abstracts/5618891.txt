Acne is chronic disorder of the pilosebaceous units with excess sebum production, follicular epidermal hyper proliferation, inflammation and P acnes activity. It affects 85% of adolescents at some time during their lives. Dermatologists use manual methods such as direct visual assessment and ordinary flash photography to assess the acne. These methods are very time consuming and tedious. To address these issues, researchers in recent years have proposed computational imaging methods for aiding in the acne diagnosis. To develop algorithm with an automated acne grading method is the objective of this proposed method. This work presents an image segmentation method for acne lesions based on color features with K-means clustering. The segmentation results from randomly selected images show the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value greater than 81%.

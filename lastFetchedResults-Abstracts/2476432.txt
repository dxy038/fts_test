This paper presents a strategy for load distribution between the generating units in hydro power plants. The objective is to reach the maximum energy conversion efficiency for a given dispatched power. The developed tool employs a heuristic-based combinatorial optimization technique in conjunction with a set of system variables measurement allowing real-time load sharing. The developed equipment is used to give online energy conversion efficiency from each unit of the power plant. No specific previous information about the efficiency of system components is required. Simulation results of the proposed optimization technique when applied to typical hydro power plant data are presented.

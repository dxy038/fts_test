This paper explores the presentation of tomographic medical images on a computer screen. Limitations of the computer screen are apparent, as even a very large computer monitor cannot display an entire study consisting of dozens of images at once. Our objective is to propose filmless computer presentation methods for these images, in particular for magnetic resonance images. First, we observe the magnetic resonance image analysis task in the traditional light screen environment where presentation of many images has always been possible. We then propose solutions for meeting requirements in the computer environment. After implementation of these solutions we obtain user feedback on alternatives in order to determine feasibility and preference.

ations reveal three requirement categories: user control of film management, navigation of images and image series, and simultaneous availability of detail and context. We developed a framework of detail-in-context-technique parameters for the purpose of viewing tomographic medical images and presented our solution directions to the radiologists for feedback. Results from the user feedback study support the feasibility of the proposed approaches and clearly indicate the importance of presentation issues in the development of medical imaging viewing systems.

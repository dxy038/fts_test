This paper presents a study of the effect of model uncertainty on damage detection when feedback controllers, such as passive controllers, are incorporated into the structure. The use of feedback control techniques can generate additional modal parameters of closed-loop systems for structural damage identification. One major issue of the application of feedback control techniques is the effect of model uncertainty, such as boundary condition variation, on structural damage detection. The objective of this research is to develop control methodologies to reduce the effect of model uncertainty on structural damage detection.

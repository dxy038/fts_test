Objective: Our purpose was to examine the cellular localization of inhibin and activin subunits in human epithelial ovarian tumors. Study Design:We examined the immunohistochemical localization of the α, βA, and βB subunits of inhibin in human mucinous and serous ovarian tumors including adenoma, cystic tumor with borderline malignancy, and adenocarcinoma. Results: Immunostaining specific for the α, βA, and βB subunits of inhibin was observed in the tumor cells of the mucinous adenoma and the cystic tumor with borderline malignancy. We observed negative immunostaining specific for the α subunit and positive staining specific for the βA and βB subunits in the tumor cells of the mucinous adenocarcinoma. We did not observe any staining for the α subunit of inhibin in the serous tumors including benign adenoma, cystic tumor with borderline malignancy, and adenocarcinoma. However, positive staining results for the βA and βB subunits were observed in the serous tumor cells. Conclusion: Our results suggest that inhibins and activins might be secreted by the mucinous adenoma and the cystic tumor with borderline malignancy and that activins might be secreted by the mucinous adenocarcinoma and the serous tumors including benign adenoma, cystic tumor with borderline malignancy, and adenocarcinoma.

The objective of this work is to study the interaction of a copolymer, poly methyl vinyl ether/maleic anhydride (PMV/MA) used in pharmaceutical dosage form and a phospholipid  -α-dimiristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) with the aim of developing a bioadhesive system. Glycerine is the plastifiant used to make PMV/MA insoluble. We have studied copolymer–plastifiant compatibility with differential scanning calorimetry and we have studied the influence that the solvents produce on the copolymer by infrared spectroscopy. Monolayer experiments were carried out with a Wilhelmy-type surface balance. The purpose of these experiments is to obtain molecular information about interaction PMV/MA–glycerine system with DMPC. The results show that there are attractive forces and it is a spontaneous process.

This paper investigates the topology selection of the current resonant converter for bidirectional applications. The current resonant converter has several topologies which categorized switch network construction and resonant network construction. It is important that the topology is selected suitable for each application from several circuit topologies. In this paper, the operating characteristics are discussed in detailed in order to evaluate the appropriateness for each application. Moreover, the applicable topology is selected from detail operating characteristics.

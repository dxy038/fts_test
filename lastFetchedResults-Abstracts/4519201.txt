The main aim of this work is to adapt the ratio-technique for snow cover mapping developed for C-band to the X-band and high resolution COSMO-SkyMed images. This algorithm, aimed at detecting wet snow, is based on the difference in backscattering coefficients between snow- covered areas in winter images and snow-free summer images. For these purposes, a series of COSMO-SkyMed acquisitions (Stripmap PingPong mode, dual polarizations VV-VH) has been planned and acquired over the test site located in South Tyrol (Northern Italy) in correspondence of the melting and winter season. Contemporary to radar passes field campaigns have been performed. The objective is to test the sensitivity of X-band data to different snow conditions. An analysis has been carried out to find the most suitable filtering technique which allows a clearer distinction of distributions of backscattering coefficients of snow-covered and snow-free areas. Based on this analysis a first map of snow from the images acquired on 26-27 April 2010 (wet snow) was derived and compared with snow cover area derived from LANDSAT ETM+ of 20-04-2010 based on NDSI. Further statistical analysis will be carried out also considering the new acquisitions.

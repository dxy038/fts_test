Introduction: Certain periods of development of the nervous system are critically vulnerable to environmental insults because of the processes involved that cycle very quickly. Morphologic and functional development of mastication occurs coincidently during these stages. Early environmental insults during critical periods can cause permanent effects on both structures and functions of organic systems that can have lasting repercussions in adulthood. Objective: In this study, we investigated, through a literature review, the possible effects of perinatal calorie and/or protein low diet on structural and physiological development of mastication. Design: A systematic literature search was conducted from in the PUBMED electronic database. In collecting literature we used the keywords: “undernutrition” and “stomatognathic system”. Criteria used in the selection of articles for inclusion were: studies evaluating the effects of perinatal calorie and/or protein low diet on masticatory morphology and function. Exclusion criteria included, short communications and nonavailability in full text format. Conclusion: Undernutrition during critical periods of life causes changes in the key structures of masticatory function. This fact can affect the selection of essential nutrients, thereby interfering with the process of satiation.

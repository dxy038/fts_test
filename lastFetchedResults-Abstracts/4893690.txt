This paper investigates the modulation and control of a new bidirectional converter for 42V ISA system. The modulation for both rectifier and inverter is derived from the indirect space vector modulation algorithm for AC/AC matrix converter. The proposed bidirectional AC/DC power converter combines the advantages of matrix converter and Z-source inverter. The closed-loop control of input displacement angle and DC output voltage has been addressed in this paper. Experimental results are shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

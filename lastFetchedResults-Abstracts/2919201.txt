The primary objective of the work presented (a part of the MoD central staffÂ´s ST(D) 2004 programme), is to assess the suitability of mating Mascot3 with Ada. The aim was to capitalise on the results of several earlier studies by implementing a realistic real-time Ada application of non-trivial size based on a Mascot3 CIWS design and, furthermore, demonstrate the distribution of an Ada-based system over heterogeneous processors. For this project, the original CIWS design was split between host and target systems as many real Ada projects are to be distributed. The naval example chosen was thought to be sufficiently general to be able to provide information relevant to many application domains. The test scenario used was derived off-line from facilities developed by ARE. The scenario consists of a missile attack on a group of ships by several aircraft. The CIWS has to supply a labelled plan display, LPD, of the unfolding actions. Targets detected by the CIWS are automatically engaged unless vetoed by the operator. Several simpler subset scenarios were also used which were obtained by filtering the most complex version

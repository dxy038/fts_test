The accounting scientific literature pays much attention focusing on the incentives of the use of earnings management. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between Earning management and cost of equity capital in 150 Malaysian firms over the period 2000-2011. The main objective of this research is that whether or not firms manage earnings to profit from a lower cost of capital. The library method is used for gathering information and the method of multiple regressions has been used to predict this relation. To determine cost of equity growth (Gordon) model has been used, and adjusted model of Jones has been used to determine of earning management. Debt to equity ratio, firm size and return on equity were used as control variable. In general, findings from the empirical analysis indicate that the relationships between cost of equity and earning management was inverse but weak, and all control variable have significant relation with cost of equity except return on equity.

Tribocorrosion is defined as the chemical–electrochemical–mechanical process leading to degradation of materials in tribological contact immersed in a corrosive environment. Degradation results from the combined action of corrosion and mechanical loading and it is well-known that synergistic effects can accentuate the wear–corrosion rate. While the role of lubrication in reducing wear has been identified, there are still some key unanswered questions in relation to the importance of wear/corrosion interactions. In this study in situ electrochemical measurements have been made to isolate corrosion and corrosion-enhanced wear/tribology damage mechanisms on high carbon CoCrMo and low carbon CoCrMo alloys. Tests are carried out in three different biological solutions: 50% calf bovine serum, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) and 0.36% NaCl solution at 37 °C with the specific objective being to attempt to isolate the effects of proteins and amino acid species in wear–corrosion. In this paper, a detailed analysis of corrosion/wear interactions is presented, which facilitates discussion of exactly how corrosion and wear processes interact and the role of the lubricating fluid in this respect.

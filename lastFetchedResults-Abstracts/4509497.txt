We solve a class of convex multi-objective programming problems using aggregate homotopy method. By the means of aggregate function, we transform a multi-objective programming problem with constrains into a uniobjective programming problem with a single constrain. Combined homotopy interior-point method is used to solve the single-object optimization problem; the minimal weak efficient solution of the multi-objective optimization problem has been obtained by path tracking.

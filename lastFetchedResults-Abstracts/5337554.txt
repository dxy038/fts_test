In this paper, a reconfigurable power amplifier (PA) fully integrated in 65-nm CMOS technology, combining Envelope Tracking (ET) and Power Transistor Switching (PTS) techniques, and robust to battery depletion is presented. The main objective of the proposed architecture is to significantly improve the average efficiency in comparison with a stand-alone power amplifier at power back-off. A distributed active transformer (DAT) is also implemented to recombine power generated by the parallelized power cells which can be turned on/off in response to the desired output power. Simulations were conducted in the 3GPP LTE band at 2.535GHz to validate the proposed implementation. Results show that the proposed topology provides higher power added efficiency (PAE) and reduced current consumption at power back-off compared to a stand-alone PA. The most significant improvement is obtained at 9 dB back-off from 27.5dBm where PAE is improved by 8%.

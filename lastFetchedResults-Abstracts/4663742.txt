A new transmission planning methodology using genetic algorithms (GAs) is proposed. This identifies the optimal transmission network over an extended time horizon based on the expected pattern of electricity demand and generation sources. A computer code has been developed and tested on a simplified UK Network model with 23 nodes and 49 possible wayleaves. Simulation tests have been subdivided into different categories according to the objective function of the optimum network. It is found that the GA model is applicable to the transmission planning problem

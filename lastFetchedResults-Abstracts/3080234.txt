In this paper, we present a novel multi-objective evolutionary clustering approach using variable-length real jumping genes genetic algorithms (VRJGGA). The proposed algorithm that extends jumping genes genetic algorithm (JGGA) (Man et al., 2004) evolves near-optimal clustering solutions using multiple clustering criteria, without a-priori knowledge of the actual number of clusters. Experimental results based on several artificial and real-world data show that VRJGGA can obtain non-dominated and near-optimal clustering solutions in terms of different cluster quality measures and classification performance

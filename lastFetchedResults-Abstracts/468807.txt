Objective
This study investigates the role of male sexual partners and relationships in determining whether women seek emergency contraception (EC) when needed.
Study design
Data on EC use from a clinic-based sample of sexually active women, aged 15 to 30 years, in the San Francisco Bay area (n = 497) were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression analysis.
Results
Results show that factors measuring power dynamics, such as male dominant decision making (odds ratio [OR] = 4.1, P = .035) and pressure for sex (OR = 2.7, P = .006), as well as a strong desire to avoid pregnancy on the part of the male partner (OR = 4.2, P â‰¤ .001), have a significant association with the use of EC. However, relationship factors known to be associated with use of other contraceptive methods, such as communication, satisfaction, and commitment, show no association with EC use.
Conclusion
Factors predicting EC use, including male partner and relationship factors, may not always be evident to a clinician, so it is important to include EC as part of routine counseling.

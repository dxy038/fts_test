The objective of this contribution is the formulation and algorithmic treatment of a phenomenological framework to capture anisotropic geometrically nonlinear inelasticity. We consider in particular the coupling of viscoplasticity with anisotropic continuum damage whereby both, proportional and kinematic hardening are taken into account. As a main advantage of the proposed formulation standard continuum damage models with respect to a fictitious isotropic configuration can be adopted and conveniently extended to anisotropic continuum damage. The key assumption is based on the introduction of a damage tangent map that acts as an affine pre-deformation. Conceptually speaking, we deal with an Euclidian space with respect to a non-constant metric. The evolution of this field is directly related to the degradation of the material and allows the modeling of specific classes of elastic anisotropy. In analogy to the damage mapping we introduce an internal variable that determines a back-stress tensor via a hyperelastic format and therefore enables the incorporation of plastic anisotropy. Several numerical examples underline the applicability of the proposed finite strain framework.

METHODS: 100 patients with UA and diagnosis of CHF or PIE who had ischemic changes in their EKG with regard to occurrence of MI or cardiac death and serum Ctpn-I level were followed in a 6 week period. The incidence of MI and cardiac death in elevated Ctpn-I and normal groups were compared and analysed statistically.
FINDINGS: From 100 selected patients, 24 cases had positive elevated level of serum Ctpn-I who 6 of them had MI or died and among 76 cases, only 3 of them had MI or died (RR=6.33).

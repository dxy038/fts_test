This paper proposes the implementation of a novel controller based on a Recurrent Neural Network and PID controller for a Rotational Inverted pendulum. The objective of the controller is to determine the control strategy to stabilize the pendulum angle. Normally, the pendulum is a move towards an uncontrolled state. The Rotational Inverted pendulum by RNN controller and PID controller are analyzed in detail. This paper presents an investigation problem for stabilizing the RIP using Genetic Algorithm (GA), which can guide the control design for a nonlinear model. The result shows that both controllers are capable of controlling the Rotational Inverted pendulum system successfully, as shown in the simulation results.

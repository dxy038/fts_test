The authors examine the feasibility of using robotics on the flight line. The objective is to develop the capabilities and technologies to perform aircraft ground-support functions more efficiently using fewer personnel. This could enhance future sortie-generation capabilities by assisting ground crews in the preparation of mission-ready aircraft. The proposed system would also encompass many types of fighters and transports in the US Air Force inventory and consider both fixed-hangar and bare-base scenarios. Ground refueling using aerial refueling tactics was selected as the initial turnaround candidate because of its frequency, impact on sortie generation, availability of hardware, and the fact that in-flight refueling receptacles are standard equipment on all tactical and strategic aircraft. This makes refueling ideal for robotics

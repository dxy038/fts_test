Operations assignment to feasible and suitable machine-tool combination affects the total production costs and selecting the best combinations is important for these systems, this is one of the significant problems in flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs). In this paper, minimizing the machining cost, setup cost and material handling cost for the given multi-objective problem is considered. Also, this problem is solved with a grouping genetic algorithm and the associated results are presented.

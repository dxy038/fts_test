The main objective of this study is to provide a model for the formation of emerging technological innovation system in Iranian Biotechnology Sector. In this qualitative and quantitative research, the historical development of formation of biotechnology sector has been analyzed using the functional approach of Technological Innovation System (TIS) concept. 
Various ways for collecting and analyzing data have been used (literature review, analysis of policy documents, expert opinions, interviews with officials, questionnaire-based survey from activists in the sector) to find the main functions and activities in the formation phase of this emerging sector. Using historical data mapping, the evolution of different functions and activities has been charted. Using factor analysis and structural equation modeling on the 103 questionnaires, functions and activities of conceptual model were confirmed and the causal relationships between different functions were mapped. Based on the study results, 7 functions and several activities have been identified for the formation of emerging technological innovation systems in Iran. 
The historical analysis of these functions and activities indicated that government has a key role through influencing the functions such as guidance of research and innovation, supply and institutional building and legalization. This key role gradually causes other system functions such as knowledge creation, knowledge diffusion, market formation and entrepreneurship, which leads to the formation of technological innovation system in Iranian Biotechnology Sector. 
Therefore, the functions and activities that have done by the government were the main drivers of formation and development of such these sectors in Iran; it also led to the development of knowledge and market capacities leading to better formation of this sector.

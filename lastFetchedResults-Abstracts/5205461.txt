Successful execution of ICT-supported unified process of offshore outsourcing (ICT-SUPOO) of software development can offer various important benefits. However, ICT-SUPOO of software development is very complex and risky, and often fails. Almost no empirical studies are available on the risk factors that affect the ICT-SUPOO. The objective of this study is to investigate the key risk factors associated with ICT-SUPOO, understand how they create risks, and how the risks can be alleviated. We carry out a multiple case study from both of the vendorpsilas and clientpsilas sites, where professionals with extensive experience in managing offshore outsourcing of software development were interviewed. Through an in-depth empirical research, we identify a list of risks that affect the success of such projects, analyze how they create risks, and which strategies were implemented by our case companies to alleviate these risks. By using the research results, companies can facilitate successful completion of the ICT-supported offshore outsourcing of software development projects while avoiding the key risks.

Biomedical implants require wireless power and bidirectional data transfer. We pursue our previous work on a novel topology for a multiple carrier inductive link by presenting the fabricated coils. We show that the coplanar geometry approach is better suited for displacement tolerance. We provide a theoretical analysis of the efficiency of power transfer and phase-shift-keying communications through an inductive link. An efficiency of up to 61% has been achieved experimentally for power transfer and a data rate of 4.16 Mb/s with a bit-error rate of less than 2 ?? 10<sup>-6</sup> has been obtained with our fabricated offset quadrature phase-shift keying modules due to the inductive link optimization presented in this paper.

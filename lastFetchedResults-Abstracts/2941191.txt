A novel approach for designing multiplierless FIR filters for digital quadrature demodulators is presented. The filter coefficients are designed using a two-stage search strategy involving the use of an objective function which considers both the ripple and matching of the in-phase and quadrature filter pass band frequency responses. The results obtained provide evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed design method

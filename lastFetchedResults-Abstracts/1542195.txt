In rhetorical subjects, ‘simile’ has been considered as the primary image-creating factor. Perhaps it could be assumed as the most primitive and simple kind of imaginings because its understanding is accomplished more easily than the other imaginings.
‘Simile’ is known to be the main basis and theme of some of the other imaginings understanding of which absolutely involves understanding and perception of ‘simile’.
    The purpose of the present research is to investigate and know ‘simile’, its fundamentals, and subdivisions as one of the basic and distinguished imaginings in the rhetoric, according to the divisions of ‘simile’ in the realm of traditional rhetoric and scientists’ viewpoints.
Since the audience are lingually and temporally more familiar with the contemporary poetry, ‘Travlog of Cyclone’, a collection of poems versified by the contemporary poet, the late Seyed Hassan Hoseini, was chosen, and using the analytical-descriptive method, together with examples, tables, and statistical figures, underwent criticism and investigation. 
The findings of the research suggest that in 267 existing similes in the mentioned collection, Hoseini has taken advantage of ‘simile’ in his artistic rhetoric and has created simple, objective, tangible, and comprehensive images.

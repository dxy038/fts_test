This paper addresses the reliability impact of connecting IPPs to the part of a radial supply system having relatively poor reliability. Conceptually, adding a switching substation to a radial system can have a negative impact on the system reliability. The study presented in this paper quantifies the reliability impact of two different station configurations to which the IPPs are connected. The reliability of a three breaker ring bus configuration and a two breaker bus configuration is evaluated based on available information and specific assumptions. The comparison between the two substation configurations is made. How to select an appropriate station configuration for connecting IPPs to help achieve the BCTC reliability objective in the future is also discussed.

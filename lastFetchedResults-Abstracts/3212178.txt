In 2006 the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Joint Internet Protocol Modem (JIPM) Product Management Office (PMO) took the initiative to define a standard interoperable IP modem with transmission security. One of the prime motivations was to reduce the costs associated with operating the relatively large number of different proprietary IP modems with similar performance and capabilities, performing similar functions, which are inefficiently consuming precious Military Satellite Communication (MILSATCOM) bandwidth. In March 2010, the Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) organization released DVB Document A155-1 in support of Second Generation DVB Interactive Satellite System (DVB-RCS2), with a similar objective brought forth by commercial satellite operators to reduce equipment costs by promoting economies of scale and increased interoperable solutions among IP modem vendors, while also lowering operational costs through increases in power and bandwidth efficiencies. Recently, the commercial market has started to express a need for transmission security (TRANSEC), which DVB-RCS2 aims to provide through a more effective and interoperable TRANSEC capability. The JIPM Interoperability Document was released in September 2010 through a Request for Information (RFI) to the IP modem industry. As a result of this exercise, the JIPM PMO has recognized an increased acceptance by the commercial industry in support of DVB-RCS2. This paper will evaluate the potential impacts of transitioning JIPM to DVB-RCS2, including an assessment as to whether DVB-RCS2 meets the objectives of the JIPM PMO<sup>1</sup>.

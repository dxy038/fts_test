Objective
quid (BQ) components induce the secretion of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in oral keratinocytes, which promotes oral mucosal inflammation and oral cancer. This study was carried out to evaluate the association of TNFA genetic variants (−308G&gt;A and −238G&gt;A) with the risk and prognosis of BQ-related oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC).

l of 403 subjects (205 cancer cases and 198 healthy controls) who habitually chewed BQ were recruited. The genotypes were determined by TaqMan real-time assays.
s
le and G/G genotype at TNFA −308 were associated with a 1.95-fold (95%CI: 1.16–3.28, pcorrected = 0.024) and 2.28-fold (95%CI: 1.30–4.00, pcorrected = 0.008) increased risk of cancer as compared to those with A allele or A/A + A/G genotypes, respectively. In addition, G allele (p = 0.080) and G/G genotype (p = 0.076) at TNFA −238 were associated with a borderline but statistically significant increased risk of OPSCC. The combined G/G + G/G genotype at both loci had a 2.37-fold increased risk of OPSCC as compared to those with other combined genotypes (95%CI: 1.41–4.00, p = 0.001). Interactions between combined genotypes and smoking status were also found to contribute to risk of BQ-related OPSCC. There was no association of TNFA genotypes with clinicopathologic findings or the survival of OPSCC patients.
sions
wers who carry the G allele or G/G genotype in TNFA −308 may have an increased risk of OPSCC. The intensity of cigarette smoking modulates the effect of the combined TNFA genotypes on risk of BQ-related OPSCC.

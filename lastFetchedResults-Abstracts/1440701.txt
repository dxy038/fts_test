The objective of this work is to evaluate the dealumination via ammonium hexafluorosilicate treatment as an effective method for enhancing the catalytic performance of H-Y zeolite in chlorinated VOC oxidative destruction. A series of Y zeolites with various Si/Al ratios was prepared from a commercial sample and then tested for the catalytic decomposition of 1,2-dichloroethane as a model reaction. In general, these modified Y zeolites exhibited a higher activity than that of the parent material, the zeolite subjected to 50% dealumination resulting the most active catalyst. This increase in activity was associated with the development of strong acidity due to dealumination. Likewise, 50% dealuminated sample showed an improved catalytic behaviour for the destruction of other typical chlorinated pollutants, namely, dichloromethane (DCM) and trichloroethylene (TCE). The ease of destruction was found to follow this trend: 1,2-dichloroethane &gt; dichloromethane &gt; trichloroethylene.

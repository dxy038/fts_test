Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine compliance with postmolar pregnancy surveillance in our indigent population. Study Design: Data for all women who were diagnosed with molar pregnancy from January 1996 through December 2000 were entered prospectively into a database. After remission, postmolar pregnancy surveillance was continued for 6 months. Patients whose condition required chemotherapy for gestational trophoblastic tumor had 12 months of follow-up. Medical records were reviewed. Results: Molar pregnancies occurred in 121 women: 103 Hispanic women (85%), 12 African American women (10%), and 6 white women (5%). Eighty-two women (68%) achieved remission without chemotherapy; 23 women (19%) were lost to follow-up without achieving remission, and 16 women (13%) had gestational trophoblastic tumor. Fifty-six Hispanic women (54%) completed postmolar pregnancy surveillance, compared with two African American women (11%, P< .01). Hispanic patients who were fluent in Spanish only were more likely to complete follow-up than bilingual Hispanic patients (62% vs 41%, P< .01). Conclusion: Hispanic women who were fluent in Spanish only were most likely to complete the recommended postmolar human chorionic gonadotropin surveillance. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:1151-3.)

This paper presents the results of a survey of methods for calculating transmission line conductor surface voltage gradients. The main objective of this survey is to obtain comparative data on the accuracy and the computational aspects of the different methods presently in use for calculating conductor surface voltage gradients. A total of thirteen typical transmission line configurations has been selected for the survey which elicited worldwide response. In addition to an analysis of the results, the paper also presents a brief review of the existing methods of calculation and a discussion of the accuracy requirements from a practical point of view.

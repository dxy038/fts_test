This paper presents a multi-objective optimal dispatch model based on optimal power flow with the thyristor controlled series capacitor (TCSC) and load static voltage characteristic. The proposed model is formulated as multi-objective optimal power flow (MOPF) problem with competing pool purchase cost, pollution emission and active power losses impact objectives. The minimize of the pool purchase cost, pollution emission and active power losses are solved individually in order to define the membership function of objective, then, the multi-objective problem is reformulated into a new standard nonlinear problem by the fuzzy sets theory and max-min operator, finally, it is solved by interior point method and the results that match with multiobjective problem is gained. The effect of TCSC on the optimal dispatch is also investigated in this paper. The test results show that the proposed model more match with the power system operation and can ensure the multi-factor impartiality of Generation Company. The test results also show that incorporation of TCSC can not only utilize the existing lines, but also change the results of optimal dispatch of power system

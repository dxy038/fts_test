In the latest development of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) communication system, the system performance can be distracted by the frequency offsets (FOs) which can demolish the orthogonality of the subcarriers, increases the inter-carrier interference (ICI) and intensely deteriorate the system performance. As a result, Intercarrier Interference Self-Cancellation (ICI-SC) has been applied in numerous OFDM systems as a simple and impressive approach to overcome ICI. ICI not only diminish yet maximum frequency diversity can also be achieved by manipulating the Space Time Frequency Block Codes (STFBCs) that use spatial, time and frequency diversities which is implemented in the OFDM system. Hence, the objective of this paper is to evaluate Pair-Wise Error Probability (PEP) performance using STFBC MIMO-OFDM ICI-SC technique with a novel quarter subcarrier mapping (new) data conversion method to diminish ICI due to FO. The simulation results expressively show that the quarter method subcarrier mapping technique can provide the best system performance compared to the symmetric and adjacent methods. Hence, by using this suggested technique, maximum diversity order with an efficient bandwidth can be achieved and ICI can be reduced.

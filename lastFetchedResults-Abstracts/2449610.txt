<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To compare efficacy, safety and tolerance of combination of mifepristone and misoprostol versus misoprostol-only in induction of late intrauterine fetal death (IUFD).<br /><strong>Materials and methods: </strong>This prospective study included a consecutive series of 52 women gravid up to fourth with IUFD after 28 weeks of gestation between January 2008 and June 2011. Women were divided into two groups. First group of women received a single oral dose of 200mg mifepristone, and after 24 hours, 100ug of intravaginal misoprostol was administered, followed by intravaginal 100µg misoprostol at four hourly intervals if required. Second group of women received 100 µg misoprostol at four hourly interval per vaginally (maximum 600µg in 24 hours). Oxytocin was given for augmentation if needed.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>The induction-to-delivery time was shorter with the combination regimen (p &lt; 0.001) group. The total dose of misoprostol needed was lower in the group pre-treated with mifepristone (p &lt; 0.001). Oxytocin was required only in misoprostol group. The two groups did not differ as regards complications experienced during labor and delivery significantly.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong>Both regimens, misoprostol-only and the combination of mifepristone and misoprostol are safe in induction of labor after intrauterine fetal death (IUFD). Pre-treatment with mifepristone is more effective in terms of reducing of induction delivery interval, requirement of lesser dose of misoprostol and no need of augmentation with oxytocin.</p>

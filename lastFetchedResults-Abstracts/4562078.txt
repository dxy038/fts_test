For the path search problem whose objective is maximal average horizon, the traditional algorithms are unsuitable due to the characteristic of the problem. This paper presents a method based on evolutionary algorithm, which may rapidly get the optimal solution by designing multiple effective evolutionary operators and self-adaptively adjusting the probability of each mutator. Experiments show that the method presented is superior to the simulated annealing algorithm.

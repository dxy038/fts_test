Background and Objective: Adiponectin plays an important role in hyperglycemia, lipolysis, and inflammatory mechanisms.  However, mechanisms responsible for the relationship between adiponectin and insulin resistance in response to exercise, still remains unclear.  The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a six-week-long high intensity interval training (HIIT) on plasma adiponectin levels, insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance, and B-cells function in sedentary young men.
Materials and Methods: Eighteen students voluntarily participated in the study and were randomly divided into two groups: Experimental (n=9, age=24.33 ±1.41 yr, height=176.22 ±4.91 cm, weight=72.27 ±6.59 kg) and Control (n=9, age=23.27 ±2.01 yr, height=180.22 ±6.88 cm, weight=76.27 ±7.33 kg) groups.  The test group performed three HIIT sessions per week for 6 weeks.  Each session consisted of four to six repeats of maximal sprint running within a 20-m area with 30 s recoveries.  Fasting blood samples were collected immediately before and after the exercise protocol.  Data were analyzed by dependent and paired t-tests.
Results: The results indicates that while plasma adiponectin levels in the experimental group increased significantly (P= 0.047), there was a significant decrease in the percentage of body fat (P= 0.019).  There were also a decrease in serum concentrations of insulin, fasting glucose and insulin resistance values as well as an increase amounts of insulin sensitivity and beta cells function.  However, these changes were not statistically significant (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: Our findings show HIIT is a time efficient method for increasing adiponectin levels and reducing body fat.  Also, the intensity of exercise as an important factor in the increase in adiponectin levels could be noted.

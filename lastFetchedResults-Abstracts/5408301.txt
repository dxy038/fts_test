Research into mobile business has grown significantly over the last decade, but seemingly in a haphazard and not always rigorous fashion. This was first observed in 2003 and then borne out by an in-depth analysis of hundreds of m-business research publications in 2006. Four years on, these notions and findings still suggest that a direction of future research with a firm empirical base is needed in the first instance. The research should, furthermore, also be tightly coupled with an equally firm objective to theory building in this ever more important sector of information and communications technology. This paper presents the argument that the Grounded Theory method of qualitative research combines both of these essential fiats. It has the rigour and empirical grounding demanded and aims exclusively at generating theory in domains where there are few. A research agenda based on the Grounded Theory methodology is set out and recommendations for future research directions and collaborations are offered for discussion.

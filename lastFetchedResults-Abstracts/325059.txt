The goal of this study was to compare insomniacs with and without objective verification, on the basis of sleep parameters, personality, and performance. An insomniac complaint group was subclassified as objective insomniac (OI) or subjective insomniac (SI) and compared to a non-complaint group. Groups did not differ on night sleep variables or daytime sleep latency measures; rather, a consistent sleep tendency was revealed for all three groups. The poorer the previous night of sleep, the longer the daytime sleep latencies. Groups differed on subjective measures of conscious state during the day. SIs inaccurately estimated sleep/wake state in comparison to objective measures on the MSLT, whereas OIs were accurate in their estimations. Personality scores showed trends that suggested greater neuroticism for SIs and introversion for OIs. Results demonstrated subjective tendencies and related personality types that may help in the understanding of the complaint of insomnia with and without objective findings.

A measurement procedure is explained which makes the combination of simple simulations, broadband and frequency-selective electromagnetic measurements to check in a practical way if a base station site complies with restrictions regarding the exposure to electromagnetic radiation. The measuring method enables the accurate and objective control of a base station site in a practical and reliable way. The procedure provides a consistency check and makes it possible to reconsider the compliance of a site when slight changes are made to the transmitters of the base station antennas or when new restrictions are issued. In this paper the procedure has been applied to a realistic case and it is shown that the method is easily executed while being accurate and and unambiguous.

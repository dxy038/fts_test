This paper presents a robust method for semi-deterministic topology and geometry design of trusses supporting distributed loads, giving due considerations to the load domain. The load-bearing nodes are not treated as basic nodes and the number and location of these nodes are considered as design variables. These quantities affect both the truss and the distributed load domains. The method developed for the integrated design of trusses supporting distributed loads is based on introducing a new parameter that can be treated as an additional design objective or constraint in truss design problems. This parameter can be used as a reliable substitute for the load domain objectives in a semi-deterministic integrated design. A case study is carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed design method.

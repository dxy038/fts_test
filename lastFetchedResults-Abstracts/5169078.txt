From the perspective of system science, multiple objectives of a construction project can be regarded as a system. The degree of coordination of the objective system is improved by multi-objective synergy optimization. The concepts of efficacy coefficient and the extent of system coordination are introduced, sub-objective system efficacy function of cost, time, quality and resources are set up separately and an optimization model of coordination extent of objective system of construction project is proposed accordingly. A new algorithm is employed to conduct the model optimization. After introducing the basic theory of the algorithms, a numerical example is given.

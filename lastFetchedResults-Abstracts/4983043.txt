Different concepts of controller design for DC/DC converters based on fuzzy logic are presented. Since the performance of a fuzzy controller depends on the choice of membership functions and the inference of fuzzy rules, it does not require an accurate mathematical model of a power converter. Furthermore, the fuzzy set theory, in nature, is capable of coping with a nonlinear system. The fuzzy controllers, thus, have an advantage in resolving the time-varying nonlinear nature of switches in DC/DC converters. The objective of this paper is to design a fuzzy controller for basic DC/DC converters and then compare the computer simulation results with that of the current-mode control in buck, boost and buck/boost converters in respect to the start-up transient response and load regulation

In this paper, Fuzzy-based voltage control in a realistic distribution system that is a part of the North Delta Electricity Distribution Company network in Egypt is concerned. This system includes tap-changed main transformer, synchronous condenser and feeders switched capacitors whose operation is to be coordinated. The imprecise linguistic expressions associated to practical operation are treated via fuzzy sets. First, the objective function and constraints are formulated in terms of fuzzy sets. Then, a direct search optimization technique is adopted to solve the problem to determine the optimal dispatching schedule of the main transformer tap position, feeders capacitors on/off status and synchronous condenser reactive power on hour-by-hour basis throughout the day. Extensive results are discussed while comparing the proposed voltage control strategy versus two others.

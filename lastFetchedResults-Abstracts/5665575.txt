For pt.I see ibid., p.919-24, (2000)). This paper continues part I to develop models and solutions for printed circuit board (PCB) assembly sequence and feeder assignment problems in the case of Tchebyshev robot arm motion. The problem is decomposed into sub-problems of feeder assignment and assembly sequence separately and the combined one under different scenarios of machine settings. The analysis of the problem leads to a number of nonlinear multiple objective decision making (MODM) models. These models are linearized and solved by heuristics using the solution procedure in part I and some standard techniques

Currently, laser cladding by powder (LCP) is an emergent non-traditional process of components repair with potential application in several industries. This paper presents a study to evaluate the effect of the processing parameters (laser power, scanning velocity and powder mass flow rate) under the geometric form of clad. A plan of experiments was established considering laser cladding by powder with prefixed processing parameters in substrate 100 Mn Cr W4 (DIN) steel plates. The objective was to establish a model using multiple regression analysis (MRA) between processing parameters and the form of single-cladding layer (clad height, clad width and depth penetration into the substrate). In addition, confirmation tests were performed to make a comparison with the foreseen results from the mentioned model. Finally, two industrial applications of components repair are presented.

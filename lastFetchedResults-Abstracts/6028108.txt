Multiview video plus depth (MVD) is a new 3D video format that would support 3D video applications. The primary goals are the high-quality reconstruction of an arbitrary number of views for 3D television (3DTV) and free viewpoint television (FTV). Its quality depends highly on the quality of depth image, a depth compression base B-spline interpolation is proposed for MVD to improve the 3D video coding (3DVC). The depth map is down sampling prior to multiview video coding (MVC) encoding and up sampling after decoding. The results investigated by objective as well as subjective evaluations over several multi-view test sequences imply that the proposed methods reduce the bit-rate for depth coding and achieve better rendering quality.

Current standards for indoor comfort are based on studies of adults, but they also apply to
children, even though children differ in terms of metabolic rates, clothing types, activity levels, and preferences
in space arrangement. Children are also more sensitive to a range of environmental factors, they are usually
unable to interact with their environment, and they accept indoor conditions passively. This study aims to
extend research into indoor environmental quality (IEQ) for children by providing analysis, measurements and
surveys carried out in an Italian primary school. Continuous monitoring was combined with a detailed spot
monitoring campaign, during which pupils completed a questionnaire so that subjective and objective evaluations
could be compared. Thermal comfort was also evaluated by comparing pupils’ sensations based on the two
most common approaches: the heat balance and adaptive comfort models. Tests revealed that there was no
clear, uniform correspondence between subjective response and acoustic and thermal measurements. Children
reacted actively to discomfort, suggesting that they should be allowed to interact with their environment.
Building acoustics were also measured in order to evaluate the insulating properties of building elements. The
following tests were conducted: façade sound insulation, sound insulation of the vertical and horizontal
partitions between classrooms, and the impact levels between overlapped classrooms. Reverberation time and
background noise were measured in unoccupied, furnished classrooms after school hours. Impulse response
and Speech Transmission Index (STI) measurements were also performed in one classroom.

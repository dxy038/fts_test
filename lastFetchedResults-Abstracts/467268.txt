Objective: This survey was conducted to determine the practice patterns of gynecologists in Canada regarding the discontinuation of oral contraceptives before gynecologic surgical procedures. Study design: In May and June of 1997, surveys were sent to all obstetricians and gynecologists on the mailing list of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada. Results: Of the 1472 surveys that were sent, 702 of the surveys were completed and returned, for a response rate of 48%. More than 90% of the gynecologists who were surveyed would advise their patients to continue using oral contraceptives before relatively minor surgical procedures and <1% of them would use low-dose heparin before these procedures. Rates of oral contraceptive discontinuation increased as the extent of the surgical intervention increased: Prolonged laparoscopy (39.8%), vaginal repairs and hysterectomy (54.7%), and abdominal hysterectomy or adnexectomy (56.1%). Just over one half of the gynecologists (56.1%) indicated that they would advise discontinuation â‰¥4 weeks before the surgical procedure, which is the minimum time required for the prothrombotic changes that are associated with oral contraceptive use to return to baseline. Less than 10% of the surgeons indicated that they would use low-dose heparin even when the patient was advised to continue taking oral contraceptives before major surgical procedures. Conclusion: The controversy over whether young healthy women should discontinue oral contraceptive use before major surgical procedures that are associated with immobility is reflected by a lack of consensus among gynecologists in Canada.

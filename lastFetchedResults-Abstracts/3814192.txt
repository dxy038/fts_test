Ghana has recognized the need for efficient and reliable telecommunication services. The widespread availability of these services will promote the nation´s economic advancement and the decentralization of the government´s activities. To achieve the objective of bringing telecommunications to all the people of Ghana, private sector participation is considered essential as a source of management skills, technology, and financing that will be required for the provision of services. In order to attract such participation, Ghana is putting in place the necessary policy, institutional, and regulatory frameworks to create an enabling environment for private sector investment in the telecommunication sector.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

A perfect field safety record continues from these developments: 1) Determination of the threshold-energy (system safety) rating of several pyrotechnic devices via an advanced pulse technique. A 1 ampere, 1 watt power rating is incomplete and has no direct relationship to threshold energy levels. 2) Evolvement of an unconventional system circuit and logic design. 3) Continued field safety assessment using the Hughes stray energy monitor. It provides a simple, objective go, no-go indication of system safety.

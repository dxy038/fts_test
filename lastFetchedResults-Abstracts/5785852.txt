The structure and size of Articulated Dump Truck´s final drive greatly impacted on the car´s dynamic and economic performance. With the objective function of the smallest volume for final drive, to meet conditions with the contact strength, bending strength and boundary constraint, it built the articulated dump truck´s final drive optimum design mathematical model. To use Adaptive simulated annealing algorithm as optimization strategy and the articulated dump truck final drive as an example. The results showed that the method could obtain optimal solution of the structure, effectively reduce the dimensions of the final drive, and proved the correctness and feasibility of the method. It has important theoretical and practical engineering significance.

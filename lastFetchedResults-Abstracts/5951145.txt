A high-power PWM (pulse-width-modulated) force-commutated power converter with DC voltage source is studied. The converter makes it possible to control the bidirectional power exchange between the AC mains and the DC source. Furthermore, the use of PWM techniques will make it possible to control the harmonic spectrum on the AC line. The principle of the active and reactive power control is first presented. The modeling of the system in relation to the DC voltage control (i.e., active power control) and reactive power control is considered. Some numerical simulation results are presented in order to confirm the analytical study. Finally, experimental results obtained through a real scale prototype are given. The four quadrant operation of the converter in the <e1>P</e1>-<e1>Q</e1> plane is verified experimentally

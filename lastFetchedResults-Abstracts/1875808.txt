OBJECTIVE: To identify and explore the learning and support needs of patients and families during the waiting period before cardiac surgery.

: Prospective, cross-sectional cohort survey design.

G: University-affiliated tertiary cardiovascular care center in mideastern Canada.

TS: One hundred forty-seven patients currently on the cardiac surgery waiting list, and 125 family members of these patients.

E MEASURES: Needs Inventory for Patients who Wait.

ENTION: All patients were sent a survey for themselves and one for a family member that included: a demographic profile, subjective questionnaire, and the Needs Inventory for Patients who Wait. The survey was to be completed and returned to the investigators.

S: The return rates were 77% (113) for patients, and 70% (87) for family members. For patients and their family members, item rankings were highly correlated for areas in which they wanted information (r = 0.84), and for areas that caused them the most concern (r = 0.91). Family members were also concerned about caring for the patient before and after surgery. The number of weeks on the waiting list (&lt; 1 month to &gt; 6 months) did not change the concerns of patients and family.

SIONS: This survey identifies some of the educational and support needs of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and their family members. Patients are concerned about their health and survival until the surgical procedure, as well as about the success of the procedure. Families share patients concerns and have an additional concern regarding how to support the patient during the perioperative stage. The needs identified by patients and their families in this survey were found to be stable over time, and within the realm of nursing practice to address.

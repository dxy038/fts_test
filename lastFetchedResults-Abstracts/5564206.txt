This paper presents a new multispectral compact laboratory gonioreflectometer that can adequately sample bidirectional reflectance functions. It will be used for obtaining BRDF data of vegetation elements that can be applied in light transport simulations within virtual forests. In this way, future investigation and interpretation of radiation of forest canopies will be made possible.

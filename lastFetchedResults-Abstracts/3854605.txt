The objective of this paper is to develop a SPICE- compatible equivalent circuit of a thermoelectric module. A methodology is developed for extracting the parameters of the proposed model from manufacturersÂ´ data of thermoelectric coolers (TECs) and thermoelectric generators (TEGs). The model could be helpful in analyzing the drive requirements of TECs and loading effects of TEGs. The present model is compatible with PSPICE or other electric circuit simulators. An important feature of the model is its ability to generate small-signal transfer functions that can be used to design feedback networks for temperature control applications

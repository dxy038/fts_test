Objective: The objective of this article is to determine the safety and effectiveness of transvaginal sacrospinous ligament fixation as part of the management of pelvic support defects in a residency program.
Study Design: A retrospective chart review of patients undergoing sacrospinous ligament fixation at the Division of Gynecology, Jackson Memorial Hospital, University of Miami School of Medicine, between July 1990 and December 1995, was performed. Patients with vaginal vault prolapse and uterine prolapse with documented preoperative evaluation were included in this study. Data were obtained using a detailed predetermined flow sheet.
Results: A total of 160 patients was included in the study. All patients underwent right sacrospinous ligament fixation, anterior and posterior colporrhaphy, and perineorrhaphy. In addition, 31 (19%) underwent enterocele repair, 5 (3%) underwent trachelectomy, and 9 (6%) underwent Burch procedure. Complications included fever 13 (8.1%), urinary tract infection 16 (10%), blood loss requiring transfusion 7 (4.3%), sciatic neuralgia 2 (1.2%), and rectovaginal fistula 2 (1.2%). The mean follow-up was 40 months (range 18 to 78 months). The success of the operation was gauged by recurrence. Ninety-four percent of the patients had no evidence of vaginal vault prolapse on follow-up, and 85% had no recurrence of any pelvic support defect. Eleven of the 24 patients with recurrence underwent repeat surgery, whereas 13 opted for conservative management with pessaries.
Conclusion: Transvaginal unilateral sacrospinous ligament fixation is a safe and successful operation for the treatment of pelvic support defect and should be an essential component in the training of gynecologic residents.

Because of the evolution of technology and consequently, the development of advanced techniques, related to signal analysis and digitalization, has increased the use of data from brain electrical activity in clinical analysis and in researches, for example, with the use of the quantitative electroencephalography (EEGq). This is based in techniques of digital signal processing, such as, statistical analysis, transforming to the frequency domain, prediction and others. The topographic quantitative EEG (EEGQT) allows the creation of a scalp image showing the activity in many regions of the brain based on the quantitative analysis of the EEG signal. It gives an accurate graphical vision of the electrical activity, as well their localizations and alterations. The existing EEGQT software is based on the signal analysis on the frequency domain and gives a two-dimensional vision of the cortical activity. To obtain a more reliable EEGQT in real time, it would be important a three-dimensional mapping of the cortex. The main objective of this work is to present a proposal of architecture of a computational system capable to generate a three-dimensional brain mapping based not only on the frequency domain analysis, but in other characteristics of the EEG signals, such as, the similarity, stationarity, frequency, entropy and the signal linearity.

Background and Objective: Success rate of IVF depends on infertility factors and its treatment cycle. Different methods of treatment and different centers have reported various rates of success. The aim of this study was to evaluate the fertility outcome after IVF and related factors.

Data was collected by a questionnaire including woman's age, husband's age, infertility factor, spermogram, infertility period, the number of follicles caused by treatment, the number of oocytes, the number of produced and transferred fetus and treatment outcomes. Data was analyzed by SPSS software and Chi-square, t-studen test, One-way ANOVA and logistic regression.
Results: The mean age of women was 29.7+5.4. The meanÂ±SD follicles oocytes and transferred fetus were 11+6, 6+3.9 and 2.6+1.5 respectively. There was significant relation between the number of follicles (P<0.05), obtained oocytes (P<0.05) and transfered fetus (P<0.05) with the success rate of IVF. The fertility rate was 24.6%. There was no significant relation between the age groups and fertility rate.

This article consists on measuring bio-impedance that reflects biological and clinical information useful for the tissue characterization and diseases detection etc... The objective of this article is to adapt the programmable impedance meter AD5933/34EBZ for measuring bioimpedance by the tetra-polar configuration. This method allows direct measurement of the impedance of the sample without the electrode impedances and impedance of interface skin/electrode. This paper also allows to overcome the drawbacks of the evaluation kit and to set the parameters of the various components of the adaptation circuit.

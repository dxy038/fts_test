The objective of this paper is to develop the control method using a voltage sourced converter with active filter function to suppress the maximum value of the harmonic voltages in the overall system effectively. The proposed control scheme using multiple harmonic voltages in remote sites is realized by the estimation of harmonic sensitivities in the system. It is expected that the control scheme can be applied to the system with the dynamic change of harmonic sources and so on. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme are verified by the simulations.

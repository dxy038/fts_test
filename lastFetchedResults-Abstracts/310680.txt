Objective:  This research examines individual differences in the wrist postures adopted during the use of two pointing devices (mouse and trackball).

Design: A multiple case study of twelve participants was employed.

Background: The use of pointing devices may lead to musculoskeletal discomfort and injury as a consequence of prolonged exposure to postures involving wrist extension and ulnar deviation.

Methods: Wrist flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation was measured while twelve participants completed two standardised tasks involving horizontal and vertical cursor movements respectively.

Results: Exposure to extreme ulnar deviation and wrist extension was observed in the use of computer mouse and trackball. The trackball involved decreased ulnar deviation and increased wrist extension, however considerable individual differences were observed.

Conclusions: Some users may be placed at risk of injury by prolonged exposure to the use of such devices, while others may not. A trackball may reduce the exposure to extreme ulnar deviation, but in some cases, a trackball may increase exposure to extreme wrist extension.

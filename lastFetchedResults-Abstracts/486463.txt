Background: Juniperus polycarpos L. and Juniperus communis L. are two of the most important conifers in Iran and tolerant trees against cold and drought stresses which have noticeable important in mountainous areas in Iran. In this study, the essential been tried to compare quantities and qualities characteristics of oil and efficacious materials of their female cone together has been studied.
Objective: This research is trying to quantitative and qualitative characteristics of essential oil active ingredients and compares them with material cones and evaluate.
Methods: In order to analysis of essentials oil, female cones were detected after distillation by GC-MS.
Results: The results indicated that efficacious materials of these plants were different, significantly. 
Conclusions: In J. polycarpos 30 compounds were detected that the most important of the 
4-terpine ol (17.72%), limonene (9.53%), sabinene (8.58%), γ-terpinene (8.10%) and 
δ-cadinene (7.13%) 27 compounds were identified in J. communis that the most important of them were α-pinene (46.63%), α-cedrol (12.36%), β-pinene (4.64%), 4-terpineol (2.86%) and α-terpinolen (2.45%), respectively.

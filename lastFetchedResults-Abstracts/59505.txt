The oil sands mining industry in Canada has made a commitment to reclaim mining areas to an equivalent capability to that which existed prior to mining. An essential requirement in the design of reclamation covers to meet this objective is that all covers must have a sufficient available water holding capacity (AWHC) in order to supply sufficient moisture for vegetation over the summer moisture deficit typical in the region. AWHC is currently based on static evaluations of wilting point and field capacity under a constant annual evapotranspiration demand. This paper presents an alternative probabilistic approach by which the hydrologic performance of these reclamation soil covers can be assessed. A field-calibrated water balance model is used along with the available historical meteorological record to estimate the maximum soil moisture deficit that a soil cover is able to sustain over the growing season. Frequency curves of the maximum annual moisture deficit are used to assess the probability that a cover is able to provide any particular threshold of moisture demand. The method also allows for a quantification of the predictive uncertainty of the model. The predictive uncertainty is used as a margin of safety to estimate a design value of moisture deficit for various alternative cover designs. This paper recommends procedures for a frequency-based assessment and design of reclamation soil covers in the oil sands industry. This method takes into account climatic variability as well as parameter uncertainty in estimating the soil moisture deficit.

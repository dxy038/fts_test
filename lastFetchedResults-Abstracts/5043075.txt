This paper proposes a novel approach for Quality of Experience (QoE) driven cross-layer optimization for wireless video transmission. We formulate the cross-layer optimization problem with a constraint on the temporal fluctuation of the video quality. Our objective is to minimize the temporal change of the video quality as perceivable quality fluctuations negatively affect the overall quality of experience. The proposed QoE scheme jointly optimizes the application layer and the lower layers of a wireless protocol stack. It allocates network resources and performs rate adaptation such that the fluctuations lie within the range of unperceivable changes. We determine corresponding perception thresholds via extensive subjective tests and evaluate the proposed scheme using an OPNET High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) emulator. Our simulation results show that the proposed approach leads to a noticeable improvement of overall user satisfaction for the provided video delivery service when compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

The objective of the analysis presented is to outline and validate a methodology for the optimization of MV distribution networks operation, so that variable loads are fed under minimum energy losses. Loss minimization is achieved by the installation of shunt capacitors and reconfiguration of the network. The impact of load variation and load modelling on the optimizing decisions is examined. Two different reconfiguration methods are applied and compared

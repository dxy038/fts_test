We address the problem of tracking line segments in a sequence of time varying images acquired by a camera on a robot moving in an indoor environment. Two representations for the line segments are presented and discussed, and an appropriate representation is derived. In order to achieve our objective, we combine computer vision that detect and measure motion with simple control strategies. A mathematical formulation for the model of the dynamic system is given for each parameter of line segments, and we propose to use a discrete PI controller to compute the desired motion of the robot system. The selection of the controller is based on the vision technique used for the computation of the successful visual tracking. Computer simulations evaluated the reliability and precision of the technique

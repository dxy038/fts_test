The relatively high incidence of Listeria monocytogenes in cold smoked salmon (CSS) is of concern as CSS is a ready-to-eat product. No post-processing measures are currently available to control this pathogen in CSS. The objective of this study was to develop an effective antimicrobial edible coating containing organic salts to control the growth of L. monocytogenes in CSS slices and fillets. An in-house made formulation consisting of sodium lactate (SL, 0–2.4%) and sodium diacetate (SD, 0–0.25%) as well as 2.5% OptiForm (a commercial formulation of SL and SD) were incorporated into five edible coatings: alginate, κ-carrageenan, pectin, gelatin or starch. The coatings were applied onto the surface of CSS slices inoculated with L. monocytogenes to an inoculum level of 500 CFU/cm2 (∼ 3 log CFU/g) and stored at room temperature (22 °C) for 6 days. Alginate coating was found to be the most effective carrier for the various antimicrobial treatments in inhibiting the growth of L. monocytogenes. In the second phase of the study, CSS slices and fillets inoculated with the pathogen at a level of 500 CFU/cm2 were coated with alginate incorporating the in-house made and the commercial (OptiForm) SL/SD based formulations and stored for 30 days at 4 °C. When cold-smoked salmon slices and fillets were stored at 4 °C, alginate coatings supplemented with 2.4%SL/0.25%SD and the commercial product OptiForm significantly delayed the growth of L. monocytogenes during the 30-day storage with final counts reaching 4.1 and 3.3 log CFU/g (slices) and 4.4 and 3.8 log CFU/g (fillets), respectively, while the counts in their untreated counterparts were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) reaching 7.3 and 6.8 log CFU/g for slices and fillets, respectively. Therefore, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of using an alginate-based coating containing lactate and diacetate to control the growth of L. monocytogenes to enhance the microbiological safety of filleted and sliced smoked salmon.

We address cooperative caching in mobile ad hoc networks where information is exchanged in a peer-to-peer fashion among the network nodes. Our objective is to devise a fully-distributed caching strategy whereby nodes, independently of each other, decide whether to cache or not some content, and for how long. Each node takes this decision according to its perception of what nearby users may be storing in their caches and with the aim to differentiate its own cache content from the others\Â´. We aptly named such algorithm "Hamlet". The result is the creation of a content diversity within the nodes neighborhood, so that a requesting user likely finds the desired information nearby. We simulate our caching algorithm in an urban scenario, featuring vehicular mobility, as well as in a mall scenario with pedestrians carrying mobile devices. Comparison with other caching schemes under different forwarding strategies confirms that Hamlet succeeds in creating the desired content diversity thus leading to a resource-efficient information access.

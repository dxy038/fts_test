A thermodynamic analysis of the refueling of a gaseous fuel tank and a thermal analysis of heat losses through tank walls is presented. The objective of the thermodynamic analysis is to compare the temperature and pressure evolutions coming from different equations of state and from thermodynamic tables. This comparison is performed with nitrogen and hydrogen and the compression is assumed adiabatic. It is shown that the ideal-gas assumption results in under-prediction of the tank temperature and pressure for hydrogen but in over-prediction for nitrogen. An approximate analytical expression of the Redlichâ€“Kwong equation of state is given which is in very good agreement with thermodynamic tables. To handle heat losses, different approaches are used and compared. First, a global thermal conductance is introduced which allows deriving analytical expressions. Then, a thermal nodal modeling of tank walls is proposed to take into account thermal capacity effects. Finally a 1D semi-infinite modeling of the tank walls is presented. Finally, this model is used to optimize mass flow rate in order to limit the temperature rise during the filling process.

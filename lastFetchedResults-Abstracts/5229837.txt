Aimed at minimizing the centre distance of reducer in lift mechanism and being satisfied with the conditions of load-bearing capacity and distribution of transmission ratio, the mathematical model in fuzzy design optimization was set up which was to considering the random character of the value of design parameters. Firstly, the number of teeth of the minor gear in the system, its normal module, and its tooth width were taken as design variables in the condition of definitely selected helical angle, and the sum of volumes of the double circular arc gears was taken as objective function. Then, the design principle of genetic algorithm was employed to build up a mathematic model for optimization of the design of transmission system. Finally, the optimization was performed by using the neural network procedure. The result of optimization showed that, when the genetic algorithm in combination with the neural network procedure was used in the system optimization design, the shortage such as the prematurity phenomenon with the use of the former alone or the local convergence with the latter alone could be overcome.

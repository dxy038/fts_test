Technology is an absolute necessity in the world of sport these days. It has been implemented to develop various techniques that are used to learn new strategies and hence excel in sports. The judicious use of technology could improve performance of the players, prevalent coaching methods, match analysis and prevent controversial umpiring. So, the primary objective of this research is to attain the following goals: 1) An automated multidimensional visual system that would prevent wrong interpretations due to perspective errors. 2) Simulate the pre and post match activity in a computerized graphics system for game and performance analysis of a certain team, player or playing conditions. 3) Approximating the trajectory of ball from multiple dimensions and comparing the predicted path with the actual path. This research paper presents the implementation of augmented reality in cricket using multi valued automated decision making to detect no ball and wide ball. The trajectory approximation is then used to gather information on variations in pitch and to train the players about the spin and swing of the ball.

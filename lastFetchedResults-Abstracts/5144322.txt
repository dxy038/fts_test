The main objective of this paper is to give an electrical characterization of epoxy based nanocomposite materials. These innovative materials are composed of an cycloaliphatic epoxy with a flexibiliser mixed with 0, 1, and 20%wt Nanopox&#174;. These materials are aimed to be used for electrical engineering applications and they should have a significant increase in electrical performances compared to the reference material (neat epoxy). Many studies have been carried out on epoxy based nanocomposite samples with a weak content of nanofiller. In this work, we aim to evaluate the influence of a high concentration of nanofiller, up to 20 %wt, on the electrical properties of the samples. The stability of the sampleÂ´s dielectric response has been evaluated and a post heat treatment has been performed. The loss factor has been measured for different nanofiller concentrations at 60&#176;C. Then, space charge measurements have been performed for different poling conditions (&#8220;low&#8221; and &#8220;high&#8221; applied electric field). Glass transition temperatures &#8220;Tg&#8221; have been measured on the different materials and the poling temperature (60&#176;C) has been fixed below the lowest Tg. With the nanofiller content, the effect of the applied electric field on space charge accumulation is shown.

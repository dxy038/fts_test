Objective: Aflatoxin B1
 (AFB1) suppresses the immune system. To decrease such suppressive
effects
on
the
immune
system,
a
wide
range
of
herbal
medicines
like

garlic are utilized. Biological activities of garlic in vitro and in vivo have also been verified. Our previous

studies demonstrated that aged garlic (dry garlic bulbs preserved in the freezer for six months at -20°C) have increased immunostimulator fractions and reduced immunosuppressor


fractions. This study focuses on the immunosuppressor activity of AFB1
 and immunostimulator activity of aged garlic extract (AGE) through the evaluation of CD4+
 CD25+ FoxP+ regulator cell (Treg) counts and the pattern of cytokine production in Balb/c normal mice.

Materials and Methods: In this experimental research, AFB1
 was separated from Aspergillus
flavus
(PTCC
5004)
by
HPLC
and
AGE
prepared
using
the
Mantis
method.
The

Delayed-Type
Hypersensitivity
(DTH)
test
was
carried
out
to
determinate
the
effectiveness

of

different doses of AGE and AFB1
, which can both have an effect on the immune system.
Subsequent
experiments
were
carried
out
on
20
Balb/c
mice
to
estimate
the
effects

of
AGE
and
AFB1
 on the number of Treg cell in 4 groups: 10 µl/kg/day of AFB1
 and AGE diluents were administered for 4 consecutive days to group 1. AFB1
, 2. control, 3. AGE + AFB
and 4. AGE via intraperitoneal (IP) route, respectively. Mice were sacrificed and splenocytes harvested and the percentage of splenic Treg cells was measured by flow cytometry analysis. The ELISA method was utilized to measure Cytokine production.
Results: The findings reveal that AGE increased the level of IFN-? and IL-4 cytokines produced
by
splenocytes
stimulated
by
specific
tumor
antigen
and
decreased
the
number
of

Treg
cells
in
the
spleen
(p < 0.05).
AFB1
 increased the number Treg cells in the spleen and decreased cytokine production (p < 0.05). In groups 2 (control) and 4 (AGE) the number of Treg cells decreased (p value < 0.05) whereas in groups 1 and 3 the number of Treg cells increased (p < 0.05).

Conclusion: This study indicated that AGE is able to alter the cytokine production in normal
mice
into
a
Th1
 protective pattern which is beneficial to the immune system in general and anti-tumor immunity in particular. AFB1
is able to alter the cytokine production into a Th2
protective pattern. Therefore, AGE might be used as herbal medicine with few side effects as compared to chemotherapy in treating cancers caused by substances like AFB1.

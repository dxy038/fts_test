The main objective of this work is to evaluate the potential of L band PolSAR data to discriminate deforestation increment. In order to achieve this purpose, it was performed a coherent attributes exploratory analysis and a Maximum Likelihood - ICM (Iterated Conditional Modes) classification of R99B sensor L band PolSAR data. The PolSAR data classification obtained good agreement with PRODES Digital project reference map (k=0,71). This result might indicate that R99B L band PolSAR data have good potential to discriminate deforestation increment areas in Amazon Forest.

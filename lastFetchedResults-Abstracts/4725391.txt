Web service composition lets developers create applications on top of service-oriented computing native description, discovery, and communication capabilities. Such applications are rapidly deployable and offer developers reuse possibilities and users seamless access to a variety of complex services. Most existing Web service composition ways construct chains of services based on semi-automatic or automatic process includes presenting matching services to the user at each step of a composition, filtering the possibilities by using semantic descriptions of the services. The generated composition is then directly executable through the WSDL grounding of the services. We provide composition architecture of trusted web services based on ontology. The objective of this paper is to research a framework that enables trusted semantic search of web services and trusted dynamic composition of workflows to answer complex questions from the user expressed in their natural language electronic commerce requirements.

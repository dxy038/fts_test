In this paper we focus on a multiobjective two-level 0-1 programming problem in which the decision maker at the upper level has an objective function and the decision maker at the lower level has multiple objective functions. We assume that there is not coordination between the decision maker at the upper level and the decision maker at the lower level. The decision maker at the upper level must take account of multiple rational responses of the decision maker at the lower level in the problem. We examine two kinds of situations based on anticipation of the decision maker at the upper level; an optimistic anticipation and a pessimistic anticipation. We show mathematical programming problems for obtaining the Stackelberg solutions based on two kinds of anticipation and propose computational methods using genetic algorithms for obtaining the Stackelberg solutions. In order to demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed computational methods through genetic algorithms, we plan to conduct numerical experiments.

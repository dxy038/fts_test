This work proposed the systematic calibration method of process parameters for electromagnetic analysis of CMOS back-end devices in millimeter-wave and THz frequencies. It uses the propagation constants of transmission lines in all the measurement frequency and the RLGC model parameters in low frequency as the objective variables of the parameter fitting. It was showed that the EM simulation results using calibrated process parameters were in good agreement with the measurement results up to 330 GHz.

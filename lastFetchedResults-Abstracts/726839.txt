A series of sugar derivatives (7–14) were synthesized from stachyose, a sugar compound of Stachys sieboldi Miq, and evaluated for antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium, and Staphylococcus aureus, and their structure–activity relationships were studied. The results showed that the compound OCT359 (allyl O-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-α-d-galactopyranosyl)-(1 → 6)-O-(2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-α-d-galactopyranosyl)-(1 → 6)-O-2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-β-d-glucopyranoside) (12) exhibited in vitro antibacterial activity. The allyl group at C-1 and the acetoxy groups of the manninotrioside were requisite for the antibacterial activity.

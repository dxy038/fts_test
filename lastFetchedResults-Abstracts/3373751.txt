Manufacturing of large computer-generated submillimeter wave holograms with high pattern accuracy has been the main challenge in the development of hologram based compact antenna test ranges (CATRs). Illumination of the hologram with a shaped beam produced by a dual reflector feed system (DRFS) simplifies the hologram manufacturing by eliminating the narrow slots in the hologram pattern. In this paper, the design of a shaped dual reflector feed for a hologram CATR is described. The simulated and measured illumination field amplitude and phase at 310 GHz are presented and compared to the desired hologram illumination. The measured amplitude is within &#177;0.5 dB from the design objective in the most significant central region of the illuminating beam. Measurement results of the quiet-zone field of a demonstration CATR illuminated by the DRFS are presented and compared to the measured quiet-zone amplitude and phase of a hologram fed directly with a corrugated horn. The quiet-zone diameters of the both holograms are over 0.25 meters and the measured root mean squared (rms) amplitude and phase ripples are below &#177;0.4 dB and &#177;5&#176;, respectively. Further improvements to the hologram CATR, such as greater tolerance to manufacturing errors, are also discussed.

Antennas are generally measured in anechoic chambers, where walls are covered with appropriate absorbing materials so that reflections are minimized. However, different methodologies have been proposed to process the data measured in nonanechoic conditions with the aim of reconstructing the free-space antenna radiation pattern. The objective of this communication is to evaluate the conditions under which those methods can be extended to the case where only amplitude data is available and phase is estimated using the Hilbert transform.

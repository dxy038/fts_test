Objective: This study was done to evaluate left ventricular structure and function among pregnant patients with preeclampsia and compare them with those of normotensive pregnant and nonpregnant subjects. It also tested the hypothesis that abnormalities in left ventricular structure and function are associated with elevated plasma levels of natriuretic peptides. Study Design: The study compared 75 pregnant women (n = 40 with preeclampsia; N = 35 normotensive pregnant women) and 10 nonpregnant normotensive control subjects undergoing an echocardiographic and biohumoral (renin activity and aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide, and brain natriuretic peptide concentrations) evaluation. The statistical analysis was carried out by analysis of variance, and significance was set at P< .05. Results: Comparison of pregnant patients with preeclampsia versus both normotensive pregnant women and nonpregnant women showed significant increases in left ventricular mass and left ventricular endsystolic and end-diastolic volumes and significant reductions in left ventricular ejection fraction and percentage of fractional shortening. These changes coincided with increases in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide that were linearly related to the left ventricular structural and functional changes observed in patients with preeclampsia. Conclusion: Pregnant patients with preeclampsia showed adaptation to the increase in systemic blood pressure, with significant modification of left ventricular structure and function related to the plasma levels of both atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide. A simple evaluation of plasma natriuretic peptide concentrations could help to discriminate patients with preeclampsia who have a condition of mild left ventricular overload.

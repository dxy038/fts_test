There are few immunologists in Africa. Researchers predominantly study the immunology of infectious diseases (HIV, malaria and tuberculosis), HLA genotypes and cytokine secretion patterns. Lack of research funding is the problem; continued, equitable international collaboration is a short-term answer. Sustainable development will come when African countries find ways of training and retaining scientists who will produce research and diagnostic tests. The Internet should be utilized to improve communication and as a conduit for online, virtual immunology courses.

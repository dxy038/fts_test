This article presents 10 broad policy recommendations aiming at improving the awareness and a sound use of the patent system in Belgium. This exercise was motivated by the relatively low reliance on the patent system in Belgium, by both applicants and inventors. The main objective was not to stimulate ‘blindly’ the filing of more patents applications, but to ensure that inventions that should be protected are indeed patented. The recommendations are structured around four main pillars: (i) improve access at lower costs; (ii) improve awareness through training; (iii) improve information; and (iv) improve visibility of Belgium as a European actor. Concluding remarks underline the importance of involving the social partners for an effective implementation and the need for a cost–benefit evaluation of several recommendations.

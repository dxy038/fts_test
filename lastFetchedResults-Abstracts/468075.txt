Objective: We assessed several variables as predictors for pre-eclampsia risk in a group of women at high risk. Study Design: We studied 2503 women with either diabetes mellitus, chronic hypertension, multifetal gestation, or pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy who participated in a multicenter study comparing aspirin and placebo in preventing pre-eclampsia. We evaluated multiple variables for predicting pre-eclampsia risk with use of univariate and multivariable analysis. Results: Parity and mean arterial pressure at randomization were most predictive of pre-eclampsia risk. The risk was 8% with a mean arterial pressure at enrollment of <75 mm Hg versus 27% with a mean arterial pressure >85 mm Hg (relative risk and 95% confidence interval 3.3 [2.4 to 4.4]). The risk of pre-eclampsia was 26% in nulliparous patients versus 17% in parous subjects (relative risk and 95% confidence interval 1.5 [1.3-1.8]). Conclusions: The finding that second-trimester mean arterial pressure affects pre-eclampsia risk suggests that the pathophysiologic process of preeclampsia is initiated before that time.

In this paper, we consider distributed control for a class of linear systems, where we assume that each controller has different structural information about the system. A simple distributed adaptive control law is developed. Each controller is aware of the presence of the other controllers and utilizes the local information to control the system such that the components of the states which are relevant to the controller are being controlled properly. The control law is adapted to the local model information and achieves the global control objective under certain conditions. It can be interpreted as decentralized market adjustments in the economics literature.

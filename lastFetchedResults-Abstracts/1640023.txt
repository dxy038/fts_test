The cultivation of sugarcane and production of its derivatives are closely linked to Brazilâ€™s history and development. The factory managers face the problem of discarding the sugarcane bagasse ash (SBA), as these ashes are the final waste resulting from the industrial processes, with no possibility to reduce it. The objective of this study is to analyze the effect of adding SBA to compressed earth blocks (CEBs). Two sets of blocks were prepared with 6% and 12% of cement in addition to the earth and with the addition of SBA at ratios of 0%, 2%, 4% and 8% each. Compressive strength and absorption tests were performed on the blocks. Additionally, masonry prisms were produced with the set of blocks that showed the best preliminary test results. The results showed that the SBA can be incorporated into the CEBs and masonry without damage to the mechanical properties.

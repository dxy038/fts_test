This paper presents an algorithm for solving the multi-objective reactive power dispatch problem in a power system. Modal analysis of the system is used for static voltage stability assessment. Loss minimization and maximization of voltage stability margin are taken as the objectives. Generator terminal voltages, reactive power generation of the capacitor banks and tap changing transformer setting are taken as the optimization variables. This paper introduces a new search model Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO), it is recently being used as a new, reliable, accurate and robust optimization technique scheme for global optimization over continuous spaces .This paper presents an, improved version of TLBO algorithm, called the improved Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (ITLBO). This algorithm uses a parameter in TLBO algorithm to increase convergence rate. In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm, it has been tested on IEEE 30 bus system and compared to other algorithms reported those before in literature. Results show that TLBO is more efficient than others for solution of single-objective ORPD problem.

The particle swarm optimization algorithm has been shown to be a competitive heuristic to solve multi-objective optimization problems. Also, fitness sharing concepts have shown to be significant when used by multi-objective optimization methods. In this paper we introduce an algorithm that makes use of these two main concepts, particle swarm optimization and fitness sharing to tackle multi-objective optimization problems.

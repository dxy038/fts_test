Objective: In 2014, enrolled 20 patients who applied to the Unit of Assisted Reproduction
Techniques, Konya Necmettin Erbakan University. Based on the presence of hyaluronic
acid (HA) in the oocyte-cumulus cell complex, sperm attached to HA in vivo were modeled
in vitro. Available healthy sperm obtained in the swim-up procedure using HA were
investigated.
Materials and Methods: This observational cohort study, a routine analysis was conducted
on the ejaculation samples obtained from 20 patients. We divided each sample
into two groups and the swim-up method was applied. Human serum albumin (HSA, 0.5%)
was added to samples from the first group. HA (10%) was added to samples from the second
group. We determined the floating linear and non-linear sperm concentrations of both
groups annexin V was used to determine the rate of apoptosis of these sperm.
Results: Following swim-up, linear and non-linear sperm concentrations were higher in
the group that contained HA compared to the group with HSA. However, there was a significantly
higher apoptosis rate in the HSA group compared to the HA group.
Conclusion: The addition of HA to the medium in the swim-up procedure positively affected
sperm parameters. Thus, healthier sperm cells were obtained without DNA damage
and with high motility.

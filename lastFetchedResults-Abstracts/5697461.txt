Based on the analysis of the traditional bubble sort algorithm, this paper proposes two bidirectional bubble sort algorithm design ideas. After giving C language description of the three algorithms, the paper tests the new algorithms, analyzes comparatively the time complexity and space complexity of the three algorithms, and summarizes such a conclusion that the first new algorithm has the same average time complexity and space complexity as the original algorithm, while the second is time efficient than the original one, and thus truly reaches the optimization purpose.

In this paper we compare two special classes of systolic arrays, namely unidirectional systolic arrays with delayed output and bidirectional systolic arrays with one directional pass-through input. We make use of the results of [5], where we presented a so called functional approach to the synthesis of unidirectional arrays. By analysing the behaviour of arrays with two directional data-flow we determine the conditions and the cases in which the two corresponding (uni- and bidirectional) array types are solving the same class of problems. Thus the synthesis problem for the two different array types can be solved simultaneously.

Process mining has been widely applied in lots of fields, which can discover workflow models from event logs, helps to design or re-design process models, and brings convenience to workflow management system. The main function of process mining algorithms is to provide us with valuable objective information hidden in event logs, which plays a crucial important role on the implementation of new operation business process, and audit, analysis and improvement of the existing ones. In this paper, we firstly describe the application background of process mining technology, and then list the frame structure of the technology at home and abroad, followed by summarizing and analyzing the algorithm of important domestic and abroad research, and forecast the future direction for research at last.

The objective of this work is to study the effects of harmonics on energy meters. This study is carried out based on IEEE 1459 standard through extensive tests on some energy meters installed at Gilan utility consumers. First, a review on IEEE 1459 standard on power definitions will be given. The definitions are then evaluated for a compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) as a harmonic generating load. Then, the results of the performance evaluation of two energy meters are presented for different linear and nonlinear loads based on IEEE1459 standard power definitions. Two different test procedures are performed for this purpose. In the first series of tests, a harmonic polluted voltage is applied to a linear resistive load, and the calculated energy values by the energy meters are evaluated.In the second series of tests, the voltage is applied to some nonlinear loads, and the performance evaluation of the energy meters is presented. The precision and correctness of the measured power quantities are then discussed. Based on IEEE 1459 standard power definitions, it is recommended to use the Non-active power term instead of the reactive power for large consumers.

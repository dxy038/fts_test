Area Coverage for ground-to-air voice communication can be extended largely while radio stations are connected with ground-based wired network. This application system has three main characteristics: half-duplex conversation, twice voice encoding and voice over IP transferring. Under this scenario, we present an objective calculation model, which is based on E-model, to evaluate the end-to-end voice quality. We use this new model to predict the voice quality of G.711/G.729+AMBE scheme, and also use subjective method to assess the Chinese word articulation of a trial system. It is shows that assessing results of the subjective method and the objective method are consistent to some extent, and both of those two methods can facilitate system design, research and development.

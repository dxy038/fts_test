The present paper deals with an optimal boundary control problem in which the process of systems under consideration is governed by a linear parabolic partial differential equation over an infinite time interval. The objective of the paper is to determine the optimal boundary control that minimize a given energy-based performance measure. The performance measure is specified as a quadratic functional of displacement and a suitable penalty term involving the boundary controls. In order to determine the optimal boundary controls, the problem with boundary controls are converted into a problem with distributed controls. The modal space technique is then used to reduce the system into the optimal control of time invariant lumped parameter system. The associated system of uncoupled first order initial value problems is solved in terms of controllers. Next step deals with the computation of the control and trajectory of the linear time-invariant lumped parameter. For this we approximate the controllers by a finite number of orthogonal exponential zero-interpolants over the interval [0,âˆž). The resultant performance index after using the optimality condition leads to a system of linear algebraic equations. The suggested technique is easy to implement on digital computer. We provide a numerical example to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach.

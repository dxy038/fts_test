The objective of the note is to propose an intelligent controller for the temporal scheduling of actuators in distributed parameter systems. The system under study is assumed to have multiple groups of actuators with only a single group being active in a given time interval and with the remaining groups kept inactive. Reasons for such an actuator scheduling are due to possible power limitations which do not permit simultaneous activation of all actuator groups, a desire to improve performance via actuator switching, and stringent demands on control energy consumption. The issue of first placing groups of actuators on a system describing the dynamics of flexible cable is addressed. An algorithm that schedules, in some optimal manner, a different group of actuators in a given time interval is then summarized. The proposed actuator allocation scheme is then simulated for a flexible cable and whose results demonstrate its performance enhancement over the case of a permanently used actuator group

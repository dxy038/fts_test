An <e1>O</e1>(<e1>N</e1><sup>3</sup>) algorithm for partitioning and allocating <e1>N</e1> Datalog procedural bundles among <e1>K</e1> distributed or dedicated processors is presented. The algorithm determines a static distribution of the bundles to all <e1>K</e1> processors. The independent variables of the objective function include both processing and communication costs, and the goal is to balance the processing requirements of the <e1>K</e1> processors while allocating bundles in such a way as to reduce the communication costs. The algorithm can be used with heterogeneous systems of processors, and it can accommodate a two-tier communication model in which both local area networks and more expensive wide area networks are used. The algorithm can be used interactively with a programmer or system designer. Example results from its implementation are given, and a comparison with another technique is shown

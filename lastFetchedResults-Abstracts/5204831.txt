This research considers a vehicle routing problem of a real application taken from Thai Bakery Company. This vehicle routing problem is to find a route for delivering bakeries from a single depot to the companyÂ´s customers. The objective of the problem is to the delivery route such that minimize the total distance and, as a consequence, minimize the total number of vehicles used. To achieve the objective, this research applies Genetic algorithm (GA). Genetic algorithm (GA) has been applied to develop a modified-GA approach to make the routing in order to minimize the total corresponding distance. The GA proposed in this research is evaluated by using data taken from the real situation and compared with the typical routing technique. The comparison result reveals that the proposed GA generates better solution than the typical routing technique.

This paper presents a production programming model in textile industry by using a goal programming method. The production programming presented here is a new modeling method which uses a single objective model and the shadow price of restrictions and management priorities to cover all various goals of the organization without overlooking some. A weight is also given to the goals based on the management opinion. Applying this model, more compatibility with management ideas and more precise and effective results are obtained. Design method and development of the model was implemented using ACCESS Software. After entering the data, various goals and management decisions can be determined and useful guides are provided to select proper goals. The produced model is then solved by LINDO software and the required reports are expressed in a clear manner. A case study was performed in Isfahan Kanaf textile factory. The obtained results show that using the proposed model, the factory management ideals in determining the production amount of the desired strings while maximizing the profit and complete usage from the capacity of production parts and consuming the raw material at requested level are well achieved

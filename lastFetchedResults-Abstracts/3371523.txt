The objective of this work was to analyze the influence of lateral heterogeneities which had the existence of the geologic imperfections in the measurement of the resistivity of the ground. The following methods had been used: method of the finite elements in the modeling 2D applying the arrangement dipolo-dipolo to establish a model of the probable real distribution of the values of resistivity in subsurface. The results had shown heterogeneities of the layers of the geoelectrical model, influenced for the geologic imperfections inside of the studied area. This heterogeneity reflects the difference of resistivity of the ground. In such a way, this study it contributes to guide the project of the grounding system that future can be used for accomplishment of the mesh of the grounding.

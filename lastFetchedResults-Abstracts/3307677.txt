This paper presents a new approach to the multi-objective optimization for the hybrid renewable energy distributed generation system based on fuzzy satisfaction degree. Firstly, based on the analysis of the characteristics of the distributed power supply, three indexes, including economy cost, power supply reliability and power factor, are chosen. And then, the fuzzy satisfaction degree is proposed based on the concept of fuzzy mathematics to reflect the objective function with more comprehensively, veritably and naturally. And then the three individual indexes are converted and unified to overall satisfaction degree. Then, the event driven optimization process is established and global optimization is achieved by genetic algorithm. Finally, a scenario case study is demonstrated and indicates that the approach is a suitable solution for the multi-objective optimization to the distributed hybrid renewable energy generation system.

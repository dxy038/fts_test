Summary form only as given. The concept of efficiency plays an important role both in data envelopment analysis (DEA) and multiple objective linear programming (MOLP). Despite this and other apparent similarities, DEA and MOLP research have developed separately. Structurally, the DEA formulation to identify efficient units is quite similar to the MOLP model based on the reference point approach

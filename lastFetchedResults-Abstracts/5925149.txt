In recent years, body-centric wireless communications become an active area of research due to their various applications such as e-healthcare, support systems for specialized occupations, and personal communications. Since the candidate frequencies for body-centric wireless communications widely range from MHz to GHz, dielectric properties of the human body tissues, relative dimensions of the human body to wavelength, and the propagation channels around the body extremely vary with frequencies. In this paper, to bring objective and unified idea on the frequency characteristics of body-centric wireless communication channels, electric field distributions around the human body wearing a small antenna in a wide frequency range of 2.5 MHz to 2.5 GHz are numerically calculated. The results show that behavior of the electric field distributions around the human body could be broadly divided into two ranges; below 100 MHz and above 250 MHz.

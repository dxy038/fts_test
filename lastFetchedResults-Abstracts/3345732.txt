The objective of the work was to evaluate the impact of internal gains on building energy consumption. The study presented here is based on simulation results. We modeled in Matlab / Simulink conventional electrical equipments and we have integrated them into a building model. This model allows us to determine and quantify the effect of internal gains on the thermal behavior and power consumption of the building.

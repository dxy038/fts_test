This paper discusses the disadvantages of several existing objective quality evaluation methods for frame interpolation techniques. Samples show that these disadvantages lead the objective quality measurement inconsistent with what humans perceive. Based on these observations, a new metric designed to evaluate the performance of frame interpolation techniques is proposed. This metric combines the severity of interpolation artifacts and several human visual factors into a single quality score. Final implementation shows that the proposed metric out-performs other commonly used metrics.

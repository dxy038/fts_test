With the objective of developing high thermal conductive laminates capable of being used as high current-carrying wiring boards for automotive and industrial applications, we identified the optimum fillers for biphenyl-type epoxy resin that possesses high thermal conductivity, and studied laminating conditions. As a result, we found fillers capable of achieving a maximum thermal conductivity of 10 W/m&#183;K and thereby enhanced both thermal conductivity and insulation resistance. In addition, we were able to determine molding conditions such as press temperature. Although copper-foil peel strength was reduced, we increased its strength by means of the roughening of rolled copper.

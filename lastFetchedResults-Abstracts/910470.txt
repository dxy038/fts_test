Gelian anticline is located at south of Shirvan in North Khorasan Province, and geologically considered as a  is part of Aladagh-Binaloud construction zone. The aim of this research is to evaluate the active tectonics of Gelian anticline based on geo-morphological indices. The purpose of this study is evaluating the active tectonics of Gelian anticline by using geo-morphologic indices. For achieving the above said objective, the required data were extracted from 1/100000 geological map and 1/50000 topographic maps as well as from Quickbird satellite images. Also, the field studies of Geo-morphological landforms and processes were made. Required data  for calculation of ‚Äù K indices, triangular facets, wine-glass valleys, mountain front sinuosity, and stream spacing ratio(R) were extracted after  importing into ILWIS (Integrated Land and Water Information System) software and the under study anticline  was divided into 3 tectonic zones based on height, width and slope.
 Results of this study reveal that the rates of K, W (maximum width of wine-glass valley divided by width of wine-glass valley in outlet), R, slope, base length and area of triangular facets in zone 1 are higher than those of other zones. The values of mountain front sinuosity in 3 zones are about one. Generally, the evaluation of geo-morphological indices represent firstly, that Gelian anticline is tectonically active and secondly, that the rate of tectonic activity increases from southeast to northwest.

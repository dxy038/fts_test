National development is a primary objective of all developing nations. For the development process to occur, the nation in question has to ensure that certain needs are met, and education ranks among the top priorities as it underpins all needs. In many third world nations, education at the tertiary level usually takes place in universities in selected urban centers and mostly for traditional students. This is viewed as inadequate and efforts are being made to extend university education to other centers with the hope of involving more people in the non-traditional sector in the education process. University of Ghana has adopted this and has extended their service to mature and non-traditional students. By employing information and communication technology (ICT), these students will be able to participate in the education process from their homes. This paper describes how Ghanaians view this technology and may use it to empower non-traditional students in their effort to improve the level of education in the country which will lead to the advantage of sustained development in the country.

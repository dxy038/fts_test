Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) could become remarkable resources for improving quality and reliability of future grids, if adequate control of their onboard storage systems is provided. Hence, the problem of PEVs optimal control strategies is a crucial topic of research in modern power system operation. This is particularly true in the Smart Grid (SG) context, where the presence of bi-directional communications among distributed energy resources and customers makes it possible to obtain an optimized operation of the grid. In this paper a critical overview of some of the most significant single-objective optimization methodologies proposed for the optimal operation of PEVs in electrical distribution networks is presented in order to verify their feasibility in the context of SGs. These methodologies allow the performance of several services, which aim to meet both needs internal to the SG (for example, the losses minimization or the minimization of average voltage deviations) and external to it (for example, ancillary services to the electrical system to whom the SG is interconnected). This paper reports the theoretical aspects of the optimization models, whereas the companion paper &#8220;Part II: numerical applications to vehicle fleets&#8221; proposes the results of the analysed models.

Describes the authors experience in using two major design suites currently on offer through the EuroChip program, namely, Mentor Graphic´s Genesil and Cadence´s Edge, for second year design projects. The goal was to design a simple self-learning neural network system based on a multiprocessor architecture for pattern classification applications. The overall objective of the projects was to bring together the various disciplines of the undergraduate course in information system engineering (ISE) including computing, circuit design, chip design and algorithms, in the form of a design project. The authors´ experience suggests that as well as improving the VLSI design skills of students, VLSI design tools can bring benefits such as teaching system design and group interactions

This paper represents the digital current mode control for a multi-module bidirectional converter intended for battery charging/discharging applications. The digital current mode control is adapted to achieve equal current sharing and good dynamic performance. The predictive control is used for the digital current compensation and the direct method is adapted to the digital voltage compensation. The control parameters for the digital compensations are designed and fine-tuned using the SISO tool in MATLAB software. Theoretical predictions are confirmed with both MATLAB simulations and measurements on an experimental prototype converter.

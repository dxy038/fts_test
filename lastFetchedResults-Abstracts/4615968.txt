A more efficient way of data transmission has been brought about to remote monitoring system due to the rapid development of GPRS networking, which features wider network coverage, higher transmission speed and lower construction cost and consequently makes it possible to establish a distributed monitoring system characterizing in decentralized collection points, greater number of participants and higher level of real-time communication. Taking reference of basic theory of GPRS system and existing GPRS techniques, The objective of the paper is to propose a solution for a remote network system for irrigation by taking reference of basic theory of GPRS system and introducing the newest type of ARM embedded platform technology into the existing GRPS technology.

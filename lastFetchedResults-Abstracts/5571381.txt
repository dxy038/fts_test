Chaotic systems subject to uncertainty are considered. The design of a controller for such systems is obtained as the solution of a min-max optimal control problem. Since the traditional stabilization of a target state (equilibrium) is not feasible, the objective becomes that of confining the system state within a prescribed neighbourhood of such a target state, irrespective of the uncertain variables. The proposed method is applied to a well-known chaotic first-order discrete-time system

Materials and methods: Fecal samples collected from the patients were tested first by an ELISA kit, specific for adenovirus detection. All samples including positive specimens by ELISA method were subjected to two rounds of PCR test. A specific pair of primers for adenoviruses 40 and 41 was applied PCR method. 
Results: Out of 280 fecal specimens collected from diarrheic children, 7(2.5%) were positive by ELISA test and 12 (4.3%) by PCR method. All of positive samples belonged to ad41.

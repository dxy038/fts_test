Introduction & Objective: Paying attention to oral health in the high-risk group of pregnant women is more crucial than others because of its effects on both mother and fetus health. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of structured educational programs on oral-hygiene behavior of pregnant women.
Materials & Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, 130 pregnant women of Arak city were randomly put in the case and control groups (65 women in each group). Data collection devices were a questionnaire based on HBM and the pregnant women’s oral and dental health behavior. During one month, members of the case group took part in 4 sessions of educational classes and 3 months after the intervention, members of both case and control groups filled out the questionnaire and then the data was analyzed.
Results: There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in the mean scores of HBM variables in the case and control groups before and after the intervention. Before the intervention, the mean score of oral-hygiene behavior in the case group was 45 ±9.2 that after the intervention and three months of follow-up reached to 77±9.7 which showed a significant difference (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: The results of this study showed that applying educational programs based on HBM model to oral and dental health behavior of pregnant women is very effective. In doing this program, control, monitoring and follow up educations are highly recommended.

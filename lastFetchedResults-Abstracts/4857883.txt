The objective of this research is to propose and design a compact tactile display module and verify its performance in a pen-like haptic interface. A small, safe, silent and light tactile display module with a low power dissipation has been built. Based on this module, we present the Ubi-Pen, a system providing texture and vibration stimuli. Preliminary evaluations indicate it can satisfactorily represent tactile patterns. We also investigate the optimal frequencies at which to present stimuli, and evaluate its capacity to support GUI operations by producing a simple click-like feedback when buttons are pressed

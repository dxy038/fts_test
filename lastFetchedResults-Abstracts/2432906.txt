This research uses a solution based on a combined grey-fuzzy DEMATEL method to deal with the objective of the study. This study is aimed to present a perception approach to deal with real estate agent service quality expectation ranking with uncertainty. The ranking of best top five real estate agents might be a key strategic direction of other real estate agents prior to service quality expectation. The solving procedure is as follows: (i) the weights of criteria and alternatives are described in triangular fuzzy numbers; (ii) a grey possibility degree is used to result the ranking order for all alternatives; (iii) DEMATEL is used to resolve interdependency relationships among the criteria and (iv) an empirical example of real estate agent service quality ranking problem in customer expectation is used to resolve with this proposed method approach indicating that real estate agent R1 (CY real estate agent) is the best selection in terms of service quality in customer expectation.

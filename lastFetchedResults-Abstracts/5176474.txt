According to the various and complicating of production planning problem, a visual modeling and simulation system for optimal production planning was proposed in this paper. Considering the opening, universality and integrated optimization idea of system, objective oriented technology and operation research method were used to develop the system. Supporting by the system, planners can configure the production process, edit parameters of the production equipments according to actual condition, and generate multi-objective optimal programming model for production planning corresponding to orders, solve the model and evaluate the results.

This paper addresses the problem of using multiple, spatially distributed RF/EO sensors for target tracking. Data from the multi-modal sensors is collected at a fusion center, and used to track multiple objects in the sensors´ field of view. Continuous approximations are made of the sensors´ resolution in range, range rate and azimuth in terms of system parameters such as bandwidth, PRF, EO zoom and pointing angle. These approximations are used to create a continuous objective function in terms of the tracking filter´s information matrix, and a search is undertaken to find the system parameters that optimize tracking performance based on the current target environment. Simulations demonstrate the benefit of this technique compared with open-loop tracking methods.

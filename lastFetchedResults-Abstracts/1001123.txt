The objective of this work was to study the effects of the following Ligands: Chelex-100, Dowex MAC-3 and Dowex 50WX-8 using Competing Ligand Exchange Method. This objective was achieved by investigating complex dissociation kinetics of trace metals: Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), Mn(II) and Pb(II) of a well-characterized Laurentian Fulvic Acid (LFA) in model solutions and in a natural waters of Lake Heva (Québec, Canada). The effects of variation in the competing ligands (including their quantities) on the complex dissociation kinetics were quantitatively characterized by their first-order dissociation rate coefficients. The kinetic lability of the metal complexes varied with the metal-to-LFA ratio, as expected from the theory of metal complexes of the chemically and physically heterogeneous complexants, LFA. The general trend in the metal-binding by the above competing ligands was: Dowex 50WX-8 > Chelex-100 > Dowex MAC-3. However, no difference was found between the Dowex 50WX-8 and Chelex-100 for Cd(II), Zn(II), and Co(II). The results revealed the importance of the quantity of Chelex-100 as a competing ligand in the metal(II)–LFA complexation, on the dissociation kinetics of these complexes in model solutions. By developing Competing Ligand Exchange Method as an analytical technique, for studying the relative affinities of the above competing ligands for metals complexation in natural waters this work has made a substantial contribution to analytical chemistry.

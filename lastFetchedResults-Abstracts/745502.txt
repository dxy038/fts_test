Objective
To study the potential mechanisms of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) mediating improvement of the cardiac function of dilated cardiomyopathy mice (DCM).
Methods and results

We established experimental model of dilated cardiomyopathy by repetitive coxsickievirus B3 (CVB3) infection in Balb/c mice and half of the experimental group mice were injected 0.2 Âµg recombinated human HGF through tail vein every 2 days starting from the 5th month. At the 5th month, dilated cardiomyopathy occurred in experimental group mice. The HGF level and N-cadherin expression in myocardium of experimental group was downregulated. At the 7th month, after HGF supplement, the HGF level and N-cadherin expression in the myocardium of the mice were increased, the fibrosis of myocardial and cells apoptosis were ameliorated and cardiac function was improved. In vitro experiment, we found that N-cadherin expression was increased in cultured myocardial cells treated with rHGF.
Conclusion

Increasing in N-cadherin expression may be one of the potential mechanisms of HGF mediating Improvement of cardiac function of dilated cardiomyopathy mice.

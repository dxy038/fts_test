The ARMA model provides an effective means for precise representation of the speech production process. A stable and accurate estimation of ARMA parameters from the speech signal has been shown to be possible by the SEARMA method. In this paper we propose an ARMA speech analysis-synthesis system based on the SEARMA method. The validity of the proposed system is investigated by means of both objective and subjective evaluation. The results reveal that the zeros in the spectrum contribute to the reduction of spectral distortion and to the improvement of the quality of synthetic speech.

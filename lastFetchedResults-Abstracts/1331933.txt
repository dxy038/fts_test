Multiobjective design and control optimization of composite laminated non-linear doubly curved shell with various boundary conditions is presented to minimize the dynamic response. The control objective aims at dissipating the elastic energy of the composite laminated shell with the minimum possible expenditure of control energy using a closed-loop distributed force. The layer thicknesses and fiber orientations are taken as design variables. The objectives of the optimization problem are formulated based on a shear deformation theory including the von-Karmen non-linear effect for various cases of boundary conditions. The non-linear control problem is solved iteratively until an appropriate convergence criterion is satisfied based on Liapunovâ€“Bellman theory. Liapunov function is taken as a sum of positive definite functions with different degrees. Comparative examples for three-layer symmetric and four-layer antisymmetric cylindrical laminated shell are given for various cases of edges conditions. Graphical study is carried out to assess the accuracy of results obtained due to the successive iterations. The influences of the boundary conditions, orthotropy ratio, shear deformation on the cylindrical laminated shell optimal design are elucidated.

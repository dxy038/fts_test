Increase in people participation in Sport for all has always been considered by policymakers. In Iran, despite numerous agencies and departments that regard themselves as responsible for Sport for all, participants in Sport for all in our country are in less favorable situation than those in other countries. This paper aims to present a model to institutionalize sport for all of Iran. For this purpose, researchers referred to the experts of the sport for all of Iran and collected data from them through deep interviews. Then, the data resulted from twenty-nine interviews were encoded and analyzed through grounded theory method. The results of codes classification showed sixteen components at the three contextual, organizational, and behavioral levels. According to the sport for all of Iran model, it can be noted that the contextual level of sport for all of Iran, in which the other two levels are rooted, includes external environment and conditions, and generally leads to organizational and behavioral levels. The organizational level is the outer layer of behavioral level and includes the regular relations governing the internal and objective components of sport for all of Iran. The behavioral level is the factors associated with Iranian people's sporting behavior with a health approach. The relationship between these levels is close and, practically, they are inseparable in sport for all of Iran. In such relationship, levels interact with each other as continuous systematic relations. The presented model can be used as the analytical tool for sport for all of Iran so that it would solve problems of this field of sport reasonably and principally.

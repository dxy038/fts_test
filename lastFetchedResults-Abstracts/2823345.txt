This paper presents the modeling of a voltage source converter (VSC) based on a phasor strategy suitable for implementation on stability softwares. This phasor is compared with a three-phase model for a point-to-point VSC transmission and then it is used in a dynamic stability study of a meshed VSC-HVDC grid connected to an AC system. The HVDC system evaluated comprises 14 DC terminals operating at &#177;400 kV or at &#177;200 kV, interconnecting islanded wind farms with hydroelectric based AC networks. The objective of the work is to evaluate the dynamic behavior of the asynchronous connections as well as the power interchange between the networks and its influence on its electromechanical stability. The effects of fault occurrences, line and converter contingencies are then analyzed.

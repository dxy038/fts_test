The bidirectional associative memory (BAM<sub>2</sub>), so far limited to two input/output patterns, is generalized to several input/output patterns (BAM<sub>q</sub>). Earlier results on the memory capacity of BAM<sub>2</sub> are generalized to BAM<sub>q</sub>. The consequences of such schemes for data fusion and pattern splitting are evaluated, and the encoding of several temporal patterns (ordered sets of vectors) in temporal associative memories (TAM<sub>q</sub>) is sketched

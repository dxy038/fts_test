This article proposed the sharing solutions of heterogeneous information´s between Java content repository and relational database by using XML. The XML was bridge to realize the bidirectional mapping of Java content repository and relational database, and furthermore it realized the powerful advantage between the massive documents information operating in Java content repository and the massive data message operating in relational database. Finally it settled the operations of the magnanimous simulated data´s memory about the storing such as the edition, the revision, deleting and so on effectively. Also it realized the operations of simulation document uploading, downloading, deleting in simulation analysis project fast and effectively.

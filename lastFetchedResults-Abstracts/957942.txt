High temperature epitaxial growth processes for SiC bulk and thin films are reviewed from an academic point of view using heat and mass transfer modeling and simulation. The objective is to show that this modeling approach could provide further information to fabrication and characterization for the improvement of the knowledge of the growth history and to quantify the different phenomena leading to growth. Recent results of our integrated research program on SiC taking into account the fabrication, process modeling and characterization will be presented.

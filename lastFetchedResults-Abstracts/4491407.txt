This paper describes a DVB-S2 based adaptive air interface designed to meet the performance constraints of bidirectional satellite communication links to be established in a post-disaster emergency situation in Ku/Ka and Q/V bands where strong channel impairments occur. The proposed solution allows to establish very quickly a minimal low bit rate satellite return link, using the available resources of a primary geostationary satellite system, and very small, low-cost and power-limited dedicated ground terminals. The focus is placed on: (i) the principle and performance analysis of the adaptive strategy that was devised using the DVB-S2 modulation and coding (ACM) scheme along with other techniques, (ii) the implementation of the transmission channel simulation model within the Juzzle open source environment software, and (iii) the preliminary simulation results obtained.

Objective: To study the extraction technology of polysaccharide from Cyclocarya Paliurus. Method: Ultrasonic wave was applied in extraction of polysaccharide from Cyclocarya Paliurus. The effects such as ultrasonication time, temperature and solid-liquid ratio on extraction efficiency were studied. Results: Based on single and orthogonal experiments, the optimum conditions were established the extraction techniques polysscharides of as follows: solid to liquid ratio 1:35, extracting time 55 minutes, temperature 55&#176;C. Conclusion: The method is simple, convenient and it is an ideal way to extract polysaccharide from Cyclocarya Paliurus.

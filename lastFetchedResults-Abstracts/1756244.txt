The objective of this study was to characterize the infectious bursal disease viruses (IBDVs) circulating in broiler chicken farms in China between 2012 and 2013. The VP2 gene sequences of nine newly isolated IBDVs, obtained using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, were determined and compared with worldwide reference isolates, which have been previously well characterized. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the nine broiler IBDV isolates are closely related to very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV) strains. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences of VP2 from the nine vvIBDVs isolated from the broilers revealed that they share 99.2 to 100% sequence similarity. Additionally, amino acids A222, I242, I256, I294 and S299 of VP2 that are conserved among previously characterized vvIBDV strains are also encoded by the nine isolates. This study confirms the circulation of vvIBDVs in Chinese broiler chicken farms experienced slow evolution and was relatively stable in China.

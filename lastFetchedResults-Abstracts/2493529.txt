     Microsatellite genotyping can always be prone to genotyping errors which significantly affect the entire subsequent analysis. One of the new approaches to overcome this problem is an alternative method of using a clustering system of genotypes based on microsatellite motif length and allelic frequencies range instead of individual genotypes. The objective of the present study was to establish an association of 13 microsatellite markers, classified into three new groups based on allele size consisting homozygous for the short allele, homozygous for the long allele and the class of heterozygous for long and short alleles, with body weight and Keliber ratio in commercial Boer goats. The results after considering the fixed effects, revealed that the class of heterozygous for long and short alleles of TEXAN006 and CSSM32 loci were significantly associated with kids birth weight (P < 0.05). The highest weaning weight was observed in individuals homozygous for long alleles at the BMC1009 locus (P < 0.05). The BM4307, BM4621 and UWCA46 loci were also shown an association with average daily gain (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the results showed that the use of motif length in the genotyping of microsatellite markers instead of genotype of each locus can minimize the genotyping errors and cause the higher probability to get a significant association with economically important traits.

This research effort details the modeling component of a comprehensive decision support system for energy planning that allows for combining existing electricity generating capabilities with increased use of renewable energy sources. It focuses on energy planning at the regional level, and it is illustrated by applying it to the greater southern Appalachian mountains of the eastern United States: a region that was chosen for analysis not only due to its heavy dependence on coal for electricity, but also because of its potential for increased use of wind and solar power. The paper specifically discusses the development of a multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) model that can be used to determine the optimal mix of renewable energy sources and existing fossil fuel facilities on a regional basis. This model allows a decision maker to balance annual generation costs against the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions, and it provides significant support for implementing a variety of different policy analyses.

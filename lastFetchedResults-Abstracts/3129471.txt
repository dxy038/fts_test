Aimed at this and based on the analysis of the overall objective of communication countermeasure system, the paper expatiate the basic functions of the system in detail and then design the system infrastructure based on High Level Architecture (HLA). Finally, the system implementation is provided from two aspects of logic structure and software class structure. The research provides an overall solution for the communication countermeasure training simulation system.

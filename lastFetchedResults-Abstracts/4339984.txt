A throughput analysis is presented of cellular spread spectrum CDMA packet networks with transmit power control limitations. Scenarios in which regulatory and/or equipment considerations limit the maximum transmitted power are considered with the objective of assessing the impact on system capacity. An analytical model is developed for an architecture in which uniformly distributed remote stations use asynchronous direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) to access base stations laid out in a square grid pattern. The model is used to assess the degradation in system performance caused by transmit power constraints, both in terms of a global capacity measure (average throughput per unit area) and a service uniformity measure (local packet success probability function)

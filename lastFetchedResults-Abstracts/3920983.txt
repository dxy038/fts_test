Compact photonic integrated circuit (PIC) chip with low crosstalk, which consists of a buried heterostructure passive waveguide, a Y-branch, a receiving pin photodiode, and a monitor photodiode on an n-InP substrate, has been fabricated and tested for bidirectional transceivers. The 50 &#956;m long receiver pin photodiode shows that external responsivity and capacitance are 0.12 A/W and 0.28 pF, respectively. The angled facet reflectivity of the PIC is measured for the first time, and the insertion loss of the PIC chip is 14.4 dB

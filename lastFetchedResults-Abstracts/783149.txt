Background Reports on the quality of life
(QOL) of family caregivers of psychiatric patients are
uncommon. Objective The objective of this study was
to assess the subjective QOL of caregivers of stable
Sudanese outpatients using the World Health Organization
26-item Quality of Life Instrument compared
with a general population sample, and assess the factors
associated with caregivers’ QOL. Method Responses
of caregivers of outpatients with schizophrenia
(99), major affective disorders (120), and neuroses (81)
were compared with 211 general population subjects.
Results Caregivers were satisfied with the items related
to the strengths of the traditional society and dissatisfied
with the items related to national economic indices.
Schizophrenia caregivers had lower scores than
the others (P>0.05) who scored significantly higher
than general population subjects and patients. Parents
had the least scores. Patients’ variables were not significantly
associated with caregivers’ QOL. Caregivers’
sociodemographic variables were significantly associated
with QOL. Caregivers’ QOL was predicted by
their impression of patients and state of health. Schizophrenics
had the least correlations with caregivers’
QOL. Conclusion Caregivers who are women, parents,
and sick seemed relatively vulnerable and need assistance.
Their areas of dissatisfaction with material circumstances
should be addressed in a social welfare
program. Caregivers’ inner strengths, extended family
supports, and positive appreciation of the patients are
resources for enhancing their caregiving role

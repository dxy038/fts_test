Generally, the implementation of various treatments of medical images, especially the 3D reconstruction, should support a real-time execution of the algorithm on the architecture: It is to meet the constraints of latency and circuit space while minimizing the resource consumption. We are interested in this project for a 3D reconstruction of medical images on a platform based on an FPGA. We have as an objective the specification and hardware implementation of the reconstruction algorithm, the Marching Cubes.

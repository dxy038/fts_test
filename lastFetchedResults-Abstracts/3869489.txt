In this paper an optimization tool in the simulation program system NETOMAC is presented. The motivation is to provide users with a simple and efficient way of flexibly solving various optimization problems arising in power systems. The most attractive features of the optimization within the simulation program system are that: (1) an objective function and all constraints related can be implicitly formulated with the block-oriented simulation language; and (2) the performance of various optimizations does not need any modification to the source program. Three improved optimization algorithms have been implemented. These algorithms have been developed in a real problem-oriented way. They are efficient and robust in practical applications. Capabilities of the optimization tool implemented are demonstrated in this paper by solving four optimization problems arising in power systems

Objective
To investigate the role of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene val66met polymorphism in the association between stroke and depression.
Method
Five hundred community residents aged >65 years without stroke or depression at baseline were re-evaluated after 2 years. Disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, WHODAS II), cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE), and BDNF genotype were also measured at baseline.
Results
The association between incident stroke and depression was strengthened progressively with increasing numbers of met alleles, and was only significant in subjects with the met/met genotype after adjustment for disability and cognitive function.
Conclusion
The BDNF val66met polymorphism may modify the association between stroke and depression

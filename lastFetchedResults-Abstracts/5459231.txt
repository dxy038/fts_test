Analytic hierarchy process is very extensive in decision-making of many objects and widely used in many fields as a classical multi attribute decision-making approach. But its judgment matrix is constructed only by decision-maker subjective judgment. Judgment matrix consistency is the core problem in the AHP. In this paper, a nonlinear programming model is proposed for improving the consistency of the judgment matrix. Then a genetic algorithm is designed to solve the nonlinear programming model to determine matrix consistency adjustments. The improved analytic hierarchy process is more objective, more logical and more compact.

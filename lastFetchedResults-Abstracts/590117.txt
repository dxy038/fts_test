This paper presents a fuzzy-based genetic algorithm to maximize total system social welfare by
best the placement and sizing of TCSC and SSSC devices, considering their investment cost in a double-
sided auction market. To introduce more accurate modeling, the valve loading effects are incorporated
into the conventional quadratic smooth generator cost curves. In addition, quadratic consumer benefit
functions are integrated into the objective function to guarantee that locational marginal prices charged
at the demand buses are less than, or equal to, the DisCos benefit, earned by selling the power to retail
customers. The proposed approach utilizes fuzzy-based genetic algorithms for optimal scheduling of
GenCos and DisCos, as well as optimal placement and sizing of SSSC and TCSC units. In addition, the
NewtonRaphson approach is used to minimize the mismatch of the power flow equation. Simulation
results on the modified IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 30-bus test systems (with/without line flow constraints,
before and after the compensation) are used to examine the impact of SSSC and TCSC on total system social
welfare improvement versus their cost. To validate the accuracy of the proposed method, several case
studies are presented and simulation results are compared with those generated by genetic and Sequential
Quadratic Programming (SQP) approaches.

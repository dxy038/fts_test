Aseptic Techniques is one of the most important steps that needs to be utilized by Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) users. This technique is crucial to avoid them from bacterial contamination which leads to peritonitis while performing CAPD procedures. Therefore, this study was conducted to assist CAPD users in learning and practicing Aseptic Techniques. A multimedia application has been developed with the integration of multimedia elements such as text, image, and video in order to help renal patients in learning the Aseptic Techniques. A usability test and an interview were conducted to evaluate the usefulness of the multimedia application. The result indicates that the application is successful in increasing knowledge, understanding and guidance for CAPD users in aseptic activities. This application provides users with a different experience in learning aseptic activities as they are able to learn at their own pace. It is discovered that the multimedia application has successfully met the objective and it is beneficial for renal patients as one of the means to avoid Peritonitis.

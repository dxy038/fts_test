E-Systems Montek Division successfully completed a series of 100 precision approach and landings at NASA Ames Research Center in June 1995 under contract to the FEDSIM Software Management CenterÂ´s FAA client. The E-Systems Automatic Landing System (ALS) accomplished its objective in demonstrating that DGPS, augmented with Kinematic Carrier Phase Tracking (KCPT) technology, can meet Cat IIIb autoland requirements for navigation sensor error (NSE) and integrity. E-Systems Montek Division was assisted in this effort by E-Systems ECI, Falls Church and Greenville Divisions and by Ashtech, ARINC, Litton Aero Products and Barken international. Two significant results of the flight tests were: 1) the KCPT fast ambiguity resolution using two frequencies demonstrated carrier phase ambiguity resolution and tracking accuracies consistently, with high integrity, from the final approach fix at 5.25 nm through touchdown and roll-out. 2) the avionics RAIM technique based on carrier phase tracking demonstrated sufficient accuracy margin to reliably provide low probabilities of missed detection and false alarm during the testing that included static integrity tests

The electric vehicles become an alternative to gasoline driven cars nowadays which calls for the technological progress on EV battery charger. This paper presents a bidirectional isolated Dual-Active-Bridge-based DC/DC converter with dual-phase-shift control for a Li+Fe battery system of the EV application. The dual-phase-shift control strategy provides two degree of freedom to control the transmitting power and improve the performance of the DAB converter. In order to reduce the switching loss and the hysteresis loss of the isolating transformer, the control strategy is designed to minimize the peak transferring current flowing on the transformer. Theoretical analysis and control implementation are described. A LABVIEW-based prototype is established to verify effectiveness.

This paper proposes a learning approach to solve adaptive Connection Admission Control (CAC) schemes in future wireless networks. Real time connections (that require lower delay bounds than non-real-time) are subdivided into hard realtime (requiring constant bandwidth capacity) or adaptive (that have flexible bandwidth requirements). The CAC for such a mix of traffic types is a complex constraint reinforcement learning problem with noisy fitness. Noise deteriorates the final location and quality of the optimum, and brings a lot of fitness fluctuation in the boundary of feasible and infeasible region. This paper proposes a novel approach that learns adaptive CAC policies through NEAT combined with Superiority of Feasible Points. The objective is to maximize the network revenue and also maintain predefined several QoS constraints.

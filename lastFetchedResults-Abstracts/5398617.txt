The main objective of this research is to automate WEFT (Wings, Engine, Fuselage, Tail) technique as input to aid VATR (Visual Automatic Target Recognition) system. VATR systems are relatively mobile in nature and easy to use in field. Earlier aircrafts have been observed using traditional binocular techniques, which are still in use along with some early warning system. The prime advantage to use VATR is to make the system more flexible and portable. It also helps to automate traditional technique with latest technology. Many techniques, currently in use, to recognize aircrafts are the same as used in World War I, and IL Although these traditional techniques are good but have limited scope in terms of its applicability and generality. WEFT is well known technique for recognizing the four major parameters of shape to recognize an aircraft. It can be applied using video camcorders to facilitate military surveillance. This paper is discussing some of the important shape feature extraction using WEFT techniques. These extracted features become an input to our Intelligent Video Automatic Target Recognition System (IVATRs) for further processing in feature extraction techniques.

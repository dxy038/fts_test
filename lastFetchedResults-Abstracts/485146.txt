Background and Objective: Many genetic studies on predisposing factors for active tuberculosis have been
conducted. Study on human leukocyte antigens (HLA), vitamin D receptor (VDR), NRAMPI, mannose
binding lectin (MBL), and tumor necrotizing factor (TNF) are the most studies in this field. This study was
planned to identify any relationship between VDR polymorphisms (Apa I, Bsm I, Fok I and Taq I) and
susceptibility to TB.
Materials and Methods: This case-control study was performed on blood samples from tuberculosis cases
(n=164) and controls (n=50). DNA was extracted from white blood cells and the sequences were amplified
by PCR followed by restriction digestion (PCR-RFLP technique) using specific primers and enzymes for
each polymorphism. VDR polymorphisms were evaluated for two mentioned groups.
Results: Two genotypes of AbfT and AabbFfTT were the only statistically significant genotypes which had a
dfferent frequency between the study and control groups.
Conclusion: Results of this study showed that genotypes of AbfT and AabbFfTT are protective factors
against TB in our patients. We could not find any genotype as a predisposing factor for TB in our study
group. However, other studies with larger group of samples are needed to find such a relationship

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients who developed acute respiratory failure due to different primary diseases are candidate to use mechanical ventilation. The outcome of critically ill child depends on how fast and carefully will be managed in PICU (pediatric intensive care unit). The purpose of this study was to determine the diseases need for mechanical ventilation.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was done on 674 children who were admitted in PICU of Amirkola children hospital during 1999 to 2003. The information were gathered by questionnaires and diseases were classified according to ICD-I0. Data were analyzed by statistical correlation, Chi square and Fisher exact tests.
FINDINGS: From 674 children who were admitted in PICU, 150 (22.2%) patients were on mechanical ventilation that 72% of them were under 5 years. The most common type of disease, which needs ventilator was neurologic disease (24%). There was a significant relationship between classification of diseases and outcome (p=0.004). There was a significant relationship between length of admission and outcome (p=0.000). Fifty- six percent of patients died.
CONCLUSION: Since the number of children who required mechanical ventilation was high in under 5 years of age and the most need for mechanical ventilation was neurologic diseases in our PICU, we must have more attention in early diagnosis and treatment of these patients.

In this paper, a novel approach based on digital linear frequency modulation (LFM) is proposed to implement high speed pulse compression. The main objective is to achieve high speed pulse compression for high range resolution in target detection using modified Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) input/output (I/O) data flow algorithm. The digital processing cycle (DPC) factor of the proposed method is investigated in comparison with previous works. The results of both simulation and implementation show 99.8% improvement in the FFT calculation time and pulse compression ratio of 71% in the proposed method. This method eliminates the drawbacks of the methods proposed for pulse compression in previous works. In addition, the proposed method has the advantages of high signal to noise ratio (SNR), and good detection of low amplitude level signals.

The proposed control objective is achieved by a voltage positive feedback loop properly designed in the synchronous <i>d</i>-<i>q</i> frame. The test system configuration and parameters are prepared on relevant international standards. The system operating conditions and the overall power flow control scheme of the studied DG are firstly described. Then, the design methodology of an a- aptive voltage shift acceleration gain based on small-signal stability and step input response is presented. The proposed control approach is intended to achieve a reliable detection with quasi zero non-detection zone, minimum effects on power quality and easy implementation without additional sensing devices or equipments. Performances on constant power and constant current control modes are investigated. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed anti-islanding approach and the gain design method are verified with comprehensive simulation and experimental results.

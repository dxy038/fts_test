High-speed technology for 3D processing of transparent dielectrics based on bulk optical breakdown with ultrafast lasers is developed. Optical glass BK7 and fused silica were used for the patterning 3D structures of predetermined shape inside volume of the sample without affecting on its surface. 3D structures consist of an array of damaged spots in the volume of transparent sample, produced as a result of laser-induced breakdown at the local point of the objective and arranged in accordance with predetermined shape.

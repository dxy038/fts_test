We present a runtime integrity measurement for Linux-based smartphones. It is based on a Mobile Trusted Module (MTM) with the objective to prevent running arbitrary third-party applications (Apps) on a smartphone. Only Apps signed by the MTM are allowed to run on the smartphone. Moreover, the proposed architecture inhibits running Apps which are infected with e.g. a mobile virus after their installation. We believe that the proposed approach is useful particularly for company administrators who want to fully control the list of Apps allowed to run on employeesÂ´ smartphones and to ensure that Apps altered after their installation or installed without company permission are never executed.

A family of alternating minimization algorithms for finding maximum-likelihood estimates of attenuation functions in transmission X-ray tomography is described. The model from which the algorithms are derived includes polyenergetic photon spectra, background events, and nonideal point spread functions. The maximum-likelihood image reconstruction problem is reformulated as a double minimization of the I-divergence. A novel application of the convex decomposition lemma results in an alternating minimization algorithm that monotonically decreases the objective function. Each step of the minimization is in closed form. The family of algorithms includes variations that use ordered subset techniques for increasing the speed of convergence. Simulations demonstrate the ability to correct the cupping artifact due to beam hardening and the ability to reduce streaking artifacts that arise from beam hardening and background events

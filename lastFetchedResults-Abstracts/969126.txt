Solid immersion lenses (SIL) facilitate high numerical aperture (NA) and consequent sub-wavelength diffraction limited focusing in near-field optics based systems. Such systems are in commercial and research use for various applications including near-field scanning optical microscopy, ultra-high-density magneto-optic data storage and near-field nanolithography. Here, we present a novel manufacturing method using SIL-based near-field optics for laser-induced patterning on silicon wafers. The near-field effect of SILs was investigated by using hemispherical lenses made of three different materials (BK7, Sapphire, LaSFN9) to superfocus an incident Q-switched, 532 nm Nd:YAG laser beam transmitted through a focusing objective. This optical arrangement achieved a laser-processed feature resolution near the diffraction limit in air. Results of experiments that were conducted at various processing conditions to investigate the effects of varying incident laser power (with peak pulse power less than 1 W), pulse width, number of pulses and size of SIL on processed feature size and resolution are presented. Experimental results are compared with numerical simulations using the simplified model.

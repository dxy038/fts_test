Ardebil city has located in East Azerbaijan. As the third most populated city of Azerbaijan; it has been one the main centers regarding the population. Since 1993 it has been recognized as the center for Ardebil Province. A number of industrial towns have been built around it and have created much waste. The prime objective of the present study is identifying suitable locations for landfill in Ardebil city. To achieve this objective, the weighted overlay, analytic hierarchy (AHP), fuzzy logic and Boolean logic methods are used. The second objective of this study was to compare the above methods and identify appropriate methods for locating solid wastes of Ardebil city. In order to collect the required data geologic, topographic, hydrologic, and use and climatic factors maps were used. Required data for locating the landfill has been processed in IDEISI and ArcGIS.3 software and the final maps have been drawn. The results show that Ardebil city landfill location is a piece of land with 45 hectares area which has located 17km north of Ardebil (left side of the Ardebil-Moghan road). Field observations also confirm the suitability of the area for the landfill. Also the results show that the methods of AHP, index of overlap weight and fuzzy logic have the highest correlation with locating landfills in Ardebil, respectively. Boolean method presented wrong location for landfill and it is an inappropriate method for this purpose.

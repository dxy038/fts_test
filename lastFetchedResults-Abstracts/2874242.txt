This paper describes the modification of a four terminal-pair coaxial bridge, part of the traceability chain of the capacitance unit to QHE, originally constructed to measure AC resistances, with the objective to measure capacitances at the nano-farad range. We also present preliminary results and the uncertainty analysis.

Multicast routing is regarded as a critical component in networks especially the real-time applications become increasingly popular in recent years. This paper proposes a novel fast multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called MOEAQ for solving multicast routing problem (MRP) in MANET. The strengths and limitations of the well-known multicast model are analyzed firstly in this work. Specifically, the “Greedy” and “family competition” approach are integrated into MOEAQ to speed up the convergence and to maintain the diversity of population. The theoretical validations for the proposed method are presented to show its efficiency. After that, a CBT-based improved protocol is then proposed to simplify the MRP, and finally, the performance of MANET scaled from 20 to 200 nodes with different types of service is evaluated by OPNET, experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of achieving faster convergence and more preferable for multicast routing in MANET compared with other GA-based protocol well-known in the literature.

We study the following web service composition problem: given existing web services S<sub>1</sub>, &#8943;, S<sub>n</sub> and a desired web service S<sub>0</sub>, the objective is to synthesize an orchestrator Orch that coordinates S<sub>1</sub>, &#8943;, S<sub>n</sub> so that S<sub>0</sub> is provided. We develop a simple input-output automata-based method that solves this composition problem. We also study whether the desired service S<sub>0</sub> is totally or partially provided by the system ((S<sub>i</sub>)<sub>i</sub>=1&#8943;n, Orch). The studied problem can be seen as a control problem, where Orch is a controller that restricts the behaviors of S<sub>1</sub>, &#8943;, S<sub>n</sub> so that the controlled system conforms to S<sub>0</sub>.

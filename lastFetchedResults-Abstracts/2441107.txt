A decision support system for the optimal deployment of drifting acoustic sensor networks for cooperative track detection in underwater surveillance applications is proposed and tested on a simulated scenario. The system integrates sea water current forecasts, sensor range models and simple drifting buoy kinematic models to predict sensor positions and temporal network performance. A multi-objective genetic optimization algorithm is used for searching a set of Pareto optimal deployment solutions (i.e. the initial position of drifting sonobuoys of the network) by simultaneously optimizing two quality of service metrics: the temporal mean of the network area coverage and the tracking coverage. The solutions found after optimization, which represent different efficient tradeoffs between the two metrics, can be conveniently evaluated by the mission planner in order to choose the solution with the desired compromise between the two conflicting objectives. Sensitivity analysis through the Unscented Transform is also performed in order to test the robustness of the solutions with respect to network parameters and environmental uncertainty. Results on a simulated scenario making use of real probabilistic sea water current forecasts are provided showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Future work is envisioned to make the tool fully operational and ready to use in real scenarios.

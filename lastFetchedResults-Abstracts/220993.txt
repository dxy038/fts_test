A general variational framework for image approximation
and segmentation is introduced. By using a continuous
“line-process” to represent edge boundaries, it is possible
to formulate a variational theory of image segmentation and
approximation in which the boundary function has a simple
explicit form in terms of the approximation function. At the
same time, this variational framework is general enough to
include the most commonly used objective functions. Application
is made to Mumford–Shah type functionals as well as those
considered by Geman and others. Employing arbitrary L
p norms
to measure smoothness and approximation allows the user to
alternate between a least squares approach and one based on total
variation, depending on the needs of a particular image. Since
the optimal boundary function that minimizes the associated
objective functional for a given approximation function can be
found explicitly, the objective functional can be expressed in a
reduced form that depends only on the approximating function.
From this a partial differential equation (PDE) descent method,
aimed at minimizing the objective functional, is derived. The
method is fast and produces excellent results as illustrated by
a number of real and synthetic image problems.

The development and performance of two translation methods that connect, and integrate the CAE and ATE environments are discussed. The objective is the automatic translation of the information achieved by CAE design simulation procedures into a program that can be directly input to the test equipment for device-under-test (DUT) stimulus and response verification. The authors show how a set of commands for the tester is automatically generated, improving systems integration and robustness in DUT verification

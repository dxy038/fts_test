The objective of present study is to investigate rolling contact fatigue (RCF) damage process of the sprayed coating by acoustics emission (AE) and vibration signals. Fe-based alloy coating was prepared on 1045 steel using the plasma spraying technology. The results show that RCF damage process is composed of four stages. The AE with higher sensitivity can detect fatigue damage details, such as the material deformation, crack initiation and growth. While the vibration can only reflect the final failure, such as extensive and deeper pittings. The analysis of AE waveform and frequency are effective methods for studying RCF damage process.

The project on Monitoring Urban Dynamics (MURBANDY) is being carried out by the Centre for Earth Observation programme, in support to the environment and spatial planning policies of the European Union, with the main objective to provide information on changes and dynamics of European landscapes. MURBANDY will quantify and analyse structural changes in urban areas and in their surrounding belts to understand past evolution and predict future trends of urban developments and their impact of the quality of environment. The project started in early 1998 and is expected to produce first results by July 1998. This paper describes the scope and the methods of the MURBANDY project

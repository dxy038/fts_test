Objective
The purpose of this study was to purify and characterize canine hematopoietic progenitor cells for surface antigen phenotype and reconstitution ability.
Methods

Canine hematopoietic progenitor cells were isolated by density gradient sedimentation, lineage depletion with monoclonal antibodies, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for selection of cells with low-forward and right-angle scatter that were rhodamine 123 (Rh-123)dull. Isolated cells were characterized for expression of CD34, c-kit, and Flt-3. A canine/murine xenograft model and a mixed-chimerism assay were used to examine the in vivo proliferative potential of isolated cells.
Results

The lineage-positive (Lin+) cells represented 80 ± 11% (n = 22) of the input mononuclear cells. Lineage depletion resulted in a fourfold increase in colony-forming unit granulocyte/monocyte (CFU-GM), a 2.5-fold increase in burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E), and a twofold increase in the number of Rh-123dull cells over nonlineage-depleted bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs). Lineage depletion led to a 2.7-fold enrichment of CD34 cells, a 10.4-fold enrichment of c-kit cells, and a 10.8-fold enrichment of CD34/c-kit+1 cells over total BMMCs. Nineteen percent of lineage-negative (Lin−) cells were positive for Flt-3. Injection of canine cells into irradiated (400 rads) NOD/SCID mice resulted in the detection of canine CD45+ cells with BMMCs, Lin− cells, or Rh-123dull cells. Transplantation of purified Lin− cells in dog leukocyte antigen–matched littermates resulted in low-level engraftment for at least 10 weeks.
Conclusion

The development of methods for purification and characterization of canine hematopoietic progenitor cells should enhance the utilization of the canine model for a variety of experimental and therapeutic purposes.

Objective. Exploring the difference of the femur anatomise structure between the trampoline athletes and the normals, evaluating the impact of the trampoline training. Methods. 16 trampoline athletes in Jiangsu are divided to two experiment groups, youth group and junior group, shoot pelvic flat X-ray photography, measure the parameters on each flat X-ray photography, like femoral head diameter, neck shaft angle, length of femoral neck, length of femoral offset, metaphyseal width T0,T+20,T-20, CE angle, AC angle, pitch angle, pelvic height, pelvic width, HT. Then compare with proximal femoral anatomical parameters of normal people. Results. Trampoline athletes and normal have some differences in proximal femoral anatomical parameters, especially different in CE angle, AC angle, femoral head diameter, length of femoral neck, neck shaft angle, length of femoral offset, metaphyseal width T0,T+20,T-20. Conclusions. Trampoline athletes devote to long-term trampoline training, making big differences with proximal femoral anatomical parameters of normal people.

This paper examines the influence of lamination material on the performance of a flux focusing permanent magnet machine. This machine is designed for the traction of hybrid vehicles. The design optimization is performed by coupling a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm with the finite element method. The optimization procedure is performed for three different lamination materials. Solutions from optimization procedure are then compared.

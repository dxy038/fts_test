The disadvantage of multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm (MEDA) is insufficiency in the local search capability, but its performance is significantly improve after introduce bacterial forging behavior. It is more excellent than NSGA-2 and MEDA. This paper combines the sensitivity coefficient of all branches when short circuit is happening in power system and MEDA-BF, then puts forward an excellent arrange scheme that application the minimum number of superconducting fault current limiters (SFCL) and more economics. First of all, we need to calculate sensitivity coefficient of all branches in the power system. Then, we chose candidate branches base on their sensitivity coefficient. At last, we apply the MEDA-BF optimal allocating SFCL with the number and economic of installation SFCL as objective functions.

We have compared the interaction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with the human macrophage-like cell line THP-1 and with human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). The association of M. tuberculosis with THP-1 and MDM was comparable in both the presence and the absence of serum. For both cells, serum-mediated binding was much greater than nonopsonic binding and was mediated by a heat-labile serum component. Nonopsonic binding of M. tuberculosis to both cells could be inhibited by antibodies recognizing CD11b and by mannan and glucan. Intracellular M. tuberculosis grew progressively in infected MDM and THP-1 cells. Treatment of the infected MDM and THP-1 cells with the anti-mycobacterial isoniazid resulted in the rapid killing of the intracellular mycobacteria. Differentiated, adherent THP-1 cells bound IgG and complement-coated particles at levels similar to those of MDM. However, binding of zymosan by THP-1 cells was significantly lower than that seen for MDM.

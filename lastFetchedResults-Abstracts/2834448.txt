This paper presents the design of voltage and current references in short channel CMOS technologies operating with Low Supply Voltages (&lt;; 1.2V). The objective is to design simple circuits having good Power Supply Rejection (PSR) with minimal power consumption and area which are easy to re-use. The references are based on class AB CMOS inverters and current mirrors. A voltage reference is obtained as a scaled sum of two diode voltages carrying different current densities so that it is equal to a fraction of the bandgap voltage of silicon. The current reference is obtained by calibrating a simple current source using the bandgap voltage and a switched capacitor conductance clocked by the system clock.

Background & Objective: Many cases of neonatal deaths which are caused by asphyxia could be prevented by appropriate resuscitation. Successful resuscitation depends on several factors including the skill of nurses and midwives involved in taking care of sick neonates.

Methods: In this study, 88 nurses and midwives in Kerman Province Hospitals participated and all completed an 11-hour neonatal resuscitation course. Among the participants, 25 were selected for the based line survey. After five months, all of them sat for a theoretical and practical test including nine stations.

Results: Five months after the workshop, the mean theoretical and practical scores of the participants in different hospitals showed a significant difference (P=0.0001). Scores of the practical test varied in different stations. The highest score belonged to "neonate's tactile stimulation" while the lowest was given to "resuscitating a non vigorous meconium stained neonate". There was a weak inverse yet significant relationship between age and the time past from graduation with the practical score (P=0.035, r=-0.23 and P=0.017 and r=-0.25 respectively). Practicing on mannequin and studying the provided notes on resuscitation led to getting a significantly higher score (P=0.0001 and P=0.046 respectively).

Conclusion: This study shows that teaching resuscitation alone may not guarantee skill in people. Maintaining resuscitation skill is influenced by factors such as age, job status, practicing on mannequin, and participation in neonatal resuscitation.

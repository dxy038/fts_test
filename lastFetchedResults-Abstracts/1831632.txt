Pteridine and folate research has long been recognized as important for many biological processes, such as amino acid metabolism, nucleic acid synthesis, neurotransmitter synthesis, cancer, cardiovascular function, and growth and development of essentially all living organisms. A blue fluorescent compound was identified as 6-hydroxymethylpterin (Pt-6-CH2OH) and as the characteristic folate degradation product of various cancer cells in tissue culture. The compound was found to be uniquely excreted in the urine of patients with cancer. The objective of this study was to measure the levels of this un-conjugated pterin in the urine of patients with different types of solid tumors such as breast cancers, lung cancer and so on. Urine was collected from healthy volunteers (n=18) and cancer patients (n=21) at any time of the day, since it was previously established that excretion of pterins remain relatively constant throughout the day. Pt-6-CH2OH is expressed in relation to urine creatinine. In the present study, there was a highly significant increase (P <  0.0001) in the pterin excretion in the urine of cancer patients when compared to that of control group. More metabolic studies will have to be carried out before it is understood why the compound is excreted in increased amounts in patients with solid tumors. The value of urinary 6-hydroxymethylpterin as a marker for diagnosis, monitoring response to therapies and for prognostication must also be further explored.

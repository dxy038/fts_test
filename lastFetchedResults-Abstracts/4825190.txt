In this paper, a novel resource allocation algorithm is proposed for multi-service OFDMA systems. The multi-objective optimization model is established for resource allocation, according to the different QoS requirements of different services. In order to achieve the suboptimal solution for the multi-objective optimization problem, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical algorithm, and adopting some appropriate parameter can achieve the optimal performance practically. Simulation results explicitly verify our expectation that the proposed algorithm can meet the different QoS requirements and balance the fairness among users of the same service.

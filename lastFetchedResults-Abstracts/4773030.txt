Managing and tracking thousands of IT assets across a company manually is costly, time-consuming, and prone to errors. In order to reduce costs in budget planning, maintaining control of IT assets, increasing accountability to ensure compliance, and supporting strategic decision making, companies require a solution to manage hardware, software, and information throughout the IT asset lifecycle. The main objective of this study is to develop an IT Asset Management application that helps companies maintain information regarding hardware assets, locations, owners, and incurred costs via a web interface. A secondary objective is to introduce the application of Fuzzy Logic using Tsukamoto method to solve vendor selection problem in the procurement process. Fuzzy Logic can provide definitive solutions for vague, imprecise, and ambiguous issues by transforming linguistic-form information provided by experts in the procurement field into a mathematical decision making model. Vendor selection is a critical activity to increase competitive value of company in todayÂ´s business environment. The two criteria used in this study to measure vendor performance are price and delivery delay. Result from this study is a web-based IT Asset Management application, using fuzzy logic to provide rank and score of recommended vendors in the asset procurement process.

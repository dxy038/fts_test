The paper focuses on approaches for the optimal process control in hydroforming. The main objective is to find by numerical simulation and optimisation the loading curve versus process parameters that minimise the thickness variations and that give the shape for the final part. Different approaches are proposed typically based on optimisation strategies and requiring a sensitivity analysis, or based on a local approximation of the tube thickness versus process parameters using optimisation procedures based on evolution strategies. The results obtained proved the ability of the proposed approach in the analysis of tube hydroforming processes and its potential to handle the numerical process control.

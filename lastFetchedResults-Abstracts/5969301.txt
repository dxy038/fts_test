In the hot rolling production, in order to avoid or delay the invalidation of backup roll end, a chamfer transition is often designed at the end of backup roll. But the selection of specific parameters of backup roll chamfer for different width hot strip mills, which do not attract too much attention. In this paper, based on the comprehensive consideration of various factors including contact pressure between work roll and backup roll, and shape control capabilities, the multi-objective and satisfactory optimization model of backup roll chamfer parameters has been established, and optimized computing has been done with simulated annealing genetic algorithm for specific examples, This paper proposes a set of method on the design of backup roll chamfer for different width rolling mills, and provides a theoretical guidance for the practical application.

A circuit with a unidirectional armature current and bidirectional field current was used in order to realize a high-reliability speed-control system for dc motors by simplifying the armature circuit construction in comparison with conventional Thyristor-Leonard speed-control systems. In making the new circuit feasible, we developed a system in which either armature current or field current is fixed and the other varies depending on the magnitude of the torque command; a high-reliability magnetically controlled three-phase thyristor amplifier; and minor feedback loops provided with a field current control circuit and armature current control circuit. By using these techniques, we developed a dc motor control system that features higher reliability and smaller power consumption than conventional control systems. The new system was applied to elevator control with good results.

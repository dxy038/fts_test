Genistein is an isoflavanoid from soybeans and promising cancer chemotherapeutic agent. Genistein exposure varies widely because of cultural differences in diet. Hypothetically, this could account for differential cancer risk across ethnic populations. Genistein inhibits the growth of many different cancer cell lines by increasing apoptosis, inducing cell cycle delays, and modulating intracellular signaling pathways. Data from recent studies suggest that the therapeutic potential of genistein extends to cancers that affect blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. The objective of this paper is to provide background information on genistein, and discuss its potential as a therapeutic agent for treating hematological malignancies.

The optimum design of a condenser is significant in an organic Rankine cycle to achieve higher waste heat utilization efficiency. Based on the mathematical model of a condenser using plate heat exchanger (PHE), some key geometric parameters on the total heat transfer surface area and pressure drop of the condenser are examined. In order to obtain geometric parameters of a plate heat exchanger, a multi-objective optimization of the condenser in organic Rankine cycle is conducted to achieve the optimal geometry design. The total heat transfer surface area and pressure drop are selected as two objective functions to minimize both total heat transfer surface area and pressure drop under the constant heat transfer rate and LMTD conditions. The plate width, plate length and plant distance are selected as the decision variables. Non-dominated sorting generic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) which is an effective multi-objective optimization method is employed to solve this multi-objective optimization design of PHE. The results show that an increase in channel distance or plate width increases the total heat transfer surface area and decreases pressure drop in the condenser. It is noted that the plate length of PHE has a positive effect on the optimization design of PHE. By multi-objective optimization design of the PHE, a Pareto optimal point curve is obtained, which shows that a decrease in total heat transfer surface area of a condenser can increase the pressure drop through the condenser.

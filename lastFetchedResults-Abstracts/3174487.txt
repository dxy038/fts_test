This paper illustrates the importance of control on energy saving opportunity for electrical drives systems. The paperÂ´s objective is to present a real time implementation of suboptimal control law for an electrical positioning system with induction machine at constant flux. The suboptimal control is based on numerical integration of the Matrix Riccati Differential Equation (MRDE).

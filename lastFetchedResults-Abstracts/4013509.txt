The most active development of commercial fuel cells was undertaken in 1967 by United Technologies for a consortium of 32 gas or mixed gas-electricity companies known as TARGET. The first phase of the TARGET program resulted in 1971 in the development of an early experimental 12.5 kW hydrocarbon-air fuel cell (Powercel PC-11). From January to December 1973, Hydro-Qu&#233;bec tested, under the actual operating conditions of an electrical network, six of these PC-11 power plants for a nominal output of 75 kW. The reason Hydro-Qu&#233;bec came to study fuel cells was to seek a more economical way of generating electricity in remote areas of the province. A description is given of the components and operation of the PC-11 fuel cell and of the installation used to conduct the tests. Practical problems encountered and some of the results obtained during the testing program are outlined. On the other hand, in 1974, United Technologies announced the beginning of another fuel cell program for Electric Utilities. The objective of this new program is to develop a 26 MW fuel cell generator for dispersed power generation. Finally, the application of fuel cell with regards to storage of electricity is briefly discussed.

This paper proposes a new joint power control and resource allocation algorithm in OFDMA femtocell networks. We consider both QoS constrained high-priority (HP) and best-effort (BE) users having different types of application and bandwidth requirements. Our objective is to minimize the transmit power of each femtocell, while satisfying a maximum number of HP users and serving BE users as well as possible. This optimization problem is multi-objective NP-hard. Hence, we propose a new scheme based on clustering and taking into account QoS requirements of users. We show by extensive network simulation results that our proposal outperforms three state of the art schemes (Centralized-Dynamic Frequency Planning, C-DFP, Distributed Random Access, DRA and Distributed Resource Allocation with Power Minimization, DRAPM as well as our previous proposal, FCRA, in both low and high density networks. The results concern the rate of rejected users, the throughput satisfaction rate, the spectrum spatial reuse, fairness, as well as computation time.

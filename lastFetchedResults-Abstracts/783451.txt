Objective Although socially disadvantaged
groups are known to have a high risk of poor
health the involved mechanisms and psychosocial
dynamics are not fully understood. Long-term
unemployment and the perception of social justice
may both additionally endanger health. We therefore
set out to explore the specific impact of these two
context variables on self-reported health, health
behaviour, and resources in marginalised groups.
Methods A structured interview survey was conducted
in three federal provinces in Austria, which
targeted a quota sample of 486 subjects in long-term
unemployment. Results Both, duration of long-term
unemployment and low perceived social justice, are
strongly associated with self-reported poor health and
low personal (internal) and social (external) health
resources. The best differentiation of dependent
variables concerning the univariate analyses was
found with respect to social health resources, as all
variables on this level significantly correlated with
perceived social justice but not with duration of longterm
unemployment. Conclusion While this study
does not allow to establish causal relationships, the
associations we found suggest that also perceived
social justice needs to be taken into account in
interventions that are intended to foster equity in
health among socially disadvantaged groups.

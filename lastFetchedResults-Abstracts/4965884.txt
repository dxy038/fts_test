This paper describes the first results of an extensive measurement campaign for evaluating the potential impact of scattered signals from wind turbines to terrestrial DTV reception quality in the UHF band. The field trial carried out in Northern of Spain has two main objectives: the empirical characterization of the scattered signals from the wind turbines, and the assessment of the potential impact of these scattered signals to the reception quality of the terrestrial DTV systems. This paper includes preliminary results relating to the second objective. Some empirical threshold carrier-to-noise ratios in the area of influence of a wind farm are presented in order to verify whether scattered signals from wind turbines could affect the threshold carrier-to-noise ratio required for quasi-error-free reception in the DVB-T system.

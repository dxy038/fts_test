In the last decades, rice yields in South Asian countries grew
tremendously in one hand and a noticeable yield fluctuation
on the other. The objective of this study was to examine the rice
yield distributions, estimate yield risks at country level, and
compare risks between five countries namely Afghanistan,
Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan. Anderson Darling
(AD) test was applied to test the goodness-of-fit for four distributions
by using country level de-trended rice yields from 1961
to 2010. Results showed the Normal distribution was fitted well
in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, whereas the Weibull distribution
in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan. The average yield risks at
85% of the expected yield were found 5.29, 4.27, 3.86, 1.55,
and .15% in Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, and
Bangladesh, respectively. Wilcoxon signed rank test results of
mean absolute percentage differences showed yield risk in
Bangladesh was significantly lower than the rest four counties
and that in Afghanistan was significantly higher than Nepal and
Bangladesh at 0.1 level. The outcome of this study could give
policy implications for designing and implementing the risk reducing
programs in the countries with higher yield risk.

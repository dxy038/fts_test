Physical-layer cooperation allows leveraging the spatial diversity of the wireless channel without requiring multiple antennas on a single device. However, most research in this field focuses on optimizing physical layer metrics, with little consideration for network-wide and application-specific performance measures. This paper studies cross-layer design techniques for video streaming over cooperative networks. The problem of joint video rate control, relay selection, and power allocation is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem, with the objective of maximizing the sum peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of a set of concurrent video sessions. An asynchronous, distributed and localized low-complexity algorithm is designed, based on the iterative solution of convex optimization problems at each individual node. In addition, a global-optimization centralized algorithm based on convex relaxations of non-convex constraints is also proposed as performance benchmark. The distributed algorithm is shown to achieve performance within a few percentage points of the optimal solution. It is also shown that cooperative relaying allows nodes to reduce the overall power consumption without leading to a perceivable decrease in video quality.

It has been recognised that a model predictive control (MPC) approach can be successfully applied to many areas in the signal control of urban traffic networks. In this study, the authors propose a novel distributed MPC algorithm with decomposition of the signal control problem in the urban traffic networks. The objective of each subsystem takes into account the information of neighbouring subsystems, being this way affected by their non-local decisions. The proof is also given to show that the solution of the new approach will converge to a global optimum after adequate iterations. Moreover, the simulation result shows that our method solves the problem with an acceptable solution performance.

In order to protect the fragile panel of a liquid crystal display (LCD) from damage caused by shock, a shock-absorbing structure designed to absorb most of the shock energy can be installed between the panel and the frame. The design methodology proposed in this paper uses the topology optimization technique in designing this shock-absorbing structure. The objective is to minimize the maximal panel stress with the shock-absorbing structure, which is designed to be of minimal weight. An algorithm which integrates three modules-the finite-element software ANSYS/LS-DYNA used as the structural analysis tool, the optimization module based on the differential evolution method, and a topology module - is developed to achieve crashworthiness design. Numerical results show that an optimal layout of the shock-absorbing structure with minimal weight is obtained. And, this shock-absorbing structure is proven to effectively increase LCD shock resistance.

We consider the problem of designing optimal online-ad investment strategies for a single advertiser, who invests at multiple sponsored search sites simultaneously, with the objective of maximizing his average revenue subject to an advertising budget constraint. A greedy online investment scheme is developed to achieve an average revenue that can be pushed to within O(&#8712;) of the optimal, for any &#8712; &gt; 0, with a tradeoff that the temporal budget violation is O(1/&#8712;). Different from many existing algorithms, our scheme allows the advertiser to asynchronously update his investments on each search engine site, hence applies to systems where the timescales of action update intervals are heterogeneous for different sites. We also quantify the impact of inaccurate estimation of the system dynamics and show that the algorithm is robust against imperfect system knowledge.

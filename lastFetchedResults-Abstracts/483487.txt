Objective: The aim of this research is studying the role of achievement goals in student's self-regulating learning. Method: subjects are 685 students of third grade in height school in Tehran city. Sampling method was multistage cluster sampling. Motivated strategies for learning questionnaire (MSLQ)'s, pintrich and De Groot (1990) and students achievement goal orientations's Midgly and his colleague (1997) was administrated with_group method. Questionnaires validity and reliability was satisfied. Subjects placed in 5 groups by their goal orientations (mastery, approach-performance and avoiding-performance, multiple goals and no goal). Results: Results of comparing means by (MANOVA) show that means of self- regulating learning components were significance in 5 groups (p< 0/01). Post hoc tests (tuky and shefe) show that means of cognitive and references management strategies is lest in avoiding-performance and no goal groups (p< 0/01). Mutual means of mastery, approach- performance and avoiding-performance, multiple goals groups do not have significance difference. Mean of avoiding-performance group is better rather than no goal group. Means of cognitive strategies in some groups is difference with others (p< 0/01). Conclusion: providing multiple goal and mastery constructs and environments have important role in developing self-regulating learning skiffs and components. Therefore it should practice to this goal.

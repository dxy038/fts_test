Introduction Hundreds of physicians go to remote places to provide service once in a week in district and sub district private health centers, rest of the days patients wait for their physicians for the next visit after 1Â week. There are no specialist physicians in most of the districts and sub district levels in Bangladesh. Roads and Highways are under developed where as well covered by Telecom network and rapidly growing. People, modernized medical services. Objectives The main objective of the study was to cross the geographical berries and provide healthcare facilities to rural and remote areas (health for all) so it is beneficial for the population living in isolated communities. Materials and methods Telemedicine consultations take place over a video conference in which both the patient and doctor see each other on television screen. Results The result revels that Internet-based telemedicine as the optimal and cost-effective solution in this perspective. We illustrate a case study of Diabetic Association of Bangladesh between Dhaka and Faridpur. Conclusions Future work will be on more cost-effective image-construction retaining standards, faster transmission facilities, synchronous video-conferencing between patient and doctor. Besides telemedicine issues regarding other prevalent diseases of Bangladesh (e.g., heart-disease, diabetes) must be taken into account.

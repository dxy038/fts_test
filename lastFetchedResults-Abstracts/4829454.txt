The article deals with the subjective evaluation of 3D image perception for different viewing angles. Results of the subjective testing, observations of the two different 3D video-sequences and two 3D photographs made by 28 observers on two different types of 3D displays (active and passive technologies) are shown. The results of measuring the objectively measurable photometric and colorimetric parameters of the observed image depending on the viewing angle are also referred in this article. The results confirm the expected constraints of the used systems. The article contains description of subjective tests, their summary and evaluation of results. Results of subjective tests are complemented by objective measurement of photometric and colorimetric display parameters.


Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of neurofeedback therapy
on event-related potential (EPR) at both behavioral and physiological level in children (7-12
years) with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Methods: The current study is a quasi-experimental project whit pre-test and post-test control
group. In this study, the subjects (12 patients in the experimental group and 12 patients in
the control group) were selected after initial evaluation, according to DSM-IV criteria for
attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and the type of sampling is purposeful. Due to control
of intelligence variable, the children with normal range of IQ were selected. Subjects were
matched as much as possible with respect to age, IQ, and comorbidity with other disorders.
Subjects performed visual continuous performance task VCPT at two time points by two months
interval (at the start and end of the program). Analysis of variance with repeated measures
ANOVA and ANCOVA methods were used respectively for the evolution of neurofeedback
effects on EPR and behavioral characteristics (omission error, commission error, and reaction
time). For statistical processing SPSS software version 21 was used. Results: No significant differences were observed between experimental and control groups in
event-related potentials of both behavioral and physiological level. Conclusion: Application of neurofeedback is a useful approach in improving performance
of patients with ADHD through the normalization of patient’s brain waves, especially in the
prefrontal area.

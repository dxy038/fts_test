This paper presents a methodology for transmission expansion planning using AC optimal power flow. A multi-objective framework has been considered in which three objectives are represented. The objectives are to minimize the investment cost (IC), minimize the operation cost (OC) and also to minimize the power losses (PL). The augmented &#949;-constraint method was used so as to solve the proposed multi-objective mathematical programming (MMP) problem using lexicographic optimization for every objective function in order to construct the payoff table. The method used can create all Pareto optimal solutions in which the decision maker can select the best optimal solution based on his/her preferences. The proposed model has been applied to GarverÂ´s six bus test system and also to a real system of north-eastern part of the Iranian national 400-kV transmission grid. The detailed results of the case study are presented and analyzed.

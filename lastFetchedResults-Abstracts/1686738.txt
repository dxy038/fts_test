Seismic performance-based design of a steel structure is performed using a multi-objective optimization that considers both direct economic and social losses. Specified performance objectives are considered as constraints and their variance over the obtained Pareto front is investigated. Optimization objectives are selected as the lifetime cost calculated from the initial construction cost and expected annual loss associated with seismic direct economic losses, and direct social loss parameter defined as expected annual social loss. Inelastic time history analysis is used to evaluate structural response under different levels of earthquake hazard to obtain engineering demand parameters. To illustrate the seismic performance-based design procedure, calculations are presented and compared for a sample steel structure located in Los Angeles, CA and Memphis, TN.

The subchronic toxicity and toxicokinetics of a novel proton pump inhibitor, pymeprazole (LZB), were investigated in beagle dogs by daily oral administration for 13 consecutive weeks. Three test groups received doses of 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day of LZB. Rabeprazole of 60 mg/kg/day was used as positive control. The 13-week repeated oral doses of LZB resulted in objective signs of mild gastrointestinal disturbance for high-dose group animals. One individual dog of high-dose group was found to be lethargy and astasia at the last month of administration; for hematology, mild anemia was observed at high-dose females; for clinical chemistry, higher cholest, trigly and gastrin were observed at high-dose females, higher ASAT, ALAT, cholesterol, triglyceride and gastrin at high-dose males were also observed; for histopathology, the primary effects of LZB were related to gastric mucosa of high-dose group seen by H and E or Grimelius stain. Impairment of surface epithelium was observed by SEM. The treat-related effects basically were reversible for a 4-week drug-free period. As for positive control group, 13-week oral administration of rabeprazole resulted in more severe toxicity than high-dose group of LZB although much lower dose was employed. The accumulation of LZB after 13-week oral administration was not notable at the toxic dose of 300 mg/kg/day. The toxic dose was considered to be 100 mg/kg/day and the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) to be 30 mg/kg/day, which is much higher than other PPIs. The toxicological target could be stomach, liver, hematological system and nervous system.

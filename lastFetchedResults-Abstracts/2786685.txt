The purpose of this paper is to propose a new method for the optimization of the transient step response of a linear continuous-time system. The approach situates in the framework of model pseudo-inversion [1]-[3] because the input reference is computed starting from some desired features of the transient output. A significant feature of the new method is that the transition trajectory is not &#8220;ad hoc&#8221; exactly pre-specified by the designer. Rather, it is implicitly defined by the procedure for the minimization of a suitably multi-objective quadratic cost functional.

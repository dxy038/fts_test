Development of safe and effective cancer vaccine formulation is a primary focus in the field of cancer immunotherapy. The recognition of the crucial role of dendritic cells (DCs) in initiating anti-tumor immunity has led to the development of several strategies that target vaccine antigens to DCs as an attempt for developing potent, specific and lasting anti-tumor T cell responses. The main objective of this review is to provide an overview on the application of poly (d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) as cancer vaccine delivery system and highlight their potential in the development of future therapeutic cancer vaccines. PLGA-NPs containing antigens along with immunostimulatory molecules (adjuvants) can not only target antigen actively to DCs, but also provide immune activation and rescue impaired DCs from tumor-induced immuosupression.

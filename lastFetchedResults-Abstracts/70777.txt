The kinetics of the fast complexation of zinc(II) with 8-quinolinol (Hqn) and 5-octyloxymethyl-8-quinolinol (Hocqn) at the 1-butanol/water interface was investigated with two-phase sheath flow/laser-induced fluorescence microscopy. The micrometer-sized two-phase sheath flow system was constructed in a flow cell, in which the 1-butanol phase was introduced as an inner flow and the aqueous phase as an outer flow. The fluorescence emitted from the zinc(II) complex was corrected by an objective lens, and detected with a CCD camera. It was revealed that the fluorescence intensity had a maximum value at the interfacial region, and increased with the reaction time up to 2 ms after the formation of the interface. The complexation rate increased with the increase of the initial ligand concentration in the organic phase, giving a saturation curve. The complexation rate of Hqn with zinc(II) was three times faster than that of Hocqn at equivalent conditions. A digital simulation taking into account the interfacial formation rate of 1:1 complex, the interfacial adsorption of the ligand and complex, and the diffusion of each species reproduced accurately the observed results. It was suggested that the interfacial adsorption of ligands was delayed and depressed by the preferential occupancy of 1-butanol molecules at the interface.

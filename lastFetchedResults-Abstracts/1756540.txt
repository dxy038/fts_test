Objective
pe D Scale-14 (DS14) measures distressed (also, Type D) personality by assessing the medium-level trait negative affectivity that encompasses the low-level traits dysphoria, anxiety, and irritability, and the medium-level trait social inhibition that encompasses the low-level traits social discomfort, reticence, and lack of social poise. The literature discusses three different structural models of the DS14. The goal of this study was to investigate which of the three models best describes the internal structure of the DS14.

d three methods to investigate the internal structure of the DS14 items using data collected in representative samples from the Dutch general population (N = 3,181). The methods were exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and Mokken scale analysis.
s
atory factor analysis suggested a two-factor structure without evidence of the low-level factors, and the other two methods showed evidence of a three-level structure including the low-level factors.
sions
factor model with correlated errors for items defining low-level traits adequately describes the data. The results support the three-level hierarchical model as a conceptual model for Type D personality, and support the interpretation of DS14 scores on item subsets representing medium-level traits and low-level traits.

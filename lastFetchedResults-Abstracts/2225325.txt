Objective: There is a wide application of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) in
industry. These particles are used in various products, and they also has biological effects
on cells and organs through direct contact.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental research, the effect of TiO2 on chondrogenesis
of forelimb buds of mice embryos was assessed in in vivo condition. Concentrations
of 30, 150 and 500 mg/kg body weight (BW) TiO2 NPs (20 nm size) dissolved in distilled
water were injected intraperitoneally to Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) mice on
day 11.5 of gestation. On day 15, limb buds were amputated from the embryos and skeletogeneis
of limb buds were studied.
Results: TiO2 NPs caused the significant changes in chondrocytes in the following developmental
stages: resting, proliferating, hypertrophy, degenerating, perichondrium and
mesenchymal cells. Decreased number of mesenchymal cells and increased level of
chondrocytes were observed after the injection of different concentrations of TiO2, which
proves the unpredictable effects of TiO2 on limb buds.
Conclusion: Results of the present study showed TiO2 NPs accelerated the chondrogenesis
of limb buds, but further studies are recommended to predict TiO2 toxicity effects on
organogenesis.

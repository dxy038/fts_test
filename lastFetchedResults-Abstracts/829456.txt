Hopelessness and not having a positive and optimistic attitude is an 
issue that while ruining man’s purposeful endeavors, it discourages human psychological health as well. It is believed in positivistic psychology that some factors such as hopelessness can lead to different types of illnesses. Therefore, in the last two decades, psychologists have in light of a theory called “hope theory” proceeded to treat depression through concentration on hopeful thinking. On the other hand, in respect to the efficacy of an individual’s worldview in overcoming different types of illnesses, the role of religion in overcoming hopelessness cannot be neglected.The present research is intended to conduct a comparative study on hopelessness in the Snyder’s theory and its retrieval in the concepts of the Qur’an and to pinpoint the overlapping of these two areas in explaining the above issue. In conclusion, it has been found out that the commonalities concerning hopelessness in the above two areas are more than their differences and that the human findings are very similar to the Revealed ones; and since science is basically the statement of the beings and non-beings, therefore the relation with spirituality in stating the values and their do’s and don’ts has a very influential impact in confronting hopelessness. Of course, more experimental and objective studies remain to be conducted to make any judgment concerning more or less efficacy.

This paper empirically investigates a sample of capital facility projects in the construction industry. The purpose of this paper is three-fold. The first objective of this study was to validate a model for assessing the relationships among IT application, KM practice adoption, and project success (project performance and project benefits). The second objective was to evaluate the mediating role of KM practice adoption in the relationship between IT application and project performance. The third objective was to investigate whether the effect of knowledge management on project success may be moderated by project type. The structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was used to validate the research model. These analyses suggest that levels of IT application are positively associated with projects' levels of knowledge management. Additionally, project outcomes can be achieved with higher levels of knowledge management. The findings also indicate that KM practice adoption fully mediate the effects of IT application on project performance in terms of schedule and cost success as well as quality and safety performance. The results also show that team relationship and team size have a moderating effect on the relationship between knowledge management and project success.

The objective of this research is to investigate the feasibility of using Conway´s game of life to solve the problem on printed Lanna character recognition. Pattern recognition can be defined as the objects identification on the basis of information available about it. The problem on character recognition has been discussed to find out the best solution and various recognition methods have been implemented. Conway´s game of life has a capability to generate a new identity pattern, which is a stable state, from predefined pattern. The proposed framework consists of three modules: preparation, training and recognition. The experiments are carried on 1,200 printed Lanna characters, which randomly selected from documents written in Lanna language. The system performs the number of match 1,142 characters or 95.15%, while mismatch 27 characters or 2.25% and rejecting 31 characters or 2.58%.

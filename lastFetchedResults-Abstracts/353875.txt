β-adrenergic stimulation helps to synchronize Ca release in myocytes from failing hearts. Transverse (t-) tubules, which synchronize Ca release in normal cells and contain many of the elements of the β-adrenergic pathway, may be depleted in such cells. The objective of the present study was to determine whether β-adrenergic stimulation could reverse the desynchronization of Ca release observed in detubulated ventricular myocytes. The effect of isoprenaline (0.5 μM) on control and detubulated rat ventricular myocytes was investigated. Ca transients were monitored using whole-cell fluorescence and confocal microscopy, and Ca current recorded using the patch-clamp technique. Immunocytochemistry was used to investigate phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation. Detubulation reduces and slows the Ca transient; these effects were reversed by isoprenaline. This restoration was associated with partial reversal of the desynchronization of Ca release that occurs in detubulated cells. Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca load increased by the same amount in normal and detubulated cells, but Ca current increased less in detubulated cells (64%) than in control cells (124%) in response to isoprenaline. The pattern and extent of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and CaMKII-induced phosphorylation of PLB in response to isoprenaline was the same in both cell types. Thus, the β-adrenergic pathway is functional in the absence of t-tubules; such stimulation appears to increase the speed of propagation of Ca via Ca-induced Ca release between adjacent clusters of ryanodine receptors, which may be relevant in pathological conditions, such as heart failure, in which t-tubules are depleted. The data also suggest that the Ca current responds to local signaling pathways, which are better coupled to the channel in the t-tubules than at the surface membrane, whereas PLB responds to whole-cell signaling.

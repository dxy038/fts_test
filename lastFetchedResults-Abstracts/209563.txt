Kelussia odoratissima Mozaff. is a plant belonging to the Apiaceae family which has got
high nutrition and medicinal value and is extensively used for treatment several diseases. The
objective of this research was determination of content and composition of fatty acids, total
phenolic content and essential oil content on K. odoratissima seed. Extraction of total phenolics
content earried out by Folin-Ciocalteu method and the absorbance at 750 run was measured by
spectrophotometer. Results showed that total phenolic content was 288.15 mg OAE/g OW in
seed. Hydro distillation by Clevenger-type apparatus was used for the extraction of essential oil.
2.1% essential oil was obtained in the experiment. Moreover, extracting from the seeds was
done using Soxhelet method, in addition to measuring fatty acids by Oc. The results showed K.
odoratissima seeds contain 25% oil. The major fatty aeid present in seeds (75.35% of % total)
was C18:1 including petroselininc acid (CI8:I(n-12)) and oleic acid (CI8:I(n-9)). Other fatty
acids were including linoleic acid (19.14%), palmitic acid (6.65%), stearic acid (1.9%) and
linolenic acid (.95%).

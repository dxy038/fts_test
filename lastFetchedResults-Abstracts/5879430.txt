We conduct a Systematic Mapping Study to categorize the primary research papers in architectural analysis. Systematic mapping studies can change the research perspective in an area and they can help to find the ignored researched areas. The objective of this study is to investigate the techniques used in papers on architectural analysis, identify the current trends, and provide suggestions for the future research studies. We search for papers published within the last ten years in the following databases: IEEE Explorer, ACM Digital Library, Science Direct, and Wiley. We conclude that more validation and evaluation research is needed to provide a better foundation for architectural analysis.

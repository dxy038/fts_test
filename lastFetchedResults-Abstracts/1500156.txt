Nowadays, optimization of solar systems is used to reduce system total cost, increased life cycle savings and improving thermal efficiency. It is very demanding for optimal utilization of solar resources to meet the energy demands. Various optimization techniques either deterministic or stochastic are implemented to achieve this objective. The stochastic techniques generate better results as compared to deterministic in large search space in low computation time. The optimal set of design and operating parameters are means to produce maximum system performance. This study includes review of various stochastic optimization techniques implemented in solar energy systems for performance enhancement. Based on the results given by various investigators, an attempt has been made to compare the stochastic optimization techniques in terms of providing maximum system performance of different solar systems.

The objective of the research work is to integrate the basic applications modules to generate automated, online, closed-loop control systems for water distribution networks. Such control systems will provide optimal scheduling of available pumps for least cost operations, while maintaining reservoir storage and pressure levels and satisfying demands. Monitoring and regulatory activities form an integral part of such systems, ensuring continuing safe operations

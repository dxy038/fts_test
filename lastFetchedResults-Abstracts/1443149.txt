Myoglobin and lipid oxidation are major causes of quality deterioration in fresh pork. A process to enhance color and lipid stability would prove valuable to the pork industry given the current trend of centralized packaging and distribution to retail markets. Our objective was to determine the effects of dietary α-tocopherol (α-Toc) supplementation on color and lipid stability in ground pork, and loin chops stored in modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). Yorkshire crossbred pigs (n=20) were randomized into two groups and fed diets containing 48 (CON) or 170 mg α-Toc acetate/kg feed (VIT-E) for 6 weeks before slaughter. Plasma α-Toc concentration was measured weekly. Post-slaughter, Boston butt shoulders were ground, formed into patties with or without 1.5% salt, and stored fresh at 4°C for 0, 2, 4, or 6 days, and frozen at −20°C for 45 or 90 days. Pork loin chops were packaged aerobically and stored at 4°C for 0, 2, 4 or 6 days, or in MAP at 4°C for 7, 10 or 13 days prior to Hunter L*,a*,b* and TBARS analyses. α-Toc concentration of longissimus dorsi, psoas major, biceps femoris, semimembranosus and semitendinosus muscles was determined. Plasma α-Toc was greater (P&lt;0.05) in VIT-E animals compared with CON and α-Toc concentrations were greater (P&lt;0.05) in all VIT-E muscles compared with CON. TBARS values of both fresh and salted patties were less in VIT-E than in CON meat following 6 days at 4°C; VIT-E TBARS of salted patties were less (P&lt;0.05) after 45 days at −20°C compared with CON. α-Toc supplementation did not influence (P&gt;0.05) color of aerobically packaged or MAP chops, or of fresh or salted pork patties. α-Toc supplementation reduced TBARS formation in fresh and salted pork but had no significant impact on color.

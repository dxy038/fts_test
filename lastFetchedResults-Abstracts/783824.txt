Objectives Mental illness stigma is one of the key causes
for poor psychosocial treatment adherence. The objective
of this study was to explore the link between self-stigmatization
and adherence via path analysis with insight and
readiness for change conceptualized as the possible mediators.
The direct effects of psychopathology causing nonadherence
were also tested.
Method One hundred and five participants with schizophrenia
were recruited from five psychiatric settings in
Hong Kong. Data concerning their level of stigma, insight,
stages of change, psychopathology, and psychosocial
treatment adherence were collected. Path analysis was used
to test two hypothetical models.
Results The findings supported the direct effects of selfstigma
on reducing psychosocial treatment adherence, and
its indirect influences mediated by insight and stages of
change on treatment adherence. Psychopathology was also
found to have a direct effect on undermining adherence.
This model showed better model fit than the one which did
not consider the direct effects of self-stigmatization and
psychopathology.
Conclusion To conclude, this study deepened our
understanding on the mechanism explaining how selfstigmatization
undermines psychosocial treatment adherence.
The findings provide direct implications on ways of
formulating a self-stigma reduction program to combat
self-stigma and its negative consequences

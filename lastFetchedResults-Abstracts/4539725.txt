The paper introduces decision analysis concept to help Press Company in Oman to select a printing machine. The main objective is to test the clarity of these concepts to industry and how easily decision makers (DM) grasp them. Although decision analysis has been discussed since 1976, we face some technical difficulties explaining these concepts to DM in the Press Company. One of the major concerns when applying normative approach was constructing a utility curve. Many industries apply &#8220;intuitive&#8221; decision making approach such as pros and cons, and experts opinion. Therefore, the methodology presented in the paper is to flip the coin and show that decision analysis normative approach &#8220;should&#8221; be applied to any decision making matter in the industry. We first introduces the decision frame, preferences, alternatives, and if any ambiguity surrounding the printing machine selection. By performing sensitivity analysis and overcoming technical difficulties, the Press Company was able to utilize decision analysis concepts.

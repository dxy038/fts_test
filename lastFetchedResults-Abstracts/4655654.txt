The main objective of this paper is the evaluation of security features in TPM implementations. Nowadays security is very important, especially for those who keep important information on their computers, such as passwords, bank accounts and certificates. TPM can help to keep the information protected from possible adversaries. In order to trust in a TPM-enabled computing device, one must be sure that it really secures the stored information in it. In this paper are investigated security features and concerns of TPM and also is performed an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages its shows. The evaluation is based on different experimental results which include TPM implementation and capabilities involving various software and computers equipped with embedded TPM.

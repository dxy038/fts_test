As network virtualisation continues to receive attention, recent proposals have advocated for survivability in network virtualisation environments (NVEs). However, research work within the same area has mainly focused on the single provider environment, leaving network survivability in multi-domain environments largely unexplored. In particular, survivability in heterogeneous physical networks raises questions with regard to the negotiation between competing parties so as to form coalitions for resource provisioning. In this paper, we propose a distributed negotiation algorithm which uses a system of entities to support survivability in a multi-domain NVE. The objective is to make each of the virtual network providers adaptive and dynamic by modelling them with capacity to perform QoS aware resource back-ups and/or restorations for physical link failures.

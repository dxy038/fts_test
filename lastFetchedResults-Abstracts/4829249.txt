The main objective of this paper is to present an XML-based data representation model for the exchange of power system reliability information among the power system community. Legacy power system applications represent power system data as IEEE common data format, industry standard Common Information Model (CIM) and the huge number of proprietary formats that makes it difficult to exchange the system data. The proposed data conversion model can accept the IEEE reliability test systems (RTS) data as input, and converts it to XML-based format. The exchange of data using XML is validated through XML Schema Document (XSD) and Viewed with the help of XML Style sheet Language (XSL). The generated XML document can be access, navigate, manipulate and update the content by using the Document Object Model (DOM). The proposed data representation model is error-free, adaptable and highly reliable to commonly used integration platforms like Web Services, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).

BION2 is a system based on injectable neuromuscular implants whose main goal is to restore the functional movement of paralyzed limbs. To achieve this objective, the functional requirements of the implanted interfaces include not only stimulation but also integrated sensors in order to detect patient intention, to provide servocontrol of muscle activation and to sense posture to inform more global motor planning and coordination. The technical constraints for managing the system include the efficient use of forward and reverse telemetry channels with limited capacity, minimization of adverse consequences from errors in data transmission or intermittent loss of power to the implants, and ability to adjust stimulation rates and phases to achieve efficient fine control of muscle force while minimizing fatigue. This paper describes a communication and control architecture with several novel features that address these requirements

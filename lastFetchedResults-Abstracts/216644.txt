disseminated BCG disease in 17 patients less than 10 years old.
This is a retrospective study of total of 17 cases who were admitted in Children Medical
Center Hospital with systemic syndrome compatible with Mycobacterium disease with
evidence of histopathologic demonstration of acid-fast bacilli during 1995-2004.
Fourteen cases occurred in children younger than 1 year old. Nine patients were female.
Ten of the 17 total cases were associated with an immune deficiency including severe
combined immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous disease and cell mediated immune
defect. Response to therapy was ineffective and 10 of them (58.8%) died.

that should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. Immune-compromised infants
are at greatest risk and they respond poorly to standard therapies.

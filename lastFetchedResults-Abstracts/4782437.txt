The objective of this paper is to design a control system which supports an operator´s dexterity. In order to design the control system, it is necessary to make a mathematical model of the dynamics of a unicycle and analyze it. This paper focuses on the modeling, analysis and control method. A control input is obtained by model matching. Two models are the actual model and the desired model. The actual model is derived by Lagrange´s method, and the other is derived by the Hamiltonian method which stabilizes a unicycle. A numerical simulation is performed to evaluate the proposed control system.

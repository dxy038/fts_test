Background and Objective: A large number of hospitals in the world have implemented Health Promoting Hospital (HPH) programs. The objective of this study was to provide a model for its promotion in Iran.

Materials and Methods: This study was a descriptive-analytical survey in selected hospitals of Iran. At first, we surveyed health promotion models based on comparative studies for selection of effective factors on Health Promoting Hospital (HPH). Then, the questionnaire was designed. The validity of questionnaire was computed by experts evaluation and the reliability of questionnaire was computed using Cronbach alpha(r= 0.89). At first, cluster sampling was used and 4 Medical Universities (Tehran, Gilan, Isfahan, and Shiraz) were selected. Then, in the provinces, random sampling among university professors, administrators, nursing managers and health promotion experts was done. The adequacy of sample volume was made using Kaiser Meyer Olkin method and the sample was 268. Afterwards, to determine relations of factors, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach by the softwares Spss 18 and Amos 18 was used.

Results: Findings showed that in the final model, 8 factors are effective. In this respect, the dissemination (0.64), policy (0.63), techniques for projects implementation (0.53), project implementation (0.51), evaluation (0.47) and society (0.47) have the highestto lowest regression weight or effect.

Conclusion: Regarding the relationship between the structure and components of the model, it can be concluded that for establishment of HPH, health plans, health policy and information (dissemination of health promotion programs) should be developed.

A procedure to significantly reduce the computational cost of the simulated annealing optimization algorithm coupled with analysis methods is proposed for EM devices. The chosen approach relies on the application of the simulated annealing method to an analytical approximation of the true objective function, expressed in the form of a multiquadric expansion. The algorithm is fully described, its potential advantages are pointed out and some test cases showing the effectiveness of the implemented strategy are reported and discussed. As an example the superconducting magnet energy storage device is mentioned

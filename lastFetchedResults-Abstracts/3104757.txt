A three-phase PWM bidirectional converter system based on line voltage oriented vector control is researched. A novel on line voltage oriented vector control without line voltage sensing is proposed. The system is operated with unit power factor in the side of AC line no matter in rectifier mode or active inverter mode. The alpha and beta components of line voltage were estimated by the line current, switch signal and DC voltage, so the reliability is increased and the cost is decreased. The proposed control has been digitally implemented with TMS320F2808 and the feasibility has been verified by simulation and experimental results.

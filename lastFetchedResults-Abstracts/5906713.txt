This paper consider the rendezvous of multi-agents with time delay and virtual leader. The objective is to make the entire group move at a desired velocity. The desired velocity is supposed to be a time-varying and smooth function. A delay independent rendezvous law of multi-agents is derived. If the initially communication graph is connected, then it remains connected throughout the system evolution, and all agents asymptotically converge at the same position and move with the leaderÂ´s velocity.

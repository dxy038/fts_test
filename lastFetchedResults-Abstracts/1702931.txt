Abstract
Background: Heat shock proteins (HSP) are from proteins family playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular hemostats and protecting cells in acute and chronic stressful conditions. The objective of this study is to investigate the alternation of heat shock proteins (HSP70) levels after Wingate and Strand tests in female students. 
Materials and Methods: In this semi-experimental study, 40 female students (20 athletic and 20 non-athletic) with the mean age of 22.3±3 and 23.2±2 years, height of 159.2±5 and 161.2±4 cm, and mean weight of 59.3±3 and 65.4±2 kg, respectively were selected randomly and underwent training protocols of Wingate and Strand tests with 3-day intervals. Five cc brachial vein blood samples were taken immediately before and after performing tests in order to analyze the data using repeated measures analysis method. 
Results: The findings showed a significant increase after aerobic Strand test in athletic and non-athletic females (P < 0.01). However, after aerobic Wingate test, a significant increase was observed only in athletes' group (P > 0.05). There was an insignificant reduction in the non-athletic group. 
Conclusion: The results showed that exercise duration is more important than exercise intensity in HSP70 production.

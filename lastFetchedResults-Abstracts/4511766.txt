Traditional analog signature analysis of In-circuit test canÂ´t automatically adjust the parameters of stimuli signals, which affects the judgment of circuit faults. It is necessary to adjust the stimuli parameters manually, leading to lower test efficiency and wrong or missing judgment. Doing well in solving the nonlinear problem, Newton-Gaussian iteration method can analysis and process the nonlinear analog signal efficiently. An improved Newton-Gaussian Iteration method was presented to optimize the stimuli signal. On the principle of the analog signal analysis, taking the capacitive component as component under test (CUT), the objective function was established to reflect the signal difference between the standard component and faulty component based on the electrical characteristics of the CUT. Experimental results show that the method can adjust the test sensitivity on CUT automatically.

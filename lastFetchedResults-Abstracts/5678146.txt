This paper presents an optimum approach to design input-output feedback linearization (IOFL) controller for a rotary inverted pendulum (RIP) using the Binary Genetic Algorithm. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are stochastic global search methods that emulate the process of natural evolution and because of their simplicity and robustness, they are more popular and applicable. The primary design goal is to minimize the integral absolute error of system angles and velocities and balance the pendulum in the inverted position by minimizing overshoot, settling time and rise time of step response. An objective function using these indexes is established. Then by minimizing the objective function using Binary Genetic algorithm, the optimal controller parameters can be assigned. Simulation results verified capable and competent characteristics of proposed optimal feedback linearization controller. The proposed method can be considered as a promising way for control of various similar nonlinear systems.

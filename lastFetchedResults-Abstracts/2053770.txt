New X-ray imaging techniques with excellent spatial resolution are under development for investigating surface and interface structures. X-ray reflection imaging microscopy (XRIM) applies full-field imaging to a specularly reflected X-ray beam from a surface or interface. This technique uses a zone plate objective lens to spatially resolve the reflected X-ray intensity and, by exploiting phase contrast, allows steps or terraces to be directly visualized. Thickness fringes caused by interferences in crystalline thin films grown on single-crystal substrates are observed near Bragg peaks and also carry information related to the termination of the film at either the surface or the filmâ€“substrate interface. We have applied the XRIM technique to image X-ray intensity along thickness fringes in complex oxide thin-film systems such as SrRuO3 on SrTiO3, EuTiO3 on DyScO3, and Bi2O3 on SrTiO3. Measurements of the contrast variations in the images as a function of momentum transfer, Q, allow features to be identified as steps/terraces, or attributed to film inhomogeneities. Using both the Q-resolution and the excellent spatial resolution of the XRIM technique, images of fabricated systems with lateral structures are demonstrated.

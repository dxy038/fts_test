The objective of the Crew System Ergonomics Information Analysis Center (CSERIAC) is to support the requirements of the US Department of Defense, other government agencies, industry, and academia for incorporating crew system ergonomics in the design and operation of human-machine systems. In order to accomplish its mission, CSERIAC offers a variety of services, including a technical inquiry service, which is designed to answer questions concerning the ergonomics of human-system design as directly and quickly as possible. CSERIAC has within its means a variety of approaches to extracting data, information, and knowledge to provide answers to questions and solutions to problems. Case studies are used to illustrate the process of responding to user requests for information. The case studies were chosen to reflect both the range of inquiries received and the different ways CSERIAC responds to those inquiries. The case studies comprise an important compilation of lessons learned

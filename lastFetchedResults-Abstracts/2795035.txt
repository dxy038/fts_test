A new methodology is proposed in this paper to automate traffic system to produce dynamic output. Typical traffic systems perform the task based on specific predefined rules. Best possible traffic system would not be produced by the typical traffic systems due to increasing traffic and non-deterministic behavior of modern traffic. Most feasible result has been generated dynamically implementing proposed method. Agent technology is implemented based on real-time data to produce this dynamic traffic system. Number of cars at any particular time instance on a specific lane and clock time are considered as decision making parameters. Lane status is considered as three types such as busy, moderate, and idle. Real-time data is collected with specific time intervals. The collected data is processed by the respective agent(s) performing specific operations. Fuzzy logic is utilized as mathematical model for implementation of agent technology. The proposed traffic system has dynamic nature as the outcome is being generated automatically in each specific time intervals, and is independent from previous results. Objective of the paper is to exhibit an advanced traffic signaling system using fuzzy rules. Comparison between existing system and proposed system has been demonstrated in experimental section to visualize effectiveness of our proposal.

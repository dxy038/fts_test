In this work, flexible micro-sensors were integrated in a fuel cell using the micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) process for in situ monitoring of temperature and voltage distributions in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. The greatest advantages of temperature and voltage micro-sensors are their flexibility, resistance to breakage, and resistance to electrochemical corrosion. The development of fuel cells has motivated research into monitoring their status and degradation. The objective of this investigation is to use integrated flexible micro-sensors to analyze the causes of fuel cell degradation, and to conduct accelerated degradation tests to optimize fuel cell design.

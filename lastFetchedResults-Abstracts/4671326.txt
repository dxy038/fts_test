The objective of this paper is to implement the Bit Plane Complexity Segmentation (BPCS) algorithm and provide a comparison in terms of effectiveness and hiding capacity with the least significant bits algorithm (LSB) using 4 bits. The BPCS algorithm was chosen due to the effective high hiding capacity promised. The four LSB algorithm was selected as it promised a similar capacity. The motivation for the work was to explicitly examine the hypothesis that the BPCS algorithm would out perform the four LSB algorithm using low order attacks. Effectiveness of the algorithms was measured by visual attacks and basic first order statistical attacks on the stego-images produced. The outcome of the research showed that whilst the hiding capacity of the two algorithms were comparable (both equating to roughly 50%), the four LSB algorithm at the maximum capacity was ineffective. This was due to the fact that a visual attack sufficed to realise there was something hidden. In contrast, the BPCS algorithm provided a much more effective method for obtaining a 50% capacity since visual attacks did not suffice for detection.

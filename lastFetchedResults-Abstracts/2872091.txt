The objective of this paper is to provide a Design Of Low-Speed Permanent Magnet Synchronous Wind Generator (LSPMWG) by Conventional Inner-Rotor Radial-flux (CIRRF) topology to small direct-drive wind energy conversion system (SDWECS). Finite element analysis (FEM) was carried out to obtain magnetic flux density, Air-gap flux distribution versus Angles, Eddy-Current Loss, Hysteresis Loss, Anomalous Loss, Torque, and Electrical Energy Efficiency (EEE). Comparison of LSPMWG based on the latest Soft Magnet Powder Composite (SMC) with advantages and disadvantages are highlighted in comparison a conventional Steel laminated in this research paper. Besides, to ensure SMC-5P X-SOMALOY 700HR features of magnetic properties electrical the measurements must be done on standard geometry. the results present the best-suited materials to enhancing EEE of LSPMWG.

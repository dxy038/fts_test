In order to avoid some phenomena such as too many regulating times of on load tap changer, too frequent actions of capacitor switching, lower bus voltage qualification rate and higher network loss, it is presented that a control strategy for optimization of voltage and reactive power in substation based on load forecasting in this paper. The load and system voltage forecasting are realized by using radical basis function neural network. With the times of equipments´ actions and the voltage quality as constraint conditions, the optimization objective function of the minimum system loss is established. The initial subsection load is based on apparent power fully compensated by the existing compensation capacitors. According to the subsection principle that voltage quality should be as high as possible, the tap position of transformer is determined. According to the initial optimization results, the reactive power is used as subsection load by the principle of as much as possible compensation. The best amount of groups of compensation capacitor is determined in the secondary subsection optimization. The application of 35kV distribution system in Yucheng County of Henan Province is analyzed in this paper. The voltage quality, the equipments´ actions number limit, the maximum reducing system network loss can be achieved.

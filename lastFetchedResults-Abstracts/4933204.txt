This paper is wanted to be a new conception of methodology for analysis and anticipated availability estimate of the nuclear complex systems still from design phase during life cycle. In this context will be quantified more efficient the deterministic effects which has it the design demarche for achievement activity of the maintenance, respective maintainability, reliability and availability for nuclear plant considered. The proposed conception is structured adequate to implementation demarche at a Nuclear Detritiation Plant existent at ICSI, Rm. Valcea. The implementation demarche will be in successive phases, starting from specific indicators identification in nuclear domain. It is continued with the probabilistic demarche utilization the most adequate, for nuclear plant considered, adequate of context in which will evolve the new nuclear objective.

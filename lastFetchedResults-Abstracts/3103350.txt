The topology optimization of micro-compliant mechanisms undergoing large deformation is investigated. Geometrically nonlinear structural response is calculated using a total Lagrange finite element formulation and the equilibrium is found using an incremental scheme combined with Newton-Raphson iterations. The mathematic optimal model of micro-compliant mechanisms is established. The solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) approach is employed in the design of compliant mechanisms. The sensitivities of the objective functions are derived using the adjoint method and the optimization problem is solved iteratively by the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA). Numerical simulations show that this approach performs well for the nonlinear topology optimizations of compliant mechanisms with large displacement.

In this paper, we present an experimental study about the functionalization of a Tunisian nacrite with a hydrated magnesium chloride salt. The elaborated nanomaterial composite have been studied via X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy and EDXS. The quantitative XRD analysis allowed us to determine the structural parameters related to the number and position along the normal of the layers of the alkaline bivalent cations Mg<sup>2+</sup>, halide anions Cl<sup>-</sup> and water molecules in the interlamellar space. The obtained results showed that the basal spacing value shifted from 0.72 nm related to the unexpanded nacrite to 1.5 nm attributed to the nacrite/MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O composite. The existence of intercalated water is verified by infrared spectroscopy, and revealed that the active groups on the nacrite layers and the intercalated species are linked by hydrogen bonds. Moreover, microstructure investigation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) were carried out. TEM analyses confirm the intercalation of MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O into the nacrite matrix. The main objective of this paper was to elucidate the influence of the new physicochemical properties of the modified nacrite layers that allows the evaluation of the applicability of this innovative composite material &#8220;nacrite/MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O/ethanol&#8221;.

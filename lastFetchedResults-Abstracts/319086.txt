The objective of our study was to determine the relation between the serum level of endotoxin at birth and the development of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) in preterm infants. We studied 68 preterm infants whose gestational ages ranged between 27 and 33 weeks, and birthweights between 1000 and 2000 g. The serum endotoxin level was measured in the blood immediately after birth by means of a conventional chromogenic Limulus test. Serum endotoxin was taken as present when it was >5 pg/ml (indicated by ENDO(+)). Premature rupture of membranes (PROM), the mode of delivery, EEG findings and the development of PVL were investigated. Six infants were diagnosed as having cystic PVL on ultrasonography. Endotoxin was detected in 28 infants. PROM was observed in 18 ENDO(+) infants and 16 ENDO(−) infants (P=0.085). Caesarean section was performed in nine ENDO(+) infants and 14 ENDO(−) infants (P=0.29). PVL was observed in two ENDO(+) infants and four ENDO(−) infants (P>0.99). EEG abnormalities were recognized in five ENDO(+) infants and six ENDO(−) infants (P>0.99). Between ENDO(+) infants and ENDO(−) infants, no significant difference was observed in any of the four parameters. These results may indicate that endotoxin itself does not directly cause PVL.

Objective:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of ethnicity on outcome in women with mild gestational hypertension that is remote from term. Study Design: Nulliparous women with mild gestational hypertension who participated in an outpatient monitoring program between January 1995 and December 1999 were candidates. Patients had a singleton pregnancy at <37 weeks of gestation and were followed up for a minimum of 2 days as an outpatient. Maternal and perinatal outcomes were compared between groups by the Student ttest, Mann-Whitney Utest, and Pearson Ï‡2analyses. Results: One thousand one hundred eight-two women were included in the analysis. No clinically remarkable differences in gestational age or incidence of proteinuria at the start of observation were noted. Newborn infants of Hispanic and African American women had significantly smaller birth weights compared with those of white women. African American women had a higher incidence of abruptio placentae (n = 5), stillbirths (n = 3), and neonatal deaths (n = 2) versus the other groups (n = 0 for all). The frequency of progression to thrombocytopenia/HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome) and cesarean delivery rates were similar between groups. Conclusion: Differences in outcomes are observed between ethnic groups even when the women undergo the same intensive outpatient monitoring for mild gestational hypertension.

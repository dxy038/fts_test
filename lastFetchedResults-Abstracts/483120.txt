Husserl's Idealism is a theory capable of being explained in special fields as a concrete science. It does not deny the natural objective world, but its view of nature and the world differs from other epistemological viewpoints.
In this article, the authors try to falsify a view that considers Husserl's idealism as absolute idealism by analyzing his terminology, and to show that in a careful analysis, it should be called transcendental idealism. He employs such concepts as "awareness and sympathy", "reduction", "intentionality", "intuition", and "idea-eidos" in his special sense, each of which explains the transcendental nature of Husserl's phenomenology.
The authors show that in Husserl's phenomenology, every thing belonging to this world attains its full particular meaning as well as its ontological condition. This is why Husserl in his Ideas tries his best to differentiate between phenomenology as method, and phenomenology as knowledge. His phenomenology covers all philosophical as well as scientific aspects of reality.

To solve the electrical capacitance tomography(ECT) technology "soft field" effect and pathological problem, a new three conjugate gradient algorithm for electrical capacitance tomography is presented. On the basis of analyzing ECT system measurement principle, constructing corrector formula of secant approximation algorithm in second-order information items of objective functions. The feasibility of using this algorithm for ECT problems is also discussed. It shows that it is easy to meet the convergence condition and error of image reconstruction is small. Experimental results and simulation data indicate that the algorithm can provide high quality images and favorable stabilization compared with LBP and conjugate gradient algorithms and this new algorithm presents a feasible and effective way to research on image reconstruction algorithm for Electrical Capacitance Tomography System.

The objective of this paper aims to optimally schedule and dispatch production plan of pharmaceutical products. The production of this product is deemed complex and must rigidly comply with regulations such as GMP, PIC/S (Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme) and so on. Thus, certain procedures such as setup and clean up when changing production are inevitable in order to avoid contamination on the product. However, it is time consuming process. Therefore, scheduling of the production must also consider batch to batch change and other constraints as well. In this paper the mathematical model is developed to formulate the problem and the mixed integer linear programming is utilized to obtain an optimal solution.

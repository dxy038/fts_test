This paper describes the technique of electropalatography and the development of Linguagraph, which is a user-friendly, clinical instrument, for measurement of tongue/palate contact, during speech. Linguagraph allows objective assessment of tongue function; appropriate targeting of therapy is therefore possible. Visual feedback is also provided, for therapy, and an objective measurement of outcome is easily obtained. Linguagraph was used, for both therapy and assessment, in a clinical trial. Technical aspects of Linguagraph and of the trial results are presented here. These suggest that the instrument will prove useful in the assessment and management of many speech disorders. Full clinical details of the trial are reported elsewhere.

Lead is becoming an increasingly unwanted material due to its toxic qualities. The objective of this study is to find out if an alternative lead-free solder technology can be recommended given the LCA knowledge we have today. Conductive adhesive is chosen as alternative to tin-lead solder. The result depends entirely on how the environmental loads from production of silver, tin and lead are divided between these metals since in many cases they are produced simultaneously. Further, the environmental effects of silver, tin and lead waste are very uncertain. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether tin-lead solder or conductive adhesive is the best environmental alternative

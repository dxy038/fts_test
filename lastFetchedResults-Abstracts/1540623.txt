In this paper, stability and chaos of a simple system consisting of two identical Rulkov map-based neurons with the bidirectional electrical synapse are investigated in detail. On the one hand, as a function of control parameters and electrical coupling strengthes, the conditions for stability of fixed points of this system are obtained by using the qualitative analysis. On the other hand, chaos in the sense of Marotto is proved by a strict mathematical way. These results could be useful for building-up large-scale neurons networks with specific dynamics and rich biophysical phenomena.

This paper investigates the combination of different statistical and structural features for recognition of isolated handwritten digits, a classical pattern recognition problem. The objective of this study is to improve the recognition rates by combining different representations of non-normalized handwritten digits. These features include some global statistics, moments, profile and projection based features and features computed from the contour and skeleton of the digits. Some of these features are extracted from the complete image of digit while others are extracted from different regions of the image by first applying a uniform grid sampling to the image. Classification is carried out using one-against-all SVM. The experiments conducted on the CVL Single Digit Database realized high recognition rates which are comparable to state-of-the-art methods on this subject.

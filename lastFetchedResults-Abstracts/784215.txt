Objective To (1) estimate the proportion of people in the
community who could correctly recognize autism spectrum
disorders (ASD); (2) describe the attitudes towards various
treatments for ASD; and (3) identify factors associated
with ASD recognition.
Methods A population-based cross-sectional survey was
conducted in Harbin, China (n = 4,947). We estimated the
proportions of participants who were at different levels of
knowledge about ASD and of their attitudes towards
mental health service use. Multivariate logistic regression
modeling was used to identify factors associated with the
recognition of ASD.
Results Overall, 2,786 (57.8%) of the respondents could
recognize the ASD. Recognition of autism depended on
gender, residing areas, age and educational levels. With
respect to the attitudes towards mental health service use
for ASD, 4,007 respondents (84.6%) chose to visit a health
organization for treatment; 2,470 (68.2%) made the choice
of consulting a psychotherapist.
Conclusions There is a large room for improvement in
awareness about ASD and treatment in the Chinese communities.
Insufficient knowledge about ASD and inappropriate
attitudes towards mental health service use may
impede the efforts of early identification and intervention.
Health education and promotion are needed to improve
peopleâ€™s knowledge about ASD and available mental health
services

This paper offers a method to multi objective Sectionalizing Switches and DG placement simultaneously considering critical system condition in distribution systems. The critical system conditions like tripping a 63/20kv distribution transformer and adding an external manoeuvre loud. By considering critical system conditions, a hi stability distribution system structure is offered with DGs. Additional finding sectionalizing Switches and DG places in this research, power and optimal power factor is obtained by the given algorithm. Proposed method is implemented by genetic algorithm to find an optimal structure system with place of sectionalizing Switches and distributed generators. The proposed algorithm is effectively tested on the 33-Bus IEEE test system and a part of real life distribution system in Iran.

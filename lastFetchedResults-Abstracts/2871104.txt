This study presents an application of Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to the multi-objective optimal placement of distributed generation (DG) in distribution system with special requirements for power quality and power supply. To effectively replicate different perspectives and satisfy some consumers´ special requirements, a multi-objective optimization model, which considers technical, economic and environmental attributes and introduces special requirements for voltage magnitudes of certain buses and total installed capacity with certain sub-system, is presented to place DG optimally. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method handled with NSGA-II are demonstrated by the optimal placement of micro-gas turbine in the IEEE 33-bus system considering four scenarios. The encouraging simulation results indicate that the proposed method can get better quality solutions and that the significant technical, economic and environmental benefits with optimally placed DG with special requirements can be verified. Meanwhile, the proposed special requirements strategy quantify the particular consumers´ requirements, it provides flexibility and diversity while not violating the system´s operation, effectively replicates and guarantees the consumers´ special demands for power quality and power supply.

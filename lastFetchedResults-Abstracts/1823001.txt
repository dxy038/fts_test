Objective
ant tumour arises due to abnormal cell proliferation, chronic inflammation, defect in apoptotic pathway and unwanted angiogenesis. The present study has investigated the modulating effect of apigenin on expression pattern of apoptotic (p53, Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase-3 and 9) cell proliferative (PCNA, Cyclin D1, c-fos), angiogenic (VEGF) and inflammatory (NFÎºB, COX-2) markers during 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced hamster buccal pouch carcinogenesis.
als and methods
quamous cell carcinoma was developed in the buccal pouches of golden Syrian hamsters by painting with 0.5% DMBA three times a week for 14 weeks. Deregulation in the expression of the cell proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation and angiogenesis markers was noticed in hamsters treated with DMBA alone.
s
dministration of apigenin at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg bw prevented the deregulation of the above mentioned molecular markers in hamsters treated with DMBA.
sion
sults thus suggest that apigenin exhibited anti-cell proliferative, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and apoptotic potential during DMBA-induced hamster buccal pouch carcinogenesis.

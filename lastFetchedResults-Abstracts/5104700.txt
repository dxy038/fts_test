This paper presents the design and realization of a wide band four-port microstrip matrix to feed a switched-beam antenna array for wireless applications at 1.9 GHz. The objective of this investigation is to develop an antenna-array feeding network based on Butler with a large bandwidth in order to cover the PCS band: 1900 MHZ to 2200 MHZ. In order to meet these requirements, wide band microwave components such as hybrids and crossovers were designed and used to Butler proposed matrix. The Butler matrix is used as a beamforming network that allows to produce orthogonal beams that can be steered in different directions. To examine the performance of the proposed matrix, simulated and experimental results is presented and discussed.

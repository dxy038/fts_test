Objective
jective of this study was to assess the association of psychological stress and social support with anxiety and depressive symptoms in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
s
-one patients receiving PD were recruited. Their demographic characteristics, psychological stress, and social support were determined with a structured questionnaire, and their anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.
s
logical stressors caused by ESRD and PD originated from five major sources, as determined by factor analysis. These included “Job and family crisis,” “Worry about health and family being harmed,” “Worry about daily life being restricted and physical appearance being altered,” “Fear of decline in social ability,” and “Fear of decline in physical function.” Hierarchical linear regression analysis indicated that, after adjusting for gender, age, marital status, educational level, and duration of illness, solid social support can alleviate such symptoms.

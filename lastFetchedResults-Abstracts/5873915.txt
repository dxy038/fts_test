We present a design procedure, based on ES optimisation, to parametrize IMM tracking structures for air traffic control applications. The objective, not addressed in the available bibliography on IMM filters, is to find the most suitable parameters for a selected IMM structure, accordingly to a determined a set of performance specifications. Two alternative structures are analysed following this procedure, showing the best performance achievable by each one, in terms of the proximity of the performance metrics to the specified values

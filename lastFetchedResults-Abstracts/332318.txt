Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical result of 546 tetracycline-stained teeth restored with a porcelain laminate veneer system (Cerinate, Den-Mat, USA) for aesthetic reasons.
Methods

Tetracycline-stained teeth (546) were restored with a porcelain veneer system, and bonded with Ultra Bond resin cement. The restorations were recalled after 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 years, respectively. Modified Ryge criteria were used to evaluate the veneers marginal adaptation, interfacial staining, secondary caries, postoperative sensitivity and the patients' satisfaction of the colour of the restorations.
Results

This study found that 99% veneers had excellent marginal adaptations; and less than 1% veneers required rebonding in the first 6 months; the colour of the veneers was stable and no evident staining was found. Almost all patients were satisfied with the colour match of their restorations 1 year after placement.
Conclusions

The research indicated that the porcelain veneer restoration system under investigation provided a reliable and highly satisfactory choice for the aesthetic restoration of tetracycline-stained teeth.

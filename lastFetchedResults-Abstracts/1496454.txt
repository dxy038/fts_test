The objective of this article is to analyse the standards relative to technical exigencies and CE marking that correspond to photovoltaic inverters of low voltage (less than 5 kW) as marketed in Spain. For this study, around 400 different models of inverters from the European market were compiled. Twelve of them, 50 Hz single phase, were chosen, made up of different brands and options of transformer below 5 kW. For these inverters, regulations for each model were examined according to their data sheet specifications, manual and EC Declarations of Conformity. Heterogeneity in compliance to the standards was found. In addition, in view of results obtained it is possible to conclude that it would be wise to establish a common set of standards for every country in the world (or at least a common European normalization) according to PV grid inverters. It would enable all grid inverters to be commercialised in compliance with the same standards everywhere.

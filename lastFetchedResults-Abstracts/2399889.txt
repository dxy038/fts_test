Objective
m of the present study was to investigate two- and three-body wear of microfilled, micro-hybrid and nano-hybrid composite resins using a ball-on-disc sliding device.
s
crofilled (Durafill VS), one micro-hybrid (Filtek Z250), one hybrid (Clearfil AP-X), one nanofilled (Filtek Supreme XT), and two nano-hybrid (MI Flow, Venus Diamond) composite resins were examined. The composites were filled in a cylindrical cavity, and light polymerized. After storage in 37 Â°C distilled water for 7 days, all specimens were tested with a custom-made ball-on-disc sliding device with a zirconia ball as antagonist (50 N loads, 1.2 Hz, 10,000 cycles) immersed in water, poppy seed slurry and polymethyl methacrylate slurry, respectively. Maximum wear depth and volume loss of worn surfaces were quantified by a digital CCD microscope and analyzed with two-way analysis of variance.
s
teractions between composite resin and condition of their maximum wear depth and volume loss were significant (p &lt; 0.01). The abrasive wear produced at three-body loading with poppy seed slurry was very large for the microfilled composite, and small for all other composites tested. In contrast, two-body wear of the microfilled composite, and one nano-hybrid composite was very low.
icance
ll-on-disc sliding device used is considered suitable to simulate sliding of an antagonist cusp on an opposing occlusal composite restoration, either in the two- or the three-body wear mode. All tested materials except for the microfilled composite showed low surface wear when exposed to poppy seed as the third-body medium.

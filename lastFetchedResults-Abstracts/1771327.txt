Introduction & Objective: Despite all the progress in surgical sciences, controlling  parenchy-mal hemorrhage especially in liver parenchyma, is still one of the challenges surgeons face in saving patients’ lives. Therefore, introducing an effective method to control liver bleeding is an important research priority. This study attempts to determine the haemostatic effect of fer-ric sulfate and zinc chloride and compare it with that of the standard method (simple suturing technique) in controlling bleeding from liver parenchymal tissue.
Materials & Methods: This is an experimental study. In this animal model study 70 male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into seven groups. An incision, two centimeters (cm) long and half a cm deep, was made on each rat’s liver and the hemostasis time was measured once us-ing ferric sulfate and zinc chloride with different concentrations (15%, 25%, and 50%) and then using the control method (i.e. controlling bleeding by simple suturing). The liver tissue was examined for pathological changes. Finally, the hemostasis times were entered into SPSS software and analyzed using Kruskal- wallis test, Mann-Whitney, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
Results: The mean time to hemostasis in groups of ferric sulfate concentration of 50%, 25% and 15%, were, respectively, 9.50±1.17, 21.80±2.2,and 37.8±2.7 seconds, and in groups of zinc chloride concentration of 50%, 25% and 15%, were, respectively, 15.80±1.75, 30.20±2.57 and 49.00±2.21 seconds also in the control group (suture) mean time of hemosta-sis was 91.30±7.30 seconds. The haemostatic times of different concentrations of ferric sul-fate and zinc chloride were significantly less than that of the control group (P <  0.01). There was a statistically significant difference between different concentrations of ferric sulfate and zinc chloride haemostatic times (P  <  0.01). The pathologic examination showed the highest frequency of low grade inflammation based on the defined pathological grading.
Conclusion: Ferric sulfate and zinc chloride compared to the control method (i.e. controlling liver bleeding by simple suturing) needs less time to control liver bleeding. Ferric sulfate is a more effective hemostatic agent than zinc chloride in controlling liver bleeding in an animal model.

Future wireless systems will have to support multimedia services such as voice, data and fax. Issues in providing multimedia services on wireless include multiple access, bandwidth rationing and power control. We address the latter two issues. CDMA is assumed to be the access method. Different services have different quality (QoS) requirements, maximum power and/or minimum rate constraints. In order to achieve the required QoS they can alter their power and/or rate of transmission. Different rates are represented by varying the processing gain. Since users interfere with each other, achieving each userÂ´s QoS requirement is completely coupled with the powers. We formulate this as a constrained optimization problem. The objective functions used are minimum power and maximum rates. The former reduces interference seen by other cells due to the current cell, the latter attempts to achieve the best possible throughput for users in the current cell. We develop bounds on the total number of users of each class that can be supported simultaneously while maintaining adequate QoS and meeting resource constraints

Shared resources and the processes that control them play a critical role in the functioning of concurrent systems. The article analyzes the production control of a workstation producing a number of products concurrently. The workstation is periodically stopped for maintenance. The objective of the production control is to minimize inventory and backlog costs over an infinite time horizon. Using the maximum principle and under the so-called agreeable cost structure, we derive the optimal production control. We prove that under this cost structure, the problem can be solved in polynomial time.

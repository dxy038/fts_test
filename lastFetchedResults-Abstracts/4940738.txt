With the purpose to enhance efficiency and accurate of emergency dispatch, realize reasonable distribution material quantity, reduce life and property loss caused by paroxysmal emergency events, a dynamic continuous consumption emergency scheduling model is established. Some features of emergency scheduling goals are analyzed. The objective function includes minimizing earliest emergency start time and the least disaster relief participated places. Simultaneously, satisfactory degree of disaster area is also considered in the objective function. Two main categories of constraints, namely, continuous consumption, supply and demand quantity are considered. GA is employed to solve the model, and the basic implement step of GA is given in detail. To employ GA easily, the constraints are disposed with penalty function idea so that they are introduced to the fitness value. To validate the validity of GA, the multi disaster places emergency scheduling problem for dynamic and continuous consumption is abstracted. The experiment shows that by multi running, GA can get multi efficient typical solutions so as to provide significant support for decision-making of emergency scheduling. The global search capacity of GA is strong, and it is suitable to solve complex optimization problems such as emergency scheduling problem under dynamic and continuous consumption condition.

Objective
Detection of seizure, its etiology, and clinical types is important for guiding
therapy. This study was designed to evaluate the etiology and clinical evaluations
of neonatal seizures in Kashan, Iran.
Materials and Methods
The data of 100 hospitalized neonates with a complaint of seizures in Kashan City,
from January 2006 to January 2011 were evaluated. The pediatric neurologist
made the final diagnosis. The gestational age, neonate admission age, type of
delivery, and laboratory and radiological investigations were reviewed from
the medical records. The relation of seizure etiology and other variables were
compared using the Chi-square test. All the statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS (ver 11.5).
Results
A total of 100 neonates were hospitalized with a diagnosis of seizures. The overall
incidence rate of seizures was 2.6 per 1,000 live births. A total of 59% of seizures
happened in the first three days of life. The etiologies of seizures were hypoxicischemic
encephalopathy (HIE) (36%), hyponatremia (12%), hypoglycemia
(11%), intracranial hemorrhage (11%), infections (10%), hypocalcemia (8%),
metabolic disorders (7%), the structural anomalies (5%), and hypomagnesaemia
(4%). In 23% of neonates, no specific etiology was found and 23% had multiple
etiologies. In 45% of neonates, the EEG was not recorded. The type of the
seizures were focal-clonic (26%), tonic (25%), multifocal clonic (34%), subtle
(11%), and myoclonic (4%). The types of the seizure were unrelated to the
paraclinical findings.
Conclusion
 Neonatal seizures are common and HIE was the main cause of seizures in this
study. The clinical evaluation of neonatal seizures needs improvement.

The Advanced Helicopter Electromagnetics (AHE) was initiated at Arizona State University on January 1, 1990, to address research needs on developing analytical and measurement methods for helicopter EM applications. The AHE program is a coalition of research and education efforts supported by aerospace industry, federal government agencies and state government. The objective of the AHE program was to develop analytical methods and modelings of antennas on metallic and non-metallic bodies for advanced helicopter applications and to facilitate technology transfer through industry, government and university. Under the support of the AHE members and the joint effort of the research team, significant progress has been achieved. The research effort has focused on practical helicopter electromagnetic problems, such as antenna pattern modeling and prediction, composite materials, HF antennas, conformal antennas for UHF and possibly VHF, and scale model measurements. The paper provides a brief review of the AHE program through representative examples of some of the problems that were investigated

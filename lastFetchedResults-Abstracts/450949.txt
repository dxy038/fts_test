Purpoe
To evaluate the accuracy of the diagnotic capabilitie of optical metric generated from wavefront meaurement in relationhip to pot–laer-aited in itu keratomileui (LAIK) viual complaint a expreed and drawn by patient.
Deign
Retropective analyi and obervational cae erie.
Method
Patient wavefront data from an invetigational device exemption tudy for wavefront-guided ablation were ued to derive normative modulation tranfer function (MTF), encircled energy (EE), and trehl ratio. Thee optical metric and their point-pread function (PF) were compared with data from five potoperative patient with night viion complaint. Patient were aked to draw their ymptom, which were elicited by teting with a Fenthoff mucle light, while uing their bet-corrected ditance viion.
Reult
The MTF, EE, and trehl ratio of mot patient were markedly different from thoe of the average of 208 normal myopic eye before and after LAIK urgery. The patial extent of the PF correlated poitively with the everity of the viual complaint. Wavefront-derived PF were markedly imilar to the patient’ drawing.
Concluion
The reult of thi tudy demontrate the diagnotic capability of the wavefront ytem in predicting viual ymptom and complaint of patient with high-order aberration. Objective viual metric from patient with night viion complaint were different from thoe of normal myopic eye that had undergone LAIK procedure.

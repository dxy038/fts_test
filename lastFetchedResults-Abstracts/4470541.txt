Targets assignment is one of crucial problem for multi-UAVs cooperative campaign. By taking furthest campaign benefit and survival probability of UAVs as objective function, the mathematics model of targets assignment is formulated in this paper, and an approach solving targets assignment problem based on chaos optimization is proposed, whereas a new encoding method is introduced, chaos search queues is mapped to solution space of targets assignment problem effectively by defining exchange, shift and insertion operators, and an correcting method is applied to keep the validity of solutions. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by computer simulations.

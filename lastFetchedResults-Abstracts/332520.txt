Objective
To analyze a new endodontic sealer material commercially known as Resilon™ and to describe in detail the experimental techniques employed that lead to the identification of the composite material.
Methods

An extensive structural, thermal, and physical characterization was used to identify a new endodontic sealer material using the following techniques: Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) technique, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement, thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The surface morphology was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).
Results

The material was identified as a composite of polycaprolactone, which is a polymer of the polyester family and bioactive glass, which is radiopaque filler.
Conclusions

The Resilon™ sealer material is a thermoplastic synthetic degradable polymer (polycaprolactone), it contains bioactive glass. Its properties, such as strength, modulus, shape-memory effect and biodegradability depend on the crystalline fraction, which is affected in turn by conditions of crystallization. Investigation of the crystallization kinetics of PCL is of practical significance. It is especially necessary to study its the dynamic and non-isothermal crystallization process.

Based on a comprehensive study of the literature, concepts of three-phase rectifier systems with low effects on the mains are classified. Such systems are unidirectional and bidirectional self-commutated power converters with impressed output voltage or output current and line-commutated rectification in connection with passive and active filtering. Selected circuit concepts are analyzed concerning the operational behavior and the obtainable quality of the mains current. Furthermore, an evaluation of the rectifier concepts concerning utilization of the power semiconductors, rated power of the inductive and capacitive components and of the realization effort in general is given. Finally, problems of the practical application of high switching frequency PWM rectifier systems and topics of further research are discussed

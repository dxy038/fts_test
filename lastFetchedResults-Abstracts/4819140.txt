In this work we present a new theoretical approach to the design of a transimpedance amplifier. The objective is to achieve a minimum ripple in the bandwidth while minimizing the noise current. The proposed method has been applied to the design of a transimpedance amplifier using GaAs monolithic technology. Measurements of the amplifier and of the built optical receiver are presented, The optical receiver has a 62.5/spl plusmn/0.75 dBoh gain in a bandwidth from 1.8 to 6.5 GHz and the equivalent noise current is lower than 16 pAspl radic/Hz in the mentioned band.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

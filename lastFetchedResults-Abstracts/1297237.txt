In this paper, we present an interactive algorithm (ISTMO) for stochastic multiobjective problems with continuous random variables. This method combines the concept of probability efficiency for stochastic problems with the reference point philosophy for deterministic multiobjective problems. The decision maker expresses her/his references by dividing the variation range of each objective into intervals, and by setting the desired probability for each objective to achieve values belonging to each interval. These intervals may also be redefined during the process. This interactive procedure helps the decision maker to understand the stochastic nature of the problem, to discover the risk level (s)he is willing to assume for each objective, and to learn about the trade-offs among the objectives.

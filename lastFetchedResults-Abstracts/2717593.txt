Load demand management in the context of grid-connected microgrids is the scope of this paper. This issue is formulated as a power dispatching problem between distributed power sources with the objective of grid operational cost minimization. Under the assumption of time-varying demands and supplies at individual microgrids, a cooperative power dispatching algorithm of interactions among microgrids is proposed for power sharing within the grid. This is done through a communication infrastructure in the grid and a set of defined parameters known as purchase prices at individual microgrids. As a result of this algorithm, power flows within the grid are regulated to smooth power generations at microgrids despite the stochastic load demands. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed load management scheme in comparison with no power sharing scheme in the grid operational cost point of view. Moreover, optimal solution of the power problem verifies these results.

IT has been very adequately and accurately said by many people in the last few years that much more information is required concerning the thermal performance of rotating electric equipment in aircraft. At the same time, a need exists for new devices of improved thermal performance characteristics for many applications. These cover the whole range of aircraft applications from commercial aviation to high-performance missiles. It is the objective of this paper to discuss some of these problems. In particular, the topics are as follows: 1. Rating of air-cooled rotating electric machines. 2. Overtemperature indicators. 3. New developments in thermal design of aircraft generators Obviously, all of these cannot be covered in detail so most of the discussion will cover rating with brief coverage of the other two topics.

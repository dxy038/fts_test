There are applications where a system may be required to perform multi-functional tasks simultaneously. A key challenge of multi-tasking is the ability of the system to maintain consistent and satisfactory performance, under conflicting functional requirements as well as previously unseen events. Such requirements and events could be imposed by internal processes (system related property) or/and external processes (environment related property). This paper introduces a predictive analytical model that allows a system to change state (e.g. physical property), with the objective of mitigating unwarranted events (i.e. events leading to undesirable functional behaviour).

An ad hoc network consists of wireless hosts that may move often. Movement of hosts results in a change in routes, requiring some mechanism for determining new routes. Several routing protocols have been proposed for ad hoc networks depending on routing strategy i.e. Reactive, Proactive, Hybrid, Destination and Geography etc. In this paper we are going to evaluate the performance of routing protocols which comes under the category of geographical based routing. The protocols which we have targeted are LAR, LANMAR and DREAM. The main objective of this paper is evaluate the performance, so that we can suggest the user which one is best suited under these conditions. We are going to simulate all three routing protocols under NS-2. While simulating the performance, we have chosen the parameters according to the real world conditions, so that at the end, we should be able to conclude, which one is the best under assumed condition. The paper is a future of our earlier work reported in [Bilal Maqbool et. al 2010][1].

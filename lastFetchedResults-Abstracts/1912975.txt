Improving the quality of lipid management requires an objective assessment of current practice and the ability to monitor whether quality is improved by implementing changes in practice. In a competitive healthcare environment, documentation of quality of care and patient outcomes may be important in securing contracts. It would be almost impossible to perform a meaningful clinical-outcome analysis in a timely fashion without the support of a computerized database. However, evaluating, selecting, and implementing computerized databases can be a daunting task. Before the purchase of a database, the following steps should be performed: (1) consider and prioritize the goals for the computerized database; (2) audit charts to determine whether the existing chart format meets the current guidelines for reimbursement and medicalâ€“legal standards; (3) revise the paper chart to improve fulfillment of the goals from step 1; (4) consider the specific clinical environment, including the skill level of personnel using the system, how user-friendly the system is, whether the system is multifunctional, and the costs associated with the software and implementation. We have evaluated 3 types of computerized databases and report their strengths and weaknesses; we also briefly discuss the electronic medical record.

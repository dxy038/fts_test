Objective(s): Pesticides has wide range of infertility in female reproductive. This study was done to evaluate the effect of movento pesticide on development of granulosa cells and ovarian follicles and FoxO1 and Vnn1 gene expression in BALB/c mice.
Materials and Methods: In this study 40 healthy BALB/c mice 5-6 weeks age were used. Animals were randomly allocated into four groups. Control (without any intervention), three experimental groups received 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg movento dissolved in PBS by gavage for 21 days. Animals scarified after three weeks. For determining the effects of movento on granulosa cells in culture, treatments were conducted to movento (125, 250, 500 Î¼g/ml) for 24 hr. We surveyed the expression of the FoxO1 and Vnn1 in granulosa cells in vitro, and its relation to cell death by flowcytometer and DAPI. Levels of FoxO1 and Vnn1 were analyzed by real-time PCR.
Results: Exposure to movento significantly decreased ovarian weight and the number of primary, secondary and antral follicles. Further, treatment with different concentration of movento induced apoptosis on granulosa cells. Gene expression analysis showed the transcriptional expression of FoxO1 and vnn1 in granulosa cells. Level of Vnn1 mRNA in granulosa cells was decreased in granulosa cells and expression of FoxO1 significantly increased in treated groups in compare to controls (P-value <0.05).
Conclusion: Exposure to movento significantly reduced the number of follicles and increased apoptosis of granulosa cells leading disruption of the reproductive system. Also movento reduced expression of Vnn1 and increased FoxO1 genes in a dose dependent manner.

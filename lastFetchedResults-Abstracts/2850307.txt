This paper describes a method to obtain a perceptually relevant sparse representation of a sound signal. Based on matching pursuit (MP) and recent psychoacoustic data on time-frequency masking measured with Gabor atoms, a perceptual matching pursuit (PMP) algorithm is proposed. To obtain a good match between the masking model and the signal representation, a dictionary of Gabor atoms with variable sizes is chosen for MP. In the proposed method, the signal is first decomposed using MP and the masking model is applied on the resulting set of atoms. This allows for isolating the masked components from the residual. Experimental results show that exploiting time-frequency masking allows to remove more atoms than using only spectral masking. Additionally, accounting for masking effects between atoms of different sizes and at different times allows for sparser representations. The objective evaluation of the proposed PMP algorithm indicates imperceptible distortions.

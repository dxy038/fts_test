The objective of this study was to provide some information on the influence of outdoor rearing on pasture (O) compared with indoor (I) on carcass and meat quality of cull sows. Twelve sows (6 per group) originating from the same breeding unit were slaughtered 11 days after their last weaning. O sows had heavier and fatter carcasses, however lipid content in Longissimus (L) and Triceps brachii (TB) muscles was not affected. Grazing of O sows led to a high increase in the n − 3 fatty acid content, particularly the C18:3 linolenic acid in the backfat and L muscle, thus improving the meat nutritional quality. Vitamin E content appeared (P = 0.13) to be increased in the backfat of O sows, but not in the muscles. Lipid oxidation in meat during storage was similar between groups. Histological and metabolic observations showed that outdoor rearing increased the glycolytic capacity of the L muscle, and the oxidative capacity of the TB. Outdoor rearing did not influence meat pH1 and pHu, but decreased colour (a∗ and b∗ values) of the TB, and increased the processing yield of loin into cured bacon. Outdoor rearing decreased the red colour intensity and homogeneity, but improved tenderness of cured loins.

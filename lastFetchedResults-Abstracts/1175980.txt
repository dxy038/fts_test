Abstract
Background and objective: Anopheles mosquitoes are the sole biologic vectors of malaria. Research on the anophelinaemosquitoesfauna and monthly activity is important in some aspects such as, in vector control.In this study, species composition and monthly activity of anopheles mosquitoes inMahshahr district has been studied.
Materials and methods: Larvae and adult mosquitoes were captured in a descriptive study from selected villages. Adults were captured using total catch and hand catch methods, also larvae were captured by Ladle handling method. Larvae and adults were identified microscopically using illustrated keys for Iranian mosquitoes.
Results: Totally 1746 larvae and 1167 adults of Anopheles mosquitoes were captured. Four species were identified as the Anopheles fauna in five villages consisting of Anophelesstephensi (70.55%), An. pulcherrimus (1.16%), An. dthali(5.60%), An. superpictus(22.69%).The peak of activity of Anopheles larvaeis in June and September and its monthly activity is in April to January.
Conclusion: Anophelesstephensiwhich is main malaria vector in different parts of theworld and Iran, having high potential fortransmission and possibility of establishing a transmission cycle with low abundance is the characteristics ofthis species. Specific studies such as determination of biting and resting habits and host preference of adult mosquitoes inthis area is recommended.

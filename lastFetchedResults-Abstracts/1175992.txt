ABSTRACT
Background and objective: Todays, the resistance to antibiotics among of pathogen bacteria is one of the main concerns of doctors all around the world, with consideration to different reports about Staphylococcus aureus bacteria’s sensitivity, this study was done to examine the pattern of sensitivity and antibiotic resistance of Staphylococcus aureus strains collected from clinical samples of patients hospitalized in Tehran’s Araad hospital.
Materials and methods: In this descriptive examination, after extracting Staphylococcus aureus derivations from clinical samples (urine, catheter, phlegm, wound, bronchial and blood), their sensitivity was measured using standard Kirby-Bauer test, in contract with following antibiotics Amikacin, Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, Imipenem, Sulfametoxazole Trimetoprime, Tetracycline, Oxacillin, Ceftriaxone and Penicillin.
Results: In this study 260 samples of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from clinical specimens in three years. The most sensivity was to Vancomycin and the most resistance was to Penicillin and Oxacillin.
Conclusion: The results of this study are indicating that Staphylococcus aureus strains resistance has increased against Penicillin and Oxacillin; presumably it is due to excessive consumption of these antibiotics. It is obvious that, with regard to increasing consumption of antibiotics and consequently, augmentation of antibacterial resistance, control of this resistance factor is necessary and inevitable, so it is recommended to avoid unnecessary usage of antibiotics.

The objective of this work is automatic design through genetic programming, of the fastest possible locomotion of simulated snake-like robot (Snakebot). The realism of simulation is ensured by employing the Open Dynamics Engine software library. Empirical results demonstrate the emergence of sidewinding as fastest locomotion gait. Robustness of the sidewinding is illustrated by the ease with which Snakebot overcomes various types of obstacles. The ability of Snakebot to adapt to partial damage by gradually improving its velocity characteristics is shown. Discovering compensatory locomotion traits, Snakebot recovers completely from single damage and recovers a major extent of its original velocity when more significant damage is inflicted.

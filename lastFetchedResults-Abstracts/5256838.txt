A bidirectional DC model of n-MOSFET using exponential interface state profile is proposed. The model employs single physically based exponential expression to describe localized distribution of the interface states along the channel. The saturation voltage as a function of a position along the channel due to localized interface states is taken into account. Several short-channel effects including vertical and lateral field degradations, saturation velocity, parasitic source-drain resistances, channel length modulation are included. The predictions of the model agree well with the experimental data.

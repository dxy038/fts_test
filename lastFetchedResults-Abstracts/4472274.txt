This paper presents the performance comparison and transfer efficiency modeling and analysis of a 2-quadrant switched capacitor converter (2-Q SCC), a 4-Q SC Luo converter and interleaved SCC, applicable for hybrid electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) Energy storage system (ESS) applications. SCCs offer essential features of voltage step-down, voltage step-up, and bidirectional power flow, associated with two or more HEV energy storage devices.

Determination of road safety situation as a complex issue can reduce injury and death rates on roads. This study aimed to determine the effective indicators of road safety and introduce approaches to combine different indicators for implementation index to assess the road safety situation of Iran.Methods: In this analytical and comparative study eleven indicators which have been categorized in nine dimensions were employed. Indicators normalized with maximum and minimum measures and three approaches were used to calculate the index. In order to put index into practice, data collected from eleven Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. Comparison was performed by al-Haji index which has been development for ASEAN countries in 2007.

Results: The findings indicated that weighted index results based on previous experience are similar to al-Haji index and correlations between them are statistically significant (r=0.997). This study showed a remarkable difference between some selected countries. Singapore and Brunei have the best index records, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines have the medium index records, Iran (with score 36.81), Indonesia, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos have the least index records.

Conclusions: Findings of study indicate that Iran needs implementation composed index of risk factors to prevent RTIs and to assess better performance on road safety. The road safety in our country is still far from the desired condition; therefore, more attention is necessary to be done to reduce injury and mortality rates in Iran.

Mobile Cloud Computing has become very popular because it integrates mobile computing and cloud computing. This paper has presented a critical review on existing MCC techniques especially for optimistic deployment of software. The optimistic deployment mainly focuses on partitioning an application in such a way so that energy consumption will be minimized. The objective of this paper is to study and explore several graph partitioning algorithms and propose a new ACO based technique to deploy software in mobile clouds in optimistic approach. The recommended algorithm has the ability to overcome the limitations which are present in earlier techniques.

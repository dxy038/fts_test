A new Kalman filter based signal estimation concept for active vehicle suspension control is presented in this paper considering the nonlinear damper characteristic of a vehicle suspension setup. The application of a multi-objective genetic optimization algorithm for the tuning of the estimator shows that three parallel Kalman filters enhance the estimation performance for the variables of interest (states, dynamic wheel load and road profile). The Kalman filter structure is validated in simulations and on a testrig for an active suspension configuration using measurements of real road profiles as disturbance input. The advantages of the concept are its low computational effort compared to Extended or Unscented Kalman filters and its good estimation accuracy despite the presence of nonlinearities in the suspension setup.

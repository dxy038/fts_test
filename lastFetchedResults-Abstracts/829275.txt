Objective: Cyclosporine (Cs), a cyclic undecapeptide with potent immunosuppressive
activity, causes several adverse effects including reproductive toxicity. This study aims
to examine the ability of Crataegus monogyna aqueous fruit extract as an antioxidant to
protect against Cs-induced reproductive toxicity. 
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 32 adult male Wistar rats were divided
into four groups of eight
animals each. Rats in two groups received 40 mg/kg/day Cs for
45
days by oral gavage. In addition,
one of the two groups received
Crataegus
monogyna

aqueous
extract
at a dose of
20 mg/kg/day orally four
hours after
Cs administration. The

remaining
two groups
consisted of a
vehicle
treated control (Cont) group and a Crataegus

monogyna
control (Cr) group. Differences
between groups
were
assessed by
analysis of

variance
(ANOVA)
using the SPSS software package for Windows. 
Results: Cs treatment caused a significant decrease in sperm count and viability with
an increase in DNA damage and protamine deficiency of the sperm cells. We observed
significant decreases in fertilization rate and embryonic development, in addition to an
increased rate of embryo arrest in Cs-treated rats. Crataegus monogyna co-administration
attenuated all Cs-induced negative changes in the above-mentioned parameters.
Conclusion: Supplementation with Crataegus monogyna a queous fruit extract could be
useful against reproductive toxicity during Cs treatment in a rat model.

Background: Determination of transgenic embryos from non transgenic embryos sibling is an
important step in producing homozygous transgenic mice. These steps need by PCR or southern
blotting followed extraction of DNA, but both techniques require skill and consume time.
Objective: The aim of this study was simulation of high accuracy method using novel
enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene cassette to eliminate some consume
time in livestock industry to assay high quality embryos and morphological plasticity.
Materials and Methods: We modified pQE-Tri systemic vector with EGFP and IRES
sequence to trace out coming planning of molecular farming transgene using coinjection
method.
Results: The combination of these sequences successfully showed the faint and normal
expression of transgene in mouse pre-implantation stage embryos. The low rate of
surviving green positive embryos as compare as only medium and physical treatments
could be partly from the physical damage caused by microinjection and gene integration.
Furthermore, application of the enhanced GFP marker facilitated subtle detection of
asymmetrical division appeared in some of transgenic embryos.
Conclusion: The results of current mouse simulation model imply that an efficient
production and propagation of transgenic livestock can be done by co-injection of every
economical gene with this novel transgene and also it can be suitable gene cassette for
numerous experiments and study of protein behaviors in living cells.

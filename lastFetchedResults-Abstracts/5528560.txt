In this study the Parameters of the classic PSS and STATCOM internal AC and DC voltage controllers and AC-damping stabilizer are designed in order to damp the Low Frequency Oscillations (LFO). The STATCOM is used for adjusting the voltage in line and the dynamic effect of STATCOM is considered. The design of PSS and STATCOM parameters is considered as an optimization problem and Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) is used for searching optimized parameters. The introduced objective function in this paper is based on the system modes of oscillation considering all modes in the objective function. The participation factors method is used for identifying the type of each mode. The study is performed on the linearized power system model with presence of STATCOM and PSS. The analysis of the eigenvalue method is used for optimal parameter adjustment. These studies are performed for five operating points. The design is performed using nonlinear simulation. The results show that the design according to simultaneous optimization is an effective procedure for power system stability improvement.

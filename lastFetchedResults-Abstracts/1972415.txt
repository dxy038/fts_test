The objective of this research is to determine the thermal inactivation kinetics of Listeria monocytogenes in chicken breast meat under both isothermal and dynamic conditions. A four-strain cocktail of L. monocytogenes was inoculated to chicken breast meat. Isothermal studies were performed by submerging samples under hot water maintained at constant temperatures ranging from 54 to 66 °C. The D values at each temperature were determined and used to calculate the z value, using log(D) = log(D0) − T/z. Dynamic studies were conducted by submerging samples in a water bath with its temperature programmed to increase linearly from 30 to 65 °C at 1.25 °C/min or 1.73 °C/min. A method was developed to determine the kinetic parameters from linear heating temperature profiles.

ermal inactivation of L. monocytogenes in chicken breast meat followed the first-order kinetics. The z value determined from the isothermal studies was 4.95 °C, which is very close to the values reported in the literature. The dynamic method can also be used to determine the thermal inactivation kinetics of L. monocytogenes. The average z value (4.10 °C) determined by the dynamic method was slightly lower than that determined by the isothermal method. However, the parameters (D0 and z) determined from both isothermal and dynamic methods can be used to estimate the survival of L. monocytogenes exposed to linear heating temperature profiles, with statistically equal accuracies.

namic method explored in this study can be used to determine the D0 and z values of microorganisms that exhibit first-order kinetics and are exposed to linear heating temperature profiles. Compared to the isothermal method, the dynamic method requires few data points and is equally accurate.

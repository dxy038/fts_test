In the domain of content delivery over Internet, each of the Client/Server and P2P communication modes has its pros and cons. In this scope, hybrid network architectures have been recently proposed as a relevant solution. In this paper we propose a new hybrid architecture that is called P2PWeb, between the centralized client/server and the non-centralized P2P architectures for content delivery. The main objective of this proposal is to reduce the load over the server in order to provide a better Quality of Service (QoS) for the end-users. A new P2PWeb communication protocol has been implemented and deployed to reach the objective. The experimentation results and the performance evaluations that we have made show the efficiency of the proposed system in terms of QoS evaluations.

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Evaluating the status of the ECO member countries in relation to goal 5 of 3rd millennium which includes 75% reduction of maternal mortality rate till 2015 in comparison to 1990. <br /><strong>Material and Methods:</strong> In 2009, we have critically reviewed the countries’ MDG reports and extracted the data on each MDGs’ indicator by year and cause of mortality, (if possible) resident area (urban/rural) to explore the trend. In the next phase, the main stakeholders, from both governmental and international organizations in the country have been visited and interviewed (individually and in group) by the research team as part of the data validation process.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> The MMR is very heterogeneous among the ECO countries. Afghanistan with the MMR of 1800 (per 100,000 live births) in 2005 is the worst country in the region/world while Turkey has reached the level of 19.4 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2008. Multiple regression analysis shows that only the index of delivery by skilled health personnel is effective in reduction of maternal mortality.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> With considering half a decade to the end of predetermined time for achieving the millennium development goals, i.e. 2015, it’s optimistically expected that only a few of the ECO countries will reach the target for maternal health.</p>

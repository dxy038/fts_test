Recent scientific revolution, has led to significant changes in human societies. The new technologies that developed through animal laboratory testing are improving medicine. This evolution, is leading to the emergence of an ethical debate that has been a central issue in the laws: by which rule and why men, in order to alleviate their own suffering, cause animals to suffer? Regarding the importance of animal experiments in biocompatibility of dental biomaterials, this article will review the existing legislation on animal studies in France. Reaching to this objective, a review literature was carried out by using Google database and searching topics like "éthique", "biocompatibilité", "essais animal", "essais d’utilisatio", "lois françaises" and "biomatériau" through internet motor engine. 
Based on the result of this study, the first French law in animal protection was in 1850. But, until now more rigorous laws in Animal studies are necessary for evaluating biocompatibility of dental materials. But during the research, the researcher must provide the animal welfare and deal with them in ethical way.

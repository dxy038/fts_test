The learning object (courseware) reveals one of the most important elements of the educational process that needs care in its conception, production, development and creation, turning this process in a relatively onerous and complex activity. Promoting and stimulating the reuse of educational resources (reusability) diminishes the costs and at the same time improves the quality of the generated systems. The exploitation of already existing and previously tested contents makes possible the creation of e-learning systems with more quality, low cost and shorter time. The objective of this model is to help the normalization of already existing educational contents in a simpler form and without the necessity of remaking e-learning system, allowing them to function in the way they have been projected and developed, however, in the way that its contents of learning, or part of them, can be reused in new solutions that respect SCORM standard.

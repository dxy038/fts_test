The purpose of this study is to establish a comprehensive and dynamic system of monitoring the effects of tourism. Based on the analysis of the carrying capacity of tourism destinations, an evaluation index system is constructed, with 13 indexes. By employing grey relational analysis and calculating the harmony factors, comparatively objective judgment was achieved. This evaluation system offers a quantitative evaluation basis for future studies.

In this paper, 125 different mycobacterial promoters are analyzed for their DNA curvature distribution using several di- and tri-nucleotide dependent models of DNA curvature. Different models give similar behavior and therefore qualitative validation of the results. Mycobacterial promoters resembling the E. coli σ70 type have almost 81% (85%) sequences having medium and high curvature profiles using dinucleotide-dependent models. Non-E. coli σ70 type mycobacterial promoters have comparatively higher percent of low curvature profiles. Very few extended −10 promoters have low curvature profiles. Mycobacterial promoters having AnTm (n+m≥3) tract in the upstream region of −35 box and repeated in phase with each other have high curvature profiles. M. smegmatis promoters have high curvature profiles compared to M. tuberculosis promoters.

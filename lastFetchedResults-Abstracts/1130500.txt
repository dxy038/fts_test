Abstract 
Introduction: Industrial wastewater containing dyes, from textile industries, is one of the important sources of environmental pollution, which is harmful for human health and environment. A number of processes, like flocculation, chemical coagulation, precipitation and ozonationare are employed for the treatment of dye wastewaters. However, they possess inherent limitations such as high cost, formation of hazardous byproducts and intensive energy requirements.
Objective: This study was carried out to investigate the removal of Acid Red 18 and Reactive Black 5 dyes from aquatic solution using adsorption onAzolla?liculoides, as an economical and effective adsorbent in batch system. 
Materials and Methods: This research was an applied and experimental type. The immobilizationof colorofAzollafiliculoides was done with 0.01 M sulfuric acid in the ratio of 1:1 (Azolla : acid) at 250 0C for 5h. The equilibrium time (2hr) was determined from kinetic data with other constant parameters. The effect of pH, Azolla dosage and initial dyes concentration was determined after equilibrium time. The remaining concentrations of Acid Red 18 and Reactive Black dyes were analyzed by UV/VIS spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 506and 598 nm, respectively. 
Results: The result showed removal efficiency was increased from 17.45% to 59.53% for reactive black 5 and 75.4% to 90.45% for Acid Red 18 by increasing of contact time from 5 to 120 minute in constant conditions, respectively. Also, result showed removal efficiency was decreased and increased by increasing initial concentration of dyes and initial azolla dosage. By increasing of pH from 2 to 12 the removal efficiency was decreased from 70.58 % to 10.65 % for reactive black 5 and 97.24% to 28.98% for acid red 18. The results showed that kinetic data were explained acceptably by pseudo second-order model ((RB5 (R2=0.98)), (AR18 (R2=0.999)).
Conclusion: The removal of dyes can be quick and effective usingAzolla?liculoides. The removal efficiency of Acid red 18 was approximately 20percentmore than that of Reactive Black 5 in a constant condition.

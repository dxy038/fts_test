Modern cellular mobile communications systems are characterized by a high degree of capacity. Consequently, they have to serve the maximum possible number of calls while the number of channels per cell is limited. The objective of channel allocation is to assign a required number of channels to each cell such that both efficient frequency spectrum utilization is provided and interference effects are minimized. Channel assignment is therefore an important operation of resource management and its efficient implementation increases the fidelity, capacity, and quality of service of cellular systems. Most channel allocation strategies are based on deterministic methods, however, which result in implementation complexity that is prohibitive for the traffic demand envisaged for the next generation of mobile systems. An efficient heuristic technique capable of handling channel allocation problems is introduced as an alternative. The method is called a combinatorial evolution strategy (CES) and belongs to the general heuristic optimization techniques known as evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Three alternative allocation schemes operating deterministically, namely the dynamic channel assignment (DCA), the hybrid channel assignment (HCA), and the borrowing channel assignment (BCA), are formulated as combinatorial optimization problems for which CES is applicable. Simulations for representative cellular models show the ability of this heuristic to yield sufficient solutions. These results will encourage the use of this method for the development of a heuristic channel allocation controller capable of coping with the traffic and spectrum management demands for the proper operation of the next generation of cellular systems

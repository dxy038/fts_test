An ideal multi-objective financial decision support (MFDS) model for contractors should have ability of handling both the quantitative and qualitative inputs. This paper aims to develop a new MFDS model, which attempts to provide a more accurate way to support financial decision-makers in Chinese state-owned construction firms. Owing to the slow progress of passing the construction regulations, coupled with the inherited ownership problems in the Chinese booming construction industry, it is logical for Chinese project managers to make financial decisions with the consideration of the four objective functions (profit margin, risk factors, government relationship and market share), which are realistic representations of the present situation of Chinese construction industry. The proposed MFDS model is a practical method to support financial decision-making. For the model's computational performance, Module 3 (stochastic universal sampling selection, adaptive crossover and adaptive mutation of Genetic Algorithm) is more superior.

Congestion management problem is a popular issue in power system which can be due to line, voltage and thermal constraints. This phenomenon can possibly lead to voltage instability occurrence, loss increment and voltage drop in power system. Therefore, a proper management of congestion should be carried appropriately in order to maintain system operability considering all the available constraints. This paper presents congestion management problem using bee colony optimization approach. The aim of the study is to optimize the cost of generation in power system network within the given available constraints. The study involved the development of bee colony algorithm in addressing congestion management, considering cost optimization as the objective function. Line constraint is also taken into consideration in this study which depends on the electrical power provider to allow the power delivered to the customers. Tests conducted on the IEEE 30-Bus Reliability Test System for performance assessment revealed that the proposed bee algorithm technique is better than evolutionary programming technique in addressing this problem.

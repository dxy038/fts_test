Objective
A prospective blinded, randomized controlled trial was undertaken to compare the initial response of albuterol nebulized in heliox or control in the treatment of moderately severe asthma in children presenting to a pediatric ED.
Methods
Patients were randomized to receive heliox (n = 20) or control (n = 21). The primary outcome was to compare a modified dyspnea index score at 10 and 20 minutes after randomization. Secondary outcomes were to determine if heliox decreased admission rates or endotracheal intubation.
Results
There was no statistically significant difference found at 10 or 20 minutes after randomization with heliox (P = .169 and P = .062, respectively). No statistical difference in admission rate was found, and no patients required endotracheal intubation in either group.
Conclusions
Our results demonstrate that albuterol nebulized with heliox offered no clinical benefit over standard therapy in the initial treatment of moderately severe asthma in the ED.

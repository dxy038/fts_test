This paper presents a multi-objective mathematical model for redundancy allocation in production systems. In many of the production and assembly lines, process times, time between failures and repaired times are generally distributed. The proposed method of this paper is able to consider time dependent parameters as general distribution functions by using the hybrid approach of simulation and response surface methodology. The objectives of the mathematical model are maximizing production rate, minimizing total cost and maximizing quality. In order to solve the proposed mathematical model, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm and multiple objective particle swarm optimization are used. Numerical results indicate the effectiveness of both algorithms for generating non-dominated solutions. Moreover, comparative results indicate the superiority of the Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm.

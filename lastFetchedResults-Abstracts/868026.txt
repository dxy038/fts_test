In this paper, we study the configuration of machine cells in the presence of alternative routings for part types. The objective function is the minimization of transportation costs. Limits on cell sizes as well as separation constraints (i.e. machines that are not allowed to be placed in the same cell) and co-location constraints (i.e. machines that must be placed in the same cell) may be imposed. An efficient Tabu Search (TS) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. Extensive computational experiences with large-size problems show that this method outperforms some existing Simulated Annealing (SA) approaches.

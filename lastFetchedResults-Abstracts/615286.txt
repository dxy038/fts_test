Abstract
Increasing the resources productivity using cropping pattern optimization is a proper way for agricultural development. In this study, the idealsâ€™ realization possibility of maximizing the gross margin in compromising with reducing the water consumption, minimizing the fertilizers uses, minimizing the production risk, and maximizing the social benefits of cropping pattern were analyzed using a multi-objectives fuzzy non-linear programming model in Marvdasht City of Fars Province. In this approach, the crop area is optimized to maximize the weighted sum of fuzzy objective in the range of their given bearing bounds. Results show that in many cases the possibility of complete ideals realization in the multiple goals model in comparison with single goal patterns was not observed. Considering the outcomes and the relevant weight assigned to each of the goals by the decision maker consisting of the Fuzzy Composite Distance Function reveals that the cropping patterns base on multiple goals are superior to current patterns and even single goal pattern in supply of multiple compromised ideals. Implementation of these models in study areas has significant influence on reducing water use as well as increasing the gross margin and reducing fertilizer use and risk.

This paper presents two reduced switch count AC motor drives. The configurations were conceived to operate without the use of the boost inductor filter. The configurations use a six-phase induction machine or a four-phase induction machine. The drive systems provide both bidirectional power flow and power factor control. The paper presents the operating principles and control strategies of the topologies. Experimental and simulation results are presented.

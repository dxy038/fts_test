The main objective of this work is to investigate the chaotic behavior and chaos synchronization of a complex two coupled dynamos system subject to different initial conditions. This system exhibits a chaotic attractor which is found numerically. The global synchronization and active control techniques are used in this investigation. The feedback gain matrix and Lyapunov function are calculated and used to show that the linear error dynamical system is asymptotically stable. The analytical results are tested numerically and excellent agreement is found.

Borage (Borago officinalis L.) is a valuable medicinal plant of Boraginaceae family,
which is used in treatment of different human diseases. Therefore, it is necessary to determine
optimum levels of agronomical factors affecting plant growth and production.
Objective: To determine the effects of foliar application of calcium nitrate on quantitative yield
and some quality components of borage.
Methods: This study was done inResearchfarm of ACECR, Institute of Medicinal Plants
Research in a randomized complete block design with three replications and four treatments along
2008 - 2009. The treatments were four concentrations of Ca(NO3)2 foliar application (0, 5, 10 and
15 mM Calcium Nitrate).
Results: The results showed that foliar application of calcium nitrate had significant effects
(p<0.01) on plant height, dry matter yield of aerialparts and flowers, chlorophyll content and
content of total phenol and tannins. With increasing concentrations of calcium nitrate, these
parameters increased and the highest amount of them were observed at 15 mM Ca(NO3)2.
Conclusion: The application of calcium nitrate had positive effects on growth and yield of
borage. Also, the qualitative and quantitative yield of borage aerial parts increased with increasing
concentration of calcium nitrate.

This paper discusses the prerequisite and preparation of the organizational learning (OL) implementation from three aspects of organization structure reform, culture and incentive policies, and OL tools and platforms. Using the thought of project management for reference, the plan of OL implementation will be broken down into a series of sub-projects and small activities to be implemented step by step. And this paper also proposes grading method of OL implementation, dividing OL process into three stages roughly known as prototype, expansion, and institutionalization, as well as gives the objective system and appraisal focuses of each stage, thus offers beneficial reference for OL implementation. Finally, it shows the merits of the idea that taking OL as the sequential decision-making process of the learning strategy for investors, and points out that the grading method of OL is the basis of carrying out the research on OL options.

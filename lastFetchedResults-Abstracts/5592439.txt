Different aspects of the design of implanted devices is discussed by numerical analysis of a conceptual model. Different antenna topologies are compared for their efficiency and sensitivity to variations in thickness and dielectric constant of a lossy superstrate (which models the skin). It was shown that microstrip patch and loop antennas are the most viable candidates among basic antenna topologies. A modified objective function is proposed which can take into account the strong detuning due to lossy superstrate. Finally the effect of a protective lossless superstrate is investigated intensive numerically. The trade-offs involved in the size of the protective superstrate are addressed by finding the trends in which the antenna performance varies with the dimensions of the protective layer.

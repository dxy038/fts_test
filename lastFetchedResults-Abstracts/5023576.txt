A model of the supply-traction drive system related to a fuel-cell based vehicle for public transportation allows to investigate the influence of the components rating and of the control parameters on the supply system performances for a generic traction cycle and, in particular, on the overall efficiency. A parametric analysis allows to evaluate several quantities involved the performance assessment as functions of the design parameters. Such quantities are combined in a suitable objective function, included in a minimization algorithm to choose the input set of parameters which optimizes the supply system performance

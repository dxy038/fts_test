The adaptive control problem for the case of an unknown plant with a single input and a single output is considered. The objective is to design a differentiator-free controller so that the output of the plant evolves asymptotically to the output of a given model. A method of choosing the controller-structure is presented in the paper and methods for adjusting the parameters to achieve asymptotic stability in the whole are discussed. Simulation results are included to indicate the generality of the approach and its potential in other control situations.

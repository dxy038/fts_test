Background: The German cockroach, Blattella germanica
L. (Dictyoptera: Blattellidae), has become resistant to many
insecticides due to control failures in hospital and student
dormitory settings of southern Iran.
Objective: This study was thus designed to detect and monitor
carbamate resistance in two strains of German cockroach using
lethal dose bioassay methods.
Methods: Wild dormitory (D) and hospital (H) strains were
collected. Adult males were subjected to the jar exposure
procedure. A range of concentrations based on the world health
organization (WHO) standard concentration of carbamate
insecticides (carbaryl, bendiocarb, propoxur) were used. For
each insecticide, four to seven different concentrations leading
to  > 0% and  < 100% mortality were assayed. Ten insects were
placed in each jar and the exposure time of contact was held
constant for 30 minutes. Mortality data (as LD50) were assessed
using probit analysis.
Results: Although both strains showed lethality values above
those of the WHO standards, the H strain was more resistant to
all of the three carbamate insecticides than the D strain, possibly
due to the frequent and excessive dosage of these chemicals used
in the hospital environment. The order of resistance for H strain
was carbaryl  >  propoxur  >  bendiocarb. The ratio of LD50 in H
strain to that of D strain for bendiocarb was about twice that of
the other two insecticides indicating that German cockroaches
were most susceptible to bendiocarb under both environments.
Conclusion: It is concluded that excessive reliance on carbaryl
in both D and H settings has led to resistance.

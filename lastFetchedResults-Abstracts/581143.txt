Background and Objective: Long term and vigorous exercises may lead to a deficiency of the body immune system components. Consuming caffeine supplementation before the exercise can affect the body immune response. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of short-term caffeine supplementation on the defense system and the innate immune index responses in male athletes after an exhaustive aerobic exercise.
Materials and Methods: 24 male endurance athletes were randomly divided into supplement and placebo groups. Exercise testing was an exhaustive treadmill test (Bruce test). One hour before the main test, the supplement group (SUPP) consumed caffeine (6 Mg/BW) and the placebo group (PLA) received Cellulose during testing. Blood samples were collected from anticubital vein before and immediately after exercise testing. After serum collection; Cortisol and eHsp72 concentrations and leukocyte count were determined using ELISA and H1 method respectively. After conformation of normal distribution of variables by kolmogrov-smirnov test, SPANOVA and Independent t test were performed and p  <  0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results: Independent t test results showed that the mean changes of serum cortisol and HSP72 indexes were increased significantly in SUPP and PLA group (P < 0.05) after exhaustive aerobic exercise; but there was no significant change in the leukocytes count. Also, SPANOVA test showed that caffeine supplementation has significantly changed Hsp72 and serum cortisol levels in male athletes (P < 0.05) while it has no significant effect on serum leukocytes (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: findings show that consuming caffeine supplementation prior to short-term exhaustive aerobic exercise possibly has positive effect on the innate immune system and the body's defensive apparatus.

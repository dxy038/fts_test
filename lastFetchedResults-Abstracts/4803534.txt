We describe our experience in developing a Hadoop based integration flow to collect and integrate publicly available government datasets related to government spending. The objective is to enable users, U.S. taxpayers in this case, to easily access the data their government discloses on the web in different websites. We also provide users with easy-to-use tools to query and explore this data to gather information from the integrated data that allows for evaluation of how tax money is spent.

Gold(III) thiosemicarbazone complexes derived from [Au(damp-C1,N)Cl2] (2), where damp = dimeth-ylaminoethylphenyl, have been synthesized. The compounds were characterised using various spectroscopic and analytical techniques, including NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The gold complexes were screened for in vitro antimalarial and antitubercular activity. Although incorporation of the gold(III) centre into thiosemicarbazone scaffolds enhanced their efficacy against the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, this trend was not observed for the antitubercular activity of selected thiosemicarbazones against the Mycobacterium tuberculosis virulent strain H37Rv.

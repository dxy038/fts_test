With respect to some mandates of using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, the technology has received overwhelming attention in recent years. As an identification technology, RFID can certainly replace traditional barcode, which is just the early adoption of the technology, but the real economic benefits could come from some innovative applications of the technology due to its high cost involved. However, the pervasive nature of RFID tags also creates a potential privacy concerns to the public. The main objective of this paper is to discuss the potential societal implications of RFID-based systems, and to suggest some best practices while implementing such systems. Although the discussion in this paper focuses on RFID technology, it is also applicable to any similar sensor networks.

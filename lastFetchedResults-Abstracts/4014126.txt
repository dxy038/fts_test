This paper presents modeling guidelines and a benchmark system for power system simulation studies of grid-connected, three-phase, single-stage Photovoltaic (PV) systems that employ a voltage-sourced converter (VSC) as the power processor. The objective of this work is to introduce the main components, operation/protection modes, and control layers/schemes of medium- and high-power PV systems, to assist power engineers in developing circuit-based simulation models for impact assessment studies, analysis, and identification of potential issues with respect to the grid integration of PV systems. Parameter selection, control tuning, and design guidelines are also briefly discussed. The usefulness of the benchmark system is demonstrated through a fairly comprehensive set of test cases, conducted in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment. However, the models and techniques presented in this paper are independent of any specific circuit simulation software package. Also, they may not fully conform to the methods exercised by all manufacturers, due to the proprietary nature of the industry.

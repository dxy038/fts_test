Multiple, often conflicting objectives arise naturally in most real-world optimization. Gear is a mechanical device that transfers the rotating motion and power from one part of a machine to another. Searching for best gear is a very hard problem. Gear optimization can be divided into two categories, namely, single gear pair or Gear train optimization. The problem of gear pairs design optimization is difficult to solve because it involves multiple objectives and large number of variables. Therefore a reliable and robust optimization technique will be helpful in obtaining optimal solution for the problems. In this paper an attempt has been made to optimize spur gear pair design using Genetic Algorithm (GA) and analytical tool MITCalc. A combined objective function which maximizes the Power, Efficiency and minimizes the overall Weight, Centre distance has been considered in this model. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was carried out and results were compared with the allowable limit.

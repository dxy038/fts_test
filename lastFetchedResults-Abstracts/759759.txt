We examined whether instructional materials
describing how to rate child ADHD symptoms would
improve the accuracy of mothers’ ratings of ADHD
symptoms presented in standard child behavior stimuli,
and whether instructions would be equally effective across
a range of maternal depressive symptoms and family
incomes. A community sample of 100 mothers with 5 to
12 year old sons were randomly assigned to either receive
or not receive the instructions. All mothers watched
standard video recordings of boys displaying nonproblem
behavior, ADHD symptoms, ADHD plus oppositional
behaviors, or ADHD plus anxious behaviors, and then
rated the ADHD symptoms of the boys in the videos. These
ratings were compared to ratings of the boys’ ADHD
symptoms made by objective coders. Results indicated an
interaction such that the instructional materials improved
the agreement between mothers’ and coders’ ratings, but
only for mothers at lower family income levels. The
instructional materials improved all mothers’ open-ended
responses regarding knowledge of ADHD. All mothers
rated more ADHD symptoms in boys with comorbid
oppositional or anxious behaviors, and this effect was not
reduced by the instructional materials. The potential utility
of these instructions to improve the accuracy of ratings of
child ADHD symptoms is explored.

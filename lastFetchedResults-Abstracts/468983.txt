Objective
This study examines the effects of circuit-type resistance training on the need for insulin in women with gestational diabetes mellitus.
Study design
Thirty-two patients with gestational diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned either to a group that was treated with diet alone or to a group that was treated with diet plus resistance exercise.
Results
The number of women whose condition required insulin therapy was the same, regardless of treatment. However, a subgroup analysis that examined only overweight women (prepregnant body mass index, >25 kg/m2) showed a lower incidence of insulin use in the diet-plus-exercise group (P<.05). Women in the diet-plus-exercise group were prescribed less insulin (P<.05) and showed a longer delay from diagnosis to the initiation of insulin therapy (P<.05), compared with the diet-alone group.
Conclusion
Resistance exercise training may help to avoid insulin therapy for overweight women with gestational diabetes mellitus.

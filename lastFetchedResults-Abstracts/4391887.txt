The principal objective of the paper is to establish the framework for power quality and vibration measurements assessment of hydropower generator. To meet the objective the set of measurements were performed on hydropower generating unit, using typical instrumentation like voltage analyzer for three-phase electrical networks, laser tachometer kit, vibration measurement equipment, air gap measuring system etc. The suggested framework states that electric voltage quality is affected by mechanical faults of power generator like rotor air gap eccentricity and stator poles faults, rotor and stator vibration characteristics and unbalance. The voltage characteristics were analyzed based on every generator pole. The proposed framework is beneficial for diagnosis of hydropower units since it relates electrical and mechanical analysis and provides example of data acquisition program suitable for further investigations.

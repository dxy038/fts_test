This paper discusses the coordination for reactive power and voltage optimization of transmission network and distribution network. Based on the agent-based simulation framework of GridLAB-D for smart grid, creates the multi-agent model of reactive power and voltage optimization for cooperative transmission network and distribution network based global analysis, and solves the model; For the simulation model, the individual agents including the reactive power and voltage optimization for transmission network and distribution network, the boundary nodes of transmission network and distribution network are modeled independently; The boundary nodes of transmission network and distribution network realize the data exchange of the reactive power and voltage optimization of transmission network and distribution network; Through the cooperative iteration of all agents, realizes the global reactive power and voltage optimization. Take a power network including distributed generations as simulation example, by the time-series simulation analysis of GridLAB-D, the results prove the method eliminates the voltage mismatch and power mismatch when the optimization for transmission network and distribution network are separate; meanwhile, the method realizes the objective of decreasing the network loss, restraining the influence of voltage quality induced by distributed generations and loads, and improving the power consumption efficiency.

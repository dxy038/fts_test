A 565 Mbit/s bidirectional multilaser amplifier system is demonstrated using both intensity modulation and the FSK direct detection format. The system performance was largely dominated by saturation-induced crosstalk effects. Higher amplifier gains and input powers were possible with FSK modulation but even then residual intensity modulation of the transmitter did not allow this penalty to be completely eliminated.

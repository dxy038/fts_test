As an approach to the broad-band, multi-port, multilateral media with idealized transmitting ability for various communications, a "Flat Loss Boosted Coaxial Line" (FLB Line) with many ports, such a centipede, has been proposed. It has been built from Negativeresistance Bridged <img alt="T" src="/images/tex/16.gif"/> type <img alt="\\sqrt {f}" src="/images/tex/10437.gif"/> shape Boosters (FBA) with about 10 dB gain at 300 MHz and Negative-resistance Boosting Junctions (NBJ) with an effective gain of 4.8 dB and no directivity nor phase distortion. In this line, signal powers at all branching ports axe principally equal and are transmitted bilaterally over all frequency range, while maintaining not only sufficient stability margin but also allowable transmission performance. A trial 2 km line composed of 8 FLB sections and 3 NBJ units has demonstrated engineering feasibility that bidirectional transmission of 5 color TV signals. It operated with almost no ghosts and without any adjacent channel interferences over a frequency range from 5 MHz up to about 400 MHz.

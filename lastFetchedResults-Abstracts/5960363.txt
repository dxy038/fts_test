The issue of diabetes diet is regarded as multiobjective optimization problem which is different from traditional single-objective approach. In this paper,we design the nutrition diet decision-making model for the diabetes. We uses the state transition table to describe the genetic operators. The multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II is applied to the diabetic patients nutrition decision-making optimization problem. Experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively solve the nutrition optimization problems of diabetic patients and provide diet designers with a powerful nutrition decision support.

Objective: Our purpose was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3 dosages of Esclim, delivering 0.025 mg, 0.050 mg, or 0.100 mg 17Î²-estradiol per 24 hours, in the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms. Study Design: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trial, 196 highly symptomatic menopausal women received 12 weeks of continuous unopposed treatment with 1 of the 3 dosages of Esclim or a matching placebo patch. Results: The reduction in frequency of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms was statistically significant compared with placebo (P< .05) from week 2 onward in the Esclim 50 and 100 groups and from week 3 onward in the Esclim 25 group. Symptom severity was also reduced. Estrogen-related adverse events, particularly metrorrhagia and endometrial hyperplasia, were less frequent in the Esclim 25 group than in the higher-dosage groups. Conclusion: All 3 dosages of Esclim were effective in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms. The efficacy and safety of Esclim 25 indicate a good risk-benefit ratio.

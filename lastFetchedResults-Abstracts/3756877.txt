A radar waveform design technique which utilizes LagrangeÂ´s method of multipliers to control temporal sidelobes and to reduce Doppler sidelobes is described. This classical method of constrained optimization is applied to the problem of synthesizing a radar wave-form where mismatch loss is the objective function to be minimized. The associated constraints are taken from expressions for the composite temporal sidelobes of the cross-correlation response and the peak correlation response where sets of code words are used to modulate a series of radar pulses. The resulting code sets and receiver reference sets are called group-complementary and produce a trench parallel to or on the range axis of the cross-ambiguity surface.

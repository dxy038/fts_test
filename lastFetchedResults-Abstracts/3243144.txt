This paper describes a fuzzy control strategy for the power management in electric vehicle. The goal is to determine the optimal distance while basing on the battery SOC and desired speed. The objective of this work is to predict the optimal distance traveled by the vehicle for such a battery SOC and a desired speed and to avoid the lack of energy. The Matlab simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in maximizing of the able distance traveled by the vehicle.

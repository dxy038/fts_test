The traction system of a combine harvester contains considerable nonlinearities. The objective of this paper is to derive a model of the propulsion which can then be used for regulator design. First the nonlinearities are quantified by analyzing the output of the system excited by a multisine. Standard linear system identification techniques (such as ARX and ARMAX) are then compared to a more recent nonlinear state-space technique. Finally the derived models are validated on several alternative input signals

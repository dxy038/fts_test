A niched Pareto genetic algorithm based approach is utilized to optimize a heat pipe with axial “Ω”-shaped micro grooves. The effects of the structural parameters are evaluated and optimized with respect to the heat transfer performance in order to model the heat transfer capability and total thermal resistance of this novel heat pipe. Using the heat transfer capability and total thermal resistance as the objective function and the structure parameters as the decision variable, the optimization design for the heat pipe is performed using the niche genetic algorithm. The results indicate that the heat transfer capability and the total heat resistance are inversely coupled and as a result, the optimization must be constructed on the application objective. Using the niched Pareto genetic algorithm and the pre-specified application constraints, a Pareto-optimal solution set can be determined and the optimal design for a given application is selected.

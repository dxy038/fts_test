Specific expression of the structure-specific recognition protein (SSRP) gene was investigated in rat fetal, adult, and tumor tissues using a 2.0-kb partial sequence of rat SSRP cDNA isolated from a cDNA library of rat renal cell carcinoma. The results revealed that it was rather specifically expressed in rat fetal kidney and renal cell carcinoma induced by Fenitrilotriacetate, but not in adult kidney, when various organs were tested by Northern blot analysis. In situ hybridization further demonstrated that it was located in the neoplastic cells of renal cell carcinoma and in the epithelial cells of fetal kidney but undetectable in any cells of normal adult kidney. These observations seem to imply the involvement of SSRP gene, which is believed to recognize structural alterations of DNA, in kidney development and carcinogenesis of certain types of kidney cancer.

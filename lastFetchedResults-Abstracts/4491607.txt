A method to evaluate the spectral efficiency of digital cellular mobile radio systems is presented. The spectral efficiency evaluation is based on modelling the co-channel interference and using parameters which are specific to digital systems. Voice coding techniques combined with digital modulation schemes influence both the spectral efficiency and the quality of digital systems and a particular treatment is necessary to identify the important parameters for the evaluation. Because of a dearth in subjective protection ratio measures, an objective approach is presented. Based on the method developed, the paper concludes by evaluating the spectral efficiency of the GSM Pan European cellular system, the North American digital cellular system and the Japanese digital cellular system

This paper addresses the power transformer design optimization problem and, proposes a regression analysis based heuristic optimization method. The main contributions of this research are: 1) introduction of a new effective optimization method which minimizes either the cost of transformer manufacturing or other objective functions suggested by customers; 2) incorporation of regression analysis which can significantly improve computing performance; 3) introduction of a method which can derive the empirical formulas of certain transformer characteristic.

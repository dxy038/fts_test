This paper presents the hardware design and implementation of a Microcontroller based single-phase simplified nine-level inverter (SNLI) fed induction motor. Multilevel inverters offer high power capability, associated with lower output harmonics and lower turn-off losses. This work informs a multilevel inverter fed induction motor using an H-bridge output stage with bidirectional auxiliary switches. The inverter is capable of producing nine levels of output-voltage levels (V<sub>dc</sub>, 3V<sub>dc</sub> /4, 2V<sub>dc</sub> /4, V<sub>dc</sub> /4,0, - V<sub>dc</sub> /4, - 2V<sub>dc</sub> /4, -3V<sub>dc</sub> /4, -V<sub>dc</sub> ) from the DC supply voltage. The control circuit necessary for multilevel inverter operation is implemented using an ATMEL AT89S52 Microcontroller, reducing overall system cost and complexity. Theoretical predictions are validated using simulation in MATLAB SIMULINK, and satisfactory circuit operation is proved with experimental tests performed on an experimental model.

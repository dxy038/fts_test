Background and Objective: Mycoproteins are produced by Fusarium venenatum through aerobic fermentation of carbohydrate substrates. The RNA content of the biomass produced is high and should, therefore, be reduced to less than 2% by heat treatment.
The nutritional value of mycoproteins is very high: the cell walls of the hyphae, the cell membranes, and the cytoplasm are sources of dietary fiber,
polyunsaturated fat, and high-quality protein, respectively. In this study the possibility of the production of mycoprotein by Fusarium oxysporum in the laboratory was investigated and the optimum fermentation conditions for the highest production efficiency (yield) were determined.
Materials and Methods: Aerobic fermentation was carried out on a Vogel medium at different tempratures, agitation speeds, levels of glucose as the carbon source, and levels of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate as the nitrogen source. In order to reduce the ribonucleic acid content to an acceptable level, heat treatment at 65 °C for 15 min was used.
Results and Discussion: The findings showed that the optimum fermentation conditions for mycoprotein production by Fusarium oxysporum were 25°C, 150 rpm, a glucose concentration of 5 g/1, and an ammonium dihydrogen phosphate concentration of 3.4 g/1. The mycoprotein obtained contained approximately 42 % crude protein, and the heat treatment caused a reduction of the ribonucleic acid content from 7% to less than 1% .

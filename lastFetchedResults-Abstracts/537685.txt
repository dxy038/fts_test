This paper investigates the ability of different
strategies of Differential Evolutionary (DE) Algorithm in
dealing with optimal placement of Static VAR
Compensator (SVC) in a power system. The primary
function of an SVC is to improve transmission system
voltage, thereby enhancing the maximum power transfer
limit. To enhance voltage stability, the planning problem
is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem
for maximizing fuzzy performance indices. Two different
scenarios are used when DE is applied. The performances
of DE with two different scenarios and different
strategies are compared in terms of their success rate. To
validate the results, Real Genetic Algorithm (RGA) is
applied and compared with DE.

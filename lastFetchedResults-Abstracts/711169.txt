Study Objective
To describe Latina mothers' acceptance of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for their daughters and explore their knowledge base regarding HPV-related issues.
Design
Individual interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of 40 Latina mothers of daughters 7–14 years old, from an urban, pediatric primary care clinic. Preliminary questions were asked regarding HPV knowledge and then information was verbally provided before exploring vaccine acceptance.
Results
Thirty-one of the Latina mothers had not heard of HPV and 34 were not aware of the connection between HPV and cervical cancer. Thirty-two mothers reported that they would allow their daughters to receive the HPV vaccine. Two overarching themes were identified as reasons for accepting the vaccine. The main theme for vaccine acceptance provided by 26 mothers was “to prevent disease.” The other theme was “to protect” their child. Four mothers were undecided and 4 reported they would not vaccinate their daughter. The two themes identified from this group of mothers include not having sufficient information regarding the vaccine, and that their daughters are too young.
Conclusion
Acceptance of the HPV vaccine was high in this sample of Latina mothers. The prevention of disease and the protection of their child were the motivating factors for vaccinating their daughters. Reasons for not accepting include lack of information and young age of daughter. The provision of information will be key to ensuring Latina mothers understand the rationale for vaccinating at a young age.

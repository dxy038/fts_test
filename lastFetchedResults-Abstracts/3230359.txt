The project is about analyzing the wing leading-edge modifications by leading edge droop which is used for NACA airfoil. The objective of this project is to show that there will be an increase in stalling angle by using droop leading edge modifications and for that Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software, Fluent is used to depict the increase in stalling angle when drooped leading edge is used. Using Leading Edge Drooping, achieved increased in the lift coefficient than the normal airfoil and we have tailored the stall characteristics by using leading-edge droop. And by using leading-edge droop we can successfully increase the stall/departure characteristics.

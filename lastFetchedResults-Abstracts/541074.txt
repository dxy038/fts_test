Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between identity styles and self-efficacy beliefs (personal and collective) and to compare them in Iranian and Afghan high school student boys who inhabit in Qom city. This study is of a special importance since it is a multi-cultural and comparative study between Iranian and Afghan nations.

Method: Subjects were selected from all the high school students of the Qom city. They were 231 Iranian high school boys and 132 Afghan high school boys. By cluster sampling, we chose two region from four and two schools from each region. We used Berzonsky's Identity Styles Questionnaire, Bandura's Personal Self-Efficacy Beliefs and Kim and Park Collective Self-Efficacy Beliefs. Finding: There was a significant direct relationship between informative identity style and normative identity style with personal self-efficacy beliefs and collective self-efficacy beliefs. On the other hand, a significant negative relationship was observed between confused identity style and identity commitment.

Conclusion: Informative identity style with collective self-efficacy beliefs and normative identity style with personal self-efficacy beliefs and collective self-efficacy beliefs was higher in Afghan high school boys.

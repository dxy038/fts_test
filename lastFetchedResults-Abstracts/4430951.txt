In this paper the One-Cycle Control (OCC) technique is applied to three multilevel rectifiers with reduced components that can be used in applications where the rectifier does not need to have bidirectional active power flow. A hybrid OCC is also considered in order to maintain the advantages of OCC such as simplicity, robustness and low cost. Details for the control strategy and gating signal generation is presented for the three studied circuits. Experimental results confirm the feasibility of both the proposed controller and topologies.

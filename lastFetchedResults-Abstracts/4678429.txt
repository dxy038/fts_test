The multi-objective reconfiguration model, considering the losses, the compositive voltage deviation and the system reliability, is developed in this paper. The NSGA-II method is applied to solve the model. In the decoding process, the random spanning tree strategy is adopted to avert the emergency of unfeasible solution; in the selection process, any two individuals are compared based on their rank values and crowding distances. In addition, the elitism strategy is also used to make sure that the good individuals in father population can be remained in the evolution process. The results demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed model and algorithm.

Testing and validation of the functions and performance of the digital instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) system should be done prior to installation in nuclear power plants. The objective of the I&amp;C Functional Test Facility (FTF) is to test and validate the functions of developed digital control and various monitoring systems. The FTF provides the simulated testing environment as an experimental test bed. The FTF software consists of a mathematical modeling program which simulates a three-loop 993 MWe pressurized water reactor and a supervisory program that comprises all the instructions necessary to run the FTF. The hardware equipment provides an interface between a host computer and a simple test panel or the developed target systems to be tested. The graphical user interface supports an easy and friendly interface between the FTF and users. It is implemented through a Picasso-3 graphic tool developed by the Halden Reactor Project. The FTF is applied to an advanced I&amp;C system prototype, such as an automatic start-up intelligent control system, dynamic alarm system, accident identification system, and intelligent logic tracking system, to test its algorithm or performance. The results of the test show good operational performance of the FTF in normal and transient conditions

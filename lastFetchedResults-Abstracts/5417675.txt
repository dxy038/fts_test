According to enterprise widespread surplus compressed air compressor, unloading operation by venting waste energy problems. The control system adopts multi objective optimization control strategy, which can effectively solve the compression machines with high efficiency, energy saving, output control problem of multi-objective synthetically. Through the compressed air supply one realization of the network operation and energy balance pressure of the target.

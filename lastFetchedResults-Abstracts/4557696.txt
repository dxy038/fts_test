The authors´ objective is to partition the manifold concepts arising in an EIS (engineering information system) so that the model seen by users can be simple. They propose a layering for the concepts encountered in EIS modeling discussions. However, so many concepts populate the EIS world that a horizontal partitioning alone is insufficient for certain layers. To aid users, the authors also propose a vertical partitioning of selected layers into domains of expertise (e.g. layout, logic, other design phases, system administration; or by design tools and methodology, e.g. VHDL or EDIF). This partitioning has been adopted for use in the data modeling activities of the US Department of Defense´s EIS program, in the hope that it will focus future work. An advantage of a layered model is extensibility. As concepts are needed, they can be defined at the appropriate layer, in terms of lower-level concepts.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Spherical roller thrust bearings are used as supports in many rotating machineries. By
applying an axial preload, clearance between the raceways and the rollers can be avoided.
In order to increase the endurance, the preload shall be kept as low as possible. However, a
bearing with low preload is sensitive of loosing full contact leading to nonlinear stiffness
characteristics. The objective of this paper is to suggest a tool, which can be used to determine
suitable preload and to show that a saddle node bifurcation can occur if the preload is
too small.
Studying the model in a rotating frame leads to an autonomous equation of motion from
which stationary points and their stability can be analysed. Some set of parameters give a
nonhyperbolic eigenvalue, and by investigating the corresponding central manifold it is
found that a saddle node bifurcation occurs.
Since explicit equations for the stationary points are derived, they can be used to choose
a preload high enough to make sure that full contact always is a possible solution. It is
however shown that if the preload becomes too small, the system enters an area of multiple
solutions and a saddle node bifurcation can occur.

The course on finite automata and formal languages is important in the computer science and engineering curriculum as this course is a prerequisite for system software and compiler design courses and also the concepts learnt in this course are widely applicable in the computer science and related engineering fields. Teaching the course on finite automata and formal languages is challenging because there are difficulties in understanding the formal language and automata theory concepts as the course is mathematical in nature. In addition, the conventional approach to the course followed a sequence of machine and then the corresponding language theory. The standard textbooks also recommended the same approach. The authors observe that this approach has failed to establish the context required for the study. A new approach to teaching the course on Formal Languages and Automata Theory is attempted by the authors. The course structure is redesigned to teach formal languages and corresponding automata followed by the properties of the respective languages according to the hierarchy of the formal languages. This flow of teaching makes students to understand the concepts and relate to the real time applications easily. Activity oriented teaching learning was attempted in the course and a tutorial was introduced for this course with an objective of increasing student participation. Group activities were attempted in tutorials which enhanced peer learning. Course assessment was done in terms of regular minor exams, quizzes based on GATE format and presentations. The authors observed that this has resulted in increased participation and learning of students as evident in their performance. Students also felt that the pressure during examinations is reduced as they were comfortable with their learning through activities. The paper discusses the experience of the course teachers and the results obtained.

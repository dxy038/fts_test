Background and Objective: Several studies have shown that non-surgical periodontal treatment can improve periodontal condition and diabetes metabolic control. Doxycycline seems to be useful in periodontics and control of diabetes, but its effect on periodontal tissue of diabetic patients is not well established. The aim of this study was to compare clinical effects of scaling and root planning with systemic application of doxycycline in type II diabetic patients with chronic periodontitis.

Subjects and Methods: 120 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate to severe periodontitis participated in this single blind controlled clinical trial and randomly divided in 2 groups. The baseline periodontal parameters consisted of bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and glycemic parameters consisted of measurement of Fasting blood sugar (FBS) and glycosylated haemoglobin A1C ( HbA1C ) recorded for both groups. Group 1 was treated with oral hygiene instruction, scaling, root planning and doxycycline. Group 2 had the same treatment but without doxycycline. After 4 months their periodontal and glycemic control status were evaluated. Recorded data were analyzed with independent and paired T-test.

Results: After treatment, both groups had a significant improvement in all periodontal and glycemic control parameters: BOP, PD, CAL, FBS, HbA1C were significantly reduced. However, the reduction in all parameters except of FBS was more significant in doxycycline-treated group.

Conclusion: Although both periodontal treatment regimens are effective in type II diabetics, the use of doxycycline as an adjunct provided more significant improvement in periodontal and glycemic control. Sci Med J 2010; 9(2): 149-156

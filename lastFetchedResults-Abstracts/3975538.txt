Applications of matrix techniques to the electronic network synthesis of several types of equations have been discussed in previous publications.1??5 A brief review of the basic theory is included in the Appendix. The objective of this paper is to apply these techniques to the synthesis of linear algebraic matrix equations. Existing methods are summarized and their domain of usefulness is indicated, particularly with respect to network stability.

This paper is concerned with target monitoring using a network of collaborative mobile sensors. The objective is to compute (online) the desired sensing and communication radii of sensors as well as their location at each time instant, such that a set of prescribed specifications are met. These specifications include end-to-end connectivity preservation from the target to a fixed destination, while durability of sensors is maximized and the overall energy consumption is minimized. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization, and a procedure is presented to solve it. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the prescribing pattern of general practitioners (GPs) in Kerman province of Iran during one year.
METHODS: The total 45384 prescriptions which were issued in one year (2003) by GPs in Kerman province were analyzed for the sex and age of the patients, drug name and number of drugs/ prescription, drug category, percent of generic and brand name, and route of administration.
FINDINGS: The results of this study showed that 4L7% of the patients were male (mean age 29.8 year) and 58.3 % were female (mean age 31.5 year). The mean number of drugs per each prescription was 3.43 overall. Most of the drugs (97.2%) were prescribed by generic name. The most frequently prescribed drugs were antibiotics (33.95%), sedative/hypnotics (19.56%), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs19.2%) and corticosteroids (11.17%). About 42.4% of the patients received an injection. Penicillins (25.43%), cephalosporins (7.66%), and aminoglycosides (0.86%) were the most frequently prescribed drugs among antibiotics.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed inappropriate prescription of antibiotics, NSAIDs, corticosteroids and injection drugs by general practitioners in Kerman province. Therefore, intervention methods should be chosen to change the physician's prescribing pattern behavior.

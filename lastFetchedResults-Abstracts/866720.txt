Feature is recently known as the core concept necessary to realize a fully integrated CAD/CAM system. The information contents in a feature can be easily conveyed from one application to another in the manufacturing domain. However the feature generated in one application may not be suitable for another without being modified with more information. The objective of the paper is to present the methodology of decomposing bulky features of the sculptured shape of pocket to be removed into compact features to be efficiently machined. It is possible to reactively and efficiently machine the sculptured shape of pocket by segmenting horizontally and vertically a bulky feature and by applying variable cutting condition to each feature.

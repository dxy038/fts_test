The introduction of mobile wireless communication systems into society at a very rapid rate has created a continuous demand for improved performance and efficiency. For this reason, the antennas for mobile communication systems have received a great attention over the past few years. Specifically, researchers have proposed several models for the evaluation of the radiation patterns, radiation impedance and the gain of cellular phones. Also, several novel antenna structures have been proposed and tested. The main objective is to arrive at an antenna design featuring maximum radiation in the horizontal direction, radiation characteristics that are safe to users and antenna diversity. The effects of the antenna dielectric coating on the performance of the antenna of a typical cellular phone are studied. Several dielectric profiles are used to determine the radiation characteristics of the antenna. The analysis also includes the effect on the antenna length and the matching impedance.

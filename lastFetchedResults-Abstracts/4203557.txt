Text recognition in images is a research area which attempts to develop a computer system with the ability to automatically read the text from images. These days there is a huge demand in storing the information available in paper documents format in to a computer storage disk and then later reusing this information by searching process. One simple way to store information from these paper documents in to computer system is to first scan the documents and then store them as images. But to reuse this information it is very difficult to read the individual contents and searching the contents form these documents line-by-line and word-by-word. The challenges involved in this the font characteristics of the characters in paper documents and quality of images. Due to these challenges, computer is unable to recognize the characters while reading them. Thus there is a need of character recognition mechanisms to perform Document Image Analysis (DIA) which transforms documents in paper format to electronic format. In this paper we have discuss method for text recognition from images. The objective of this paper is to recognition of text from image for better understanding of the reader by using particular sequence of different processing module.

This study deals with the practical robust stabilisation and tracking problems of the perturbed multidimensional Heisenberg system with some additional integrators in the control input path. This objective is achieved by the use of variable structure control laws with an integral augmented sliding variable. This note shows how to select the integral sliding surface in such a way that the practical stabilisation of the extended Heisenberg system is achieved in spite of the uncertainties and without loss of controllability. Experimental results on a wheeled mobile robot show the performance of the proposed controller for the practical stabilisation and tracking problems.

A repetitive low-pressure die-casting technique has been developed for optimising the processing parameters for casting high quality Mg65Cu25Y10 bulk metallic glass samples. The objective was to establish the optimal combination of casting parameters for reducing the variation in quality from a minimum number of casting experiments. It was found that charge temperature, injection pressure and injection velocity were important parameters for controlling the length, porosity and degree of crystallinity in the as-cast samples. A processing map was generated which showed that the optimum combination of melt temperature and casting pressure for generating the highest quality casting were 560–580 °C and 0.4–0.5 bar, respectively.

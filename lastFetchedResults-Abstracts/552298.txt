Background: Tuberculosis is a great health issue in developing countries. Drug resistance is one of the principal problems in treating TB patients. In this review article we tried to demonstrate the prevalence of Multiple Drug Resistance (MDR), Extensively Drug Resistance (XDR) and Totally Drug Resistance (TDR) in tuberculosis patients in Iran.

Materials and Method: We used PUBMED, Scopus and scientific Iranian journals from the year 1970 to February 2010 for extracting data. Key words such as tuberculosis, drug resistance and Iran were used.

Results: There were several articles in this context but only articles in which Multiple Drug Resistance, Extensively Drug Resistance and Totally Drug Resistance tuberculosis were used were studied. The prevalence of MDR in several provinces of Iran was 0.5 to 27.9%. In Massih Daneshvari Hospital the prevalence of MDR and XDR were 5.4 and 10.6%, respectively.

Conclusion: The results of the study revealed that the rate of MDR is increasing in Iran. The appearance of XDR and TDR are serious threats in the control and treatment of tuberculosis. [ZJRMS, 12(3):2-6]

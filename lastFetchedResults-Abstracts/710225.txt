Abstract
Study Objective
The purpose of the study was to examine the independent effects of perceived parental monitoring on sexual experience, contraceptive, and substance use.
Design, Setting, and Participants
Adolescent females at an urban-based adolescent clinic (N = 174; 41% sexually experienced) rated the extent to which they were directly and indirectly monitored by their parents.
Main Outcome Measures
These perceptions were compared with reported contraceptive use as well as substance use. Direct parental monitoring was best described using two dimensions: direct monitoring and direct monitoring when with peers.
Results
Direct monitoring was found to be associated with the use of hormonal birth control methods at last intercourse. Direct parental monitoring when with peers was found to be associated with less use of alcohol and cigarettes.
Conclusions
These data suggest that parental monitoring is a relevant factor for primary care physicians to explore during treatment.

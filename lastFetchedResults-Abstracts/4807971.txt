The ecological study of the wolf and moose populations of Isle Royale National Park (USA) is the longest running large mammal predator/prey study in the world. A discrete event simulation of the park&#194;&#191;s wolf and moose populations is used together with the study&#194;&#191;s data to evaluate four candidate ordinary differential models of predator/prey systems. Using a least squares technique, the parameters of the four ordinary differential equation systems are determined for the park&#194;&#191;s and the simulation data, then the models are compared using both objective and subjective criteria.

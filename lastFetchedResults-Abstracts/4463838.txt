The combination of &#8220;electric mobility&#8221; and &#8220;renewable energy production&#8221; heavily demands for energy storage systems. Investigations of technical possibilities to use the stored energy of electric vehicles (EV) and so called plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) for smoothing the grid load and reduce power peaks are inalienable. Within the limits given by the carÂ´s battery management system consumption-driven charge and discharge signals could be used for effective integration in V2G systems. This paper will give a detailed overview of a system for bidirectional charging in an industrial grid. First real measurements and test results are given to proof the concept and show the opportunities.

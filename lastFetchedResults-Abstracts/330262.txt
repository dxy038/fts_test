Objective
A search was conducted in biomedical journals published from January 1997 to June 1997 to identify all dental materials publications and sort them into major categories.
Methods

Tables of contents for 79 journals for the period of January to June, 1997 were inspected and divided into 17 categories. Citations were analyzed by both frequency in journals and in categories, as well as compared to frequencies for previous years.
Results

A total of 445 citations were detected in 79 journals for the period January 1997 to June 1997. Certain journals (n=19) demonstrated a higher citation frequency (>_ 10 citations for 6 months) and represented 77.8% of all citations. The greatest number of citations continued to involve bonding (n = 97), resin-based restorative materials (composites; glass ionomers) (n = 95), prosthodontic materials (n=51), and pulp protection / luting materials (n=48). Frequencies by category were very similar to those for the last four years.
Significance

The compiled literature citations provide a supplement for researchers and academicians seeking information in existing electronic databases.

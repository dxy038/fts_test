Objective: In the current study, we performed taste and salivary analysis on patients suffering from burning mouth syndrome and xerostomia or taste disturbances. Study design: A total of 180 patients who complained of idiopathic burning mouth syndrome (BMS) and taste aberrations and/or xerostomia that may accompany BMS were evaluated. These patients were compared with 90 healthy, age- and sex-matched controls. Salivary flow rate, biochemical and immunological analysis and taste acuity by the forced-choice drop technique were performed for all subjects. These analyses were found to be conclusive in distinguishing controls from patients with complaints. Results: The great similarity of both salivary and taste analysis in the BMS, taste aberration and xerostomia groups, which were significantly different from the results obtained in the control group, was found to be the most striking result. Higher salivary concentrations in the experimental group were consistent with a lower saliva (water) flow rate. Conclusion: An oral neuropathy and/or neurological transduction interruption induced by salivary compositional alterations is suggested as the possible aetiology for the complaints. This report may add an important objective diagnostic tool to the clinician treating these patients.

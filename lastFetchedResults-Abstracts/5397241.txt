A radar reflector has been developed which is capable to transmit information at a reflector site as well as to receive signal from a radar station. Hence a simple bidirectional communication channel for telemetry and telecontrol is readily provided. The bidirectional communication system is shown in Fig.1. The reflector consists of a Lunebery lens and a reflecting plate. This configuration is essentially the same as a radar reflector with controllable reflection, previously reported. (1) A main difference is that the present reflecting plate has a receiving capability, whereas the previous plate provides only controllable reflection.

A penalty method (PM) and a method of moving asymptotes (MMA) are used to solve constrained nonlinear magnetostatic optimization problems. These methods are based on the analysis of the sensitivity of an objective function to a design parameter. Theoretical aspects are considered and numerical results from two different magnetic actuators (a coreless magnetic actuator and an automotive magnetic actuator) are discussed. These algorithms are powerful, efficient, and easy to use when used in design to synthesize these electromagnetic devices. Considering the number of iterations required to solve the problems, MMA can be viewed as computationally more efficient than PM

We study secret communication for broadcast channels with two legitimate receivers and one eavesdropper. The transmitter sends two independent confidential messages to the legitimate receivers which have to be kept secret from the eavesdropper. Here, each legitimate receiver is interested in one confidential message having the other one already as side information available. This problem arises for example in the broadcast phase in a bidirectional relay network, where a relay node establishes a bidirectional communication between two nodes while keeping the communication secure from an eavesdropper outside the network. We provide achievable rate regions and an outer bound on the secrecy capacity region.

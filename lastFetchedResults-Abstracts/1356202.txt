BACKGROUND AND AIM: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the knowledge of a group of Iranian
academic dentists regarding molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) in two dental schools in Iran.
METHODS: A survey was undertaken amongst the teaching staff of the dental schools of Shiraz and Tehran
Universities of Medical Sciences. The questionnaire consisted of two sections. In the first section respondents were
asked to provide socio-demographic information including year and place of receiving, and type of dental
qualification. The second section included questions regarding perception and recognition of the MIH defect in their
clinical practice, the incidence and severity of the defect (represented by its clinical presentation), their knowledge of
its prevalence, possible determinant factors, and their clinical experience with the management strategies for MIH.
Data were analyzed using frequency distribution and Pearson's chi-square test for categorical data. The critical level
for alpha was set at 0.05.
RESULTS: A response rate of 61.3% was achieved. The vast majority of the respondents (85.7%) had encountered MIH
in their professional work, with 48.8% indicating that yellow-brown opacities were the most prevalent lesion type. A
significant difference between specialists was reported in relation to the frequency of observation of MIH (?
2(5) = 15.3;
P  <  0.001). Resin composite was the most popular material used in treating teeth with MIH (62.0%). Endodontists
(90.0%) and pediatric dentists (77.8%) used resin composite significantly more than other specialist groups (?
2(5) = 5.8;
P  <  0.001). Adhesion was the most commonly reported influence on material choice (62.0%).
CONCLUSION: MIH is a defect encountered by Iranian dental academic staff with a considerable disparity in knowledge
and views regarding its clinical pattern.

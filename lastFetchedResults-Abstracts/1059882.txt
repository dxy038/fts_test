The accumulation of deposits in the honing grooves of the cylinder liner surfaces of internal combustion engines is undesirable as they seal the grooves (reducing their oil retention capability) and increase engine's oil consumption. As part of a long-term programme of truck engine development, after different running times and under similar conditions of load, engine speed and lubrication, a number of grey iron cylinder liners were axially sectioned, measured, inspected and a presence of deposits was discovered. These deposits were characterised in order to gain knowledge about their origin and quantities. The X-ray energy dispersive analysis revealed elements stemming from the oil/fuel (C, O and S), from the detergent (Ca and Mg), from the anti-wear additive (Zn and P), and from some contaminants (K and Si). Higher concentration of S and Ca were mostly found in the honing grooves covered with deposits suggesting a domination of the detergent additive. Deposit thickness measurements obtained by a white light interferometer revealed patchy deposit topographies concentrated at the top region reducing towards the bottom of the liner which was also confirmed by scanning electron microscope measurements. Despite the limitations of the interferometer, it has been shown that the interference measurements are sufficiently reliable for a quick and objective quantification of the overall deposit accumulation.

Abstract
Introduction: One of the most important hospital problems, is revocation of elective surgeries in all around the world. This cancellation could be an index to evaluate the quality of patients care service and triage at hospitals.
Objective: The causes of gynecologic and urologic elective surgeries cancellation in two teaching hospitals (Alzahra, Razi) on the day of surgery
Materials and Methods: Data were collected about operation cancellation of elective gynecologic and urologic surgeries during 11 years (20th March 2001 to 19th March 2011), retrospectively. The amount and causes of cancelations, patientâ€™s age, the relationship between revocation and seasons and its comparison with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), were analyzed by SPSS, version 15. 
Results: From 30684 patients, 2879 were cancelled (9/38%), with the most common cause of cancellation being inappropriate preparation before surgery (33/6%). The rates were 337 (26/1%) for gynecologic surgeries and 631 (39/6%) for urologic ones. The mean age of the patients in the cancelled group was significantly higher than that in the other group (p=0/02). There was a direct correlation between ASA physical status and the amount of repeals. After eliminating the problem, 89/3% underwent operations.
Conclusion: Among the causes of cancellation, only 67.04% were avoidable. So establishing a better relationship between patients and their families, and spending more time to recognize, assess and remove the medical problems, could help to decrease the rate of operation cancellations.

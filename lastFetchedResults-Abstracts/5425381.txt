In this paper, we consider hybrid models in environments of imperfect information, where the agents do not have all the information before making their choices. It presents a study on models for decision making in strategic interactions, such as matrix games, Markov decision processes and, in particular, Markov Games, because they are stochastic models that can be used for decision making in multiagent systems. The objective is to give background to the proposal of an approach based on (Interval) Fuzzy Logic for Markov Games, using multiagent simulation, for the modeling of strategic interactions in socio-environmental systems, with multiple agents interacting or competing for their goals. For that, we also discuss concepts of Fuzzy Set Theory and Interval Mathematics.

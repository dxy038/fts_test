This paper considers an optimization technique in which the objective is attained via alterations to the physical geometry of the system. This optimization framework, to be considered in the context of electron guns, is known as optimal shape design. Optimal shape design has been used in a number of applications including wing design, magnetic tape design, and nozzle design, among others. In this investigation, we use the methods of shape optimization to design the cathode of an electron gun. The dynamical equations modeling the electron particle path as well as the generalized shape optimization problem will be presented. Illustrative examples of the technique on gun designs that were previously limited to spherical cathodes will be given.

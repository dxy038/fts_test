Construction projects are conventionally analyzed considering factors such as cost and completion time. The present paper focuses on the projects particularly dealing with the house or building. The paper aims at an objective of introducing a synergy between project and supply chain management. After a brief relevant literature review, major construction activities have been discussed and the associated synergy between project management and supply chain concepts has been explained. Applications of the supply chain concepts such as forward and reverse logistics along with the customer order decoupling point in the context of construction management are discussed as a result of the proposed development. For this purpose, a categorization of construction product is developed on the basis of land and building characteristics and it is the major contribution of the present paper. This is also expected to be useful for estimating lead time and availability of the product in the context of relevant supply chain, and an associated managerial implication.

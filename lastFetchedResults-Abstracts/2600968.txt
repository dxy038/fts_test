Background: Lavender belongs to the Labiatae family and possesses antioxidant acivity.
Objective: The present study was conducted to evaluate the protective effect of lavender extract on infarct volume and its possible mechanisms in an experimental model of stroke.
Methods: Lavender extract (100, 200 mg/kg body weight, ip) was injected for 20 consecutive days. Two hours after the last dose, cerebral artery ligation surgery was performed and 24 hours after induction of ischemia, infarct volume was assessed. Also the amount of serum nitric oxide (NO) level was measured.
Results: Treatment of rats with lavender extract at a dose of 200 mg for 20 days resulted in a significant decrease in the infarct volume caused by stroke in penumbra area (cortex) and the core (sub-cortical) of brain compared to the control (P=0.044, P=0.047, consecutively). Lavender extract at a dose of 200 mg significantly increased blood levels of nitric oxide.
Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that Lavender extract protects brain against ischemia and reduces infarct volume in rats subjected to ischemia. The mechanism may be related to augmentation in endogenous antioxidant defense in the rat brain. Lavender plant extracts with increasing levels of endothelial nitric oxide, by inhibiting the decrease in cerebral blood flow reduced infarct volume.

An area often neglected in software technology is where software meets biology. WeÂ´ll approach this topic with one of the major interfaces between human beings and information technology: body sensors. These sensors mostly operate as interfaces to relatively small software components attached to or implanted into human bodies, such as pacemakers. They provide bidirectional communication interfaces between a person and a remote information system that provides healthcare services, diagnosis, or upgrades. The authors offer an overview of this rather old yet fast-evolving technology and show how to cope with design constraints.

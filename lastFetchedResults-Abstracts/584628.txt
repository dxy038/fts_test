Background & Objective: Approach to the study, as one of the factors affects students’ learning and achievement, is of a great importance. The aim of this study was to compare medical students’ approaches to learning in pre-clinical and clinical years of study and its effect on their academic achievement.
Methods: In this descriptive-analytic study, a total of 137 medical students in pre-clinical and clinical years of study in Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran, were evaluated by using Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students (ASSIST) questionnaire. Grade point average of students in theoretical and practical courses was considered as an indicator of their academic achievement.
Results: The most common approach to study and learning was deep approach (40.1%). In clinical years of study, a significant increase of using deep approach and significant decrease of using surface approach were observed. There was no significant difference between pre-clinical and clinical students in regard to their learning and study approaches (P = 0.140). Learning and study approach showed significant relationship with students’ academic achievement (P = 0.01).
Conclusion: Due to the significance of using deep approach in learning, it is recommended that educational planners provide the best learning conditions to encourage students to take advantage of this study approach.

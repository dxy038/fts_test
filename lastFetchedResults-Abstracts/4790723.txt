Path planning method of multiple robotic fish is proposed in this paper, based on the multi-objective cooperative co-evolution algorithm. Considering the particularity of robotic fish´s movement, part of initial subgroups are heuristically generated by the initial yaw angle and the coordinates of robotic fish and the target points, so that the planned path better conforms to the requirements of robotic fish´s movement. The coordination strategies among multiple robotic fish are given. Simulation proves the algorithm better suits the movement particularity of robotic fish and effectively improves the adaptive and overall coordination capability of robotic fish.

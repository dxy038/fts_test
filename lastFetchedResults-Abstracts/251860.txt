The objective of this paper is to show the potential of gas film levitation for
noncontact viscosity measurements. Materials studied include oxide and metallic
glasses, ceramics, and biphasic metallic alloys. After a brief presentation of the
gas film levitator, the analysis procedure of the drop relaxation, both in the
aperiodic and oscillating modes, is described in connection with existing hydrodynamic
models. The uncertainty of the viscosity measurements ranges from 5
to 15%, depending on the type of materials. The surface tension and the mass
density of the sample necessary to derive the viscosity can also be measured in
the same experimental apparatus.

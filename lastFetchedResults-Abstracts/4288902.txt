Non-rigid 3D shape recognition is an important and challenging research topic in computer vision and pattern recognition. This paper presents a novel algorithm, called dictionary learning based on supervised locally linear representation (DL-SLLR), for efficient 3D shape recognition using shape descriptors. Specifically, we introduce a novel locality-preservation error term along with a label approximation error term into the objective function. The proposed algorithm optimizes a dictionary for its capability in representation as well as its locality-preservation capability, which thus allows more consistent encoding of similar descriptors compared with sparse coding. In addition, the proposed SLLR coding yields a closed-form solution, compared to many sparse coding algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that using majority voting, DL-SLLR outperforms D-KSVD and SVM over a newly generated SLI 3D Face Dataset and the SHRECÂ´11 Contest Dataset.

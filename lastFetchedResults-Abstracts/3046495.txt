The reconstruction and deregulation have brought fundamental changes to many aspects of power system operation and management. As a result, the planning activity is no longer dominated by the system operator. The deregulation has also brought many uncertainties and constraints to the system planning area. Therefore, the traditional centralized expansion planning approach will face difficulties in a market environment and new planning approaches are needed. In this paper, a market-oriented planning objective for transmission network expansion has been developed, which aims at maximizing the overall benefit from network expansion while considering critical constraints, such as power flow balance and transmission capacities. The planning objective has been solved by a genetic algorithm (GA) to achieve the best available expansion plan. The IEEE 14-bus system is used to test the developed method.

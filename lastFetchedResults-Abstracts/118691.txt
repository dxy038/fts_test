The essential idea of the principle of material frame-indifference that material properties are frame indifferent, or constitutive functions are form invariant relative to change of observers - has been disputed recently by Murdoch in [1, 2] by the claim that the standard restrictions on constitutive functions can be deduced by purely objective considerations, without the requirement of forminvariance of the constitutive functions. The purpose of this paper is to show that such a claim is groundless by pointing out blunders in the specious proofs and by presenting counter-examples.

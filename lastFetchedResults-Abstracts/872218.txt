Semiparametric necessary and sufficient proper efficiency conditions are established for a class
of constrained multiobjective fractional optimal control problems with linear dynamics, containing
arbitrary norms. Moreover, utilizing these proper efficiency results, eight semiparametric duality
models are formulated and appropriate duality theorems are proved. These proper efficiency and
duality criteria contain, as special cases, similar results for several classes of unorthodox optimal
control problems with multiple, fractional, and conventional objective functions, which are particular
cases of the main problem considered in this paper.

The authorsÂ´ objective was to detect volitionally controlled facial maneuvers as an additional means to communicate with electrically controllable devices. There are two major areas of applications foreseen for such a detection and classifying system: for use by people with disabilities, including tetraplegics, and by anyone who needs an additional channel for communication, such as an industrial worker who needs another hand. The detection system is based on the detection of the electrical activity of skeletal muscle in the vicinity of the sensor that is a set of tripolar concentric ring electrodes

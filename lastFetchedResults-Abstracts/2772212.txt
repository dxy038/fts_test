The objective of this overview article is to report the latest research findings in the research into RF/ microwave reconfigurable-bandwidth bandpass planar filters with ultralarge passbandwidth tuning ratio. This means filtering devices with much higher flexibility, showing reconfigurable bandwidths between narrow/moderate-band and ultrawideband states. Specifically, two different solutions we recently proposed are described, with emphasis on their operating principles and achieved electrical performances. They consist of 1) transversal signal-interference switchable-bandwidth bandpass filters and 2) tune-all bandpass filters simultaneously exploiting MMRs and quality-factor control to achieve unprecedented reconfiguration levels in terms of center frequency and instantaneous passbandwidth. Some other modern filtering topologies proposed by other authors, which have clear interest to attain very high levels of bandwidth variation, are also expounded.

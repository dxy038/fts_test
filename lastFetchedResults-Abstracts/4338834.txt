WiMAX is a standard based on wireless technology that provides high throughput broadband connections over long distance. This technology can be used for a number of applications, including &#8220;last mile&#8221; broadband connections, hotspots and high-speed connectivity for business customers. The objective of this article is to propose an approach to design a network on the latest standard of WiMAX namely (802.16m) and to use it dimensioning and planning such network in Tripoli Area. In this article a review of WiMAX technology was given, followed by its standard with focusing on 802.16m standard. A design approach was developed to help network planner in their work, this approach was summarized in a simple flow chart. As a case study, a network based on this technology was designed for Tripoli area. The number of subscriber was calculated for each district area and plotted in a clutter map. The Building Penetration Losses for each type of area were modeled using several measurements conducted as a part of this work. The design outcome (number of base station and there distribution) where found less than the existing ones in the operating network.

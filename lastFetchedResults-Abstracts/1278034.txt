The objective of this study was to examine the in vitro hydrolysis of vitamin E esters (α-tocopheryl acetate, α-tocopheryl succinate and α-tocopheryl nicotinate) by pancreatic carboxyl ester hydrolase (CEH) at the concurrent presence of different bile acids at different concentrations. The assay was performed by measuring the amount of α-tocopherol released by porcine pancreatic juice upon addition to different solutions of α-tocopheryl esters, which were dispersed in bile acid mixed micelles at 37°C, pH 7.4. The CEH activity was 10 U in the final assay, and the optimal concentration of cholate in this in vitro-system was determined to 30 mM for the hydrolysis of α-tocopheryl acetate. The hydrolysis of α-tocopheryl esters required presence of pancreatic juice and bile acids, and the results showed furthermore that the ability of pancreatic CEH towards hydrolysis of different α-tocopheryl esters increased with increasing lipophility, irrespective of the type or concentration of bile acid present in the assay. Likewise, retinyl palmitate was hydrolyzed at a faster rate than retinyl acetate. The structure of the bile acid influenced the rate of hydrolysis. Thus, cholate followed by glycodeoxy- and glycochenodeoxycholate were the most effective activators of CEH among the bile acids tested in this assay. The presence of γ-tocopherol or all-trans-retinyl acetate in the assay showed a non-competitive inhibition of the hydrolysis rate of α-tocopheryl acetate.

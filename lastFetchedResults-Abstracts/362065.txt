Study Objective: We determine how knowledgeable elderly (>65 years old) patients seen in the emergency department are of their prescription medications. Methods: Patients older than 65 years who presented to the ED of an urban teaching hospital were interviewed concerning their prescription medications and the indications for their use. Medications and dosages were verified through the patients' pharmacies. Medication indications were assessed for accuracy by referencing the Physicians' Desk Reference. Results: Data on 88 patients were collected over a period of 2 months. Eleven patients were excluded from the study because of logistics (9) and rescinding of consent (2). Patients averaged 5.9 prescription medications on presentation to the ED. Patients correctly identified 78.4% (359/458) of these medications. Thirty-three (42.8%) patients were able to correctly identify all of their prescription medications. Furthermore, patients correctly identified 65.5% (236/359) of dosages (25 [32.5%] patients named all dosages correctly), 91.4% (328/359) of dosing intervals (44 [57.1%] patients named all intervals correctly), and 83.3% (299/359) of indications (49 [63.3%] patients named all indications correctly). Conclusion: Elderly patients presenting to the ED have only a fair knowledge of their prescription medications. [Chung MK, Bartfield JM.

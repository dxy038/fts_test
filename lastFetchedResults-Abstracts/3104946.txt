The objective of this paper is to present a novel five phase fault tolerant doubly salient electromagnetic generator (DSEG) for direct driven wind turbine. The novel generator has same distinct features as follows: first, the generator configuration is simple and reliable. The output voltage is controlled by DC exciting current easily and the position sensors and the active power converters are not necessary. Second, if one phase winding or two non-adjacent phase winding faults occur, no matter short circuit faults or open circuit faults, the generator can still supply the qualified power to the load. Third, the currents of fault phase have no effect on the flux linkage of normal phase and heat is also isolated from the fault phase to normal phases. A FEA model is also developed and the results of simulation validity the proposed five phase fault tolerant DSEG.

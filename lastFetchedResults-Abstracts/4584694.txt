We prove that the number of Pareto-optimal solutions in any multiobjective binary optimization problem with a finite number of linear objective functions is polynomial in the model of smoothed analysis. This resolves a conjecture of Rene Beier. Moreover, we give polynomial bounds on all finite moments of the number of Pareto-optimal solutions, which yields the first non-trivial concentration bound for this quantity. Using our new technique, we give a complete characterization of polynomial smoothed complexity for binary optimization problems, which strengthens an earlier result due to Beier and Vo&#194;&#191;cking.

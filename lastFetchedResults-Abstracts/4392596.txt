The objective of this paper is to design and develop a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent-based approach for power system restoration. We describe a multiple bus electrical power system (multi-bus power system) as a market environment that consists of BDI bus agents representing two different characters, consumer and producer. The bus agents are able to balance the power system between power generation and load consumption while producers and consumers exploring the market and trading the power resource. In addition, the power system can be split into power branches by the bus agents naturally and efficiently. When a fault occurs in the system, the bus agents can maximize the capacity of the served loads or minimize the loss of power loads (when load shedding may be the only option) in a timely manner. The proposed BDI multi-agent approach can be applied to any size and structure of the multi-bus power systems. It is shown from our simulation and results comparison that the proposed approach becomes more effective and efficient when the scale of the multi-bus power system is getting larger.

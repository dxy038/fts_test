Multispectral image analysis is a relatively promising field of research with applications in several areas, such as medical imaging and satellite monitoring. However, a considerable number of current methods of analysis are based on parametric statistics. Alternatively, some methods in computational intelligence are inspired by biology and other sciences. Here we claim that philosophy can be also considered as a source of inspiration. This work proposes the objective dialectical method (ODM), which is a computational intelligent method for classification based on the philosophy of praxis. Here, ODM is instrumental in assembling evolvable mathematical tools to analyze multispectral images. In the case study described in this paper, such multispectral images are composed of diffusion weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) images. The results are compared to ground-truth images produced by polynomial networks using a morphological similarity index.

We developed a bidirectional transceiver module with polymer waveguide to enable fabrication of compact and low-cost optical transceivers for gigabit or gigabit Ethernet passive optical networks (G-PON/GE-PON). The new module is compact and uses a polymer waveguide (planar lightwave circuit [PLC]). All the optical components, i.e., an optical fiber, Y-shaped polymer optical waveguides, photo detector (PD) chip, laser diode (LD) chip, and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) filter, were mounted on the PLC platform using a passive alignment technique. We confirmed that the moduleÂ´s performance and reliability are sufficiently high for G-PON applications.

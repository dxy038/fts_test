In this paper, we consider multiple QoS based grid resource scheduling. It is heterogeneity and dynamics of the grid that make QoS problems in grid environment challenging. Computational grid´s resource management must deal with various demands from users. Each of grid task agent´s diverse requirements is modeled as a quality of service (QoS) dimension, associated with each QoS dimension is a utility function that defines the benefit that is perceived by a user with respect to QoS choices in that dimension. The objective of multiple QoS based grid resource scheduling is to maximize the global utility of the scheduling system. This paper proposes an iterative scheduling algorithm that is used to perform optimal multiple QoS based resource scheduling. The experiments show that optimal multiple QoS based resource scheduling involves less overhead and leads to more efficient resource allocation than no optimal resource allocation

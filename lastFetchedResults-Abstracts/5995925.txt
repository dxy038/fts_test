With the characteristics of wide coverage, economy and real-time, satellite remote sensing had the advantage in resource and environmental monitoring, crop yield estimation, disaster monitoring, global change and so on. Satellite image´s spatial resolution is an important indicator of Space Remote Sensing level. To pursue the higher resolution has become the development goal of many countries´ satellite remote sensing. Super-resolution technology of space remote sensing image could improve satellite images´ spatial resolution which has become an important forefront of space remote sensing technology. Combine the present situation of super-resolution technology objective evaluation method, this article focused on super-resolution objective evaluation problem and studied the key parameters of image changing after super-resolution so that established a scientific super-resolution objective evaluation index system.

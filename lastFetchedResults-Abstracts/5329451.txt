As the number and size of wind farms continue to grow, many countries have established or are developing a set of specific requirements (i.e., grid codes) for operation and grid connection of wind farms. The objective of these grid codes is to ensure that wind farms do not adversely affect the power system operation with respect to security of supply, reliability and power quality. This paper reviews major grid code requirements for wind farms, and investigates various technologies developed by and solutions proposed by researchers and wind turbine manufactures in order to meet these requirements. In addition, some of the authorsÂ´ work on these issues are discussed and demonstrated by simulation studies.

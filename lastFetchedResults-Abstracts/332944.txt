The purpose of this study is to test a new pulse sequence, fast inversion recovery for myelin suppression (FIRMS) for its ability to improve the conspicuity of gray matter. Twenty-six seizure patients were scanned with FIRMS as well as standard sequences. Gray matter conspicuity was evaluated objectively using region-of-interest calculations, including image contrast, contrast ratios, and contrast:noise (C/N). In evaluation of the hippocampus and cortex, all objective measurements of conspicuity were highest for FIRMS. In five clinical cases of suspected cortical dysplasia, FIRMS improved delineation of pathology in positive cases and ruled out the diagnosis in negative cases. In a case of hippocampal sclerosis, FIRMS was able to demonstrate atrophy of the alveus. Fast inversion recovery for myelin suppression holds promise for its ability to highlight the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.

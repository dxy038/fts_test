Introduction & Objective: Post-operative shivering is a common complication of general anesthesia with a reported incidence of 40-70 percent. It increases metabolic rate of oxygen demand, cardiac output, intracranial pressure, surgical incision retracture and post-operative pain. Various drugs such as NSAIDS have been used to treat or prevent post-anesthetic shivering. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Diclofenac Na suppository on post-anesthetic shivering.
Materials & Methods: This is a double-blind randomized clinical trial performed on 120 primiparous women undergone elective Caesarian delivery. They were randomly divided into two case and control groups. Vital signs of all the patients were measured before anesthesia and recorded. Drugs used for premedication, induction and maintenance of anesthesia were the same in both groups. Just before the induction of general anesthesia, patients in case group received one suppository (100 mg) of diclofenac Na. Shivering was evaluated during 60 minutes after extubation and vital signs were measured as well. The data were analyzed by SPSS software.
Results: Post anesthetic shivering was observed in 6117% of control group and 5% of case group (p< O. 0001). Post anesthetic hypothernia was much more frequent in control group in comparison with Diclofenac Na group (p<0. 0001). in comparison with control group, case group had more stability in body temperature.
Conclusion: Results of this study indicate that a single dose of suppository Diclofenac Na (100 mg) prevents post-anesthetic shivering without significant effect on body temperature. Accordingly, it can be suggested that suppository Diclofenac Na can be used for the management of post operative shivering.

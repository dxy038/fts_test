The WDM cross-connect is a device based on integrating a two-dimensional array of Bragg diffraction cells. This device can be used in various wavelength routing network applications and overcomes the major problems related to the conventional star coupler. This device has been proposed for the implementation of the ShuffleNet. In this paper, we propose a method of using this device for the implementation of several multihop lightwave networks such as the Manhattan Street Network, the bidirectional ShuffleNet and finally to a new logical topology, the bilayered ShuffleNet. We also use flow graphs for path enumeration analysis in the bilayered ShuffleNet and for comparison with the conventional case

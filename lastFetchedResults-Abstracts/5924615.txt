Artificial Immune System (AIS) is a branch of computational intelligence that has gained increasing interest among researchers in the development of immune-based models and techniques to solve diverse complex computational problems. This work focuses on the application of AIS techniques to cancer research and specifically for prediction of the recurrence of cancer in patients. The objective is to test AIS models and algorithms for cancer research by validation against actual cancer datasets.

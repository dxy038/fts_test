We present an Optimal Filtering (OF) algorithm to reconstruct the energy, time and pedestal of a photomultiplier signal from its digital samples. The OF algorithm was first developed for liquid ionization calorimeters, its implementation in scintillator calorimeters, specifically in the ATLAS hadronic Tile calorimeter (TileCal), is the aim of this study. The objective is to implement the algorithm on the DSPs of the Read Out Driver cards in order to reconstruct online the energy of the calorimeter and provide it to the second level trigger. The algorithm is tested and compared with a plain filtering algorithm using both calibration and real data from the TileCal detector. The results are promising specially in the regions where the electronic noise contributes significantly to the resolution

In the small brushless DC motor, the system in which the unidirectional current flows can be adopted. However, recently, the brushless DC motor, in which the bidirectional current flows, is being mainly studied. The unidirectional motor system is easy to control the direction of the torque by all armature windings. Considering the above fact, we developed the highly effective brushless DC motor, in which the unidirectional current flows.

The objective of this paper is to investigate a methodology, which can extract approximate results for the free space radiation pattern from non-anechoic measurements. Using an impulse response both in the time and angular domains of the non-anechoic measurement environment, the free space pattern of the device under test is estimated. The purpose of this paper is, as opposed to what has been stated in some papers, to show that a deconvolution based technique is feasible for reflection compensation in non-anechoic measurements. The proposed method can also be applied at a single frequency as illustrated in this paper. Simulated data has been used to illustrate the applicability of this new technique and its improved performance over the conventional FFT-based methods.

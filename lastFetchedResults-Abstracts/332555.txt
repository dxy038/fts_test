Objective
Sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) is a widely used industrial preservative commonly found in children's drinks. In this paper we examined the effect of SHMP incorporated into children's drinks on acid production by the oral biofilm by monitoring salivary concentrations of lactic acid.
Materials and method

Twelve healthy adult subjects with an average age 36 years (range 26â€“54 years) consumed 10 ml from four children's beverages (Coca Cola and three types of Sunny Delight supplemented with SHMP) and a standard solution of sucrose. Saliva was collected at intervals following exposure of the oral biofilm to the drinks and the clearance of carbohydrates and the appearance of lactate was measured using standard enzymatic techniques.
Results

All the carbohydrates derived from the drinks were cleared from saliva within 15 min of consumption. Comparison of two drinks [Sunny D Normal and Sunny C] with the same carbohydrate, but different SHMP concentrations suggested that SHMP in these beverages had no significant effect on acid production.
Conclusions

In this clinical study the role of SHMP, incorporated in common beverages, did not inhibit acid production from carbohydrates.

The  main objective of the study is to identify and to explain university female studentsâ€™ attitudes towards violence against women. A survey method was adopted and data were collected through self-administered questionnaire with a reliability index of 0.78. The validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by construct validation procedures. The sample was taken from all female students of  Mazandaran University. Totally, 450 female students were selected on the basis of stratified sampling. Theoretical Framework was Social Learning Theory. Some Independent variables such as model of different reinforcement and punishment, violence experiment, violence observation, gender role socialization and observation learning were used to explain the variations of dependent variable (i.e. attitudes towards violence against women). The results of regression analysis showed that all of nine hypotheses were confirmed. Among five independent variables, violence experience (0.78) was the most important variable for predicating attitudes towards violence against women followed by socialization (0.23), violence observation (0.22), model of reinforcement and punishment (0.14), and observation  learning (0.11).

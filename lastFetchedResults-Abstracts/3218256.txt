This paper approaches a multi-objective non-conflicting optimization problem that aims to find the loading of local generators (DG) and the most appropriate DR strategy applied to some important customers in the network, to simultaneously optimize two objective functions. A combined method between differential evolution (DE) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used in order to find the solution which fits the best the decision maker requirements.

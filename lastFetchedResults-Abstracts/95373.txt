This work deals with the solution of an inverse problem of parameter estimation involving heat and mass transfer in capillary porous media, as described by the dimensionless linear Luikov’s equations. The physical problem under picture involves the drying of a moist porous one-dimensional medium. The main objective of this paper is to simultaneously estimate the dimensionless parameters appearing in the formulation of the physical problem by using transient temperature and moisture content measurements taken inside the medium. The inverse problem is solved by using the Levenberg–Marquardt method of minimization of the least-squares norm with simulated measurements.

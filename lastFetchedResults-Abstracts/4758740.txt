In this paper, the nonlinear optimal control problem is formulated as a multi-objective mathematical optimization problem. Differential Harmony search (DHS) algorithm is one of the new heuristic algorithms. The DHS optimization algorithm is introduced for the first time in solving the fault sections estimation performance in power systems. A case on optimal estimation for fault section in the part of the 230KV Southern Brazilian electric power system is presented to show the methodologyÂ´s feasibility and efficiency. Compared with the existing fault section estimation in power system methods, the search time of the DHS optimization algorithm is shorter and the result is close to the ideal solution.

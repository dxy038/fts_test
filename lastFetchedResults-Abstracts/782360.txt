Deep oil reservoirs with high heterogeneity need thorough management to maximize production and recovery along with minimizing OPEX and CAPEX. This management is integration between technology, human resource and processes. 
Smart Well technology helps oil companies to meet aforementioned goals. Since smart well technology imposes high initial expenditure it is a risky and costly decision for oil companies to apply it for all companies. Indeed, this fact dictates prioritization of oil fields based on several parameters to decide where this technology should be implemented first. 
 In this paper we present a novel screening technique under Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) engine. This technique needs criteria and sub-criteria affecting smart well potential of fields such as Geological, Geographical, Environmental and Economical parameters. 
In this study, the main components of the four main mentioned parameters have been extracted. All of them weighted according to our objective function. The result of this research would be impact weight of each parameter with respect to each other that can be used an engineering box for making decision among several fields for implementing smart well technology.

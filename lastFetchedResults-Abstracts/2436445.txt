Combustion optimization has been proved to be an effective way to reduce the NOx emissions and unburned carbon in fly ash by carefully setting the operational parameters of boilers. However, there is a trade-off relationship between NOx emissions and the boiler economy, which could be expressed by Pareto solutions. The aim of this work is to achieve multi-objective optimization of the coal-fired boiler to obtain well distributed Pareto solutions. In this study, support vector regression (SVR) was employed to build NOx emissions and carbon burnout models. Thereafter, the improved Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2), the new Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimizer (OMOPSO), the Archive-Based hYbrid Scatter Search method (AbYSS), and the cellular genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization (MOCell) were used for this purpose. The results show that the hybrid algorithms by combining SVR can obtain well distributed Pareto solutions for multi-objective optimization of the boiler. Comparison of various algorithms shows MOCell overwhelms the others in terms of the quality of solutions and convergence rate.

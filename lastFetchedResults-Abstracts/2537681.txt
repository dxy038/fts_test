This research was carried out through a survey with a voluntary sample and by an online questionnaire. It theoretically draws upon Cultivation Theory, Use and Gratification Theory as well as Giddens’ Structuration Theory. The research population is made up of Young women and girls using Facebook in Tehran in 1394 (Iranian Calendar). Research findings indicate that there is a positive significant relationship between modern personal identity and the level of using this social network, motive and objective of using (purposefully and unpurposely), the level of participation and activity of users as well as recognizing this network’s contents.

Sensor Data Fusion deals with the synergistic combination of data made available by various sources such as sensors in order to provide a better understanding of a given scene. The use of sensor/data fusion concept has advantages such as &#8220;Redundancy&#8221;, &#8220;Complementary&#8221;, &#8220;Timeliness&#8221; and &#8220;Less Costly Information&#8221;. The following issues will be presented in this tutorial: 1) Background 2)Sensor/Data fusion overview 3) Definition &amp; Formulation 4) Fusion: A Fission inversion model 5) Fusion characterization: a) Application domain b) Fusion objective c) Fusion process input/output characteristics d) Sensor suite configuration 6) Different Techniques of Sensor fusion a) Conventional Approaches b) Knowledge based Systems/Intelligent Approaches 7) Different Level Fusion Architectures 8) Different Fusion Model Architectures 9) Integration of Mechatronics &amp; Sensor Data Fusion 10) Some typical applications of Sensor Data Fusion in Robotics &amp; Mechatronics.

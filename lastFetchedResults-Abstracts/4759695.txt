Client-server architecture is the common practice for online games where installed reliable servers provide the game logic. If the latency between two players through a server is large, the responsiveness of the game can become problematic. Consequently, performance as well as gaming experience can be unsatisfactory. In this paper, for client-server architecture we present a game state forwarding mechanism supportive for online games that can comply strict time-constraint. The objective is to reduce latency between two players by directly sharing game states rather than following a comparatively lengthy path using the server. The quality control, a key requirement for online games though subjective, is a challenging task. For this reason, game providers add enormous amount of resource into systems to maintain the desired level of gaming experience. In this article, we also introduce a quality control algorithm considering the significance of virtual interaction and playersÂ´ physical position. Our assumption states that the interaction detail between two players is inversely proportional to their virtual distance. Based on this principle and the time- constraint of the target application, a quality precedence matrix is formed augmenting gaming experience. Desired performance improvement has been observed while conducting the simulation.

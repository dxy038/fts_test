A 3D-QSAR analysis of a new class of ring-substituted quinolines with anti-tuberculosis activity has been carried out by three methodsâ€”Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA), CoMFA with inclusion of a hydropathy field (HINT), and Comparative Molecular Similarity Indices Analysis (CoMSIA). The conformation of the molecules was generated using a simulated annealing protocol and they were superimposed using features common to the set with database alignment (SYBYL) and field fit methods. Several statistically significant CoMFA, CoMFA with HINT, and CoMSIA models were generated. Prediction of the activity of a set of test molecules was the best for the CoMFA model generated with database alignment. Based upon the information contained in the CoMFA model, we have identified some novel features that can be incorporated into the quinoline framework to improve the activity.

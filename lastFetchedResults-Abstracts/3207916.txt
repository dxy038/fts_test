The increase of Photovoltaic (PV) systems in the Low Voltage Distribution Networks (LVDN) may cause several technical issues such as violation of voltage regulation. In order to prevent the issues, the installation of PV systems requires power flow calculation to quantify the allowable size of PV systems. The calculation requires exact network impedance from the power source to the point of connection of PV systems. Most of the times the network impedances are not provided and it needs to be verified by experiments. The objective of this work is to propose a simple technique to estimate the allowable load and PVs that can be installed on the LVDN based on the statutory voltage regulation. The proposed method facilitates the process of estimating the allowable PV size as well as load at the point of connection. A new terminology &#8220;Specific Power Capacity (SPC)&#8221; is proposed for this purpose.

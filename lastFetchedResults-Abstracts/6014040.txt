Based on detailed analysis of the distributed generationsÂ´(DG) characteristics in microgrid , the objective function and mathematical model are built and the improved Clonal Genetic Algorithm(CAG) is pointed out. Correctional operate and partial search are added to CGA in order to improve the search efficiency. Therefore, the optimal configuration of DG in microgrid is more rapid to obtain. Finally, the method is used in IEEE 39 bus system, and compared with other algorithms, by applying this algorithm to computer simulation, the result shows that the algorithm are feasible and available.

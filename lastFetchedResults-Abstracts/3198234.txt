Micro-grids (MGs) are active networks known as an effective solution for the control of grids including high levels of Distributed Generation (DG). In off-grid MGs, DGs connected to Voltage Source Inverters (VSIs) enroll as controllers of voltage and frequency. These VSIs should share power between the DGs fairly. A precise power sharing may increase frequency drop. In this paper, a trade-off is obtained between power sharing and frequency behavior. A multi-objective function is defined including the aforementioned parameters. Imperialism Competitive Algorithm (ICA) is used for optimization process. The obtained parameters lead to the best performance of VSI controllers considering frequency behavior and power sharing.

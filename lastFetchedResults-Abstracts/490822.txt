Background and Objective: Serous otitis media is one of the most common childhood diseases and can lead to delay in speech development. In these study children, aged less than 6 years old, from rural health centers were examined for the prevalence of otitis media as well as to assess the factors associated with this disease.

Subjects and Methods: In this cross-sectional study 856 children from the rural and metropolitan areas of Hovaiezeh city were participated. The prevalence of otitis media as well as the factors associated with the disease such as: age, sex, maternal feeding, familial smoking, social and economic conditions were assessed.

Results: The prevalence rate of otitis media was high with a value of 31% for children of less than 6 years age. The prevalence rates of otitis media in different age and sex groups showed that this disorder was more frequent for boys against girls in 0-2 and 4-6 years old comparing with 2-4 years old children. The prevalence of disease had significant positive correlation with no maternal breast-feeding, familial smokers and low economic conditions. Discussion: Considering the high prevalence of disease in study area, more attention in health services and promote the culture of breastfeeding at least in the first 2 years of life, reduce smoking by family members and creating employment is necessary. We hope the result of this research may raise attention to the importance of prevention and management of otitis media in less than 6 years-old children. Sci Med J 2010;9( 1):53-62

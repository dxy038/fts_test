Objective: To investigate the different expression of the rice receptor-like mRNA on nitrogen ion beam irradiated rice. Methods: Selected 3 groups ion beam irradiation rice seeds and untreated rice seed respectively, extracted their seedling total RNA after 96h germination at 30&#176;C, using Agilent gene chip screening different expressed genes of two groups rice seedlings. The chip contains 32323 mRNA probes; we choose difference about 2 times as the threshold range to analyze the differences in expression between the two samples. Results: There are 10 receptor-like mRNAs have significant differences expression between the irradiated group and the control group. Conclusion: The different expression receptor-like mRNAs of the irradiated rice may modulate the expression of certain genes respond to ion irradiation, which makes the irradiated rice different from control group on physiological, biochemical and phenotypic.

Automotive booming noise due to powertrain occurs when pure or narrow band tones related to the firing frequency of engine and its harmonics excite the passenger cavity, which entails a prominent increase of sound intensity. The booming sensation has been considered as very important to the acoustic comfort of passengers. In this study, a sound quality index which can objectively evaluate the booming sensation was derived. Because of the tonal nature of powertrain booming noise, subjective pitch was employed to find only aurally relevant tonal components which influence booming sensation as well as loudness. Using the empirical data and the frequency difference limen for just-noticeable change of booming sensation obtained from the listening test, an existing pitch extraction algorithm could be modified. The modified pitch model was applied to the interior noises of accelerating passenger cars together with a loudness analysis for representing the objective features of booming feeling. Subjective tests using the magnitude estimation method were conducted to evaluate the degree of booming sensation. Finally, booming strength was proposed for quantifying the booming sensation, which was validated by subjective results. The correlation coefficient between the derived booming strength and the degree of booming sensation obtained by the subjective test was 0.926.

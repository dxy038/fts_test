Using rough sets to reason from data hinges on three basic concepts of rough sets theory: approximations, decision rules and dependencies. Main objective of reasoning from data is finding hidden patterns in data. Genetic algorithms provides a general frame to optimize problem solution of complex system without depending on the domain of problem, it is robust to many kinds of problem. In this paper we propose a new approach of combining genetic algorithms and rough sets theory to compute reasoning from data by an example of information table, the combination enable us to auto-compute reasoning from data

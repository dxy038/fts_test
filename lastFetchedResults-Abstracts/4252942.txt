This paper proposes security constrained economic power dispatch (SCED) of the generators using parallel artificial bee colony (PABC) algorithm for electricity markets. The proposed non-linear optimization problem considers simultaneous minimization of deviations from scheduled transactions and minimization of fuel cost of the generators. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem in a way that insures a secure-economic system operation. Incorporation of economic load dispatch (ELD) with voltages and lineflow constraints significantly relieves the assumptions imposed on the optimized objective function. The proposed approach has been tested on two representative systems, i.e. IEEE 14 bus and IEEE 30 bus systems respectively. Here, the message passing interface based technique is used in the PABC algorithm in a shared memory model. The time complexity and the solution quality with respect to the number of processors in a cluster are thoroughly analyzed.

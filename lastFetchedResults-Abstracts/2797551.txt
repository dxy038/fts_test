An optimal light emitting diodes (LEDs) location approach applied in the indoor multiple-input single-output (MISO) visible light communications (VLC) system is introduced in this paper, which considers the requirements of indoor illumination effect and communication performance simultaneously. By choosing the objective function with the linear combination of the standard deviation of illumination and the bit error rate (BER) of the MISO VLC system, the optimal 4 LEDs location over the ceiling can be reached. Computer simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

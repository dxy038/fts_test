The objective of this work is to introduce a technique for the improvement and the optimization of the control performances of a system, composed the photovoltaic panel, a Boost converter and a load. This control is ensured thanks to the method of the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) by fuzzy logic. Simulations of the various parts of the system are developed under Matlab/Simulink, as well as a comparison between two controllers: &#8220;Perturb and Observ&#8221; (P&amp;O) and fuzzy logic (FL). The results got under various operating conditions show a clear improvement of the performances of the control by fuzzy logic of the MPPT of the photovoltaic system.

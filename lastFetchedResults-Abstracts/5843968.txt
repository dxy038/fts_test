In this paper, a hybrid sensor network consisting of static and mobile sensors is considered, where static sensors are used to detect events, and mobiles sensors can move to event locations to conduct more advanced analysis. This dispatching problem can be converted to maximum weighted maximum matching problem with the objective of minimizing the total energy consumption to move sensor or maximizing the average remaining energy of sensor after movement. We present a distributed algorithm for sensor dispatch using message passing rule. Simulation results show that the algorithm can solve sensor dispatch problem in optimal distributed way.

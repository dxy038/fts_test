Describes an engine control system experiment the intent of which was to develop experiments on the CE7 Steam Engine Apparatus for incorporation in mechanical engineering laboratory. This goal was achieved by first determining the engine characteristics. Secondly the engine was interfaced with IBM PC computer. The software allowed the authors to implement values to various variables in order to control the speed of the engine. They then performed an analysis in order to determine the operating characteristics of the engine and values or other control variables. The objective of the experiment was also to illustrate the principles of controls and to introduce the students to the control problems encountered in industry

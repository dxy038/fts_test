Welcome to Taipei, Taiwan and the 1st IEEE International Conference on Cyber-physical systems, Networks, and Applications (CPSNA 2013). Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are next-generation embedded systems featuring a tight integration of computational and physical elements. Emerging applications of CPS include transportation, healthcare, energy, manufacturing, entertainment, consumer electronics, environmental monitoring, and aerospace, all of which will be essential pieces of our social infrastructure. A grander vision of CPS faces a core challenge of multidisciplinary research collaborations, as their relevant technologies appear in diverse areas of science and engineering. The objective of CPSNA is to explore innovative, exciting, and fresh ideas for CPS. Contributions should emphasize on the design, implementation, and evaluation of systems, networks, and applications.

This work describes and evaluates the design process of an autostereoscopic viewing interface for computer-assisted microsurgery. The interface aims to improve the way surgeons perceive visual data by introducing the use of a prototype autostereoscopic display that replaces the viewing end of the surgical microscope. The new man-machine system has undergone early and continuous usability testing in the context of real domain experts doing real work, as well as in laboratory-based experiments. Subjective and objective assessments of formal evaluations have been applied to design in a meaningful way. The design process contributes: (1) a human-centred design, based on the surgeonÂ´s mental model during microsurgery, (2) a video camera system that captures stereoscopic scenes from a surgical microscope and displays them in an autostereoscopic display, (3) a mechanical coupling component design for optimising various focal settings, and (4) integration with a new tool for computer-assisted surgery, using augmented reality techniques.

Therefore, in this paper by means of using new method of generalized pattern search and genetic algorithm are elaborated and compared with another. Another fact is the direct link between PSAT with the two previous methods. For the generation of this relationship with PSAT software, by writing an innovative program we were able to give PSAT variable inputs, genetic algorithm and new method of generalized pattern search in any population generation of new amount, processes it with PSAT and this procedure is continuous objective function. The results of this simulation is put on a sample network of 16-bus. These results show the higher effectiveness and faster speed of generalized pattern search in comparison with the genetic algorithm. Also, DG improves loss reduction and voltage profile much more better than the capacitor and is more effective.

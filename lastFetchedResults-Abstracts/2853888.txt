Wireless communications between vehicles enables both safety applications, such as accident avoidance, and nonsafety applications, such as traffic congestion alerts [1] with the intent of improving safety in driving conditions. Because cost limited test-bed environments constrain prototype testing, VANET researchers often turn instead to simulation toolsets from which a rich set of environmental scenarios are modeled. However, despite the availability of such tools, results are inconsistent. While VANET investigators often model propagation loss deterministically dependent upon transmitter receiver distance, fading and shadowing effects are often modeled stochastically, leading to probabilistic results which are independent of the actual environment and thus fail to consider realistic road topologies and the presence of obstacles [2]. In this work, we implement for ns-3 [3] the empirically-validated obstacle shadowing model from [4] by leveraging building data from Open Street Map (OSM) [5] to deterministically evaluate line of sight propagation effects using techniques from computational geometry, and we further extend results to evaluate safety performance assessments. The impact to safety performance measurement of obstacles in VANET simulations motivates the following research objective: The goal of this research is to show quantitatively how accurate, deterministic obstacle fading models impact the performance assessment of VANET safety applications. Deterministic shadowing compares differently than stochastic fading and failing to account for the effects of obstacles in safety assessment can inaccurately or even greatly overstate the performance of VANET safety applications. Including realistic obstacle shadowing in VANET simulation modeling improves VANET assessment and strengthens safety, thus supporting one of the primary goals of connected vehicle systems.

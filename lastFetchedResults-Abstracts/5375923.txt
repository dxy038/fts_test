Fuzzy cognitive maps constitute an important simulation methodology that combines neural networks and fuzzy logic. The Fuzzy cognitive maps designed by the experts can be enhanced significantly through learning algorithms, which proved to increase their efficiency and accuracy of simulation. Recently, learning algorithms that employ particle swarm optimization for the minimization of properly defined objective functions have been introduced. In this work, we enhance these learning schemes by incorporating local search in PSO, resulting in a memetic particle swarm optimization learning algorithm. Three variants of the memetic algorithm are applied successfully for the optimization of an Ecological Industrial Park simulation system and they are compared also with the established particle swarm optimization learning schemes. Results are reported and discussed, deriving useful conclusions

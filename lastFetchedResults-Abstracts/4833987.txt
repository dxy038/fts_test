In this paper we present the modified SSIM (SSIMmod) and simplified SSIM (SSIMsimpl) measures and compare them with 3 objective measures (MSE, original SSIM and VIF). Objective measures are compared using 7 publicly available subjective image quality databases and 3 correlation types (Pearson´s, Spearman´s and Kendall´s correlation). Results show that SSIMmod gives higher correlation than original SSIM, while SSIMsimpl with similar weighted mean correlation as original SSIM achieves faster calculation time.

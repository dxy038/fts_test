Background: Onion has significant blood sugar lowering action.
Objective: Antioxidants have essentialeffect on spermatogenesis and sperm parameters.
Streptozotocin can dioceses oxidative stress and changes in antioxidant capacity are considered to
play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic diabetes mellitus.
Methods: Wistar male rat (n=30) were allocated into three groups, control group (n=10) and
oninon (O) group that received 1cc/rat (gavages); (n=10), and Diabetic group that receivedoninon (O) group that received 1cc/rat (gavages); (n=10), and Diabetic group that received
55mg/kg (IP) streptozotocin (STZ) (n=20) which was subdivided to two groups of 10; STZ group
and treatment group. Treatment group received 55mg/kg (IP) STZ plus15mg/kg (O), daily for,4
weeks, respectively; however, the control group just received an equal volume of distilled water
daily(gavages). Diabetes was induced by a single (IP) injection of streptozotocin (55mg/kg)
.Animals were kept in standard condition. In 28day after inducing diabetic 5cc blood were
collected for testestrone, TAC, MDA and Ox-LDL levels and testes tissues of Rat in whole groups
were removed and sperm was collected from epididymis then prepared for analysis.
Results: Sperm population, percentage of sperm viability and motility and Serum total
testosterones significantly increased in groupthat has received 1cc/rat onion (p<0.05) in
comparison to control and experimental groups. Testes weights in streptozotocin group
significantly decreased in comparison to control group (p<0.05).
Conclusion: Since in our study 1cc/rat onion have significantly Preventive effect on Sperm
percentage of viability and motility and serum total testosterones by reducing level of Reactive
Oxygen Species (ROS) in serum, so it seems that using it can be effective for sperm healthy
parameters in Diabetic Rat.

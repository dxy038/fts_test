Job scheduling (JS) is one of the most important issues in a Cloud system. The objective of job schedulers in cloud computing is to meet usersÂ´ requirements and optimize the utilization of cloud resources. To achieve better QoS with high resource utilization in a cloud environment, an improved backfill algorithm (IBA) using balanced spiral (BS) method can be used. Results show that IBA minimizes resource idleness up to a great extent. However, IBA does not provide support for handling job priority and QoS. We need an algorithm to maximize the resource utilization while considering priority.

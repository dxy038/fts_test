The paper presents an adaptation of the general-purpose SIMNON software for the study of alternating-current drives. With the objective of designing and dimensioning converter-AC machine-regulator systems, a simulation module named SEMAS is constructed in modular form using SIMNON. This software package shows great capabilities in terms of computing power, optimization, robustness of the algorithms and graphical interaction. Asynchronous and synchronous machine models implemented in SEMAS are presented. The different methods for modelling static converters and switches, with the particularities of each, are also presented. The results show evidence of a good agreement between simulations and experiments.

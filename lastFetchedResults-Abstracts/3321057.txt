This paper proposes an OFDM receiver for the forward link of a fixed broadband satellite system. We focus on the synchronization tasks in the receiver. Our objective is to reduce to the minimum the needed overhead, in order to improve spectral efficiency compared to a single carrier waveform system. A non pilot aided algorithm is used. However it is preceded by a coarse synchronization stage, in which a limited overhead is necessary (short cyclic prefix associated to a few number of pilots). The performance of the proposed receiver is assessed through several simulation results.

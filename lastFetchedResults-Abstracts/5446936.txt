The doubly-fed induction generator is widely used on wind energy. This paper proposes predictive power control for doubly-fed induction generator. The control law is derived by optimization of an objective function that considers the control effort and the difference between the predicted outputs (active and reactive power) by using rotor currents and the specific references, with predicted outputs calculated using a linearized state-space model. Because the generator leakage inductance and resistance information were required for this control method, the influence of the estimation errors for these parameters was also investigated. Simulation results are presented for validation the proposed controller.

Bidirectional transmission over a single fibre using directional couplers and analogue echo cancellation is demonstrated. The implemented echo canceller suppresses crosstalk due to reflections from the local connector and coupler by 11 dB, i.e. it extends the transmission distance by up to 10 km (at 1.3 &#194;&#191;m).

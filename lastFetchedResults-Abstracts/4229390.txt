Bidirectional antenna amplifiers (BDA) are often used to extend the range of connections in wireless local area networks (WLAN). This paper presents the theory, design procedure and implementation of receiver part of a bidirectional amplifier (BDA) for the 5GHz WLAN systems in 802.11a and HiperLAN-2 standards. Only the blocks that affect the receiver path parameters are considered. In order to reduce the amplifier cost all its circuits are made on FR4 substrate. Since OFDM modulation used in 802.11a is very sensitive to harmonic and intermodulation distortions, two techniques of LNA linearity improvement are implemented.

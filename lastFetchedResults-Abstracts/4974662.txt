The paper describes an integrated approach to the design of navigation, guidance and control systems for autonomous-unmanned-underwater vehicles (AUVs). The framework adopted is illustrated with a design example in which developments in H-infinity control theory, multi-rate navigation techniques and classical guidance strategies were applied to the design of a high level controller for the underwater vehicle MARIUS (Marine Utility Vehicle System). The problem statement requires the design of a command following system for the vehicle to achieve precise tracking of reference trajectories defined in an universal reference frame. This objective should be accomplished in the presence of shifting sea currents, sensor noise and vehicle parameter uncertainty. The design phase is described, and the interaction among navigation, control and guidance is analyzed. The performance of the complete command following system is evaluated using a simulation package that allows the designer to assess the impact of navigation, control and guidance algorithms on the dynamic performance of the vehicle

This pilot study examines one feature of a videoconferencing system, namely, the view that conferees get of participants in the other location. The current voice-switched (VS) videoconferencing arrangement was compared to a "continuous presence" (CP) system that provides conferees with the simultaneous view of all participants throughout the meeting. Groups met twice, once over each system; the task in each session involved a problem-solving discussion for which an objective measure of solution quality was available. Questionnaires were administered after each experimental session to assess subjects\Â´ opinions about the videoconferencing systems, as well as their perceptions of the nature, style, and outcome of the group interaction. Results based on the objective measure of solution quality show an advantage for CP over VS that is statistically significant. Questionnaire responses indicate large and significant preferences for CP for all items in which the two systems are directly compared. There are also significant differences for some items involving evaluations of a single system at a time; that is, the CP interaction is perceived to have more of the feel of a face-to-face meeting, to be more efficient, and to be somewhat friendlier. These latter differences are attributable, however, to implicit comparisons between the two systems after both have been experienced.

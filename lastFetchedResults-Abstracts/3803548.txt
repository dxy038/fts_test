Measurements of ``normal,´´ neuromuscular finger tremor acceleration in healthy adults were made and then analyzed by power spectra and correlation techniques. These techniques from random-signal analysis offer objective methods by which tremors may be described and compared quantitatively. Measurements of this type may provide useful information in evaluating surgical and medical treatments of Parkinson´s disease; furthermore, if relations between tremor phenomena and certain physiological and pathological states are established, these techniques will have diagnostic value. Some interesting and useful results evolved from this study; the power density spectra, autocorrelograms, and cumulative power spectra of the tremor measurements are presented and discussed.

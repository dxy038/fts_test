This paper presents a result of crossover analysis between HY-2 and Jason-2 mission over ocean. The major objectives of this paper are to assess HY-2 IGDR (Interim Geophysical Data Record) derived SSHs by comparing HY-2 measurements with the reference mission Jason-2, and further to illustrate the potential of HY-2 data in monitoring global sea level variability. The instrument-independent models and data are applied for both HY-2 and Jason-2 to correct the errors including range delays and geophysical effects, thus provide an objective assessment. All the results indicate a good performance of HY-2 measurements. A standard deviation of 6.6 cm and a bias of 0.26 cm between HY-2 and Jason-2 SSHs (Sea Surface Height) is acquired from 50&#176;S to 50&#176;N which is close to the Jason-1 and Jason-2 performance. The results suggest that a promising situation in terms of HY-2 observations.

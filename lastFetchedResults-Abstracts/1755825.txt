Disaster relief logistic planning plays an important role in Iran, as an accident-prone country, to provide service to the damaged regions. A multi-objective planning model is discussed in this research to locate temporary inventories in damaged regions for distribution of relief goods. The considered parameters in this study such as relocation cost of goods, demand amount of damaged regions and supply amount of supply centers have been considered as fuzzy numbers. The model has two main goals; 1- minimizing the cost of start-up, relocation between supply centers, temporary inventories and damaged regions, 2- maximizing total demand ratios due to keep fairness in goods distribution. In this research a genetic algorithm and a simulated annealing algorithm have been presented to solve the model. These algorithms have been compared with the exact solution of Lingo software for small size problems. In addition, these two meta-heuristic algorithms have been investigated and compared based on their performance for large size problems. The calculation results demonstrate the importance and performance of the designed model for real problems. Ultimately, a case study has been considered for Southern Khorasan as one of the most accident-prone provinces of Iran.

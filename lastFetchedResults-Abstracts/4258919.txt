This paper introduces a new vector evaluated multi-objective optimization algorithm. The vector evaluated differential evolution particle swarm optimization (VEDEPSO) algorithm is a hybridization of the classical vector evaluated particle swarm optimization (VEPSO) and vector evaluated differential evolution (VEDE) algorithms of Parsopoulos et. al. Comparisons of VEDEPSO with respect to VEPSO and VEDE on a well known multi-objective benchmark problem set indicated that significant performance improvements can be attributed to the VEDEPSO algorithm.

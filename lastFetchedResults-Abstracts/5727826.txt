This paper discusses a simple control scheme for an anti-resonance hybrid power factor correction capacitor bank in low-voltage industrial power systems. Conventional power factor correction capacitors are prone to failure due to high voltage and current caused by parallel and series resonance with the system inductance. Load current harmonics and source voltage harmonics are causes of resonance when they match the system resonance frequency. Moreover, the system parameters are dynamically changed; therefore, harmonic resonance might occur even if it had been studied before the capacitor installation. Resonance current flowing through the capacitor, as well as through the power source can be damped by using an antiresonance hybrid capacitor system. The main objective here is to suppress resonance current by applying a simple and effective control scheme to the hybrid power factor correction capacitor system. Simulation results verify the viability and effectiveness of the proposed system for reactive power compensation and any harmonic resonance elimination.

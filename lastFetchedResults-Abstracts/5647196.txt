A miniature hyper-spectral camera which gains data cube after computational information processing is presented. A data cube is composed of two-dimensional visual picture as well as one-dimensional spectral information closely related to the biochemical characteristics of the specimen observed. Thereby this design possesses plentiful promising applications in biomedical imaging, food security surveillance, detection of counterfeited cultural relic and so on. Besides, compared to conventional imaging spectrometers, this design is fairly small and compact with only two optical elements. The wavelength is from 450 nm to 1000 nm with the spectral resolution approximately 5 nm, and the focal length is 163 mm, the objective numerical aperture is 0.1. In this paper, the seidel aberration theory of optical design is firstly discussed based on the core optical element-curved prism. Then the optical layout and image evaluations are illuminated respectively.

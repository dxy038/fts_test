Two hundred sixty-eight anatomically designed shoulder arthroplasties for primary osteoarthritis were reviewed at a mean follow-up of 30 months. The Constant score adjusted for age and sex was 38% preoperatively and 97% at follow-up. Good or excellent results were observed in 77% of patients, and 94% were satisfied or very satisfied. Mean active forward elevation was 145Â° postoperatively, and all clinical parameters improved. Glenoid radiolucent lines were present in 58% of cases and were associated with a less satisfactory objective result. Postoperative active forward elevation, strength, and Constant score were inversely related to a tear of the supraspinatus or fatty degeneration of the infraspinatus. Patients who underwent biceps tenodesis had better pain relief. Complications occurred in 8.6% of cases, and 4.9% of shoulders required reoperation. Good early results can be obtained with nonconstrained shoulder arthroplasty in primary osteoarthritis. (J Shoulder Elbow Surg 2002;11:11-8.)

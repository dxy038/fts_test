This paper presents an efficient Ant colony Optimization technique for solving non-convex optimal power flow problems with considering transmission security. The ANT Colony Optimization is a metaheuristic approach for solving hard combinatorial optimization problems. The objective of OPF is defined that not only to minimize total generation cost but also to enhance transmission security, to reduce transmission loss, to improve the bus voltage profile under normal as well as contingent states. Moreover, the valve-point loading effect on thermal units has been taken into consideration. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated for IEEE-30 Bus including valve-point loading effect. The proposed approach result has been compared to those which reported in the literature.

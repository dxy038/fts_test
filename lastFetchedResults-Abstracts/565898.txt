Background and Objective: Date-palm fruit is an important horticultural fruit in Iran with a high nutritive value due to its contents of minerals, sugars, vitamins and antioxidant compounds. In this research the effects of drying process on phenolic-compounds content and antioxidant properties of two common date varieties in Kerman Province, Iran, namely, Mazafati and Kaluteh, were investigated. 
Materials and Methods: Two common date varieties in Kerman province, Iran, namely, Mazafati and Kaluteh, were chosen. They were dried by 2 methods – sun-drying and oven-drying at 500, 600, 700 and 800 C. The phenolic content was measured by the Folin–Ciocalteau method and the antioxidant activity by reducing-power assay, total antioxidant capacity, and DPPH methods.
Results: The drying process causes a decrease in phenolic compounds in comparison with fresh dates. The reductions in both total phenolic-compounds content and total antioxidant activity increased by increasing the drying temperature. The highest and lowest contents of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity were found in the sun-dried and oven-dried (at 800 C) samples, respectively. The Mazafati variety had a higher content of phenolic compounds (780 mg galic acid/100 g dry weight) and a higher antioxidant activity (35% radical scavenging DPPH) than the Kaluteh variety (720 mg galic acid/100 g dry weight and 28% radical scavenging DPPH, respectively). Keeping date fruits at a constant temperature for a long period also led to decreases in the phenolic-compounds content. 
Conclusion: Drying process results in decreases in phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of dates; the higher the drying temperature, the higher in losses in phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity.

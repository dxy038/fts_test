Programmable networks allow third parties to dynamically reprogram switches and routers in order to extend their functionality. This approach facilitates new capabilities such as dynamic reallocation of resources, automated healing from malfunctions and failures, customized information processing, and easier service creation. These capabilities enable rapid customization of the network by providing mechanisms to adapt to new applications such as multimedia, multicast, intrusion detection, and intranet firewalls. We describe IntelÂ´s framework for programmable networks, known as Phoenix. The objective of the Phoenix framework is to make it easier to deploy new network services that leverage the emerging trend toward use of reprogrammable network processors. To accomplish this goal the Phoenix framework defines an extensible mobile agent system and a set of device functionality abstractions for utilizing and extending network capabilities. We also discuss how the open interfaces provided by the Phoenix framework can be utilized to deploy new network services

In MPLS/GMPLS networks, a range of restoration schemes are required to support different tradeoffs between service interruption time and network resource utilization. In light of these tradeoffs, path-based, end-to-end shared restoration provides a very attractive solution. However, efficient use of capacity for shared restoration strongly relies on the selection procedure of restoration paths. We propose an efficient path-selection algorithm for restoration of connections over shared bandwidth in a fully distributed GMPLS architecture. We also describe how to extend GMPLS signaling protocols to collect the necessary information efficiently. To evaluate the algorithmÂ´s performance, we compare it via simulation with two other well-known algorithm on a typical intercity backbone network. The key figure-of-merit for restoration capacity efficiency is restoration overbuild, i.e., the extra capacity required to meet the network restoration objective as a percentage of the capacity of the network with no restoration. Our simulation results show that our algorithm uses significantly less restoration overbuild (63-68%) compared to the other two algorithms (83-90%).

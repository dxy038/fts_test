This paper proposes a novel speech recognition and colour sensing technique based on Formant frequency and Euclidean distance analysis for embedded systems. In this paper Formant frequencies are used as acoustic features for speech recognition. The objective of this paper is to present the design of an embedded system that will be helpful for the physically impaired individuals in their day to day life. The complete system consists of three subsystems, the speech recognition system, a central controller and the robotic arm. In the time to come, it is anticipated that speech recognition systems will play a major role as man-machine interface to control robots in manufacturing industries, healthcare, entertainment etc. Formal modeling and Matlab simulation approach is used as a robust foundation for developing real-time and embedded applications. The experimental and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm makes a good balance between the computational complexity and recognition accuracy, and thus is more useful for embedded systems.

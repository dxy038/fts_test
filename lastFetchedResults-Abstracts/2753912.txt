TanDEM-X is a spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mission, whose goal is the generation of a global digital elevation model with unprecedented accuracy, by using SAR interferometry. One of the main parameters for asserting the quality of interferometric products is the coherence between the monostatic and bistatic images. The objective of this letter is to present the first global mosaics of the interferometric coherence generated from the TanDEM-X quicklook data set, achieving a resolution down to 25 &#215; 25 ma. This is an improvement in terms of details by several orders of magnitude, with respect to the previously implemented techniques for monitoring the global TanDEM-X interferometric coherence. Critical performance areas are separately analyzed, focusing on the developed approach for optimizing the acquisition strategy, in order to achieve the final mission requirement. Moreover, TanDEM-X mosaics of the interferometric coherence show to be a promising starting point for land classification on a large scale. Finally, they represent a valuable input for the whole SAR community, allowing for the recognition of suitable test areas for further scientific purposes.

We propose a group handover scheme for multiaccess networks that uses adjusted delay to reduce the number of handover blockings that occur during group handover. In a group handover, many users simultaneously start the handover process, which causes network congestion and increases the number of handover blockings. In the proposed scheme, each user in the group handover selects a base station (BS) on the basis of the remaining bandwidth of the BS at that time and initiates the handover process after adjusted delay. To find a strategy for selecting BSs, an optimization problem whose objective is to minimize the probability that handover blocking will occur is formulated, and a solution is derived by using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition. Through performance analysis and simulation results, we show that the probability that handover blocking will occur during group handover is less in our proposed scheme than in a conventional scheme.

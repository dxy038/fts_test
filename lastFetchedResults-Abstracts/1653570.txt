Magnetorheological (MR) dampers are semi-active devices that can be used to control the response of civil structures during seismic loads. They are capable of offering the adaptability of active devices and stability and reliability of passive devices. One of the challenges in the application of the MR dampers is to develop an effective control strategy that can fully exploit the capabilities of the MR dampers. This study proposes two semi-active control methods for seismic protection of structures using MR dampers. The first method is the Simple Adaptive Control method which is classified as a direct adaptive control method. By using this method, the controlled system is forced to track the response of the system with desired behavior. The controller developed using this method can deal with the changes that occur in the characteristics of the structure because it can modify its parameters during the control procedure. The second controller is developed using a genetic-based fuzzy control method. In particular, a fuzzy logic controller whose rule base determined by a multi-objective genetic algorithm is designed to determine the command voltage of MR dampers. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, the performances of semi-active controllers are compared with some other control algorithms in a numerical example. Results reveal that the developed controllers can effectively control both displacement and acceleration response of the considered structure.

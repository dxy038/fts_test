This paper presents experimental results on the induced common-mode (CM) voltages in a residential low-voltage power installation (LVPI) networks exposed to electromagnetic fields from lightning. The objective of this investigation was to find out the severity of induced voltages in a low voltage network due to direct coupling of the lightning electromagnetic fields with the network in the absence of transient overvoltages coming through the distribution lines. Flashes at a distance of about 25 km produced many induced-voltage pulses as large as 100 V, six such pulses in a time period of 0.4 ms in a negative CG flash, and 11 such pulses in a time period of 3 ms in a CC that immediately followed the ground flash

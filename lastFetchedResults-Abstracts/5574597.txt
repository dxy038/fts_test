Local Positioning Systems (LPS) based on acoustic transducers (mainly ultrasonic) offer accurate localization in indoor environments. However, their performance is limited by transducersÂ´ frequency band and emission pattern. This paper shows how current accuracies can be improved through the use of broadband omnidirectional transducers, methods for orientation- independent accurate ranging and bidirectional emissions. We present the 3D-LOCUS LPS system that minimizes environmental effects such as temperature and air flows, attaining localization errors below 9 mm with a 90% confidence level in an area of 4 m2.

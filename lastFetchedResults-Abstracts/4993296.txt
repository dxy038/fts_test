This work presents two analytical models for the traffic signal control problem within dynamic traffic assignment framework. The bi-level formulation is based on a Stackelberg Duopoly game where the upper level objective is to determine optimal signal timing plans with the lower level representing a dynamic user equilibrium conditions. In addition, a single level system optimal model is proposed. Cell transmission model is adapted as the embedded traffic flow model in the form of a mathematical program. The single level program is solved and tested on a network containing multiple signalized intersections. It is found that the proposed model performs better than pre-timed signal timing plans.

Nowadays, the need of temperature control at home is significantly demanded as the current controller used in buildings are not efficient and enough flexible to be adapted to any changes. In this research, we are focused on controlling two actuators (i.e., air-conditioner and window) using a PID controller and a hybrid controller during the summer season. We model the home temperature control (HTC) system, which is applied to monitor the desired room temperature all the times with optimal resource cost. The objective of this research is to investigate how the PID controller and the hybrid controller maintain the desired room temperature with only two actuators and minimal resource cost. In addition, we also aim to develop the practical application of cyber-physical system (CPS) for HTC system. Through MATLAB/Simulink simulation, we study and verify our proposed CPS-based HTC system.

Reliable, accurate and appropriate tests in the field of electromagnetic drives, especially for the power converter controlled applications, have become more and more important in terms of efficiency or fault free operation. The high requirements on the electrical measuring instrumentation to be used, due to increasing switching frequencies and shortened rise times, are discussed and techniques to ensure meaningful results are described. The further objective of this paper is to present applications for obtaining useful conclusions with special respect to a new approach of dynamic electromagnetic torque investigations on an extremely wide range of AC machines without the use of mechanical sensors. Practical measurements are shown

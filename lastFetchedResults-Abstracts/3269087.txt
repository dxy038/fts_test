The future of safe and reliable electrical power supply will not be based on fossil resources. Thus, sustainable electric power generation as well as their transmission and distribution gain more and more attention. Especially in Germany, this leads to a steadily increasing level of renewable energies. Due to a significant part of the electrical power generation shifts into the medium and low voltage levels. Their increasing importance to the electrical power supply requires a new way of energy distribution management. This paper outlines a solution for an energy distribution management system for medium and low voltage levels, focusing on bidirectional, vertical power flow between medium and high voltage levels. Control concepts for storages and distributed energy resources are outlined. Based on numerical case studies the characteristics of the developed energy management system were analyzed. It is shown, that a desired power flow between grid levels can be realized, without creating critical grid situations.

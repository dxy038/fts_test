The balance beam as a device to assist in the instruction of automatic control courses is described. The system consists of two water tanks placed on the ends of a balance beam. The control objective is to move the beam to a given reference angle. The control action is provided by a pair of water pumps that can change the distribution of water between the tanks. A set of experiments are designed to help students conceptualize the tasks of modeling, system identification, the use of model linearization techniques, and the design of state feedback controllers and state observers

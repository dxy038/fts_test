This paper reports the results of the UNIZG-FER team in the third European Robotics Challenge (EuRoC). More precisely, the results of the 1st qualifying stage of the challenge where a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) is tested in realistic simulation scenarios. The paper presents the entire controller setup, starting from the power distribution level, low level cascade controllers with wind disturbance rejection to high level obstacle avoidance algorithms. The proposed controllers were tested in realistic simulations environments where their effectiveness was evaluated based on objective criteria set by the challenge organizers.

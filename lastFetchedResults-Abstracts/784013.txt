Objective The aim of this study was to examine the
psychosocial correlates of various crime types among
adolescent males born in Finland in 1981.
Methods Data on crime registered in the Finnish National
Police Register between 1998 and 2001 were received for
2,866 boys, of whom 81% (n = 2,330) filled in a questionnaire
at obligatory military call-up at age 18 in 1999.
Crime was divided into five types: drug, violent, property,
traffic, and drunk driving offences.
Results Of the 2,866 boys, 23% had been registered for
offending; 4% for drug, 7% for violent, 11% for property,
11% for traffic, and 5% for drunk driving offences during
the 4-year period in late adolescence. All the crime types
correlated with each other and shared many of the psychosocial
problems. Small community size, parentsâ€™ divorce,
aggressiveness, daily smoking, and weekly drunkenness
were generic correlates of crime, being independently related
to various crime types.
Conclusions The results support general rather than specific
accounts of youth crime. In particular, measures
moderating the adverse effects of divorce, alleviating
parental adversities and supporting parenthood, and tackling
substance abuse seem relevant in social and criminal policy
because they address psychosocial problems characterizing
youth crime in general

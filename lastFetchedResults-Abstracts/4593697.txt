In this paper, the channel predicted by using a ray- tracing simulator is presented and compared to microcellular measurement results performed inside a university campus. For data processing, the conventional beamforming is utilized to compare the directional wideband channel properties of both simulation and measurement results. Ray-tracing algorithm can investigate most of the radio propagation mechanisms. However, there are some scattering effects that are not included. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyze and compare directional wideband channel characteristics such as azimuth-delay spectrum and azimuth-coelevation spectrum from the ray-tracing results with measurements to gain insights on the significant propagation mechanisms in microcell scenarios.

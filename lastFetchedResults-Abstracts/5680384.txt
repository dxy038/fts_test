Camouflaging is an attempt to obscure the signature of a target and sublimate the target in its background frame in terms of co-occurrence matrix texture properties. The objective of this research work is to detect such camouflaged defect. Since the texture similarity between the background and the defect is the premise for accomplishing camouflage, an intensive texture analysis should be able to discriminate defect from its background. In the proposed work we intended to employ Co-occurrence matrix based texture features are computed within the block, a small region of the image. Finally defective portions are detected by cluster analysis and identified through!. Watershed segmentation. Several experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed model to spot camouflaged defects. Experimentation on the synthetic and real images corroborates the potential of the method.

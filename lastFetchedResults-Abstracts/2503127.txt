
Background and objective: Diaper dermatitis is referred to the inflammation in outer layers of the skin in the perineal area, lower abdomen, and inner thighs. The lesions are maculopapular and usually itchy, which could cause bacterial or candida infection, and predispose the infants to penis or vaginal and urinary infection and lead to discomfort, irritability, and restlessness. The drugs which have been so far administered for this disease (topical steroids) cause special complications for the sensitive skin in this area. Magnesium (Mg) is known for its anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties. The aim of the present study was to study the effect of the cream containing Mg on treatment of diaper dermatitis and diaper rash in children. Methods: In this clinical trial study, 64 children aged less than two years old with diaper dermatitis referring Pediatric Ward of Hajar Hospital were randomly assigned to two groups of 32. Group one was treated with the combined cream Mg and Calendula and group two with Calendula cream alone. The duration of recovery was compared between the two groups. Results: The duration of recovery was significantly lower in the intervention group than the control group (P value<0.001), but there was no significant difference in the lesions size and diapersâ€™ number between the two groups. Conclusions: Based on the finding of this study, Mg is effective on treatment of diaper dermatitis and could be used for treating diaper dermatitis and other types of dermatitis.

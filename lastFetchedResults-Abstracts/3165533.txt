A method for beat-by-beat recording of late potentials using adaptive filters is presented. An orthogonal lead set viewed as individual XYZ leads is employed for better detection of late potentials. The use of bidirectional and finite impulse response filters prevent filter ringing at the terminal QRS. Beat-by-beat late potentials detected from patients with ventricular tachycardia indicate the potential of this method, yet optimal filter parameters and quantitative criteria for detecting late potential are to be further investigated.

This paper introduces a new AC/AC multilevel converter for a single-phase inverter with high-frequency isolation and bidirectional power flow capability. The advantage is to provide compact HF isolation, without an additional DC stage and with lower harmonic distortion in the load. Higher efficiency and better dynamic response are possible as well . The topology is based on a high-frequency inverter, a high-frequency transformer and the new AC/AC multilevel converter. A modulation strategy for the commutation of the AC/AC converter switches is presented. Synthesis, simulation and experimental results of the multilevel converter are presented.

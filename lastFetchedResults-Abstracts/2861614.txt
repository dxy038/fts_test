Transmission of one data packet from one node to another without collision is considered as the main task in MAC protocols, although single node transmission is easy compared to many nodes (multi-hop). EML-MAC, is a new TDMA based Medium Access Control MAC protocol, which is designed for general WSN applications to improve the energy efficiency, the main objective of this study is to enhance the existing work of EML-MAC in terms of energy consumption within the multi-hop wireless sensor network. A clustering algorithm, GANG, is used to address this issue. The proposed MAC protocol is further divided into contention based intra-cluster communications, and EML-MAC slot-based inter-cluster communication phases. The trade-offs between energy consumption and time synchronization in a multi-hop environment is controlled and the network life time is increased in EML-MAC GANG protocol.

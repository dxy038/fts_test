In this paper, we consider the cargo mix problem under uncertainty in the container shipping industry. We seek to determine the optimal cargo mix in a multiperiod planning horizon with the objective of maximizing the total expected profit derived from all freight bookings received in the planning horizon. We present a two-stage stochastic integer programming model and propose a heuristic algorithm for multiperiod sea cargo mix problem under uncertainty. Finally, numerical experiments on a wide range of randomly generated problem instances are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm.

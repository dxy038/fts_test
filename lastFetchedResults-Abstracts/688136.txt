Two field experiments were carried out in the irrigated salt-affected (saline-sodic) semi-arid environment of northern Sudan (Khartoum district). The objective was to examine the response of wheat to irrigation frequency and cattle, chicken manure and urea applications. The results obtained indicated that the grain yield of wheat was increased significantly (p≤ 0•01) by decreasing the irrigation interval from 15 to 5 days. The manures applied were found to be more effective in increasing the grain yield than was urea fertilizer. In addition, levels of leaf N, P and K were increased significantly (p≤ 0•01) with fertilizer application. There were no significant effects on leaf levels of Ca and Mg. Increase in irrigation frequency gave a significant increase (p≤ 0•01) in the leaf N but not the P, K, Ca and Mg contents.

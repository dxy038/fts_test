Aims
The study objective was to investigate the effects of axillary lymph node clearance surgery on the function and morphology of the lymphatic system of the upper limb in women with breast cancer.
Methods

Nineteen women were studied before and 3 months after surgery. Fifteen were studied again 12 months after surgery. On each occasion, scintigraphy following intradermal hand webspace injection of Tc-99m-human polyclonal immunoglobulin was performed to include the affected upper limb and torso.
Results

There was considerable functional variability in response to surgery. Seven patients subsequently developed breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). Neither lymph re-routing (defined as a change in lymph vessel morphology or definition) nor linear velocity of protein transit up the arm was associated with the development of BCRL. Blood pool activity, judged from visual inspection of the cardiac blood pool on the whole body images, was earlier and more marked 3 and 12 months after surgery than before. The count rate (per 100 pixels/MBq injected activity), measured in a cardiac region of interest, was significantly higher after surgery than before, was higher in patients who developed BCRL and, in the patient population as a whole, correlated positively with arm swelling.
Conclusion

The consequences of axillary lymph node clearance were variable, unexpected and largely persistent. An increased rate of access of intradermally injected protein into the blood pool is significantly associated with BCRL.

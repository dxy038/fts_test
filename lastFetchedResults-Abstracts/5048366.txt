This paper investigates the integrated control of anti- lock braking system(ABS) and active suspension in vehicle. The control objective for the integrated approach is to reduce braking distance and stop time more than just only ABS, meanwhile the performance of suspension not going to the bad. The half car model with four degrees of freedom of active suspension is established along with an ABS system model. Fuzzy logic controllers are designed and implemented to control these two subsystems. An integrated control algorithm is presented to coordinate the two subsystems. Numerical simulations are carried out to identify the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy logic controller. The results obtained show that the integrated control of ABS and active suspension improves braking performance significantly compared with an ABS system without combining active suspension, on the other hand, the performance of suspension is not sacrificed.

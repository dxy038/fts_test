Interpreting the XML data in a current web into sources that can be used by the Semantic Web has received great attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose a procedure for transforming valid XML documents into RDF by using vocabularies of RDF schema. The first objective here is to obtain classes and properties from labels in XML document exactly by accessing the XML DTD. After that, we can interpret XML data as RDF triples by using some vocabularies of RDF schema. The main advantage of our approach is that it ensures the integrity of the structure and meaning of the original XML documents while transforming them into RDF. This procedure can be used for any kind of valid XML documents.

Experimental evaluation to compare VHF land-mobile FM, adjacent channel single sideband (ACSSB), and SSB systems is conducted. Information such as adjacent and cochannel protection ratios, reuse distances, audio frequency responses, etc., are obtained, and the main factors influencing the calculation of spectrum efficiency in the land mobile bands are determined. In relation to protection ratio measurements, conventional objective and subjective evaluation methods and interference criteria are evaluated. An objective method that produces results similar to the subjective method is derived. Factors influencing the introduction of ACSSB, SSB, or other technologies in the land mobile bands are presented

The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of temperature on anaerobic digestion of different lignocellulosic biomasses such as bamboo dust and saw dust. Bamboo dust and saw dust were mixed with cattle dung in 1:3 ratio in batch type anaerobic digesters of volume 1000 ml at 35&#176;C, 45&#176;C and 55&#176;C temperatures. At five day interval, 10 ml of digested slurry was taken out from the digesters and tested for total solid and volatile solid contents. Effect of temperature on kinetic rate constant was also studied. It was observed that biogas production increases with temperature. The kinetic rate constant plays a significant role to indicate the digestion process.

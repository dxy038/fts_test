Recently, demands for skillful engineers for developing higher application of embedded systems increase in the industry. In both universities and national colleges of technology, the higher education for embedded technology skill has been practiced in Japan. However, the systematization of the curriculum for embedded skill training is an item to be solved. Now, we are working on a project and developing skill standards with both educational contents and the new curriculum in cooperation with 10 national colleges of technology. Main objective of this project is to clarify what kinds of embedded skills should be learned and mastered in national colleges of technology. Here, skill standards have to be defined as a `skill sheet´, and based on the standards, mastered skills by each student have to be visualized to encourage their learning motivation. In this paper, two parts are mainly outlined. One is how to design embedded technology skill standards. And the other is how to construct the skill management system to guarantee student´s skill level for embedded technology.

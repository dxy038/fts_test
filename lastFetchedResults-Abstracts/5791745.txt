The purpose of this paper is the realization of an emulator for electric naval propulsion system. The main objective of an emulator is to reproduce the real system operation. The work consists of two principal parts: the first part concerns the modeling of the propeller and the different resistance forces opposed to the movement of the ship, allowing the estimation of the necessary propulsion power, and the second part presents the emulator of the ship propulsion system, based on the Hardware In the Loop (HIL) principle, using an electric machine operating as a generator to emulate the dynamic characteristic of the ship. The resulting model is validated by numerical simulations and then tested on an experimental test bench constituting the emulator. Different experiments are conducted taking into account the real operation of the ship.

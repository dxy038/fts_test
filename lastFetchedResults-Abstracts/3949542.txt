In this paper, an integrated simulation-optimization approach is proposed for annual planning of power restoration workforce related to an electricity distribution company in a province of Canada. Internal and external workforces are employed to perform maintenance actions and restore power after interruptions throughout the province. According to the electricity distribution network, the province is divided into a number of work locations (WL), each having local crews to perform maintenance actions and fix power interruptions. However, determining the size of the crew in each WL over the year is challenging because of high fluctuation in interruption frequency and consequently in projected demand during the year. The frequency of interruptions is affected by various factors such as geographical location, time calendar, and particularly weather conditions. The objective is to determine the optimal combination of internal and external workforce over the year to cover the interruptions across the province with minimum cost and minimum customer interruption duration.

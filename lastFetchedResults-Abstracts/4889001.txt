Web services have received much interest to support business-to-business or enterprise application integration but how to combine these services optimally in a continually growing search space is always a challenge. When there are a large number of Web services available, it is not easy to find an execution path of Web services composition that can satisfy the given request, since the search space for such a composition problem is in general exponentially increasing. In this paper, we design a Multi-objective Bees algorithm to solve this optimal service selection optimization problem. Bees algorithm helps to navigate through the whole search space. Web service data can be queried and a new subspace is built for each loop from which feasible solution can be calculated. Though global optimization cannot be guaranteed, an optimal solution can be obtained as a result.

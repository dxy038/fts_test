The success path monitoring system (SPMS) is an advanced computer-based operator aid which is intended to enhance the operator´s ability to handle plant disturbances effectively. It achieves this by providing an online assessment of both the status of critical safety functions and the status of appropriate success paths. A prototype version of SPMS has been implemented on the Halden Project´s PWR (pressurized water reactor) simulator, the objective being to test the SPMS in a realistic situation and to assess whether it performs in accordance with design expectations. Sixteen reactor operators were observed coping with complex transient scenarios both with and without SPMS being available. Results clearly showed the advantages of SPMS, in terms of both speed and accuracy of operator performance.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

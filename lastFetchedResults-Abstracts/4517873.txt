The Ground Test Accelerator (GTA) had the objective of producing a high-brightness, high-current H<sup>-</sup> beam. The major components were a 35 keV injector, a Radio Frequency Quadrupole, an intertank matching section, and a drift tube linac, consisting of 10 modules. A technique for measuring the transverse phase-space of high-power density beams has been developed and tested. This diagnostic has been applied to the GTA H<sup>-</sup> beam. Experimental results are compared to the slit and collector technique for transverse phase-space measurements and to simulations

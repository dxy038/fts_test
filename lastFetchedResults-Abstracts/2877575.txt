In this work a differential evolution algorithm is adapted to solve dynamic constrained optimization problems. The approach is based on a mechanism to detect changes in the objective function and/or the constraints of the problem so as to let the algorithm to promote the diversity in the population while pursuing the new feasible optimum. This is made by combining two popular differential evolution variants and using a memory of best solutions found during the search. Moreover, random-immigrants are added to the population at each generation and a simple hill-climber-based local search operator is applied to promote a faster convergence to the new feasible global optimum. The approach is compared against other recently proposed algorithms in an also recently proposed benchmark. The results show that the proposed algorithm provides a very competitive performance when solving different types of dynamic constrained optimization problems.

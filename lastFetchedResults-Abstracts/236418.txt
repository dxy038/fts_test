Corn gluten meal (CGM) is a major coproduct of corn wet milling; it has value because of high protein. However, variation in
composition and high P content reduce market value. Data that characterize gluten streams would be helpful in identifying key
processing steps that could be modified to improve the quality of CGM and increase processing efficiency. Few data are published in
the literature on the detailed composition of gluten processing streams. The objective was to characterize the gluten process streams
in a corn wet milling plant.
Samples were obtained from one plant over a six month period and analyzed for dry matter (DM), total N (protein), ash and
elements. DM and macroelement content of the streams were increased significantly during processing. Ash, priority pollutant
elements and microelement concentrations were low and of little concern. About 38% of the N (protein) in light gluten was not
recovered in the CGM; most of this was lost at the gluten thickener step into the gluten thickener overflow. Much of the P also was
removed at this step. Modification of the gluten thickener overflow to increase N and reduce P could make CGM a more valuable
coproduct and improve processing efficiency

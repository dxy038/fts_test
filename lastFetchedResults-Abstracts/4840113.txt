Diversity maintenance is an important aspect in population-based metaheuristics for optimization, as it tends to allow a better exploration of the search space, thus reducing the susceptibility to local optima in multimodal optimization problems. In this context, metaheuristics based on the Artificial Immune System (AIS) framework, especially those inspired by the Immune Network theory, are known to be capable of stimulating the generation of diverse sets of solutions for a given problem, even though generally implementing very simple mechanisms to control the dynamics of the network. To increase such diversity maintenance capability even further, a new immune-inspired algorithm was recently proposed, which adopted a novel concentration-based model of immune network. This new algorithm, named cob-aiNet (Concentration-based Artificial Immune Network), was originally developed to solve real-parameter single-objective optimization problems, and it was later extended (with cob-aiNet[MO]) to deal with real-parameter multi-objective optimization. Given that both cob-aiNet and cob-aiNet[MO] obtained competitive results when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for continuous optimization and also presented significantly improved diversity maintenance mechanisms, in this work the same concentration-based paradigm was further explored, in an extension of such algorithms to deal with single-objective combinatorial optimization problems. This new algorithm, named cob-aiNet[C], was evaluated here in a series of experiments based on four Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs), in which it was verified not only the diversity maintenance capabilities of the algorithm, but also its overall optimization performance.

This paper deals with the structural shape optimization of prismatic folded plates under buckling load consideration. Buckling loads are determined using linear, quadratic and cubic, variable thickness, C(0) continuity, Mindlin-Reissner finite strips. The whole structural optimization process is carried out by integrating finite strip analysis, cubic spline shape and thickness definition, semi analytical sensitivity analysis and mathematical programming algorithm. The objective is either the maximization of the critical buckling load or minimization of the cross-section of the prismatic folded plate with constraints on the volume and buckling loads. Several examples are included to illustrate various features of the optimization algorithm, including plates and stiffened panels.

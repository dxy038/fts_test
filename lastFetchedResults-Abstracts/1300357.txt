Suhravardiand Mull? Sadr? who have proved the theory of Ideas or Forms by following Plato have asserted that the Platonic Ideas or Forms are the cause of matter and the indivuals of each material kind. As regards the fact that the Imaginal World (objective realities independent and disconnected from man) is the intermediate between two other worlds (linear Intellects and Matter), is it the cause of matter and it'sindiviulas? The authors in this essay have tried to answer this important question. It has been proved regarding the similarity between cause and effect (ontological homogeneity) and Mull? Sadr?â€™s view on empirical and imaginative knowledge that the Imaginal World (not the Intellectuall Ideas) is the cause of Matter. So the Ideas and Forms in the Imaginal World are the cause of matter and they are the effects of the intellectullal Ideas.

There are several hormones and local testicular factors involved in the initiation and control of steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis during puberty. GH and its mediator, IGF-I, increase substantially during puberty, and in addition to LH, these growth-promoting hormones can have direct effects upon testicular function. The objective of this work was to investigate the effects of eLH, eGH and hrIGF-I upon Leydig cells derived from testes of colts and stallions representing different stages of development. Testes were obtained from 48 light horse colts and stallions at the time of routine castration, horses were categorized according to age group (prepubertal, pubertal and postpubertal) and a Leydig cell enriched preparation was utilized for cell culture. Cells derived from all 48 horses were treated with doses of eLH, and a subset of 21 horses received doses of eGH and hrIGF-I. Cells were plated at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml and incubated for 24 h at 32 °C. Production of testosterone and estradiol was measured by validated RIA. Leydig cells from prepubertal colts secreted greater basal amounts of testosterone but lesser basal amounts of estradiol compared with the other age groups (p &lt; 0.001). Pubertal stallions exhibited the greatest relative response to eLH (p &lt; 0.05). Neither eGH nor hrIGF-I elicited a steroidogenic response over baseline concentrations in any of the three age groups.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Rosa damascena Mill is from Rosacea family which has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. The effects of petal’s hydro-alcoholic extract of Rosa damascena Mill were examined on the trachea, aorta and uterus of Wistar rats in this study.
METHODS: This experimental study was conducted on forty male Wistar rats randomly divided  into five groups of eight  including control group, the groups receiving 0.5, 0.75 and %1 doses of Rosa damascena Mill extract with the presence and absence of calcium chloride. Isometric contraction was recorded by adding KCl to smooth muscle with stability device. After reaching the pan state, the effects of saline and cumulative concentrations of extracts were recorded and the percentage changes were calculated.
FINDINGS: Cumulative extract of Rosa damascena Mill (0.5, 0.75 and 1?g/m) dependent on dose caused the rat’s trachea, aorta and uterus contractions (p < 0.05). The contractions of cumulative extract of Rosa damascena Mill were 54± 2/37, 96±3/32 and 62±2/17 in aortic smooth muscle, trachea and uterus, respectively with the presence of 60mM calcium chloride.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that Rosa damascena Mill increased the trachea, aorta and uterus contractions. Therefore it should be used with caution in patients suffering from asthma, dysmenorrhea or hypertension

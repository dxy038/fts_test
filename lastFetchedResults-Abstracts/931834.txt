Listeria monocytogenes is the causal agent of listeriosis, a disease that can be serious and is often fatal in susceptible individuals. The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of Listeria spp. in raw chicken and ready-to-eat (RTE) chicken products in Amman, Jordan and the antimicrobial resistance of L. monocytogenes isolates. A total of 280 raw chicken and RTE chicken products (chicken-shawirma, chicken-burger, chicken-sausage and mortadella) were collected from Amman abattoir and local retail markets in Amman city. Listeria spp. were isolated by the conventional International Organization for Standardization (ISO) method and L. monocytogenes identified by biochemical and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Results of conventional method showed that out of total 280 samples, 141 (50%) were found to be contaminated with Listeria spp. [L. monocytogenes (18.2%), Listeria ivanovi (26.1%), Listeria grayi (3.5%), Listeria seeligeri (1.8), Listeria welshimeri (0.7%)]. The PCR confirmed all L. monocytogenes isolates (51 isolates: 15 from raw dressed broiler chicken, 23 from chicken-burger, 9 from chicken-sausage, and 4 from chicken-shawirma). Five of the tested L. monocytogenes isolates were resistance to two antibiotics (tilimicosin and tetracycline) among the ten tested antibiotics as determined by microbroth dilution method. The results presented in this study indicate the potential risk of contamination of RTE chicken products with L. monocytogenes.

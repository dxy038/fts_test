In this study for prediction of meter factor, the bidirectional pipe prover performance has been simulated by CFD techniques in two velocities 2 and 3 m/s for kerosene and two types of crude oil. Because of moving boundary condition, the simulations has been done with dynamic meshes. In the first stage of the simulation to have fully developed flow in the calibration section the prover pipe has been investigated without sphere, next simulations has been repeated with ball in flow through the prover but with same conditions at the first stage. To achieve the lowest possible error, several simulation was conducted with two turbulence models: standard k- and k-. For validation, the CFD calculated pipe friction coefficient has been compared with empirical relations. The velocity distribution has been discussed for output section pipe and around the ball in prover. The results show the effects of Reynolds number variation on meter factor is ignorable. Although this work illustrates the CFD simulations is an inexpensive powerful tool for evaluation of prover performance. Also these simulations can be used for design of provers and determination of detectors positions and so on.

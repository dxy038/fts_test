ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Calcifying odontogenic cyst is an uncommon developmental cyst. It accounts for only 1% of jaw cysts and uncommonly occurs with odontoma. Herein, we report a case of calcifying odontogenic cyst, associated with complex odontoma.
CASE REPORT: The patient was a 12-year-old girl with complaints of painless swelling in the mandibular first premolar. In radiographic examination, a radiolucent-radiopaque lesion was reported. The lesion, as well as the impacted tooth, was surgically removed via enucleation. In pathological analysis, an odontogenic cyst with ghost cells and complex odontoma was observed. Enucleation was performed for treatment and no recurrence was reported during the one-year follow-up.  
CONCLUSION: Clinical and radiographic findings of odontogenic lesions are not exclusive. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the fact that the type of lesion associated with Gorlin cyst determines the clinical course, treatment, and prognosis of complex lesions. 
KEY WORDS: Calcifying Odontogenic Cyst, Ghost Cells, Gorlin Cyst, Complex Odontoma.

Vehicles stopping on river-crossing bridge to wait for green signal do harm to the bridge. Based on the investigation and data analysis of the Global Bridge in Ganzhou, two solutions were proposed to control two intersections at the both ends of the bridge by coordination control and adaptive control based on fuzzy logic. In adaptive method, the phase and green signal time of single intersection were set by fuzzy controller. Then the average delay of vehicles were taken as objective function, the green time of every single intersection was dynamically adjusted, and the phase shift was optimized through genetic algorithm. The queue length and the stopping times of vehicles which pass through the bridge was distinctly reduced by the control way, thus the bridge load was relieved, and transportation efficiency of the bridge was improved. The simulation results show that the coordination control methods were effective.

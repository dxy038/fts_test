Analytic hierarchy process(AHP) and entropy method were used to calculate combination weight vectors for different evaluation indexes, relevancy of different flood disaster sequences were acquired by means of computing relational coefficients of flood disaster sequences and referenced sequence, flood disaster ranks of different flood disaster sequences were obtained. Application on flood disaster evaluation of China during 1998~2009 showed that the comprehensive evaluation system included more comprehensive and objective flood disaster information, the results were correspond to the actual flood situation. The results indicated that comprehensive evaluation system was conciseness and reliability, which had general applicability in flood disaster evaluation and other areas.

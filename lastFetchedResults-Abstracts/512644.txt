This monograph on the role of guidance counsellors in School Based Assessment of Universal Basic Education explored the counselling features of the 6:3:3:4 curriculum such as multiple entry and exit phases, monitoring, functionalism and continuous assessment. It also explored the origin of the school based assessment; the difference between it and the current concept of continuous assessment and the functions of counsellors in the implementation of the school based assessment. The weaknesses of the previous UPE which failed to achieve its objective were highlighted to promote precautionary measures. The paper ended with recommendations on the necessary changes the government and counsellors can make to neutralize the impression that counselling is the same as advice giving and to realize the counselling objectives of the Universal Basic Education.

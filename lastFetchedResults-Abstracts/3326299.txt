In this paper we propose a novel interpolation method which is a modified the Bi-linear interpolation. The Bilinear interpolation is computationally efficient, but it often generates jaggy-noise around the edges. We deal with the double expansion in this paper. In the case of the double expansion, the accuracy of the interpolation is improved and jaggy noise is disappeared by improving the interpolation method for the interior point. Here, we propose a novel edge-adaptive interpolation method for the interior point. By the experimental results, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified from the subjective and objective points of view.

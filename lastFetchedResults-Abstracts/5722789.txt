It is known that the total currents flowing in a given circuit may be decomposed into differential or transmission mode currents and common or antenna mode currents. The second ones are generally supposed to be the main source of emission problems related within PLC. In this paper the main objective of the authors is to analyze the frequency dependence of antenna mode currents in a PLC unbalanced circuit. The unbalance is a result of a changing the circuit from symmetrically to asymmetrically driven. Of interest is the relationship between the change of the amount of antenna mode currents due to source asymmetry and the effect on the radiated electric field. The numerical analysis is based on the full-wave theory that is solved by the method of moments. The studied theoretic example is a simple 5m long PLC line placed within a concrete wall structure.

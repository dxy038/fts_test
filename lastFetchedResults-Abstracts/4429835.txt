This paper presents a five-level Neutral-Point-Clamped (NPC) bidirectional converter based on multi-state switching cell (MSSC) operating as boost rectifier for power factor correction applications. Its main features are high power factor, reduced conduction losses, reduced weight and volume, and a bidirectional power flow between the ac and dc sides of the converter. The analysis employs the principle of interleaved converters, as it can be extended to a generic number of legs and high power levels. A theoretical analysis and experimental results from a 3 kW prototype are presented.

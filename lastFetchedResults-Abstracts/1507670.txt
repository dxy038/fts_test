The analysis of ionic micro-contamination is of growing importance in the disc drive industry. Through the use of ion chromatography, cleanliness of drive components can be assessed. An objective to improve quantification of highly reactive inorganic ions that exist within the drive environment was implemented. This paper presents a new extraction technique used to determine low levels of ammonium, by microbore ion chromatography. Various chemical compounds within adhesive formulations can be a source of extractable ammonium. By combining this new extraction method with ion chromatography, the percentage of different chemical compounds within adhesive formulations was correlated to the level of extractable ammonium observed.

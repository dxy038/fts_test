Objective:&nbsp;Recent studies on treating obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) have investigated&nbsp;noninvasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)&nbsp;to improve patients&rsquo; impaired emotion and cognition. However, such experiments have yielded&nbsp;mixed results, especially with respect to cognition. This study aimed to investigate whether&nbsp;anodal and cathodal tDCS applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) would&nbsp;improve decision making and reduce obsession symptoms in patients with OCD.
Methods:&nbsp;the current study is analysis of variance. In this regard, 20 patients with obsessive&nbsp;compulsive disorder (n=20) were randomly assigned to receive either experimental (active) or&nbsp;control (sham) tDCS. To measure cognitive functions, the participants underwent a series of&nbsp;decision making neuropsychological tasks; to measure obsession symptoms, the Yale-brown
obsessive compulsive and Beck anxiety scale (BAI) were used. The parameters of active&nbsp;tDCS included administration of 2 mA for 20 minutes per day for 15 consecutive days, anode&nbsp;electrode over the right DLPFC (F4), and cathode electrode over the left DLPFC (F3) region.
Results:&nbsp;After 10 sessions of anodal and cathodal tDCS, patients showed significant&nbsp;improvement in decision making tasks. The same results were observed for obsession&nbsp;symptoms.
Conclusion:&nbsp;The data were analyzed by SPSS 18.0.0 software, using analysis of variance&nbsp;methods.This study demonstrated that anodal tDCS over left DLPFC, concurrent with cathodal&nbsp;tDCS over right DLPFC, improved cognitive impairment and reduced obsession symptoms in&nbsp;patients with OCD.

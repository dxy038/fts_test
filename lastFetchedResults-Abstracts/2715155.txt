This paper proposes a high-performance &#8220;cycloconverter-type&#8221; high-frequency-link (HFL) single-phase rectifier with an active voltage clamper, which provides bidirectional two-stage galvanic isolation ac-dc power conversion. Modulation strategy, modeling method, and control scheme are comprehensively developed for the HFL rectifier to guarantee its superior performances: 1) two-stage power conversion and soft-switching switch devices lead to high conversion efficiency; 2) complete elimination of voltage spikes during commutation ensures safe operation of high-frequency switching devices; and 3) it can equally function as a high-performance conventional Pulsewidth Modulation (PWM) rectifier: sinusoidal input current, constant dc output voltage, bidirectional power flows between dc side and ac side, and adjustable power factor. A prototype of the proposed HFL rectifier is built for evaluation. The experiment results demonstrate the efficacy of the soft-switching HFL rectifier and its highly promising control performance. The proposed rectifier offers a high-efficiency, high-power-density, and high-performance galvanic isolation power conversion solution to extensive applications.

Objective : To identify Qazvin medical graduates' professional situation.
Methods : A questionnaire was sent to all the students graduated from 1991 till 1997 through a survey. A total number of 98 responses were gathered (of about 480 sent questionnaires).
Findings: Out of these responses , 66 responses belonged to men and 32 belonged to women who consisted of 62 general practitioners, 26 specialists, and 7 residents. The specialists were mostly internists, pediatricians and anesthesiologists. They spent their time as follows: 19.6Â±37.9 hours in visiting patients, 14.26 on teaching, 6.47 on research, 19 on medical - related works, 28.5 on management , 14.7 in studying medical books and journals. Some graduates (about 61%) believed that studying in Qazvin university has nearly prepared them to accept the responsibility to work as a physician. Some graduates didn't file for their patients, while the same number of them didn't agree to in-service training. The majority of graduates agreed to a change in the Health service system and also to limit the acceptance of medical students in universities. Instead, they mostly emphasized the importance of increasing education quality.

THE TERM &#8220;electronic power converter&#8221; needs some definition. The object may be to convert power from direct current to alternating current for d-c power transmission, or to convert power from one frequency into another, or to serve as a commutator for operating an a-c motor at variable speed, or for transforming high-voltage direct current into low-voltage direct current. Other objectives may be mentioned. It is thus evidently not the objective but the means which characterizes the electronic power converter. Other names have been used tentatively but have not been accepted. The emphasis is on electronic means and the term is limited to conversion of power as distinguished from electric energy for purposes of communication. Thus the name is a definition.

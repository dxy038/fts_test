In the past two decades, the use of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) for strengthening structural members has shown to be an effective method, with respect to both structural performance and economic features. This paper presents the results of a study conducted to investigate the feasibility of glue-laminated (glulam) timber columns strengthened with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets. Experimental and computational investigations were conducted on axially loaded glulam timber columns strengthened with FRP. Several parameters such as slenderness ratio, boundary conditions, FRP reinforcement length, and relative cost were considered in this study. The principal aim of this study was to produce data and information for practicing engineers and architects. The main objective was to justify promotion of the use of cost-effective glulam timber components as a viable alternative in structural applications.

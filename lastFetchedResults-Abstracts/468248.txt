Objective: Our purpose was to investigate the course and outcome of pregnancy in women with well-treated Î²-thalassemia. Study Design: Twenty-two pregnancies, including one twin pregnancy, in 19 women were studied. Pregnancy was advised when patients had received a prolonged intensive treatment with hypertransfusions and iron chelation and had echocardiographically normal resting left ventricular performance. All conceptions were spontaneous. Cardiac function, along with hematologic, endocrinologic, and hepatic parameters were initially assessed and monitored throughout pregnancy and for 2 to 9 years post partum. Babies were delivered by elective cesarean section. Results:Twenty-one healthy newborn infants were delivered. A spontaneous abortion and a case of exomphalos also occurred. Gestation, delivery, and recovery were surprisingly uneventful, and no significant cardiac complications were encountered. Conclusion: Pregnancy can be safe for mothers and babies, provided that women with thalassemia have been started early on intensive treatment and have a normal resting cardiac performance.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess the outcome of the type of prescreening counseling on choices for prenatal cystic fibrosis screening.
Study design
From October 2001 to November 2002, regardless of ethnicity, all prenatal patients (n = 855) at the Air Force Medical Genetics Center, Biloxi, Miss, received education on prenatal screening for cystic fibrosis by group genetic counseling either by a presentation by a genetics professional (430 patients) or by a similar audiovisual presentation only (425 patients). A combination pretest/posttest document was used to evaluate learning and served as the consent. Partner testing was recommended for mutation-positive patients.
Results
Fifty-eight percent patients requested screening, of whom 68% were white. Regardless of the type of counseling, patients showed an improvement in knowledge based on pre- and posttest scores. There was no significant difference in choices to undergo screening on the basis of counseling method. Fifteen mutation carriers were identified. Only 6 partners of mutation-positive patients were available and consented to be tested. To date, no infants have been born with cystic fibrosis.
Conclusion
Audio-visual counseling is an effective means to educate patients about genetic screening and does not require a trained genetics professional to administer. Partner testing in mobile populations may prove problematic.

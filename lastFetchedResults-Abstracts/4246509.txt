The ATM Forum defined the sustainable cell rate (SCR) and the burst tolerance (&#964;<sub>s</sub>) in addition to the peak cell rate (PCR) as the parameters to be controlled by the policing function at the UNI for the real-time VBR traffic. Policing shall guarantee &#8220;secure multiplexing&#8221; and at the same time not artificially constrain the traffic that enters the network. We propose to link the determination of the UPC parameters with a dynamic bandwidth allocation protocol developed for perceptual VBR traffic, called the anticipated traffic allocation protocol (ATAP). The main objective is to investigate the impact of the UPC parameters on the QoS of MPEG VBR audio traffic while performing statistical multiplexing. The results give an insight into the importance of this integration (of UPC with bandwidth allocation) and test their sensitivity to the loading conditions and traffic characteristics

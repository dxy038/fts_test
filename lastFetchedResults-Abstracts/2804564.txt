A compact, isolated, current-source based bidirectional solid state transformer (SST) with configurability for supporting low- or medium-voltage DC and AC application is discussed in this paper. More specifically, design considerations and practical implementation techniques for realizing a 50 kVA 3-phase to 3-phase SST are presented. Results from experimental measurements are shown and discussed.

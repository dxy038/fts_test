Introduction & Objective : There are different methods for detection of fetal growth restriction. The most important methods are serial fondal height (SFH), and ultrasonic measurement. The sensitivities and specifities of those methods are vary among different population, so, in a comparative study, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of SFH, a safe and simple method, and Doppler ultrasonography in F.G.R.

Materials & Methods: This study was cross-sectional and we selected 550 pregnant women with growth retardation in physical exam more than 4cm in SFH. So they referred to Doppler ultrasonography. We matched their demographic characters , obstetrics history ,B Mode sonography finding (AFI placental grading)and evaluated in last records of neonatal weight and other records for IUGR. We analyze sensitivity and specificity of SFH and Doppler ulterasonography in detection of IUGR.

Results: The average age was22.5±4.9(16-45), average of Parity was 1.3±0.7(1-11). Prevalence of IUGR in population study was 9.4% and sensitivity and specificity of SFH in detection of IUGR 44.7% ,93.8% respectively with positive predictive value 44.8% and negative predictive value 94.6%, Doppler ultrasonography sensitivity and specificity was 90.9% and 100% respectively.

Conclusion: SFH in detection of IUGR is a valid measurement and drawing growth curve is necessary.

Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L.) is one of the most important medicinal plants in Iran. The main objective of this study was to determine the effects of organic nutrients on the yield and oil content of chamomile. The experiment was conducted in the spring of 2010. The treatment groups consisted of vermicompost (0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 tons/ha) and the Aminol Forte sprays (no spraying or control, at the flowering stage and at budding stage). The experimental design was a factorial experiment based on Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications. The present results showed that the highest flower head diameter, flower yield and essential oil content were obtained when 20  ton/ha vermicompost was used. Effects of Aminol Forte were similar to those seen in vermicompost treatment and all measured traits were seen to be significant after the Aminol Forte spray at flowering stage.

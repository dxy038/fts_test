Single 60-femtosecond laser pulse modification threshold fluences (Phi<sub>th</sub>) of nanometer-thin diamond-like carbon (DLC) films generated by inverse pulse laser deposition (IPLD) show strong dependencies on the film thickness l. Experiments were performed in an ultrahigh precision microscope setup with a high numerical aperture objective (NA = 0.7).

Statistically designed experiments were used to characterize gel vehicles, targeted for use in lithographic inks, which were made using a combination of low molecular weight, low viscosity resin and a high molecular weight, high viscosity resin, along with an aluminum gelling agent and solvent. A combination of a factorial design and a mixture design was used to vary the ratio of the two resins and the other formulation variables. The objective was to develop lithographic gel vehicles covering a range of typical industry properties. The information gained would be used to aid in market development of these resins by providing customers with vehicle formulations having their desired properties at lowest cost. This paper will discuss the statistical design chosen, the analysis of the data collected and the conclusions drawn from the study.

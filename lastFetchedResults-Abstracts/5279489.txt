This paper describes sensors and algorithms developed and used for the creation of coloured 3-D triangular meshes from a set of range images with registered colour measurements. The objective is the creation of a digital model of a real object that is compatible with established computer graphics techniques. Triangular meshes are the fundamental rendering primitive supported by most high performance graphics workstations. The surface colour of objects can be represented by attributing reflectance values to the vertices of the mesh. Such a geometric and reflectance model provides a uniform and general representation for sculptured surfaces with non-uniform colouring

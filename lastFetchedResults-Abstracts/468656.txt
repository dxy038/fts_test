OBJECTIVE: A pilot study was performed to investigate the relationship between vulvar vestibulitis syndrome and estrogen receptor expression.
STUDY DESIGN: Women with a diagnosis of vulvar vestibulitis syndrome had tissue samples taken for vulvar estrogen receptor-α expression and this was compared with a control group.
RESULTS: The study group showed a significant decrease in estrogen receptor expression, and 50% of the samples did not exhibit any receptor expression.
CONCLUSION: There appears to be a subgroup of women with vulvar vestibulitis syndrome who exhibit abnormal estrogen receptor-α expression. This may be helpful in explaining why some women are resistant to medical treatment and may allow treatment to be prescribed more effectively.

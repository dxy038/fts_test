Objective: MiR-302-367 is a cluster of polycistronic microRNAs that are exclusively expressed
in embryonic stem (ES) cells. The miR-302-367 promoter is functional during
embryonic development but is turned off in later stages. Motivated by the cancer stem
cell hypothesis, we explored the potential expression of miR-302 in brain tumor cell lines.
Materials and Methods: In the present experimental study, we have tried to expand
our knowledge on the expression pattern and functionality of miR302 cluster by quantifying
its expression in a series of glioma (A-172, 1321N1, U87MG) and medulloblastoma
(DAOY) cell lines. To further assess the functionality of miR-302 in these cell
lines, we cloned its promoter core region upstream of the enhanced green fluorescent
protein (EGFP) or luciferase encoding genes.
Results: Our data demonstrated a very low expression of miR-302 in glioma cell lines,
compared with that of embryonal carcinoma cell line NT2 being used as a positive
control. The expression of miR-302 promoter-EGFP construct in the aforementioned
cell lines demonstrated GFP expression in a rare subpopulation of the cells. Serum
deprivation led to the generation of tumorospheres, enrichment of miR-302 positive
cells and upregulation of a number of pluripotency genes.
Conclusion: Taken together, our data suggest that miR-302 could potentially be used as
a novel putative cancer stem cell marker to identify and target cancer stem cells within
tumor tissues.

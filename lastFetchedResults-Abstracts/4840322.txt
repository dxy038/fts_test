A terminal´s latency, connectivity, energy and memory are the main characteristics of today´s mobile environments whose performance may be improved by caching. We present an adaptive scheme for mobile Web data caching, which accounts for congestion of the wireless network and energy limitation of mobile terminals. Our main design objective is to minimize the energy cost of peer-to-peer communication among mobile terminals so as to allow for inexpensive Web access when a fixed access point is not available in the communication range of the mobile terminal. We propose a collaborative cache management strategy among mobile terminals interacting via an ad-hoc network. We further provide evaluation of the proposed solution in terms of energy consumption on mobile devices.

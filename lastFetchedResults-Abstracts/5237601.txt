This paper presents the excitation control design of a synchronous generator aimed at voltage regulation in power systems. The design is based on the use of the direct feedback linearization technique. With the help of this technique, a nonlinear output variable is set up which makes the nonlinear model linear versus a new input. Subsequently this new input, which represents the output of a feedback controller, is subsequently used in the nonlinear compensating law which is valid in the whole operating region of the synchronous generator. Numerical simulation shows that the voltage regulation objective is accomplished applying the proposed design.

The objective of discriminant analysis is to use information from the independent variables to achieve the clearest possible separation or discrimination between or among groups, the main task of the present work is to modify the objective functions and make the separation as large as possible. Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis approach is modified to meet the requirement that maximizes the objective function, some computer simulations show that the modified ones can achieve the same results as the previous one.

The goal of an automatically reconfigurable shipboard power system is to prevent self-inflicted damage and to generate and utilize power in an efficient and reliable manner. To achieve this objective, the system must balance response time with decision accuracy. Speed of calculation is achieved by (1) utilizing a more efficient method of calculating optimization parameters and (2) monitoring indicating parameters to decide when to calculate a new system configuration. In addition to these points, recommendations are made regarding methodologies that account for the influence of the gas turbine power plants expected to form the foundation of future electric shipboard power systems.

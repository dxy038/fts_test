In recent years, Wavelet Packet Modulation OFDM (WPM-OFDM) signals have been
introduced for radar applications. Using these signals results in significant properties
such as desired inherent high range resolution and high resistance from radar system
against jamming reception (Electronic Warfare) in radar systems. This paper investigates
into the problem of designing these signals based on the following criteria; constrained
maximization of the detection performance in the presence of colored Gaussian noise and
clutter with the known covariance matrix and constrained minimization of the least
squared error between desired and designed ambiguity functions. In other words, this
issue can be formulated in terms of a non-convex multi-objective optimizing problem. In
order to solve it, at first, the weighted sum method is used to change the original biobjective
problem into a single objective or scalar one. Then, to find the optimal solution,
the particle swarm optimization algorithm, which is simple and computationally efficient,
will be employed.

Objective
ADHD children have anomalous and negative behavior especially in emotionally
related fields when compared to other. Evidence indicates that attention has
an impact on emotional processing. The present study evaluates the effect of
emotional processing on the sustained attention of children with ADHD type C.
Materials & Methods
Sixty participants form two equal groups (each with 30 children) of normal and
ADHD children) and each subject met the required selected criterion as either
a normal or an ADHD child. Both groups were aged from 6–11-years-old. All
pictures were chosen from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS)
and presented paired emotional and neutral scenes in the following categories:
pleasant-neutral; pleasant-unpleasant; unpleasant-neutral; and neutral–neutral.
Sustained attention was evaluated based on the number and duration of total
fixation and was compared between the groups with MANOVA analysis.
Results
The duration of sustained attention on pleasant in the pleasant-unpleasant pair
was significant. Bias in duration of sustained attention on pleasant scenes in
pleasant-neutral pairs is significantly different between the groups.
Conclusion
Such significant differences might be indicative of ADHD children deficiencies
in emotional processing. It seems that the highly deep effect of emotionally
unpleasant scenes to gain the focus of ADHD children’s attention is responsible
for impulsiveness and abnormal processing of emotional stimuli.

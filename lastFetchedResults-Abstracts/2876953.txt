This paper puts forward a proposal for combining multi-operator evolutionary algorithms (EAs), in which three EAs, each with multiple search operators, are used. During the evolution process, the algorithm gradually emphasizes on the best performing multi-operator EA, as well as the search operator. The proposed algorithm is tested on the CEC2014 single objective real-parameter competition. The results show that the proposed algorithm has the ability to reach good solutions.

The main objective of this study is to investigate the concept of “sport commitment” and identify the factors that make it up through the application of exploratory nature of grounded theory. Eleven athletes in shooting, track and field, swimming, football, badminton, and Ping-Pong who were selected for Paralympic and world competition participated in semi-structured interviews for 30-60 minutes. Then, the interviews were transcribed to analyze data.
Open, axial, and selective coding led to the classification of factors and concepts. Analyzing data showed that three factors led to sport commitment including sport enjoyment, get a higher sport ranking, and desire to make up disability. New classification of factors and omission of some effective factors over sport commitment which were found in previous studies make it necessary to pay attention to environmental and Cultural variables as well as native models (patterns).

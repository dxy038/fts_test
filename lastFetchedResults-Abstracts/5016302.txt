The main objective of this paper is to determine the required controlling pulses which control the charging and the discharging operations of the electrostatic MEMS converter. These converters found in the energy scavenging system for wireless sensor nodes. To achieve this objective, a SPICE model for the converter is implemented in order to describe its behavior. Thus the required controlling pulses are determined by simulating the interaction between the converter model and the energy scavenging system

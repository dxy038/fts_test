A* algorithm is an effective algorithm of path planning. In order to speed up the algorithm and reduce the search space, the OPEN table is adopted the fragmentation of hybrid data structure of binary heap and index array. At the same time the coefficient of risk rating is increased, the simulation body can judge straight or bypass the dangerous objects according to the environment, so as not to attack. At the same time, good two-way search stop conditions is set to ensure the effect of the bidirectional search. Relevant tests show that the improved algorithm can effectively solves the problem of path planning in concave terrain faster, and reduces the occupied space.

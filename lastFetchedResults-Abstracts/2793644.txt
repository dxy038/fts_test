CIGS is currently the subject of numerous studies, having shown high efficiencies both in laboratories and in the industry. This material is polycrystalline, and presents strong spatial property fluctuations. It is admitted that these fluctuations impact the global parameters of the cell, either positively or negatively. To better understand the underlying mechanisms, our objective is to experimentally probe the optoelectronic fluctuations at the micrometer scale. To this purpose the luminescence of the cell will be studied, since it contains various information and can be spatially resolved. Local EQE measurements are also performed. Microscale solar cells are used as a tool for the local characterization of Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub>. In the mesa configuration, we study the electrical behavior of sidewall surfaces.

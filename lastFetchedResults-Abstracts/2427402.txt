The objective of this work was to study the applicability of the elastic compliance technique for crack resistance curves evaluation of commercial GLARE laminates using small SE(B) and C(T) specimens. The experimental evaluation of R-curves of 25.0 mm wide SE(B) specimens of unidirectional GLARE 1 3/2 0.3 and 50.0 mm wide C(T) specimens of bidirectional GLARE 3 5/4 0.3 was performed. Fracture toughness was measured through a recently proposed experimental methodology based on standardized specimens and elastic-plastic methodologies (J-integral and CTOD Î´5), whereas crack growth was measured optically and estimated by elastic compliance. According to the results the elastic compliance technique seemed to be applicable to GLARE laminates, accurately predicting stable crack growth during the tests.

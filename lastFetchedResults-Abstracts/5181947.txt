The Technological Application Programs Office (TAPO) is designing a replacement aircraft occupant ballistic protection system (AOBPS) in conjunction with a group of Systems Engineering cadets at the United States Military Academy (USMA). The cadets are to assist TAPO in recommending and developing a replacement Ballistic system for 160th Special Operation Aviation Regiment (Airborne) (SOAR(A)).The objective of the project is to improve or replace the heavy, steel BPS system currently in use on special operations rotary wing aircraft by increasing the survivability of the aircraft, crew, and passengers while retaining a versatile and lightweight system, capable of sustaining multiple round impacts from small caliber weapons at variable ranges and angles of fire. The aircraft must be able to operate in extreme weather and high altitude environments without a significant performance decrease during mission flights due to the presence of BPS. The end state of the project is to provide TAPO with inventive alternatives designed to satisfy all of the objectives and specifications established by TAPO and the Department of Defense. Additional considerations include potential operational environments, personal preferences of both pilots and crew members, and maintenance personnel suggestions. The suggested alternatives are feasible and offer several advantages over the current systems to include replacing the existing ballistic panel with a lighter, more efficient panel. While the floor layout recommendation is to remain the same, a separate installation method using locking pins located at the corners of the ballistic panels would free equipment anchor points, reduce installation time, minimize snagging equipment during loading and unloading, and eliminate installation equipment.

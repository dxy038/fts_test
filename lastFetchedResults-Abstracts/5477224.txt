This paper presents a front end grid connected power converter which is based on a non-regenerative three-level bidirectional-switch VIENNA rectifier. The whole system is controlled by a digital method. The controller is implemented in carrier based PWM strategy. The control method and the simulation are presented. An experimental prototype is built to verify the theoretical analysis and the simulation. The experimental results are given. The switching frequency of the converter is 100 kHz; the efficiency reaches 96.5% at the rated condition. During the wide input range, the THDi value is controlled to be less than 5%.

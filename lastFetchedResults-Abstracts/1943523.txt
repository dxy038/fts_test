The objective of the work was to investigate tolerance to and removal of arsenic by a facultative marine fungus Aspergillus candidus. The fungus showed luxuriant growth in different concentrations (25 and 50 mg/L) of trivalent and pentavalent forms of arsenic. Biomass accumulation data substantiate tolerance of A. candidus towards the test concentrations of trivalent and pentavalent forms of arsenic. Highest arsenic removal (mg/g) was recorded on day 3. As removal increased with an increase in concentration. Hence, the test fungus A. candidus is a promising candidate for arsenic remediation.

The Algorithm To Architecture Mapping Model (ATAMM) is a scheduling strategy for predictable performance in real-time multiprocessor dataflow architectures. The architecture under consideration consists of either heterogeneous or homogeneous processors and implements dataflow models of real-time applications with a cyclo-static assignment scheme. Terminology is developed for graph partitioning, heterogeneous computing, and assignment classifications. A design methodology is described for partitioning dataflow graphs into blocks of nodes (operations) for the purpose of cyclo-static node-to-processor assignment while satisfying a design objective. A theorem is developed and proved to provide cyclo-static assignment of node blocks and illustrated by simulation results

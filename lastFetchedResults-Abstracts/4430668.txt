An existing Mixed Integer Programming optimal sector design method is implemented, analyzed, and improved. The original model is a powerful and convenient method of designing sectors, but frequently produces geometrically undesirable sector shapes. Also, solutions are sensitive to external parameters not related to the flight data that the solutions are based upon. Near-optimal solutions vary drastically with small changes in objective function value. The model is then altered to reduce this sensitivity and produce sector designs with a more favorable geometry. Additionally, a boundary smoothing method is applied that eliminates jagged boundary edges and produces a more realistic and feasible sector geometry.

This paper presents a general scheme to compute ridges on a smooth 2-manifold surface from the standpoint of a vector field. A ridge field is introduced. Starting with an initial ridge, which may or may not be umbilical, a ridge line is then traced by calculating an associated integral curve of this field in conjunction with a new projection procedure to prevent it from diverging. This projection is the first that can optimize a ridge guess to lie on a ridge line uniquely and accurately. In order to follow this scheme, we not only develop practical ridge formulae but also address their corresponding computational procedures for an analytical surface patch, especially for an implicit surface. In contrast to other existing methods, our new approach is mathematically sound and characterized by considering the full geometric structures and topological patterns of ridges on a generic smooth surface. The resulting ridges are accurate in the numerical sense and meet the requirement of high accuracy with complete topology. Although the objective of this paper is to develop a mathematically sound framework for ridges on a smooth surface, we give a comprehensive review of relevant works on both meshes and smooth surfaces for readers.

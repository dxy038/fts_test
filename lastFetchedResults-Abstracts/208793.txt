Background: Overproduction of uric acid by xanthine oxidase (XO) causes gout. XO
inhibitors such as allopurinol, are the most important available anti-gout drugs. Medicinal
plants are available natural sources that may be useful for the treatment of gout.
Objective: In this study, the XO inhibitory activity of aqueous extracts of Phaseolus
vulgaris, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Mentha longifolia, Cichorium intybus, Capparis spinosa
and Trigonella foenum-graecum that their anti-gout effects have been reported in the
literature, were measured.
Methods: In these experiments, under controlled conditions xanthine turns into uric acid by
XO. Uric acid absorbance was measured at 295 nm using a UV spectrophotometer. Adding
allopurinol (as positive control) or aqueous extracts to the solution containing XO, can
decrease uric acid production by inhibition of this enzyme. At first, XO inhibitory activity of
allopurinol and reproducibility of the method were evaluated by conducting three
experiments. After that, the XO inhibitory activity of aqueous extracts at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and
3 mg/ml were measured.
Results: The results showed an EC50= 0.38 Î¼g/ml for allopurinol. The obtained data showed
that Mentha longifolia in compare with its control could inhibit enzyme up to 72% (p< 0.001)
at 3 mg/ml. Maximum XO inhibitory activity of Phaseolus vulgaris at 3 mg/ml in compare
with its control was 27% (p< 0.001). Other extracts did not have any significant effect on XO.
Conclusion: The results showed that part of the anti-gout effects of Mentha longifolia and
Phaseolus vulgaris is due to XO inhibition.

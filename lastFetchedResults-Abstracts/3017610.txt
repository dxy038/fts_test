The challenges specific to interpolation at low video frame rates are illustrated by choosing an algorithm that performs well at high frame rates and applying it to low frame rates. The performance is illustrated by comparing the original algorithm, the algorithm adapted to low frame rate particularities, and simple averaging. To overcome the particular challenges of low frame rates, two algorithms were developed and compared on objective and subjective bases and shown to provide elegant solutions to the specific challenges of low frame rate video interpolation.

One of the grand challenges of the future generation intelligent systems is how to build a robot which can think in a way similar to human beings. In this case, cognitive robotics attempts to embed cognitive abilities of the natural intelligence, specially the human brain, in robotics applications. To provide the context of such an objective, an interdisciplinary approach which is a merger of different fields of study like artificial intelligence, cognitive informatics, psychoanalysis, and neuroscience, should be adopted. In this paper, to design the behavioral mechanism of adventurous robots, the Motivation/Attitude-Driven Behavior (MADB) model, which is a plausible computational model of human behavior with the purpose of simulating robots equipped with basic humanoid emotions, is exploited. As a result, the proposed model has provided adventurous robots with the capability of showing emotional behaviors. Finally, adventurous robots and conventional ones are separately implemented in a virtual ecosystem and their effort for survival is compared. Consequently, the simulation results show that adventurous robots have a greater chance to survive in the simulated environment.

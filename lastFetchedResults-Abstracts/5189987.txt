We present some results about the problem of output regulation for a class of hybrid linear systems. We focus on the class of linear systems and exosystems whose dynamics have jumps according to the value of a clock variable, and we address the problem of designing controllers embedding an internal model of the switching exosystem to achieve the regulation objective. This will lead us to generalize concepts and tools well known in the field of output regulation for continuous-time systems, such as the concept of steady-state response, of regulator equations and the internal model property. The actual results are preliminary steps toward the development of a theory of nonlinear hybrid regulation that is under study by the authors.

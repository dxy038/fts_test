BACKGROUND: Decreases in immune responsiveness with exercise contribute to the increased incidence and severity of infectious disease among elites athletes. The efficacy of this adjuvant strategy for vaccination in humans requires investigation .The objective of this study was to determine whether exercise were associated with altered immune response [IL-2 , IL-6and IFN-y] to influenza vaccine. METHODS: Thirty boy gymnasts (aged 9.8±0.88 years, height 139.19 ±4 cm ,weight 33.79± 7.15kg, and Vo2max=39.82 ±4 ml/kg/min) were categorized into two groups: (l)training -vaccine[TVG], (2) training[TG], and third groups: (3) vaccine[VG]. Then gymnasts performed gymnastic training for of eight weeks and were vaccinated pre and four weeks after training. Cytokines concentrations were measured pre-vaccination and at 4- and 8-week follow-ups. Then Seaim was frozen on -70 until analysis cytokines production. Cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immuneosorbent assay( ELISA). RESULTS: The results demonstrated that, IL-6and IFN-y decrease among three groups ,but IL-2 were not affected by vaccination and training. Then between groups comparing after eight weeks indicated , there are significants different on IL-2 in training-vaccine and vaccine groups and 011 IL-6 in training-vaccine and training groups,but were not significantly different in the three groups on IFN-y . CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that exercise ,vaccine may not influence immune response to influenza immunization. The practice of regular, vigorous exercise was associated with decrease immune response following influenza vaccination in pre pubertal gymnasts.

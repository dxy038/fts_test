This paper investigates the impact of different audio codecs typically deployed in current digital audio broadcasting (DAB) systems and web-casting applications, which represent a main source of quality impairment in these systems and applications, on the quality perceived by the end user. Both subjective and objective assessments are used. Two different audio quality prediction models, namely Perceptual Evaluation of Audio Quality (PEAQ) and Perceptual Objective Listening Quality Assessment (POLQA) Music, are evaluated by comparing the predictions with subjectively obtained grades. The results show that the degradations introduced by the typical lossy audio codecs deployed in current DAB systems and web-casting applications operating at the lowest bit rate typically used in these distribution systems and applications seriously impact the subjective audio quality perceived by the end user. Furthermore, it is shown that a retrained POLQA Music provides the best overall correlations between predicted objective measurements and subjective scores allowing to predict the final perceived quality with good accuracy when scores are averaged over a small set of musical fragments (R = 0.95).

Objective
This study was undertaken to determine why residents choose obstetrics and gynecology.
Study design
Applicants to obstetrics and gynecology residency programs were surveyed; a 5-point scale (5 = most important) was used to rate various aspects of the specialty. Univariate statistics were performed. Bivariate analysis comparing results that were based on gender and timing of decisions was completed with Student t test, Ï‡2, and Kruskal-Wallis tests.
Results
A total of 153 applicants (42% response rate) from 10 programs participated; 85.3% of respondents were female. Surgical opportunities, variety of clinical experience, and fast-paced/high-acuity experiences attract applicants to obstetrics and gynecology. When considering programs, resident camaraderie, gynecologic experience, and commitment to education were most important. Over 70% of residents decided to pursue obstetrics and gynecology during or after their third-year clerkship.
Conclusion
Surgical opportunities and clinical variety appeal to applicants. The majority choose obstetrics and gynecology during or after their core clerkship. In addition, program dynamics are important when choosing a residency.

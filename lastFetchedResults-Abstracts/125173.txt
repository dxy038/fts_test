Objective(s): To assess reproductive risk factors for breast cancer patients in Iran.
Materials & Methods: A case- control study was conducted in Imam university hospital (a large teaching and general hospital) from April 1997 to April 1998. Eligible cases were patients with a pathological confirmation of breast cancer diagnosis. Female patients without any history of breast problems and neoplastic diseases were recruited as controls. Using a short questionnaire demographic data and reproductive related risk factors were collected.
Results: In all, 321 cases and 300 controls were interviewed. In multivariate analysis marital status and age at first pregnancy showed significant increased risk for breast cancer (never married: OR= 3.04, 95% CI= 1.4- 6.4, pregnancy more than 30 years old: 3.1, 95% CI 1.8- 8).
Conclusion: The findings suggest that marital status and age at first pregnancy are the most important reproductive risk factors for breast cancer in Iran.

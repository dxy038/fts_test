This paper presents a method employing the penalty function search algorithm to determine the LC compensator value for the optimal power factor correction in nonsinusoidal systems. The objective of the proposed method is to minimize the transmission loss while the power factor and efficiency are taken as constraints and utilized in order to solve the multiobjective optimization problem by transforming it into a single objective one. Examples show that the load nonlinearity can have a significant impact on optimal compensator sizes.

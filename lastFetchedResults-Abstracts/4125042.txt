Regarding the different capabilities, linear motors have been employed in many applications in industry. Among different linear motors, single-sided linear induction motors (SLIMs) have been widely used due to their simplicity and low construction cost. However, these types of motors suffer from low efficiency and power factor and also, existence of so called end effect. The end effect produces braking force that deteriorates the performance of the motor, especially at high speeds. In this paper, analytical equations are derived for end effect braking force, efficiency, power factor, and output thrust. Employing the derived equations and considering all phenomena involved in the single-sided SLIM, a simple design procedure is presented and the effect of different design variables on the performance of the motor is analyzed. A multiobjective optimization method based on genetic algorithm is introduced to maximize efficiency and power factor, as well as to reduce primary weight and end effect braking force, simultaneously. All effective design variables are considered in optimization. The results show significant improvements in the objective function. Finally, the 2-D and 3-D finite element method is employed to validate the results obtained by the analytical method.

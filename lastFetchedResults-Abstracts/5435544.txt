This paper describes a role driven computational support for software project lifecycle development. For a role to achieve its goal it needs some support. In our system we build a group of support agents of different types around each abstract role (i.e. scheduler, document deliverable, bookkeeper, etc). These support agents interact among each other and with those of other roles that share tasks dependencies. Agents in the system are not restricted by predefined schemes they can join and/or leave the coalition. The objective of the system is threefold: first, to present individuals with awareness, precise views of who is doing what and when, and more specifically activities evolution; second, to provide grounding algorithms for conceptual role(activity) dynamics and consistencies in a distributed environment; and third, to facilitate the control and optimization of activities accomplishment in organizations.

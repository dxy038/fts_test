Fuel cell/ultracapacitor/battery hybrid power systems represent a promising architecture to satisfy the energy requirements for road vehicles. When the primary power source is a fuel cell, the objective of an energy management strategy is to optimize the hydrogen consumption as well as the efficiency without compromising the performance of the overall system. In order to achieve these goals, fuzzy logic has been chosen as a control strategy in this study. Using this technology is a reasonable option to achieve an adequate solution of the problem due to the fact that it can deal simultaneously with a considerable amount of variables. Besides, a simulation environment has been developed for the sake of testing the control strategies; it includes models for the power supply and energy storage devices, the power electronics and the vehicular power demand.

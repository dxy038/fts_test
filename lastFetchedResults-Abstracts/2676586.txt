Introduction: Central Venous Catheters are often used as one of vascular routes in hemodialysis patients. They have some complications such as infections leading to long hospital stay, increased mortality, and cost of treatment. The most common form of infection associated with Central Venous Catheters is infection in the insertion site of catheter. 
Objective: This study aimed to determine central venous catheter infections in the patients undergoing hemodialysis in Razi Educational Remedial and Research Center.
Materials and Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out on 170 hemodialysis patients admitted in Razi hospital for a year with the possibility of central venous catheter infection. To gather information, questionnaires including demographic information and information about the apparent criteria for infection were used. Data analysis was done using SPSS V.21 software and Chi-square and Logistic Regression statistical analysis.
Results: 58.3%of the participants were male and 39.3% were female households. Mean and SD of the age of samples was 56.5Â±13. 8 years. The most common sign of infection was fever (77.4%). 98.8%of patients, had right internal jugular vein catheter and 45.2% a history of antibiotic consumption for catheter washing. Catheter infection rate was correlated with age (P=0.03), job (P=0.01), Spouse's job (P=0.03), education (P < 0.001) and history of antibiotic consumption (P < 0.0001). Age (P=0.007) and length of catheterization (P=0.069) were predictors of catheter infection, so that those younger than  40 years, had 3.8 times greater  chance of infection, compared to those over the age of 60 years.
Conclusion: Age and length of catheterization can be used as predictive markers of central venous catheter infection in hemodialysis patients.

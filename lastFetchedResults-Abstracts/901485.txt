ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: After respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, urinary tract infection is the most common infectious disease in children that it causes renal scar and high blood pressure if timely treatment is not given. Knowledge of common pathogens and antibiotic resistance patterns for empirical treatment is necessary. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of common uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance patterns in children hospitalized in Amirkola children hospital.
METHODS: This cross sectional study was performed retrospectively on the medical records of all children hospitalized in Amirkola children hospital with UTI diagnosis from March 2010 to 2011. Information about age, sex, underlying disease, previous illness history, uropathogens and its antimicrobial resistance was recorded.
FINDINGS: Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated pathogens (89%), and then klebsiella (3.1%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.1%) were more common. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of isolated pathogens showed maximum resistance to ampicillin (88%) and cotrimoxazole (63%) and the least resistance to nitrofurantoin (9%) and amikacin (11%). The frequency of multidrug-resistant pathogens was 56.4%.
CONCLUSION: The results of the study showed that E. coli is the most common germ that causes urinary tract infection and drug resistance to ampicillin and cotrimoxazole is the greatest.

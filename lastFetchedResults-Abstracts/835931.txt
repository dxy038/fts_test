By increasing population and fresh water deficit, the importance of water resources management increases. Agricultural, industrial and municipal activities also threat the quality of groundwater resources. Groundwater resource is the major supplier of drinking and agricultural water in the Sharekord Plain, Chaharmalal&Bakhtiari Province, Iran. Therefore, conserving the quality of this source of water is very important. The objective of this research was to evaluate DRASTIC model for mapping the vulnerability of the Shahrekord Plain groundwater. The model consisted of seven effective parameters of depth to water table, net recharges, aquifer media, soil media, topography, vados zone, and aquifer hydraulic conductivity. Thematic maps of required parameters were prepared and overlayed in GIS media by formation the databank of the plain using the relevant spatial data and attributes. The results indicated 11.5%, 79.6% and 8.9% of the area are in very low, low and medium vulnerability classes, respectively. The results also revealed the higher vulnerability of the north, south-east and west of Shahrekord Plain compared to the middle plain. The correlation coefficient between the vulnerability map and nitrate concentration of groundwater was 0.43.

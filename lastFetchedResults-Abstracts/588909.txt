The objective of this study was to determine the carrier state of cats in Shahrekord harbor Bartonella henselae, the agent of Cat Scratch Disease, in their blood and thus cats can play a significant role as the reservoir of this organism. We studied evidence of Bartonella henselae infection in 40 domestic cats (10 pet, 30 stray) living in Shahrekord, Iran. We investigated cultures of blood and sterile swabs taken from the vestibular area of the teeth and paws over a 9-month period. Blood culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the amplified DNA were used for identification of Bartonella henselae. All blood samples from cats were cultured on fresh sheep blood agar for four weeks. In this study, Bartonella henselae was not isolated from cat’s paw and mouth specimens. Bartonella henselae was isolated from 5 (12.5%) of the 40 cats’ blood specimens based on PCR and sequencing of the amplified DNA fragments. Of these 5 specimens, two were positive inculfuye for Bartonella henselae according to Bartonella-like colonies; gram staining and biochemical characteristics, and the others were negative but eventually DNA of Bartonella henselae was amplified by PCR using two primers; CAT1 and CAT2 (to amplify a 414-bp fragment of htrA gene) in all of five specimens. Positive cats for Bartonella henselae bacteremia were stray and young (24 months of age or younger) and three were female and two were male cats. This is the second study on Bartonella henselae infection isolated from the Iranian pet cats. This is also the first report about Bartonella henselae bacteremia in cats from Iran.

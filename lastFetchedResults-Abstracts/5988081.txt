In order to search the joint of objective factors and subjective consciousness in safety assessment, the inherent relationships of traditional Chinese medicine technique (TCMC) and recipe engineering (RE) had been analyzed in this paper. The functions of subjective consciousness were led to right directions in virtue of the thoughts of TCMC. The interactive relationships of objective factors had been expressed in the methods of correlation coefficient and regression analysis. Research results had been applied to power plant safety assessment and a safety assessment model had been obtained. In the model, standard assessment routines and estimatorÂ´s subjective consciousness determined together the assessment results. The practice had indicated that the model could get the normative assessment process and the perfect assessment results. It would be an effective method for studying safety assessment.

Background: The objective of this study is to estimate the average
diagnosis and treatment costs of chronic hepatitis B and C, with
respect to different therapeutic strategies in Iran.
Methods: This is a descriptive, analytical, and cross?sectional study
carried out on patients with hepatitis B and C, who were referred to
the Liver Disease Research Center for Prevention and Treatment of
Hepatitis, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, in 2011. We have
estimated the direct medical costs including doctors’ fees, cost of
para?clinical tests, medical treatments, and liver biopsy, in different
treatment strategies.
Findings: The results of this study showed that the total cost of
diagnostic services for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C
virus (HCV) patients, with state medical tariffs, was US$ 1499.07
and US$ 2084.89, respectively. The patients’ profiles showed
that there were currently seven therapeutic strategies available to
treat HBV patients. The total cost of treatment strategies varied
significantly from US$ 73 to US$ 8256. There were also four main
strategies for HCV patients, each of these could be applied in
two periods of time. The total cost of these treatment strategies
showed a high disc repancy from US$ 242 t o US$ 8256.
Conclusion: The results confirmed that the total direct medical
cost for an HBV patient in Iran exceeded US$ 5.5 Milliard in
2011. The results implied that the market price of direct medical
cost of HBV and HCV patients in Iran is much higher than the
estimated state costs. These costs would likely be saved or reduced
by effective disease management and early prevention.

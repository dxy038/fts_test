The objective of this work is to study some techniques to increase computational performance of stabilized
finite element simulations of miscible displacements. We propose the use of a reduced integration
technique for bilinear quadrilateral elements in the determination of the pressure and concentration
fields. We also study the evaluation of pressure gradient (Darcyâ€™s velocity) by differentiation at superconvergent
points. Numerical examples are shown to validate our approach, accessing its efficiency
and accuracy

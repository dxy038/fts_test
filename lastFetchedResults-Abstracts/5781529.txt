In this research, we pay attention to a tactile sense as substitution for sense organs when human lost a certain sense. Therefore we think that is effective to use an apparent movement to communicate by a tactile sense about something. It is necessary to measure it objective and quantitative on using apparent movement because the apparent movement is a subjective thing. It extracts a characteristic of vital reaction with the apparent movement by EMG, this paper. We divide it into every each presentation stimulation and perform t-test by a combination of the presentation stimulation. As a result, we understood the thing that was not a little different in a t-test result by a combination of each presentation stimulation. We were able to get the result that resembled a psychological measurement when we did cluster analysis of a result of this t-test. Because this result is a result from one subject, it will be necessary to increase subjects in future.

This paper presents a digitally-controlled paralleled DC-DC converter. The main objective of the digital control is to achieve load sharing while operating at close to peak efficiency over an extremely wide load range. Results from computer simulations using Simulink show the digital control could indeed accomplish the objectives, but the improvements over a single converter depend on the original efficiency characteristics of the converters. An application for a high-power electric vehicle charger utilizing this converter setup is considered.

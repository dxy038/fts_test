Document image has been the area of research for a couple of decades because of its potential application in the area of text recognition, line recognition or any other shape recognition from the image. Text recognition from document image is very much dependent on the language of the text itself. English text recognition algorithms have already been developed and are standardized. Some works on Bangla text recognition has also been published in different literatures. Most of these recognition algorithms use character recognition as a base of text recognition. Recognition of text by recognizing its characters is a costly affair in terms of time and space. Our objective behind this work is to generate a Bangla dictionary and develop a novel technique of matching an input word with the dictionary word. The technique uses the features of the words as a whole rather than the features of each character. This reduces the time and space complexities of the recognition algorithm by many scales. We have tested our algorithm using both dictionary and non-dictionary words as the input words. For the dictionary words, it shows 100% accuracy in matching and for non-dictionary words, it shows 90% accuracy in non-matching.

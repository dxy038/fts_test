With an increasing share of distributed power in power system, the siting and sizing optimization of distributed power has an important impact on system current, voltage stability and reliability of power supply. Therefore, the rational planning of distributed power has become a major concern for power grid enterprises. This paper proposes a flexible optimization method based on particle swarm optimization, and construct the multi-objective function of synthetic utility for distributed power from the optimization of active and reactive power loss index, voltage distribution index, MVA capacity and short-circuit level index, thus reasonably determining the capacity and location of the distributed power. Besides, this paper studies the optimal site and size of distributed power with the 38-bus radial test system in independent voltage load model scenarios.

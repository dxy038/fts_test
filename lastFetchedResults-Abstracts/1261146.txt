Objectives Increasing incidence of laryngeal carcinoma and advancement in diagnostics and therapy methods, have led to constant exploration in that field. Early glottic carcinoma can be treated successfully with several procedures: cordectomy through laryngofissure, laser cordectomy, and radiotherapy. Our objective was to assess the voice quality after these different modalities of treatment. Study Design Prospective controlled study with 69 patients, treated in a 1-year period for glottic Tis and T1a carcinoma at the tertiary medical centre. Methods Nineteen of our patients were treated endoscopically with CO2 laser (types IIIâ€“IV cordectomy according to recommended European Laryngological Society classification of endoscopic cordectomies). Thirty-five patients underwent cordectomy through laryngofissure, 15 patients had radiotherapy. Multidimensional computer analysis of voice and speech was conducted 1, 6, and 12 months after the treatment. Three programs included 14 parameters, which were observed. Results While comparing the parameters between the groups, there were significant differences in the values of fundamental frequency (Hz), jitter (%), normalized noise energy (dB), standard deviation of fundamental frequency (Hz), percent silent time (%), and sound-pressure level in the different follow-up periods (Pآ <آ 0.05). Conclusion In the long run, patients treated with radiotherapy show better voice quality in comparison with other two groups.

This paper presents some tests of adaptivity for the AS4DR (Adaptive Scheduling for Distributed Resources) scheduler. The objective of AS4DR is to maximize the CPU use efficiency when executing divisible load applications on heterogeneous distributed memory platforms. Furthermore, this scheduler can operate when the total workload is unknown and when the execution parameters (available communication speed, available computing speed.) are unspecified or may vary through time. The paper analyzes results obtained when simulating AS4DR scheduling on platforms characterized by such type of execution parameters.

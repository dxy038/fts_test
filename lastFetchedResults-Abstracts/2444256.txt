Reliability investigation has always been one of the most important issues in power systems planning. The outages rate in power system reflects the fact that more attentions should be paid on reliability indices to supply consumers with uninterrupted power. Using reliability indices in economic dispatch problem may lead to the system load demand with high reliability and low probability of power's outage rate. In this paper, the Economic Dispatch (ED) problem is optimized using the reliability indices. That is, ED problem and system reliability are proposed as Combined Economic Dispatch and Reliability (CEDR) problem. In CEDR problem, it is tried to utilize generating units in a way that we have high reliability in supplying the system load demand as well as the minimum fuel costs. Due to multi-objective and non-convex characteristics of this problem, Particle Swarm Optimization with Smart Inertia Factor (PSO-SIF) is used to solve the problem. In this research, the ED of power plants is successfully implemented in two systems with 6 and 26 generating units considering emission and system reliability.

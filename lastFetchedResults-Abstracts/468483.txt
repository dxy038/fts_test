Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the rate of spontaneous resolution of grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in a private practice patient population. Study Design: One hundred consecutive women with biopsy-proven grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia were offered expectant management in the form of repeat Papanicolaou smears every 3 months up to 1 year or treatment. Women with inadequate colposcopic examination, positive endocervical sampling, or discordant Papanicolaou smears were excluded. Results: Eighty-nine (89%) women agreed to undergo expectant management. Of these, 67 (75.3%) experienced spontaneous resolution of lesions on the basis of 2 subsequent and consecutive normal smears corroborated by colposcopy. The median time to resolution was 9 months (n = 38). Seventeen (19.9%) women were treated at 1 year for persistent atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions by loop electrosurgical conization. Of these, 1 (1.1%) had a more advanced lesion (grade 2 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia). Four (4.5%) had progression before 1 year and were treated. Only 1 (1.1%) patient was lost to follow-up. Conclusion: Expectant management of grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is safe and cost-effective in a reliable patient population. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1999;181:278-82.)

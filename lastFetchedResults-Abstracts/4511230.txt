An automated computer-driven method for quantitating change on serial hand radiographs from patients with rheumatoid arthritis is described. Joint images are superimposed and subtracted using Fourier transform techniques and subjected to fractal analysis, and the thickness of the periarticular cortices is determined by microcomputer. This method has the potential to provide reliable, reproducible and objective measures of roentgenographic change

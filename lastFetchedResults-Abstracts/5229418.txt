This paper shows the application of an ongoing research project on the distributed control of processes. The objective of the project is to provide a framework to virtually model industrial plants, and to remotely, or even locally, supervise and control via Internet any industrial process by mapping it to a virtual plant. This framework provides, by using objected oriented methodologies, general patterns to industrial communication needs and to represent virtual industrial processes and their control. The application of this architecture on a fieldbus-based process allows the control and monitoring of such systems with independence from both their physical implementation and location

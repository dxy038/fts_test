Numerous proposals for fuzzy object models can be found in the literature with a variety of methods for handling inheritance in these models. One of the difficulties is specifying the semantics of fuzzy inheritance and malting clear the distinction among the many forms and uses of inheritance in object models. Different kinds of inheritance, such as generalization, combination and implementation inheritance, are briefly discussed. The primary objective of this paper, however, is to examine several of the issues involving fuzzy inheritance and to provide a discussion of fuzzy extensions to the traditional interpretation of inheritance for conceptual specialization

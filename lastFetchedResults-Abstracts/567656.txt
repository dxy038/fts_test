Background and Objectives: Studies show that huge amounts of bread are wasted in our country. One reason for this is the dough preparation process. The objective of this study was to explore the possibility of making bread from frozen dough to reduce bread wastage.
Materials and Methods: Dough was prepared by the all-in method and frozen at -30?C to -35?C (fast freezing) or -18?C to -20?C (home freezer, slow freezing). The frozen doughs were packed in two-layer polyethylene bags and stored at -18?C, defrosted after 24h, 48h, 72 h, and one week storage, and tested for extensographic characteristics. Barbari bread (a type of Iranian flat bread) was then made from the thawed dough samples and, after sensory evaluation, was stored for 1-4 d in two-layer polyethylene bags at  ambient temperature, in order to do staling tests.
Results: Storage time significantly affected extensibility, resistance and the coefficient D (p < 0.05). The type of flour had no significant effect on extensibility, resistance, or energy changes. Sensory evaluation showed that shape and upper crust surface of the Barbari bread was significantly affected by the freezing method and flour type (p < 0.05). The data also showed that the lower crust surface, chewiness, aroma, and taste of the bread were statistically significantly associated with the flour type. The flour type, freezing method, and storage time had no significant effects on porosity, firmness, or staling. 
Conclusion: Fast-frozen dough prepared from strong flour can be an appropriate alternative for fresh dough for making Barbari bread.

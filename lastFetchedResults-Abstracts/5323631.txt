With forward to TCP/IP-based information network development, a large number of innovative communication services quickly emerged. In these data-based communications services, they require different communication rate and variable quality of service. And, the TCP/IP-based networkÂ´s best-effort feature and statistical multiplexing strategy further makes the service capacity defined in telephone network no longer apply, when it is facing the new network and new communication services. To address the above problem, this paper introduces the difference between user-understanding information and machinery-understanding information, re-defines the communication service and proposes a service modeling. We hope to provide an objective and reasonable methods to evaluate the overall performance of the network and service, and guide the strategy management of the network and service to achieve the best balance between network efficiency and user experience.

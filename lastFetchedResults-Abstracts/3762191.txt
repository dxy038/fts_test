A content-based approach to the design of a triangular mesh is presented, and its application to affine motion compensation is investigated. An image is first segmented into moving objects, which are then approximated with polygons. Then, a triangular mesh is generated within each polygon, thus ensuring that no triangle straddles multiple regions. Translation and affine motion parameters are determined for each triangle, using bidirectional motion estimation. Results for three test sequences demonstrate the advantages offered by the proposed mesh design method, and by the use of affine motion compensation.

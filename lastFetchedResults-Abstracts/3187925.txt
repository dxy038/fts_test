The objective of this study is to investigate an effective design in the field of foundation among U-City construction environments. This study applies an upper bound method to estimate variable bearing capacities in soil by varying the installation angle of flexible piles and estimating previous equations of flexible piles. Also, the predicted values used in estimating the bearing capacity reinforced soil of micro-piles are compared with the results of a model test and its numerical analysis. In the results of the comparison, the predicted values are approximately satisfied with the results of the model test.

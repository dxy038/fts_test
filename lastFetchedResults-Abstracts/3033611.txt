The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of a two-scale surface roughness description on the polarization coherence in circular polarization (i.e. P<sub>RRLL</sub>). Under the assumption of sufficiently smooth surfaces, the small-slope approximation (SSA) model is employed to derive a first order expression for P<sub>RRLL</sub>. In the paper the sensitivity of P<sub>RRLL</sub> to azimuth slopes is presented.

This paper deals with nonholonomic systems in chained form with unknown covariance stochastic disturbances. The objective is to design the almost global adaptive asymptotical controllers in probability U<sub>0</sub> and U<sub>1</sub> by using discontinuous control. A switching control law U<sub>0</sub> is designed to almost globally asymptotically stabilize the state X<sub>0</sub> at both the singular X <sub>0</sub> (t<sub>0</sub>) = 0 case and the non-singular X<sub>0</sub>(t<sub>0</sub>) ne0 case. Then the state scaling technique is introduced for the discontinuous feedback when dealing with the (x<sub>1</sub>,X<sub>2</sub>,...,X<sub>n</sub>)-subsystem. Based on this, by using backstepping technique the almost global adaptive asymptotical control law U<sub>1</sub> has been presented for (x<sub>1 </sub>,X<sub>2</sub>,...,X<sub>n</sub>)-subsystem for both different U <sub>0</sub> under non-singular case and the singular case

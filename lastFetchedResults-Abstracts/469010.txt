Objective
The purpose of this study was to investigate the plausibility of serum sex hormoneâ€“binding globulin (SHBG) concentration as a risk marker for venous thromboembolism (VTE) during use of combined oral contraceptives (COC).
Study design
This was a prospective, randomized cross-over study. Thirty-five women were treated with COCs containing the same amount of ethinyl estradiol and either levonorgestrel (LNG/EE) or desogestrel (DG/EE). Serum SHBG and markers of hemostasis were determined before and after 2 months on each treatment.
Results
SHBG increased significantly with both preparations. Treatment with DG/EE caused more pronounced prothrombotic changes in hemostatic parameters than LNG/EE. With both treatment regimens, there was a significant correlation between changes in resistance to activated protein C (APCr) and changes in plasma SHBG.
Conclusion
The correlation between SHBG and the well-established risk factor APCr might indicate the usefulness of SHBG as a risk marker for VTE during COC treatment

An alternative optimization algorithm is the sequential quadratic programming(SQP) which is suitable for continuous nonlinear objective functions such as the input impedance, gain, pattern shape and so on, with both equality and inequality constraints. The basic principle of sequential approximations is to replace the given nonlinear problem by a sequence of subproblems that are easier to solve. Convergence is typically achieved in a few iterations, and therefore their interface with rigorous but expensive numerical antenna analysis codes is much more practical. We examine, with an example, the performance of a general SQP code for designing patch antennas in conjunction with a finite element-boundary integral code.

This paper describes the application of dynamic simulation to evaluate material handling resource utilization for a stamping plant in the automotive industry. The other objective of this study was evaluation of throughput relative to press schedules, shift patterns, the number of material handling resources (i.e. fork truck and tugger train drivers), and storage inventory levels. This dynamic simulation study enabled plant managers to balance the driver utilization with respect to time and to accommodate typical press schedules to achieve desired throughput levels

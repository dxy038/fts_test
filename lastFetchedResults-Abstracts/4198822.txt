In restructured power systems, the ISO should maintain the power system in an acceptable level of security. The amount of available transfer capability and spinning reserve are two important indicators of power system security. This paper presents a strategy for the allocation of demand response programs in restructured power system. The proposed approach is based on a multi-objective model in which the objectives are defined as minimization of spinning reserve cost and maximization of available transfer capability. The IEEE 30-bus test system is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

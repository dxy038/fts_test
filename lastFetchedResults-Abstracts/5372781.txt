The Technical University of Madrid (UPM) is pioneering the introduction in Spain of a new Degree in Materials Engineering, with a four-year duration, accessed directly from the baccalaureate-level studies. The materials engineers from the UPM will be prepared to meet the challenges not only in the field of structural materials, but also in functional materials and biomaterials. With the objective of enhancing student exchange programmes, the third year of studies will be taught entirely in English.

The objective of this study was to identify the high pressure processing conditions (pressure level, time, and temperature) needed to achieve a 5-log reduction of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in live oysters (Crassostrea virginica). Ten strains of V. parahaemolyticus were separately tested for their resistances to high pressure. The two most pressure-resistant strains were then used as a cocktail to represent baro-tolerant environmental strains. To evaluate the effect of temperature on pressure inactivation of V. parahaemolyticus, Vibrio-free oyster meats were inoculated with the cocktail of V. parahaemolyticus and incubated at room temperature (approximately 21 °C) for 24 h. Oyster meats were then blended and treated at 250 MPa for 5 min, 300 MPa for 2 min, and 350 MPa for 1 min. Pressure treatments were carried out at − 2, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 45 °C. Temperatures ≥ 30 °C enhanced pressure inactivation of V. parahaemolyticus. To achieve a 5-log reduction of V. parahaemolyticus in live oysters, pressure treatment needed to be ≥ 350 MPa for 2 min at temperatures between 1 and 35 °C and ≥ 300 MPa for 2 min at 40 °C.

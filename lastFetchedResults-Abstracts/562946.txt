The objective of this work was the complete characterization of the aS1 casein (aS1-CN) ]RV allele, previously identified in the Moldavian strain of Romanian Grey Steppe cattle. After aS1-CN cDNA sequencing several substitutions were observed in fRV allele (GenBank EU908730), as compared with common B and C alleles. These results suggest that the IRV allele arose phylogenetically from the C variant. Based on A-T substitution (exon 11), a PCR-RFLP test was developed for identification of IRV allele. Blood samples of 63 living individuals of this breed an representing different ages and preserved semen samples of 6 deceased bulls were genotyped, resulting in a 0.123 frequency of fRV allele. The discovery of an ancestral casein allele in such a small endangered population is critical in the context of genetic resources preservation, highlighting the unique phylogeny of Romanian Grey Steppe cattle.

We have developed a second order biomechanical model to estimate the vertical mechanical impedance of able-bodied walkers. Our ultimate purpose is to design prostheses for lower-limb amputees that provide the necessary impedance to match the vertical mechanical impedance of the able-bodied population. The objective is to increase walking comfort and walking speed for lower-limb amputees. The impedance values can also be used as a reference for shock absorption when designing walking machines.

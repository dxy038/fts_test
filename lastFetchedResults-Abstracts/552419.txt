Objective: Inguinal hernia is one of the most common diseases in general surgery. It is seen 25 times in males than in females. It is also more common after 40 years of age. There are several techniques for repair of hernia and the choice depends on the age of the patient and the surgeons' experience. The aim of the present study was to assess the clinical features and the recurrence rate of inguinal hernia among our patients in two major educational hospitals in Ahwaz.

Subjects and Methods: This study is cognitive and retrospective study. We evaluated age, sex, type and recurrence rate with regarding three major techniques employed in hernia repair namely: simple ligature in pediatric group; tissue repair (Bassini method) and mesh repair in adult group among 150 patients in Imam Khomeini and Razi hospitals over one year from (1997-1998). The patients were followed up for 2 years. Analysis of data was carried out by SPSS software.

Results: Ninety two % of cases were males and the most common age (24 %) was in 40 to 50 years old group. For repairing the hernia 20 % of patient underwent only high ligation, 37.5 % with tissue repair and in 42.5 % by mesh repair. Overall there were 8 %recurrences. \The recurrence rate with Bassini repair was 16 %, while only 3 % of recurrences occurred following either mesh repair and with high ligation techniques.

Conclusion: The finding from this study showed that recurrence rates in educational centers for simple ligature of sac in pediatric group and mesh repair in adult group are lower than global studies. However, the recurrence rate in tissue repair is higher than global studies. We therefore recommend that more detailed training of mesh repair technique to be provided for residents of surgery courses.

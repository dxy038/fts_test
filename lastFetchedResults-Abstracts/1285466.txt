The emergence of the moderate Islam thought in Turkey and its dominance in the sociopolitical arena in this country is one of the phenomena in the Islam world which needs serious consideration. After the Islamic Awakening movement, it has been tried to introduce this discourse- which has been able to pass Ataturk's rigid laicism and push political Islamists (Erbakani) to the margin based on a pluralistic understanding of Islam â€“ as a pattern for a desired Islamic government in modern political systems and a model of the Islamic revolution of Iran for Arab countries.
The question which caused the authors of the present article to investigate the political approaches of moderate Islam is: what are the features of this discourse that western countries seek to use it as a pattern for Islamic countries? (Question) To answer this question, the authors believe that the existence of a kind of Sufi inclination in Turkish moderate Islam and its integration with western thoughts has caused this interpretation of Islam to be more applicable in this country and the same issue is reflected in the political approaches of this discourse (Hypothesis). Hence, to prove this claim, the present work, while presenting a brief report of the process of the emergence of this discourse in Turkey and introducing its founders and leaders, the approach of this discourse towards the position of politics in Islam and other related issues- like the role of government in Islamic community, Islam and western liberalism, Islam and revolution and also Islamic civilization- are investigated (Method). 
The authors of the present article, who tried to show the challenges of Turkish liberal Islam in confronting political Islam (Objective), reached some conclusions such as the implementation of new Ottoman thought in Turkish moderate Islam and also the activities of Erdogan's government to propagate a new kind of religious Secularism.

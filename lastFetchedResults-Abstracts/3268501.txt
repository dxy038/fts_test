In this paper a new approach is developed to optimize the engine and hydraulic element size and their corresponding parameters of a hybrid hydraulic powertrain to given or assumed load/driving cycles. A multi objective optimization algorithm in combination with boundary condition regulation is applied in a loop. In addition, a new mixed optimization algorithm is proposed to overcome the problem of power management optimization by obtaining a better spread of solutions. The main contribution of the paper is the optimal selection of the motor and accumulator size thereby ensuring optimal vehicle dynamic and power consumption properties to different accumulator and engine sizes.

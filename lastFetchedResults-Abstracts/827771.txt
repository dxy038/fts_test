The in-vessel melt retention becomes an important safety objective for the present or future middle power nuclear plants, so care has to be taken in the evaluation of the various phenomena related to ensuring the feasibility of this objective. Since the prediction of the relevant phenomena has to be performed for the prototypical accident conditions, the applicability of the measured data or of the correlations derived from these measurements have to be established and the uncertainties determined. In this context, most uncertainties are introduced by the non-prototypicalities in the experiments. The paper describes the major findings from the OECD RASPLAV project and discusses the remaining challenges left in the area of in-vessel molten corium coolability.

One of the most significant techniques regarding the establishment of strategic schemes, is how to establish measurable indices with certain rationality and feasibility by stages. In this study, we establishe and integrate the measurable factors of all the strategic sub-schemes via analyzing previous data, additionally and further forecast the trends of those measurable factors via regressive analysis. Moreover, regarding the measurable strategic schemes with no expected objective values, this paper not only proposes the quantitative model of measurable factors and the basic model of measurable factors, but also formulates the quantitative upper bound, lower bound and median of each relevant measurable factor, so as to demonstrate 3 different types of strategic plans for decision-makers as optimistic, pessimistic and eclectic. This new method has been successfully applied to the case of construction and development of international tourism island in Hainan province which is primarily focusing on the financial indices of tourism economy, and improves the feasibility and effectiveness of this method.

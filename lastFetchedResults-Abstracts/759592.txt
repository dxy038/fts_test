Inattentive behavior is considered a core and
pervasive feature of ADHD; however, an alternative model
challenges this premise and hypothesizes a functional
relationship between working memory deficits and inattentive
behavior. The current study investigated whether
inattentive behavior in children with ADHD is functionally
related to the domain-general central executive and/or
subsidiary storage/rehearsal components of working memory.
Objective observations of childrenâ€™s attentive behavior
by independent observers were conducted while children
with ADHD (n=15) and typically developing children (n=14)
completed counterbalanced tasks that differentially manipulated
central executive, phonological storage/rehearsal, and
visuospatial storage/rehearsal demands. Results of latent
variable and effect size confidence interval analyses revealed
two conditions that completely accounted for the attentive
behavior deficits in children with ADHD: (a) placing
demands on central executive processing, the effect of which
is evident under even low cognitive loads, and (b) exceeding
storage/rehearsal capacity, which has similar effects on
children with ADHD and typically developing children but
occurs at lower cognitive loads for children with ADHD.

A description is given the MedIndEx system, formerly known as the Indexing Aid (expert) system, which is currently under development. The objective of this project is to automate indexing of medical literature as much as possible by assisting indexers in selecting index terms and applying indexing rules, thereby facilitating expert indexing. Conventional thesaurus-based indexing is examined, followed by an explanation of knowledge representation using frames. Computer-assisted indexing with MedIndEx is then examined. The projectÂ´s status and future plans are indicated.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Tuberculosis is one of the most contagious and fatal diseases in the world and BCG vaccination is recommended by WHO for prevention of tuberculosis. This is a cross sectional study which was performed in 9-15 month-old children in rural and urban areas of Boirahmad. 606 children were selected by cluster random sampling and place of birth, place of vaccination , presence of scar and scar size were recorded. Our results showed that 95.5% of children had a scar and the mean for scar size was found to be 5mm(SD =194).
Significant statistical difference was found between rural and urban areas with respect to the interval between birth and time of vaccination. This might be due to a greater number of home deliveries in rural areas.

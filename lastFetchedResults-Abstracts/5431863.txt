We have studied two different kinds of electron tubes using a cold field emission cathode as the electron source. This cathode is an array of vertically aligned multiwall carbon nanotubes. The first device is a triode. With this device, we demonstrated the modulation at 32 GHZ of a 1.4 A/cm2 peak current density with a 82% modulation ratio. The second device is a traveling wave tube. For this device, the objective is to test a cathode delivering a 2 A/cm<sup>2</sup> electron beam.

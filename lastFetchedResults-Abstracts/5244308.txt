According to gear engagement theory and Principles of Modern Tribology, by example, taking the minimum integral of temperature on gear tooth face and the minimum value of the total volume of the transmission gears as the objective function, constrained multi-objective optimization is proceeded recurring to Particle Swarm Optimization, programming with MATLAB. On this basis, studying from the point of mathematical logic and physical mechanism is proceeded for the sensitivity analysis of objective function to each design variable. The results show that with module and width of gear increasing, the volume of the meshing non-symmetrical gears increases, and it is more sensitive to module comparing with width of gears, integral temperature on gear tooth face declines as each of module, width of gear, pressure angle increases, module, pressure angle and width of gear are ranged in order of the degree of sensitivity and pressure angle is the most important factor for the surface integral temperature. Reasonably increasing the pressure angle on the working profile significantly causes the gear teeth surface integral temperature decline.

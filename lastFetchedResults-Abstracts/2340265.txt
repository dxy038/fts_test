This article, in order to guarantee the stable mode transition in tandem turbo-ramjet engines, investigates the multi-objective and multi-variable goal programming algorithm. First, it introduces the structural features of the variable cycle turbo-ramjet engines, the principles of selecting the mode transition operation point and the design parameters, and the characteristics of the turbofan mode and the ramjet mode. Second, a component-based variable cycle turbo-ramjet engine model is developed to simulate the mode transition process. Third, the Newton-Raphson algorithm is used to solve the multi-variable and multi-objective optimization problem. The results show that with the maximum residua of only 0.06%, this algorithm has an acceptable convergence that meets the predetermined goals. Finally, the simulation shows that the stable turbo-ramjet mode transition could be realized with the mode transition control law developed by the algorithm.

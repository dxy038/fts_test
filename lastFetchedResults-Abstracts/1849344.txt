Objective: To explore the association of polymorphisms in N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), glutathione S-transferase (GST), cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2A6, and CYP 2A13 genes with susceptibility and clinicopathologic characteristics of bladder cancer in a Chinese population. Methods: In a hospital-based case-control study of 208 cases and 212 controls matched on age and gender, genotypes were determined by PCR-based methods. Risks were evaluated by unconditional logistic regression analysis. Results: It was found that significant associations of the NAT2 slow-acetylator genotype (odds ratio, OR: 2.42; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.47–3.99), GSTM1 null genotype (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.11–2.42) and GSTM1/GSTT1-double null genotype (OR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.00–2.95) with increased risk of bladder cancer. Conversely, carriers with at least one CYP2A6*4 allele showed lower risk than the non-carriers (OR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.28–0.79). The adjusted ORs (95% CI) for smokers with NAT2 slow-acetylator, GSTM1 null, GSTM1/GSTT1-double null genotype, and variant CYP2A6 genotypes were 2.99 (1.44–6.25), 1.98 (1.13–3.48), 2.66 (1.22–5.81) and 0.41 (0.20–0.86), respectively. Furthermore, NAT2 slow-acetylator, GSTM1 null, and GSTM1/GSTT1-double null genotypes were associated with higher tumor grade (P = 0.001, 0.022, and 0.036, respectively), and only NAT2 slow-acetylator genotype was associated with higher tumor stage (P = 0.007). CYP2A13 was not associated with risk or tumor characteristics. Conclusion: It is suggested that NAT2 slow-acetylator, GSTM1 null, GSTM1/GSTT1-double null, and variant CYP2A6 genotypes may play important roles in the development of bladder cancer in Henan area, China.

This paper presents an application of swarm intelligence technique for power system optimization. Unit commitment is an important task for the optimal allocation of the generating units for the economic operations of the power system network. Solution to the unit commitment (UC) problem in the conventional market and profit based unit commitment (PBUC) in restructured power market have been solved using swarm intelligent techniques and thereby finding the power output of each generator available in the power system network. The main objective of the unit commitment problem is to minimize the total production cost for the generation satisfying all its system constraints. In PBUC problem the objective is to maximize the profit of the generation companies with or without emission limitation. In this paper, proposed method is tested on IEEE 39 bus system with 10 generating units and efficiency of the proposed algorithm is compared with other swarm intelligence methods.

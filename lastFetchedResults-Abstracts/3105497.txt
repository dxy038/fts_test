The main objective of 3D mesh watermarking is to maximize the watermark strength while minimizing the visual distortion. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D mesh watermarking based on the human visual system and mesh curvature. We analyze the regionpsilas mean curvature and fluctuation of curvature, and then choose the appropriate regions with high visual masking degree, in order to embed the watermark by using the Interpolation Algorithm. The experimental results show that the watermark is capacious, invisible and robust against various attacks.

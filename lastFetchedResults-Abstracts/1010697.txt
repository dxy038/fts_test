This paper presents a systematic approach for the optimization of steam systems of chemical plants. The objective of this work is to design steam distribution network (SDN) of steam systems for satisfying energy requirements of chemical processes. For obtaining better energy utilization the network structure and the operation conditions of the SDN are treated as design variables to be optimized. Furthermore, to manage the steam flow and heat flow between sites, an integrated-SDN model is developed, considering the interaction between the steam systems and the chemical processes. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed approach.

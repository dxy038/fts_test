OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the nature of the complications in preterm newborns after intrapartum fetal asphyxia with metabolic acidosis at delivery.
STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-seven preterm fetuses with metabolic acidosis were matched with 37 preterm fetuses with normal blood gas measurements at delivery. A complication score expressed the magnitude of newborn complications during the 10 days after delivery.
RESULTS: The mean complication score for the preterm newborns at 32 to 36 weeks in the asphyxia group, 9,6, was significantly greater than that for the control group, 3.1. Fetal asphyxia was associated with severe complications in all systems. The complication scores for the preterm newborns <32 weeks in the asphyxia group were of the same order as the control group. This may be related in part of a short duration of the asphyxial insult. The Apgar score at 1 minute was a valuable predictor of newborn complications in both the asphyxia and control groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Intrapartum fetal asphyxia with metabolic acidosis at delivery is an important factor in the occurrence of severe complications, particularly in the central nervous system, respiratory system, and kidney, of preterm newborns.

<strong>Objective:</strong> To report the case of a 28-year old hypercholesterolemic female with postpartum depression, whose triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels decreased while being treated with fluoxetine.<br /> <strong>Method:</strong> A 28-year old female, with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder with postpartum onset based on DSM-IV criteria, was hospitalized at a mental health hospital. Her past history included another episode of depression 4 months after giving birth to her second child, which was 12 years prior to her recent episode. Her serum total cholestrol and triglyceride levels were measured prior to the initiation of medication. Then fluoxetine was initiated at a daily dose of 20 mg and had been increased to 40 mg per day at the time of discharge. The lipid profile measurements was repeated at week 4 and 8 following treatment.<strong> <br />Results:</strong> Total cholesterol level was reduced from 242 mg/dL at baseline to 224 mg/dL at week 4 and to 202 mg/dL at week 8; triglyceride level was decreased from 516 mg/dL to 448 mg/dL at week 4 and to 404 mg/dL at week 8. <br /><strong>Conclusions:</strong> Fluoxetine may be an appropriate treatment for hyperlipidemic women with postpartum depression.

This paper presents a new fault classification scheme for electrical distribution networks using a negative sequence factor (F2) and artificial neural networks. The main objective is to develop a novel methodology to block the reclosers to avoid accidents with energized cables lying to ground. The proposed algorithm is able to identify the following fault types: shunt, series and simultaneous shunt-series with the line cable lying either on the side of the source or load. In order to check the effectiveness of the proposed methodology the 13 bus distribution test system was used.

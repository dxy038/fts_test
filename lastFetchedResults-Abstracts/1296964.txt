The paper presents an effective version of the Pareto memetic algorithm with path relinking and efficient local search for multiple objective traveling salesperson problem. In multiple objective Traveling salesperson problem (TSP), multiple costs are associated with each arc (link). The multiple costs may for example correspond to the financial cost of travel along a link, time of travel, or risk in the case of hazardous materials. The algorithm searches for new good solutions along paths in the decision space linking two other good solutions selected for recombination. Instead of a simple local search it uses short runs of tabu search based on the steepest version of the Linâ€“Kernighan algorithm. The efficiency of local search is further improved by the techniques of candidate moves and locked arcs. In the final step of the algorithm the neighborhood of each potentially Pareto-optimal solution is searched for new solutions that could be added to this set. The algorithm is compared experimentally to the state-of-the-art algorithms for multiple objective TSP.

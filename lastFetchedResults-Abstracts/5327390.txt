By the analyzing and study on the problem about JIT procurement and supplier selection of Special Steel enterprise group, a supplier selection tactic model structure of enterprise group was firstly constructed. The constructing process of the model is basically based on the procurement cost and the delivery time. On the basis of adaptive genetic algorithm, an original algorithm for multi-constraint supplier selection tactic mathematical model was then proposed. The procurement cost and the delivery time was chose as the optimization objective in the proposed mathematical mode, the model and the algorithm is applied to solve a given practical problem of Special Steel enterprise group , the validity and efficiency of the model and the algorithm is then verified by the solving results. Finally some lacking place of the multi-constraint supplier selection tactic mathematical model was discussed.

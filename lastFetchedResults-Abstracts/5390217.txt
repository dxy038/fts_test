In this paper we carry out a survey on key frame extraction methods for Video Summary. We also discuss the summary evaluation criteria and compare the approaches based on the method, data set and the results. Video Summary is a process of presenting an abstract of entire video within a short period of time. It aims to provide a compact video representation, while preserving the essential activities of the original video. It is an essential task in video analysis and indexing applications. Most of the video summaries are based on selection of key frames within the shots of a video. Many of them use motion features and few use visual features for extracting the key frames. The video summary quality assessment methods are based more on subjective and less on objective measures. Tong wei Ren et al has provided a framework to assess the quality of the video against a given reference summary using both subjective and objective measures. Ciocca et al used the objective measures for evaluation of summary and most of them evaluate by taking the subjective opinion of experts. A framework for automatic evalution is needed based on both subjective and objective measures without the reference summary.

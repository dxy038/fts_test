Objective: Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue or follicles has been proposed as an
alternative method for fertility preservation. Although successful vitrification of follicles
has been reported in several mammalian species, the survival rate is generally
low. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of fibroblast growth factor
(FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on in vitro preantral follicle development
after vitrification.
Materials and Methods:In this experimental study, preantral follicles with diameter of
150-180 ?m were mechanically isolated from ovaries of 18-21 days old NMRI mice. Follicles
were vitrified and warmed, then cultured in ?-minimal essential medium (?-MEM)
without growth factor supplementation as control group (group I), while supplemented
with 20 ng/ml FGF (group II), 20 ng/ml EGF (group III), and 20 ng/ml FGF +20 ng/ml EGF
(group IV). After 12 days, human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)/EGF was added to culture
medium, and after 18-20 hours, the presence of cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs)
and oocyte maturation were assessed. The chi-square (?2) test was used to analyze survival
and ovulation rates of the follicles.
Results: Our results showed that the rate of metaphase II (MII) oocytes in FGF group
increased in comparison with control and other treatment groups (p < 0.027), but there
was no difference between control with EGF and EGF+FGF groups in oocyte maturation
rate (p > 0.05). There was a significant decrease in survival rate of follicles in
EGF+FGE group in comparison with other groups (p < 0.008). After in vitro ovulation
induction, the follicles in EGF group showed a higher ovulation rate (p < 0.008) than
those cultured in other groups.
Conclusion: FGF has beneficial effect on oocyte maturation, and EGF increases
COCs number in vitro. Combination of EGF and FGE decreases the number of survived
follicles.

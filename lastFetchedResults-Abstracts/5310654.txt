The author introduces the concept and motivations for developing boundary scan (BS) and explains the input BS cell, the output BS cell, and the bidirectional BS cell. He then describes the application of boundary scan to the testing of analog-digital application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) in a board/system environment. An example is given to illustrate the concept and the application

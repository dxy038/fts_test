The study assessed beneficiaries’ satisfaction in the management
of loag-contract components by cooperatives involved in
the farm credit delivery in Edo State. The objective was to
identify the components of the farm loan contract, examine the
management strategies and rate the beneficiaries’ satisfaction of
such management strategies. This was done by purposively
selecting 40 cooperatives involved in farm credit delivery in
Oredo, Egor and Ikpoba-Okha LGAs of Edo State where there
is a proliferation of cooperatives who are actively involved in
farm credit delivery. Data were analyzed using descriptive
statistics, queuing model and satisfaction indices.Results showed
the main loan-contract components to be loan volume, repayment
regime, interest rates charged, default management, collateral
required, timeliness and loan monitoring. Average beneficiaries’
index was 4.28 out of 5 indicating high satisfaction originating
from good queue management with traffic density of 1.12,
moderate interest rate of 9% p.a, active loan monitoring, no
physical collateral, timely disbursement of loan and accommodative
repayment regime. Only individual loan volumes were low as a
result of inadequate loanable fund. Study recommends that cooperative
societies should take advantage of external sources of
funds to boost the volume of their loanable funds.

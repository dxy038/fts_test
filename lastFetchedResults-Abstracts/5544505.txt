The main objective of this paper is to extend EXIT charts performance analysis technique from turbo channel codes to compressive turbo codes used for the Slepian-Wolf problem. We present the methodology on using EXIT charts in this problem and illustrate its results for several pairs of correlated memoryless sources and turbo compression schemes, observing a good match between numerical EXIT results and BER simulations. Consequently, the generalized EXIT charts presented in this paper allow one to predict behavior of the iterative decoding process for Slepian-Wolf turbo compression.

Provision of various real time multimedia services to mobile users is the main objective of the next generation wireless networks, which will be IP-based and are expected to interwork with the Internet backbone seamlessly. Two major challenges in IP-based wireless mobile networks are support of fast handoff and provision of quality of service (QoS). In order to provide QoS to the mobile users, we propose to study the performance of a distributed call admission control (CAC) in a cellular IP domain. This scheme is compared to a centralized CAC performed by the domain gateway. The proposed CACs are part of a dynamic adaptive architecture DYNAA that copes with usersÂ´ mobility and that dynamically adapts the calls bandwidth.

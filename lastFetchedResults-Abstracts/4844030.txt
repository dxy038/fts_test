This paper presents an improved version of the recently proposed Self Regulating Particle Swarm Optimization (SRPSO) algorithm referred to as improved Self Regulating Particle Swarm Optimization (iSRPSO) algorithm. In the iSRPSO algorithm, the last two least performing particles are observed with different perception and they adopt a different learning strategy for velocity update. These particles get a directional update from the best particle and the next top three better performing particles for divergence of their search directions towards better solutions. This provides direction and momentum to these least performing particles and enhances their awareness of the search space. Performance of iSRPSO has been compared with SRPSO on a unimodal and a multimodal benchmark function from CEC2005 where a significant performance improvement closer to the optimum solution has been observed. Further, the performance of iSRPSO has been investigated using both the 10D and 30D CEC2015 bound constrained single-objective computationally expensive numerical optimization problems. The performance of iSRPSO on 10D problems have been compared with both the PSO and SRPSO algorithms where the solutions of iSRPSO are closer to the true optimum value compared to the other two algorithms.

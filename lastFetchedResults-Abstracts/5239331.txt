The advent of digital electronics defined a new paradigm in designing electronic systems, which center on the conversion of continuous time signals to discrete time samples. The measure of the proximity of the samples to the original signals characterized as resolution determines the extent of information represented by these digital samples and the reversibility of this process. However post-sampling requirements for increasing the sample size of discrete-time signals has driven the developments of a body of techniques that provides an enhancement of the resolution through interpolation and other prevalent methods. In furtherance of this objective a new technique is proposed that provides an improved performance over existing techniques.

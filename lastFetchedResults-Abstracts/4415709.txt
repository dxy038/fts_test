Action-reaction principle of Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) and its Inversion Based Control (IBC) is used to organize subsystems interconnection of Noao, a plug-in series hybrid race car equipped with lithium-ion battery pack and an engine/generator set as its range extender, according to the physical causality. Results from drive test of the real car are used to validate the model. The objective of this paper is to provide a dynamic model of this car in order to improve its control scheme and analyse the impact of its optimisation.

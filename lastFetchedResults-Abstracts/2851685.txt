This paper presents a packet loss concealment (PLC) method with applications to VoIP, audio broadcast and streaming. The problem of modeling of time-varying frequency spectrum in the context of PLC is addressed and a novel solution is proposed for tracking and using the temporal motion of spectral flow. The proposed PLC utilizes a time-frequency motion (TFM) matrix representation of the audio signal where each frequency is tagged with a motion vector estimate. The spectral motion vectors are estimated by cross-correlating the movement of spectral energy within subbands across time frames. The missing packets are estimated in TFM domain and inverse transformed to the time-domain. The proposed method is compared with conventional approaches using objective performance evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), and subjective mean opinion scores (MOS) in a range of packet loss from 5% to 20%. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves performance.

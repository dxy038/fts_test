This paper presents optimum design of transverse flux linear motor(TFLM) for household electric refrigerator. We use a characteristic function, table of orthogonal array and three-dimensional equivalent magnetic circuit network (EMCN) method to explain correlations between the objective function and design variables, maximize thrust force and minimize detent force for weight reduction. This paper procedure is validated by the comparison between experimental and calculation results

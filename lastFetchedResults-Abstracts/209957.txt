Objective: Spasticity is one component of the upper motor neu ron e
syndrome, whic h is characterised by a veloci ty dependent increase
in the tonic stretch reflexes . This study aimed at investigati ng the
interrater reliability of the Modified Tardieu Scale in the assessment
of muscle spas tici ty in stroke pat ients.
Materials & Methods: In this analyt ical and va lidi ty testing study 30
patie nts with spastic hemipleg ia were se lected by simple sampling from
clients of centra l ner vou s sy stem disorders cli nic of Tehran University
of medical sciences . The two muscl e groups in affec ted upper limb were
te sted usin g a s tandardized procedure. T hese were elbow f1exors and
e xte nsors. Assessment was done by the two occupational therapists during
the same session. The order of assessment and the sequence of muscle
tes ting by the two raters were ra ndo m. The interr ater rel iability was
calculated for the different subsales of Modified Tard ieu. The reliab ility
was tested with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) . For the Modified
Tar die u Sca le scores, the Co hen 's Kappa test was used to analy ze the level
of agree me nt between the raters.
Results: The val ues of ICC fo r both muscle gro ups wer e high . The ICC
for R2-R1 as main outcome measure for determinat ion of spasticity severi ty
was 0 .99 and 0 .95 in the t1exors and exten sor s, respec tively. The Kappa
va lues in mu scles reac tio n qn al ity were 0 .88 in fl exors and 0.89 in
Extensors.
Co nclusio n : The Mo d if ied Tardi e u Scale pro vides high in terr ater
reli ab ilit y in the as sessment of muscle spa stici ty after stroke .

It is necessary to study the relationship between foreign trade and migration between developed and developing countries, as the emigration rate has been increasing in recent decades. The objective of this paper is to examine such relationship between Iran's trade and labor force migration to the selected major OECD members over the period 1992-2004. Hence, the empirical results, obtained by estimating a panel gravity-based model, indicate that there is a significant and complementary relationship between Iran's foreign trade and migration to these countries. Moreover, the results show that the labor wage divergence, increasing gap between real labor wages in Iran and the selected OECD countries, increase emigration flow from Iran to such countries.

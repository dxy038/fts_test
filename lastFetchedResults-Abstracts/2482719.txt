Objective: The present study investigated the effects of gallic acid (GA) administration on
trimethyltin chloride (TMT) induced anxiety, depression, and hippocampal neurodegeneration
in rats.
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, the rats received intraperitoneal (i.p.)
injections of TMT (8 mg/kg). The animals received either GA (50, 100 and 150 mg/kg) or
saline as the vehicle for 14 consecutive days. We measured depression and anxiety levels
of the rats by conducting the behavioral tail suspension (TST), elevatedplusmaze (EPM),
and novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) tests. Histological analyses were then used to determine
the cell densities of different hippocampal subdivisions. The data were analyzed
with ANOVA and Tukeyâ€™s post hoc test.
Results: GA administration ameliorated anxiety and depression in the behavioral tests.
The cell densities in the CA1, CA2, CA3 and DG hippocampal subdivisionsfrom GA-treated
rats were higher than saline treated rats.
Conclusion: GA treatment against TMT-induced hippocampal degeneration altered
cellular loss in the hippocampus and ameliorated the depression-anxiety state in rats.

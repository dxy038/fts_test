Objective We examined to what extent internalizing and
externalizing problems at age 3 preceded and predicted
parental divorce, and if divorce and the time lapse since
divorce were related to internalizing and externalizing
problems at age 12.
Methods Parental ratings of internalizing and externalizing
problems were collected with the Child Behavior
Checklist (CBCL) in a large sample (N = 6,426) of 3-yearold
children. All these children were followed through the
age of 12 years, at which parents completed the CBCL
again, while teachers completed the Teacherâ€™s Report
Form. Children whose parents divorced between age 3 and
age 12 were compared with children whose families
remained intact.
Results Girls whose parents divorced between ages 3 and
12 already showed more externalizing problems at age 3
than girls whose parents stayed married. Higher levels of
externalizing problems in girls at age 3 predicted later
parental divorce. Parental reports indicated that 12-yearolds
with divorced parents showed more internalizing and
externalizing problems than children with married parents.
Levels of teacher-reported problems were not different
between children with married versus divorced parents.
However, children whose parents divorced between ages 3
and 12 showed more teacher-rated internalizing problems
at age 12 when the divorce was more recent than when the
divorce was less recent. Parental ratings of both internalizing
and externalizing problems at age 12 were not associated
with the time lapse since divorce.
Conclusion Externalizing problems in girls precede and
predict later parental divorce. Post-divorce problems in
children vary by raters, and may depend on the time lapse
since divorce

There are numerous safety related codes and standards related to electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE). This paper will identify applicable codes, standards and recommended practices and then describe the need for such codes. The paper will also identify gaps or areas that codes and standards could be improved related to Level 1 and Level 2 EVSEs. Level 1 EVSEs are typically a 120VAC single phase EVSE with a charging current of 12 or 16A. A Level 2 EVSE is 208 to 240VAC single phase with a maximum current level of 80A. The objective of the paper is to describe methods of enhancing the overall electrical safety for the emerging electric vehicle industry. Actual EVSE results coordinated with electric vehicle test data will be provided within the article including data related to high frequency noise in a charge circuit interrupting device (CCID) circuit. Approaches to the development of CCID circuitry could inadvertently disguise high frequency noise that could develop into harmful leakage current to ground. Vehicle compatibility testing is also an important aspect in the development of an EVSE. The paper shows data related to the benefits of EVSE as well as potential issues that should be addressed as the industry moves forward toward increased electric vehicle usage.

We have designed, fabricated, and tested an inchworm actuator using water electrolysis as the mechanical power source. The device was introduced in [1], and further characterization and interesting reliability results are reported here. Each actuator is made of two sealed electrolyte-filled silicone balloons. When electrolysis is run inside a balloon, the balloon expands due to gas generation. When electrolysis is stopped, the balloon shrinks due to gas recombination and permeation through the silicone. Bidirectional movement of a rotor, e.g., a metal probe, is obtained by applying specific expansion/shrinkage sequences to the balloons. The device works at low voltage and current, with peak power consumption around 100 &#956;W. Displacement of silicon and metal probes from 0.5 &#956;m to 75 &#956;m per cycle was demonstrated. Reliability tests were also performed. The hydrogel-enabled process to fabricate the balloons is also illustrated.

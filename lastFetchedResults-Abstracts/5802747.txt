This paper presents an optimal design and synthesis of three-ring Concentric Circular Antenna Arrays (CCAA) with non-isotropic elements with and without central element feeding. Novel Particle Swarm Optimization (NPSO) is adopted as an evolutionary optimization technique for the CCAA design and synthesis. It is shown that by proper selection of the fitness function which controls more than one parameter of the array pattern, and also by proper setting of weight factors in fitness function, one can achieve substantially improved results. For each optimal design, optimal current excitation weights and optimal radii are determined with an objective of maximum Sidelobe Level (SLL) reduction. The extensive simulation results show that the CCAA designs having central element feeding for non-isotropic elements yield to much more reduction in SLL as compared to that of the CCAA without central element feeding. Moreover, a particular CCAA with central element feeding containing 4, 6 and 8 number of elements in three successive rings yields to a grand minimum SLL of -49.21 dB. Conventional Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is adopted to compare the results obtained by using NPSO algorithm.

Multi-objective optimization models have been increasingly used as optimal decisions are searched in settings considering several conflicting objectives. In these cases compromises must be made and often a large number of non-dominated optimal solutions exist. From these solutions decision-makers must find the preferred one. This is a difficult task both from a computational and cognitive point of views, as it requires several solutions to be obtained and compared. An interactive visualization tool for fully understanding the best trade-offs is therefore becoming increasingly important. This paper proposes visualization solutions, implemented in a tool, for aiding decision-makers in finding the preferred solution in multi-objective optimization problems.

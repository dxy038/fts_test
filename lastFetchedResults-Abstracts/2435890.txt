Water quality management is inevitably complicated since it involves a number of environmental, socio-economic, technical, and political factors with dynamic and interactive features. In planning water quality management systems, uncertainties exist in many system components and may affect the system behaviours. It is thus desired that such complexities and uncertainties be effectively addressed for providing decision support for practical water quality management. The objective of this study is to develop a model-based decision support system for supporting water quality management under hybrid uncertainties, named FICMDSS, which is based on a hybrid uncertain programming (HFICP) model with fuzzy and interval coefficients. The system provides an effective tool for the decision makers in dealing with water quality management problems and formulating desired policies and strategies. The user can easily operate the system and obtain the decision support through user-friendly graphical interfaces. The HFICP model improves upon the existing inexact programming methods through incorporation of hybrid fuzzy and interval uncertainties into the optimization management processes and resulting solutions. Results of a water quality management case study indicated that the developed FICMDSS can facilitate the decision making in planning agricultural activities for water quality management in agricultural systems. Feasible decision alternatives for cropping area, amounts of manure and fertilizer application, and sizes of livestock husbandry can be generated for achieving the maximum agricultural system benefit subject to the given water-related constraints. The user can better make the decisions for water quality management under hybrid uncertainties with the help of FICMDSS.

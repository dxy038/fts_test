A bidirectional optical link capable of multi-Gbps data transfer was built to demonstrate the concept of an avionics PON based on non-resonant devices only. Replacing lasers with wideband devices such as RSOA and SLED leads to ruggedness, especially high temperature tolerance while at the same time enabling robust wavelength multiplexing into CWDM channels. This solution is potentially low-cost by utilizing high volume FTTH COTS parts, significantly relaxed cooling requirements and reduced device count by utilization of spectral slicing. Network design and growth is highly modular by using CWDM allowing scalability in number of channels and data rate. The high output power of the optical devices leads to a big link budget enabling sensor data distribution to multiple boards without the need for optical-electrical-optical (OEO) conversion.

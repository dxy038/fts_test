The main objective of this work is to explore interoperability issues in power systems management. Technology information systems offer the ability to exchange information to enhance operational and financial effectiveness and take the most of automation systems acting online. The exploitation of potential value of interoperability in the energy sector is conducted under interoperability interaction types, as coordination, cooperation and collaboration among regional grids. In this paper, the future technology trends are discussed, focused on a number of emerging information and management technologies which will aid in achieving system integration and taking as reference the programs recently published by the European Industrial Initiative and the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology; which are the latest effort to coordinate development of a framework that includes protocols and model standards for information management to achieve systems interoperability. Finally, among these proposals made in Europe and the USA, a comparative analysis is carried out.

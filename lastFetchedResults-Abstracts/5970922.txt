In order to meet the requirements of cooperation and information sharing with different layers among some heterogeneous subsystems in power system, a wide-area cooperation multi-agent platform is proposed based on Web service and agent technology. The wide-area cooperation model is discussed firstly; the principles of the framework implementing the platform are expatiated. Some key technologies are studied, such as the design pattern of diagnostic agent, the implementation of web service components, and the negotiation mechanisms based on business event and publish/subscribe. The design and implementation of the prototype for wide-area backup protection in power system illustrate that the platform can provide bidirectional communication for wide-area cooperation agents and greatly improve the intelligence and flexibility of distributed system.

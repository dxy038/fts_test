pharmaceutical industry since almost one century ago. Various materials have been
found to have such an effect but there are still many unknown substances that have
not been discovered.
Objective: To introduce a novel mineral-based sun lotion with considerable UV
absorption properties compared to commercially available sunscreens.
Method: UV absorption properties of transparent plastic sheets covered by a uniform cream layer of different mineral-based sun lotions and a commercially available
sun lotion were tested.

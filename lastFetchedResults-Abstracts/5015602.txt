This paper presents a fuzzy-GA method to resolve dispersed generator placement for distribution systems. The problem formulation considers an objective to reduce power loss costs of distribution systems and the constraints with the number or size of dispersed generators and the deviation of the bus voltage. The main idea of solving fuzzy nonlinear goal programming is to transform the original objective function and constraints into the equivalent multi-objectives functions with fuzzy sets to evaluate their imprecise nature and solve the problem using the proposed genetic algorithm without any transformation for this nonlinear problem to a linear model or other methods. Moreover, this algorithm proposes a satisfying method to solve the constrained multiple objective problem. Analyzing the results and updating the expected value of each objective function allows the dispatcher to obtain the compromised or satisfied solution efficiently.

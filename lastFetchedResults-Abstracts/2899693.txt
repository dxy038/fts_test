Current paper presents some issues on impact of adjusting the proposed Aggregated Session Admission Control (AggSessAC) algorithm to its overall effectiveness and performance. The main objective of AggSessAC is to maximize total revenue from network serving demands. This method provides the possibility of selective and mutually comparative admission control at the cost of acceptable momentary waiting time delay, which is induced while all new aggregating demands are captured into the bundle. The simulations studies are implemented by using OMNeT++. Multiple simulation scenarios were performed to get a better understanding of the performance characteristics of the applied solution.

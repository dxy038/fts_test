The paper investigates two advanced optimisation methods for solving active flow control device shape design problem and also compares their optimisation efficiency in terms of computational cost and design quality. The first optimisation method uses Hierarchical Asynchronous Parallel Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (HAPMOEA) and the second uses Hybridized EA with Nash-Game strategies. Both optimisation method are based on a canonical evolution strategy and incorporates the concepts of parallel computing and asynchronous evaluation. For the practical test case, one of active flow control devices named Shock Control Bump (SCB) is considered and it is applied to Natural Laminar Flow (NLF) aerofoil. The concept of SCB is to decelerate supersonic flow on upper/lower surface of transonic aerofoil that leads delay of shock occurrence. Such active flow technique reduces a total drag at transonic speeds. Numerical results clearly show that Hybrid-Game helps EA to accelerate optimisation process, and also applying SCB on the suction and pressure sides significantly reduces transonic wave drag and improves lift on drag (L/D) value when compared to the baseline design.

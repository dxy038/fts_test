Summary form only given. A bidirectional transmission over a single fiber is cost-effective in a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) self-healing ring network. A bidirectional wavelength add/drop multiplexer (B-WADM) is a key component in the realization of this optical network. Several configurations of B-WADM have been proposed and demonstrated. We propose a new structure of B-WADM using multiport optical circulators and fiber Bragg gratings.

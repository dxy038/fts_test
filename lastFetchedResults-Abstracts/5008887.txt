The modeling and optimization of broadband networks for video and high-speed signals are investigated in terms of economy and upgradability. First, upgrading of broadband services for future super multimedia networks are discussed to define subscriber capacities and time frames of upgrading. It is suggested that considering super-multichannel, super-high-definition and all-optical technologies are important for accommodating storage and communication (S&amp;C) type super-multimedia services. Next, the refinement of network upgrading strategies is investigated considering the trend of all-optical technologies. Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), time division multiplexing (TDM) and photonic TDM (P-TDM) are considered for double star networks. Three types of fiber cables are defined depending on how they are shared by subscribers. Also, an excess cost factor is introduced for facilitating the comparison of WDM and TDM networks. Optimization of upgrading strategies are investigated for the above mentioned broadband networks. It is shown that photonic TDM networks can exhibit applicability much earlier than expected. Sensitivity analyses are applied to get more objective and generalized results

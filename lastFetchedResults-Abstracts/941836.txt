Amphibians have been reported as sensitive organisms whose survival has been impaired
by several environmental factors. Nevertheless, sometimes amphibians are found
inhabiting extreme environments. Thus, in order to perceive how Iberian green frogs
(Rana perezi Seoane) are able to survive in the ponds of a uranium mine (Central Portugal)
this study aimed to assess the ecotoxicological effects promoted by the mine effluent in the
early-life stages of this species. To attain this objective, eggs (collected in a nearby reference
river) and laboratory hatching larvae were exposed during 96 h to different dilutions of the
effluent. All the effects on the hatch success were recorded. The highest concentration of
the effluent produced a significant decrease in body length of larvae, as well as a decrease in
stimulus reactions and an increase in pigmentation along with tail deformities. A recovery
assay showed an increased bioaccumulation of metals, uranium included, resulting from
increased effluent exposure

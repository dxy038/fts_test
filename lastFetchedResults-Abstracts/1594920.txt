In this paper, we consider the problem of scheduling jobs on parallel machines with setup times. The setup has to be performed by a single server. The objective is to minimize the schedule length (makespan), as well as the forced idle time. The makespan problem is known to be NP-hard even for the case of two identical parallel machines. This paper presents a pseudopolynomial algorithm for the case of two machines when all setup times are equal to one. We also show that the more general problem with an arbitrary number of machines is unary NP-hard and analyze some list scheduling heuristics for this problem. The problem of minimizing the forced idle time is known to be unary NP-hard for the case of two machines and arbitrary setup and processing times. We prove unary NP-hardness of this problem even for the case of constant setup times. Moreover, some polynomially solvable cases are given.

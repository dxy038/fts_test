Prisoners’ deprivation of their fundamental rights during the execution of punishment eliminates punishment rehabilitation functions. Stablishing an educational environment, satisfaction with the authorities and educational facilities in prisons are among important activities in prisoners’ rehabilitation, which provide access to educational training. The present study was conducted by distributing a questionnaire among 239 people in the central prisons of Isfahan and Kashan in order to scrutinize the function of implementation of this right and evaluate the function of prison in accessing to desired educational environment and the prisoners’ satisfaction with authorities. The study was based on objective, descriptive-analytical and it was a survey approach. The obtained results indicated that by increasing satisfaction with educational facilities, the level of satisfaction with the performance of cultural authorities increased. Furthermore, by conducting educational programs, the tendency to commit crime is reduced. Examining the relationship between the above-mentioned variables can predict the appropriate planning for improving the performance of prisons in the area of rehabilitation of criminals.

A new class of techniques for multisensor fusion and target recognition is proposed using sequence comparison by dynamic programming, and multiple model estimation. The objective is to fuse information on the kinematic state and &#8220;nonkinematic&#8221; signature of unclassified targets, assessing the joint likelihood of all observed events for recognition. Relationships are shown to previous efforts in pattern recognition and state estimation. This research applies &#8220;classical&#8221; speech processing-related and other sequence comparison methods to moving target recognition, extends the efforts of previous researchers through improved fusion with kinematic information, relates the proposed techniques to Bayesian theory, and applies parameter identification methods to target recognition for improved understanding of the subject in general. The proposed techniques are evaluated and compared to existing approaches using the method of generalized ambiguity functions, which leads to a form of Cramer-Rao lower bound for target recognition

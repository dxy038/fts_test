The paper introduces a new type of bidirectional shaded-pole motor, which retains the use of single-turn copper shading rings. The experimental results obtained from a prototype of the new motor are presented and compared with those obtained from a more conventional bidirectional shaded-pole motor that has wound shading coils on both tips of each salient pole. It is shown that the new type of motor can be made to be fully reversing rather than simply reversible.

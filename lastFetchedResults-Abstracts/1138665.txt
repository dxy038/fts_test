In this work, the shape optimization of a single link revolute-jointed flexible manipulator is carried out. Manipulator link is considered as a Eulerâ€“Bernoulli beam and finite element based on Lagrange approach is employed for dynamic analysis. Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method is applied to extremize the objective functions. Four different optimization problems are solved for comparative study of the model for vibration suppression.

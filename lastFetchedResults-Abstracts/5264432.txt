We have considered a cognitive radio network in which there is a single cell and a Base Station (BS) within that cell. Our objective is to maximize the channel allocation of the active subscribers within that network. Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been used to solve the allocation problem. Power control has not been considered here. Our approach channel allocation using GA (CAGA) yields better result with respect to percentage of customer premise equipment (CPEs) covered than previously reported Dynamic Interference Graph (DIGA) allocation and Minimum Incremental power allocation method (MIPA).

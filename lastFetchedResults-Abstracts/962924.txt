    The objective of the present experiment was to study the pattern of follicular growth in cattle with cystic ovarian follicles and the response of ovarian cyst following GnRH treatment. Ovarian follicular development was observed daily by a B-mode instrument with 8 MHz linear-array transducer ultrasonography in 5 cows with ovarian cyst. When a structure ? 20 mm was diagnosed in an ovary, the daily ultrasonography continued for at least 10 days to confirm the presence of a cyst on the ovary. An IM injection of GnRH (GonadorelinÂ®, Aboureihan, Iran, 5 ml) was administered in 5 cows. During 10 days of ultrasonography before GnRH treatment, 1 (n=2), 2 (n=2) and 4 (n=1) follicular waves were observed in the ovaries. Four out of six cysts which were observed in 5 cows regressed at days 3 (n=2) and 6 (n=2) after GnRH injection respectively, and 2 cyst did not regress. Estrus were seen on days 4 (n=2) and 9 (n=3) after GnRH injection. A new follicular wave emerged 2 days following GnRH injection in 4 cows. The results indicate that cows with ovarian cysts have the follicular wave pattern. An injection of GnRH caused regression of the ovarian cysts and the emergence of a new follicular wave in cystic cattle.

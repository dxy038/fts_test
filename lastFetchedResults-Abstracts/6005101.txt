The objective of our work is to develop a platform independent management architecture for open distributed systems. We describe one component of this architecture which enforces the observance of formally definable management policies and executes clerical management tasks automatically. Management components are defined in terms of on object-oriented class structure and policies are represented by a variant of production rules. Rule execution and automated management tool invocation is controlled by a Marvel-based policy management environment

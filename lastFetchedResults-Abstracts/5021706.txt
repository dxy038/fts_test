The mobile user objective system (MUOS) will provide global communication for the U.S. government using WCDMA technology. The base-to-user (B2U) physical link is subject to imperfections consisting of multi-path channel effects, multiple high-powered non-MUOS in-band interferers, and competing MUOS WCDMA signals (multiple access interference (MAI)). Various techniques are developed to mitigate the effects of these channel imperfections. This paper analyzes the effects on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) caused by multi-path channel propagation, undesired interference within the B2U spectrum, and MAI.

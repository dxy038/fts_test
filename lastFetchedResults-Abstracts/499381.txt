Background and Objective: Applying “Roy’s adaptation model" and care planning based on its principles for diabetic patients needs careful assessment. Since there has not been any study in this field, so, this study was done in order to evaluate the effect of nursing care plan based on “Roy’s adaptation model” on physiologic adaptation in type II diabetics.

Materials and Methods: The study was a quasi experimental, in two before and after groups that was done in Parsian Diabetes Foundation in Mashhad in 2009. Samples were 60 diabetic patients selected non-randomly and allocated randomly into two groups. For data gathering, “Roy,s assessment form” and HgA1C test were used. In “Roy’s assessment form”, maladaptive behaviors (immobility, insomnia & etc.) and their stimulators in physiological domain were determined. Then, nursing care plan designed on obtained results and implemented for 2.5 months and a one month follow-up. Then, data repeatedly gathered and analyzed by “Chi-square test, t- test and Wilcocxon test” in SPSS17.

Results: Analyzing demographic data in two groups with Chi-square test (x2) showed that they were matched (p > 0.05). Comparison of HgA1c before and after intervention in case group by paired t-test showed a significant difference (p > 0.05). Also, Wilcoxon test showed (p > 0.05) a reduction of maladaptive behaviors in case group after intervention.

Conclusion: Applying the "care plan design" based on “Roy’s adaptation model” for increasing physiological adaptation in type II diabetic patients is strongly recommended.

Material and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 109 randomly selected febrile neonates admitted to Amir-Kabir Hospital, 2010. Blood, Cerebro Spinal Fluid (CSF) and Urine samples were sent to laboratory and the results were analyzed by Chi-Square test, using SPSS software. 
Results: Blood culture of 19 cases (17.43 %) is positive.  None of the CSF   samples are gram positive and also show the sign of Meningitis.

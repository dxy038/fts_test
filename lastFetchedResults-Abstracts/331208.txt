Objectives
Calcium phosphate cement (CPC) is a promising material for dental, periodontal, and craniofacial repairs. However, its use requires on-site powder–liquid mixing that increases the surgical placement time and raises concerns of insufficient and inhomogeneous mixing. The objective of this study was to determine a formulation of premixed CPC (PCPC) with rapid setting, high strength, and good in vitro cell viability.
Methods

PCPCs were formulated from CPC powder + non-aqueous liquid + gelling agent + hardening accelerator. Five PCPCs were thus developed: PCPC-Tartaric, PCPC-Malonic, PCPC-Citric, PCPC-Glycolic, and PCPC-Malic. Formulations and controls were compared for setting time, diametral tensile strength, and osteoblast cell compatibility.
Results

Setting time (mean ± S.D.; n = 4) for PCPC-Tartaric was 8.2 ± 0.8 min, significantly less than the 61.7 ± 1.5 min for the Premixed Control developed previously (p < 0.001). On 7th day immersion, the diametral tensile strength of PCPC-Tartaric reached 6.5 ± 0.8 MPa, higher than 4.5 ± 0.8 MPa of Premixed Control (p = 0.036). Osteoblast cells displayed a polygonal morphology and attached to the nano-hydroxyapatite crystals in the PCPCs. All cements had similar live cell density values (p = 0.126), indicating that the new PCPCs were as cell compatible as a non-premixed CPC control known to be biocompatible. Each of the new PCPCs had a cell viability that was not significantly different (p > 0.1) from that of the non-premixed CPC control.
Significance

PCPCs will eliminate the powder–liquid mixing during surgery and may also improve the cement performance. The new PCPCs supported cell attachment and yielded a high cell density and viability. Their mechanical strengths approached the reported strengths of sintered porous hydroxyapatite implants and cancellous bone. These nano-crystalline hydroxyapatite cements may be useful in dental, periodontal, and craniofacial repairs.

The objective of this paper is to design a miniaturized two-band antenna for WLAN applications. First, a folded square patch antenna is designed for the generation of an omnidirectional pattern. Then, two slots with their edges shaped into the Giuseppe Peano fractal geometry are engraved to form E-shaped patches. The structure is optimized to improve its bandwidth. The antenna size is miniaturized by 30% relative to an E-shaped folded antenna. A prototype model of the proposed antenna is fabricated and measured, which verifies its advantageous characteristics.

Objective: We sought to test the hypothesis that vaginal delivery compared with elective cesarean delivery results in improved neonatal outcome in fetuses with a known isolated ventral wall defect. Study Design: We performed a retrospective chart review. Results: Between 1989 and 1999, we identified 102 infants with a confirmed antenatal diagnosis of an isolated ventral wall defect with either the diagnosis of an omphalocele or gastroschisis. Sixty-six infants were delivered by cesarean and 36 were delivered vaginally. There were no significant demographic differences between the study groups or between the two sites except that one center (Cincinnati) usually delivered these fetuses by cesarean whereas the other (Louisville) usually delivered such fetuses vaginally. Overall, there were a greater number of infants with gastroschisis than omphalocele (gastroschisis, N = 71; omphalocele, N = 31). After we controlled for primary versus staged closure of ventral wall defect and gestational age at delivery; the medians and interquartile ranges for cesarean and vaginal delivery were 39 (25, 63) days versus 42 (26, 75) days, respectively (P = .32), for neonatal length of stay and 13 (9, 18) days versus 13 (9, 26) days, respectively (P = .16), for days to enteral feeding. After we controlled for the size of the defect and the amount of bowel resected, the odds of primary closure given a vaginal delivery was about half that given a cesarean delivery (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-1.69), but this was not statistically significant. There was no statistically significant difference in the rates of neonatal death (2 [3%] vs 2 [6%]; P = .61) and neonatal sepsis (2 [3%] vs 4 [11%]; P = .18) for cesarean versus vaginal delivery. Maternal length of stay after delivery was found to be 1 day less after vaginal delivery [vaginal, 2 (2, 2) days; cesarean, 3 (2, 3) days; P = .0001]. There were 5 instances of maternal complications, and all 5 pregnancies were delivered by cesarean (P = .16). Conclusion: Fetuses with an antenatal diagnosis of an isolated ventral wall defect may safely be delivered vaginally, and cesarean delivery should be performed for obstetric indications only.

Underactuated system is a nonholonomic system that has less than the system degrees of freedom controller, light weight, low cost, energy consumption and many other advantages. This under actuated hexapod bio-robot-RR Robot, the objective is minimizing the energy loss, the use of genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization RR Robot trajectory planning, simulation results show two algorithms to solve the optimization problem RR Robot trajectory is effective, especially PSO few more iterations, less energy consumption and computation advantages.

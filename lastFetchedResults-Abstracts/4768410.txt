Honey quality evaluation is a complex task and is carried out by traditional technique using melissopalynological method. However this method involves a large range of error in interpretation of the result. Hence demand for instrumental methods to assess the identification of pollen and quality of monofloral honey in an objective manner is necessary. For discrimination between different monofloral honey samples and instrumental evaluation of their quality, a new method employing the principle of cyclic voltammetry is proposed in this paper. The technique has been investigated using platinum as working electrode and the resultant current from the potentiostat has been considered for data analysis. The use of Principal component analysis proved useful in characterizing honey samples from different botanical origins.

In this paper, we investigate bidirectional associative memory Cohenâ€“Grossberg neural networks with time delays. By applying the Young inequality technique, Dini derivative, and introducing many real parameters, a series of new and useful criteria on the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium point and its global asymptotical stability are established. It is shown that in some special cases of the results, the stability criteria can be easily checked. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the result obtained in this paper.

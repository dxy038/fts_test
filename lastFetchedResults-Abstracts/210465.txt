Objective: Stroke one of the most common diseases in neurology and is the third cause of
death in old age. Impairment of motor power and other neurological deficits and imposes a
significant financial burden on both patients' family and health care system. The aim of the
present study was to assess the effectiveness in improving the muscular power among these
patients.
Subjects and Methods: In this study on 100 patients (50 females and 50 males) diagnosed by
history, physical examination and brain Cf-scan who had experienced thrombotic eVA on
superior branch of the middle cerebral artery and had a normal lipid profile on laboratory
examination and did not previously receive lovastatin therapy, were allocated into lovastatin
and control groups. The lovastatin group (n= 49; 22 males and 27 females) received 20
mg/day for one month. While the control group (n= 5I; 28 males and 24 females). Both
groups received usual standard treatment of thrombotic eVA (ASA 325mg/daily and
dipyridamol 25mg/tds) and similar physiotherapy interventions. The muscle power at first,
one week and 30 days after starting trial on each patient was measured with the same NIHSS
scaling.
Results: Both groups had some improvement at the end of trial but patients received
lovastatin had a significantly better improvement (P<O.OOI). In the lovastatin treated group,
better improvement was observed among younger patients (51-65). There was no significant
statistical correlation between sex and weight with response to treatment.
Conclusion: The finding of this study confirms previous clinical trials and suggests that
lovastatin improved muscle power in thrombotic eVA patients.

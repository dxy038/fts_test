Background: the interpretation of the increase in stride-to-stride variability of stride time (StV)
regarding the evolution of cognitive deficits across the dementia spectrum is matter of debate. Objective: the aim
of this study was to compare StV at usual and fast-pace walking speeds of mci patients with that of cognitively
healthy individuals (chi) and alzheimer’s disease (aD) patients with mild dementia, while considering the
effects of potential confounders. Methods: StV while walking at usual and fast-pace walking speeds was
recorded with the GaitRite® system from 116 older adults (mean age 75.6±6.5 years; 55.2% female) divided
into 3 groups according to their cognitive status (44 chi, 39 mci patients and 33 aD patients with mild
dementia). Results: the full adjusted multiple linear regression models showed that high StV was associated
with slow gait speed at usual-pace walking speed (P=0.002) and with the mci status at fast-pace walking speed
(P=0.015). Conclusions: high StV at fast-pace walking speed was a specific gait disturbance of mci patients in
the sample of studied participants, and thus could be used in the future as a specific biomarker of mci patients

A process demonstration day was held at the 9th International Software Process Workshop (ISPWS), 1994. The objective of the demonstration day was twofold: to evaluate how different systems and environments support/guide users in the fulfilment of their project activities, and to bring forth technical issues identified by the different implementers in the context of their formalisms and systems. A scenario example was defined to represent issues in the life of real projects and to serve as a common example for demonstration purposes. This document gives some background to the scenario, briefly describes the systems demonstrated, and provides a commentary about the demonstrations. Architecture depictions of those systems appear in the Appendix

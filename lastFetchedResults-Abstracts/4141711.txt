We experimentally demonstrated a novel lightwave centralized hybrid bidirectional access network for integration of wavelength-division-multiplexing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing passive optical network (WDM-OFDM-PON) with radio-over-fiber systems employing multiwavelength generation and the carrier-reuse technique. In this proposed architecture, one of the main impairments of bidirectional transmission over single fiber link, Rayleigh backscattering, can be reduced, because of different frequencies for downlinks and uplinks. In the wired transmission over 25-km single-mode fiber (SMF-28), power penalties are less than 0.5 dB for both 11.29-Gb/s OFDM-16 quadrature amplitude modulation (16QAM) downlink and 5.65-Gb/s OFDM quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) uplink. Moreover, successful access network transmissions have been demonstrated since the error vector magnitude (EVM) measurements for worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) 17.28-Mb/s OFDM-64QAM downstream and 11.52-Mb/s OFDM-16QAM upstream are always under the thresholds of IEEE 802.16e.

An improved command switching control strategy is proposed to solve the multi-objective switching control problem with the acceleration and temperature safety protection for turbofan aero-engines. An improved switching law is designed to avoid frequent switching. Properly designed integrator reset technique is utilized to improve the thrust tracking performance. Switching control parameters can be optimized to obtain satisfactory safety and acceleration performance. The proposed switching controller is applied to a linear parameter-varying model of the aero-engine. Simulation shows that the proposed switching control strategy can bring the improvement on both safety and acceleration.

This paper proposes a strategy management of Fuel Cell Vehicle. The objective is to design an energetic strategy for the Low Speed Vehicle (LSV) Nemo. The vehicle is equipped with Axane fuel cell and a battery pack. The modeling is based on the Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR). The model is validated on the vehicle test bench Nemo The strategy is based on the knowledge of the maximum and minimum power limits of the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) Axane. The strategy gives two modes of running, the first one gives a maximum efficiency run of the PEMFC and the other one the maximum power of PEMFC.

Adherence to anti-tuberculosis (TB) medications is a critical issue in limiting the spread of the disease throughout the world. In South Africa, medications to treat TB are available at no cost. The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics of medication adherence in a sample of patients diagnosed with TB (N = 159). The relationships among sociodemographic variables, social support, quality of life, and adherence were explored in this cross-sectional and descriptive study. Self-report data were obtained from a community-based sample of TB-infected individuals who received care in outpatient clinics in Durban, South Africa. Data were collected from the 159 Zulu- and/or English-speaking respondents who agreed to participate in the study. Logistic regression analyses indicated that 41% of the variance in adherence was explained by the model, with nonadherent participants more likely to have less frequent symptoms and more available nutrition than their adherent counterparts. The adherent group was more likely to have increased symptoms, more days with nothing to eat, and fewer appointments with their health care provider. Implications for clinical practice and research are discussed.

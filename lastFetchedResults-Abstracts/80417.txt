We consider the optimal stochastic scheduling of a two-stage tandem queue with two parallel servers. The servers can serve either queue at any point in time and the objective is to minimize the total holding costs incurred until all jobs leave the system. We characterize sufficient and necessary conditions under which it is optimal to allocate both servers to the upstream or downstream queue. We then conduct a numerical study to investigate whether the results shown for the static case also hold for the dynamic case. Finally, we provide a numerical study that explores the benefits of having two flexible parallel servers which can work at either queue versus servers dedicated to each queue. We discuss the results' implications for cross-training workers to perform multiple tasks.

So we studied the prevalence of obesity in children and the related factors in Tehran. Material & Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 1800 female pupils. Weight and height were measured and BMI (Body Mass Index) was calculated. SPSS-I0 was used for statistical analysis. Results: Prevalence of obesity and overweight were 7.7 percent (95%CI= 6.25% - 9.3%) and 13.3 percent (95%CI= 1 I.76% - 14.95%), respectively.
There was a significant correlation between obesity and age (P=0.01), type of school (P0.002), appearance (P<0.001) and self-image (P<0.001).
Conclusion: The findings necessitate interventional programs for identification and treatment of obese children.

In contrast to hybrid electric cars (HECs), the issues concerning cost, volume, and reliability are even more rigorous when developing hybrid electric scooters (HESs). Therefore, the drive topology and control strategy used in HEC cannot be applied to HES directly. This paper presents a single-stage bidirectional dc/ac converter based on a general full-bridge inverter. The converter is designed for a low-voltage brushless dc motor/alternator (BLDCM/A) used in HESs, in which the additional bulky inductor and power switches are eliminated in the proposed design. In order to increase the reliability of the commutation process, a cost-effective sensorless control scheme for the motor and alternator commutation is developed. The commutation signals are extracted directly from the average terminal voltages, in which the motor neutral voltage, multistage analog Alters, analog-to-digital converters, and the complex digital phase-shift (delay) circuits are eliminated. In addition, instead of using the complex flux- weakening control technique, the winding-changeover technique is exploited to extend the range of the operating speed. With attractive features, such as low cost and ease of implementation, the proposed approach is particularly suitable for electric bikes, electric scooters, HESs, etc. Theoretical analysis and several experiments are conducted to justify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

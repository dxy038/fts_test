The problem of the scheduling of the multiuser H.264 video transmission over wireless networks is addressed in this work. A cross-layer algorithm, including the application (APP) layer, the media access control (MAC) layer and the physical (PHY) layer, is presented. More especially, a compressed method is proposed to estimate the video quality contribution caused by each packet in the APP. The objective is to maximising video qualities by satisfying the delay constraint and the fairness among all users. The algorithm is compatible with the emerging wireless standards, such as IEEE 802.16 and high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA). Simulations show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the conventional scheduling schemes in terms of received video qualities as well as the fairness properties.

A number of research papers have used different types of similarity and dissimilarity coefficients for determining part families. In cellular manufacturing systems, most machines are capable of performing more than one operation, which makes parts rerouting feasible. When a part is rerouted, it affects the cell performance. Most of the suggested approaches in the literature develop a new similarity coefficient based on mathematical analysis, however, these methods tend to disregard alternative routes during machine failure. The main objective of this paper is to identify part families based on a new similarity coefficient which considers the number of alternative routes available during machine failure. Based on the new similarity coefficient, the part families were identified by using a p-median model.

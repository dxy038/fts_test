Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) would affect the data acquired by a future spaceborne hyperspectral sensor with pointing capability. BRDF of rice was measured by FieldSpec and an airborne hyperspectral sensor (AISA) in this study to improve estimate accuracy of rice yield and crude protein using BRDF correction. As a result, an error of reflectance caused by BRDF was corrected. In addition, this study confirmed that estimate accuracy of crude protein was unaffected by BRDF in range of AISAÂ´s FOV (22 degrees).

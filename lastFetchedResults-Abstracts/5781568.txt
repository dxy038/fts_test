Nominal color coding is widely used by the image processing community to represent the output of a classification-segmentation process. In order to automate color-class association we propose a suitable description scheme for both the color set to be used and the image to be coded. Using this description we then define a suitable energy function for HopfieldÂ´s neural networks. The objective is to associate more &#8220;conspicuous&#8221; colors with less &#8220;visible&#8221; classes, assigning highly contrasting colors to classes with a high &#8220;adjacency&#8221;

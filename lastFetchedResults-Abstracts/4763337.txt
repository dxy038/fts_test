In this paper, a new perceptual based rate control algorithm for MPEG-2 is presented. The algorithm first determines the target bit count for each frame using simple statistical models. Precise bit allocation is used to adjust the macroblock quantization scale factors to meet the given bit count, with the uniform visual fidelity as the primary objective. Since the buffer is very stable, it is less sensitive to transmission delay. Experimental results showed that it gave better visual quality and less buffer variations as compared to the TM5 rate control scheme

In this paper, we propose a server-client coordinated joint optimal frame selection with adaptive playout for delivering stored video under both limited channel bandwidth and finite client buffer condition. In particular, the client will reduce the frame playout rate whenever its buffer fullness level falls below a given threshold in an attempt to prevent buffer underflow. And when the buffer fullness exceeds the threshold, the client will switch back to the normal frame playout rate. The server is aware of the adaptive playout decision made by the client and incorporates the decision into its optimal frame selection framework for joint optimization. The objective is to minimize the number of frames that must be discarded in order to prevent client buffer underflow or overflow and make full use of the limited bandwidth resource.

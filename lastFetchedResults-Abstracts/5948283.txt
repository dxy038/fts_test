The objective of this article is to evaluate the influence of the cross-talk and channel imbalance calibration on the estimation of the entropy and the alpha images. Few studies can be found in SAR literature concerning the influence of the polarimetric image calibration process on the target decomposition methods and their consequences on the characterization and discrimination of different ground targets. This influence is illustrated here by using a methodology based on an L-band fully polarimetric SAR data acquired by the SIPAM (Amazon Protection System) airborne R99-SAR over two areas of study, located in the Brazilian Amazon Forest and urban area regions.

Although anatomical variations in the arterial pattern of the hand have been the subject of many studies, information
on the diameter of the superficial palmar arch contributing vessels and its branches are rarely found in the
literature. The objective of the current study was to evaluate these arterial variations, with special attention to
the diameter of the superficial palmar arch contributing vessels and its major branches. Forty-six hands from male
embalmed human cadavers were evaluated, 21 right hands and 25 left hands. Complete arches were present
in 43% on the right and in 52% on the left. Arches were completed by the median artery in two cases. Variations
were more common at the radial side of the arch and on left hands. Comparison of vessel diameters revealed the
radial artery to be significantly larger than the ulnar artery but the ulnar artery to be larger than the superficial
branch of the radial artery. The diameters of the common digital arteries were not different with regard to
complete or incomplete arches, or with regard to the presence of the median artery

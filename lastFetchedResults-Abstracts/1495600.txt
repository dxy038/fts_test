No-tillage, N fertilization and cover crops are known to play an important role in conserving or increasing SOC and STN but the effects of their interactions are less known.

er to evaluate the single and combined effects of these techniques on SOC and STN content under Mediterranean climate, a long term experiment started in 1993 on a loam soil (Typic Xerofluvent) in Central Italy.

perimental variants are: conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT), four N fertilization rates (N0, N1, N2 and N3) and four soil cover crop (CC) types (C – no cover crop; NL – non-legume CC; LNL – low nitrogen supply legume CC, and HNL – high nitrogen supply legume CC).

trogen fertilization rates (N0, N1, N2 and N3) were: 0, 100, 200, 300 kg N ha−1 for maize (Zea mays, L.); 0, 60, 120,180 kg N a−1 for durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.); 0, 50, 100, 150 kg N ha−1 for sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.).

993 to 2008, under the NT system the SOC and STN content in the top 30 cm soil depth increased by 0.61 and 0.04 Mg ha−1 year−1 respectively. In the same period, the SOC and STN content under the CT system decreased by a rate of 0.06 and 0.04 Mg ha−1 year−1 respectively.

 the experimental period, N1, N2 and N3 increased the SOC content in the 0–30 cm soil layer at a rate of 0.14, 0.45 and 0.49 Mg ha−1 year−1. Only the higher N fertilization levels (N2 and N3) increased STN content, at a rate of 0.03 and 0.05 Mg ha−1 year−1.

L and HNL cover crops increased SOC content by 0.17, 0.41 and 0.43 Mg C ha−1 year−1 and −0.01, +0.01 and +0.02 Mg N ha−1 year−1.

icant interactions among treatments were evident only in the case of the N fertilization by tillage system interaction on SOC and STN concentration in the 0–10 cm soil depth in 2008.

served SOC and STN variations were correlated to C returned to the soil as crop residues, aboveground cover crop biomass and weeds (C input).

clude that, under our Mediterranean climate, it is easier to conserve or increase SOC and STN by adopting NT than CT. To reach this objective, the CT system requires higher N fertilization rates and introduction of highly productive cover crops.

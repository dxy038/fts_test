A new network reconfiguration approach with distributed generations (DG) is presented for minimum power loss and switches operation times in which the comprehensive cost is taken for objective function and the optimal structure of distributed network can be found through the improved adaptive GA. At the same time the coding method based on the loop is adapted which greatly reduces the infeasible solutions produced during genes algorithm operations in the application to distribution system reconfiguration. The test conducted on IEEE33-bus system has showed that the total profits were increased greatly with this method, and the power loss can be reduced, the voltage profile also increased.

Today, the reappraisal of the topic of the objective and historical basis of "Islamic civilization" in the discourse and literature of the Islamic Republic of Iranâ€™s revolution has become a scientific concern. This study tries to respond to a part of this problem by using the approach of futurology and resting on the method of "exploring the historical horizon" of the Islamic Republic of Iran. In the history of every nation, identifying the horizons contributes to considering and determining the future of the nation. In the conflict between the active approach and passive approach to the phenomenon of the appearance of Imam Mahdi, the Islamic Republic of Iran opted for the active approach that led to the historical development of its nation and the outbreak of the Islamic Revolution. Showing perseverance and raising self-awareness of this historical futurology, Islamic revolution could outline its version as a ground-preparing civilization by determining its bright future i.e. continuous evolution which paves the way for the appearance of Imam Mahdi.

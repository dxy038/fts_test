The objective of our work is to develop an automatic system to evaluate Arabic/French dysphonic classification by modeling speech signals using a statistical modeling based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), which is state of art in speaker recognition. Speakers were conducted at Annaba University Hospital center (CHU) in the ENT service in the presence of a group composed of 8 medical specialists. Results of the experiment show that an automatic system is able to identify dysphonic speakers with an acceptable performance either in French or in Arabic language.

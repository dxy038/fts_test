Objective: Esterase activity in Candida albicans and characterization of some of its properties was the aim of the present study.
Materials and Methods: C.albicans was grown under different conditions then using a calorimetric method, the esterase activity of the medium supernatant, as well as cell wall and cytoplasmic extract of the harvested yeast cells were assessed. The effect of some variables was also tested and optimal conditions for enzyme activity determined.
Results: The results indicated that after growth on YPG medium, the cytoplasmic extract of C.albicans shows esterase activity after incubation at 37Â°C, pH 7.5, phosphate buffer 10 mM, and incubation time equal to 90 minutes to provide its optimal activity. The maximal activity was observed against a-Naphthyl acetate follow by p-Naphthyl acetate as substrate. Activity decreased by increasing the substrate's carbon atoms number. Therefore, the enzymatic activity was respectively decreased against a-Naphthyl caprilate, a-Naphthyl laurate, and a-Naphthyl palmitate. Conclusion: C.albicans has a kind of intracellular esterase activity and its expression is not affected by the lipase induction medium. Evaluation of enzyme activity as a diagnostic or therapeutic target is recommended.

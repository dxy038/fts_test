This research expands the scope of wireless sensor network (WSN) optimization from single objective to multi objective optimization. It introduces a WSN´s energy-aware and coverage preserve hierarchal clustering and routing model based on multi-objective bat swarm optimization algorithm. Two objectives are taken into consideration; coverage and nodes residual energies. The proposed model optimizes the WSN by selecting the best fitting set of nodes as cluster heads. It works to maximize the WSN´s coverage and to minimize the nodes´ consumed energy. This minimizes the number of active cluster heads while preserving a higher percentage of the covered nodes in WSN. It extends the longevity of the WSN´s lifetime and achieves good functioning reliability. The proposed optimization model overcomes the WSN´s coverage and lifetime challenges. The proposed model outperforms the LEACH routing and clustering protocol.

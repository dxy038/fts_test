Objective: Our purpose was to investigate the effects of ovariectomy and estradiol and testosterone treatment on sildenafil- induced changes in genital hemodynamics and vaginal lubrication. Study Design: Female New Zealand White rabbits were either kept intact or underwent ovariectomy. Two weeks after ovariectomy, animals were treated with vehicle, testosterone, or a combination of estradiol and testosterone for 14 days. Genital hemodynamics and vaginal lubrication were recorded at the end of the treatment period. Results: Ovariectomy caused a marked decrease in vaginal lubrication but did not significantly alter genital hemodynamics. In contrast to testosterone treatment of ovariectomized animals, estradiol treatment significantly increased genital blood flow and vaginal lubrication above that observed in control animals. Sildenafil administration caused a significant increase in genital hemodynamics irrespective of the hormonal status. Conclusion: This study suggests that estradiol but not testosterone modulates genital hemodynamics and that sildenafil enhances genital blood flow irrespective of hormonal status.

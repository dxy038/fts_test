Despite a paucity of objective hemodynamic evidence, cardiomyoplasty has been shown to subjectively improve functional status and symptoms. In addition, the factors associated with successful cardiomyoplasty have not been defined. We have been using magnetic resonance techniques to quantify stroke volume and the three-dimensional motion of the heart during cardiomyoplasty. We have also been studying the regional mechanics and blood flow of partially isolated latissimus dorsi to determine whether the force generation and shortening of the proximal portion of the latissimus dorsi (that have typically been measured) are representative of the distal portion that is in contact with the heart.

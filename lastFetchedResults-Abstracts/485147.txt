Background and Objective: JWH133 is known to have cannabinoid-2 (CB2) receptor agonist properties.
Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-Z (COX-2) inhibitor, is also known to have antinociceptive
properties. Endocannabinoids produce analgesia possibly through cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway. The aim
of the present work was: 10 study the effect of celecoxib on JWH133 induced antinociception and to
compare the effects of two different dose ranges of celecoxib (mg/kg and nano g1kg) on the JWHI33
antiniciceptive effect.
Materials and Methods: We have studied the possible interaction of administration of mg/kg (50-200
mg/kg) and Ultra-Low Dose (ULD) (25 and 50 ng/kg) of celecoxib on the antinociceptive effect of
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of JWHI33 using formalin test in mice.
Results: JWHI33 (0.01, 0.1 and I mg/kg) induced antinociceptive effect just in phase I of the formalin test.
Celecoxib (50-200 mg/kg) and Its ULD (25 and 50 nglkg) attenuated and potentiated, JWH133 induced
antinociception, respectively.
Conclusions: It is concluded that JWH-133 induced antinociception is modulated by celecoxib and mg/kg
doses of celecoxib showed opposite effects compare to its ultra-low doses.

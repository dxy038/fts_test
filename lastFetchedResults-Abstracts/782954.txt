Objective Associations were examined between
neighbourhood income inequality and neighbourhood
socioeconomic deprivation on the one hand
and (mental) health related quality of life (QoL) on the
other, in Maastricht, the Netherlands. Methods Three
different data sources were used: 1) neighbourhood socioeconomic
indicators, 2) house prices per postal code
area aggregated to an inequality measure at neighbourhood
level, and 3) individual data measured in a family
cohort study.Maastricht families with children aged approximately
11 years received questionnaires including
the parentsâ€™ QoL and family socioeconomic status (response
rate: 60%). Multilevel analyses were conducted
using neighbourhood level, family level, and individual
level data. Results Income inequality at neighbourhood
level was not associated with QoL, whereas socioeconomic
deprivation was associated with environment-related
QoL. Conclusion The relative income hypothesis,
according to which it is the contrast in deprivation
rather than the absolute level of deprivation that influences
health outcomes, does not hold at the neighbourhood
level. Income inequality may only have an effect in
larger areas containing sufficient socioeconomic contrast.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine the best available antepartum fetal testing methods according to the underlying pathophysiologic condition.
Study design
We reviewed the current literature and our clinical experience with respect to condition-specific antepartum fetal testing.
Results
The efficacy of most antepartum tests that we use today is not supported by randomized controlled clinical trials, but from observational nonrandomized studies and expert opinion (evidence levels II or III).
Conclusion
Based on the available evidence, the accuracy of a test depends on the underlying pathophysiologic condition. To improve accuracy, we must use condition-specific fetal testing.

A formulation of the optimal reactive power flow problem for shipboard power system and results from tests of the chaos particle swarm optimization (CPSO) algorithm are presented in this paper. The objective function of the mathematical model minimizes the real power losses and voltage collapse risk by evaluating linearized reactive power margin index of weak node or nodes. Reactive power margin is the power difference between current running point and voltage collapse point. The proposed methodology evolves a unique version of PSO by adding a chaotic local search (CLS). Numerical example on a test system of a shipÂ´s distribution network demonstrates the introduced methodology succeeds in guaranteeing real power loss minimization and reactive power margin maximization.

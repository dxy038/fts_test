OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to compare two antiincontinence procedures in patients with severe genitourinary prolapse and coexisting clinical or potential stress incontinence.
STUDY DESIGN: In addition to cystopexy, 109 patients with a urethrocystocele of grade 2 or more and a positive stress test result with prolapse reduction received posterior pubourethral ligament plication or Pereyra suspension.
RESULTS: Of 55 patients undergoing posterior pubourethral ligament plication, 15 were clinically and 40 potentially incontinent; the same figures were 21 and 33, respectively, among 54 patients undergoing the Pereyra procedure. Follow-up was for 3 to 9 years. Subjective (60% vs 71%, p = 0.72) and objective (27% vs 57%, p = 0.14) cure rates were not statistically different among patients who were clinically incontinent (posterior pubourethral ligament plication vs Pereyra suspension). Among potentially incontinent patients, subjective (85% vs 100%, p = 0.03) and objective (50% vs 76%, p = 0.04) continence rates were higher after the Pereyra procedure. Overall, the cotton swab test had negative results (maximum straining angle â‰¤30 degrees) after successful surgery in 79% and 96%, respectively, of patients (p = 0.03). Four subjects (7%) underwent removal of one Pereyra suture because of urinary retention or suprapubic wound infection.
CONCLUSION: Cystopexy with Pereyra suspension is recommended, particularly for patients with prolapse and potential stress incontinence.(Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;176:337-43.)

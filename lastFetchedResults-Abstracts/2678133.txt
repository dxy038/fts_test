Argyrosomus hololepidotus belonging to the family Sciendae is one of the most valuable fish species from both commercial and nutritional aspects. Nonetheless, scarce data are available on its biology, macroscopic morphology and microscopic features. The objective of this study was investigating morphology of digestive tube and accessory glands in Argyrosomus hololepidotus. For this a total of six fish from the Persian Gulf shores in Mahshahr were provided and immediately their abdomens were opened and subjected to morphological and topographical study.Digestive tube consists of a short esophagus, a saccular stomach, leaf like pyloric caeca, sigmoid intestine, rectum and finally anus. The liver possesses three distinct lobes including right lobe, a short middle lobe and along left lobe. A gall bladder is also observed in vicinity of the right lobe. On the basis of the results of the present study, regarding to the feeding route in  Argyrosomus hololepidotus, digestive tube has a short length and besides greater bulk of the stomach compared to the other parts is significant.

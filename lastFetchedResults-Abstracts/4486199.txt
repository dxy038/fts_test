We proposed a practical approach for e-government evaluation which combines the subjective indexes with the subjective indexes. There are some limitations in traditional method which is single resources of data make evaluation too subjectively. In order to avoid it, we gain the subjective indexes by userÂ´s survey and experts review, and gain the objective indexes by web usage mining approach and financial statistic. We use these indexes to give the e-government website a comprehensive evaluation.

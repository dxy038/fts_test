Background & Objective: Evaluation is an essential process for educational institutions, and one of the most common methods of evaluation of teachers is evaluation by students. Students are the real customers in the educational process; therefore, their judgments should be important variables in determining teaching status of teachers. According to customer-centric principles, the consumerâ€™s satisfaction must be met. This study assessed the validation of the current teacher evaluation form in theoretical courses.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study investigating the validity and reliability of the teacher evaluation form that is completed by students, and identifying some factors affecting student evaluations. To determine content validity of the teacher evaluation form, 20 expert teachers were selected proportional to the number of teachers of each school of the Hamadan University of Medical Sciences. To assess the reliability coefficient of the form, 189 students were selected from different schools by proportional random sampling.
Results: According to the results, questions such as rate of adherence to the determined topics, providing practical application of teaching materials, and the efficacy of determined assignments did not have the necessary validity score. However, the results indicated that validity of the questionnaire was acceptable. In the present study, the Spearmen-Brown correlation coefficient indicated that the teacher evaluation form did not have an acceptable reliability (r = 0.456, P  <  0.001).
Conclusion: The current teacher evaluation form has an acceptable content validity, but it does not seem reliable.

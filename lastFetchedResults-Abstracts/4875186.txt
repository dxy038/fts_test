We investigate the applicability of simplified decoders of convolutional codes to the case of multilevel coding. The objective is to examine the use of reduced complexity algorithms for the decoding of multilevel codes combined with multiresolution QAM, as proposed for the terrestrial transmission of HDTV signals in Europe. The main purpose is to see if there is an additional coding gain achievable via the use of the multistage decoders based on the M-algorithm and RSSE approach and if so, how large it is. The analysis is done on the basis of the asymptotic coding gain (minimum distances) and simulation

In this paper we consider the problem of optimal wiring of VLSI circuits. The topological placement of the circuit elements (macros) on the chip is assumed to have a special hierarchical structure, i.e., to be a slicing floorplan, represented by a binary (slicing) tree. Instead of the usual objective of minimum wire length, we consider the problem of minimizing the overall area of the wired floorplan. For the case of a single multiterminal net connecting n macros, we obtain a wiring algorithm of complexity O(nd), where d is the depth of the slicing tree. The case of several multiterminal nets is still under investigation.

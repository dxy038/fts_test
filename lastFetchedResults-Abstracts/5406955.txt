R. Morrow (1991) has simulated the positive corona discharge of SF <sub>6</sub> gas by using the flux-corrected transport (FCT) method for one-dimensional continuity equations in which a single channel model was applied and only the longitudinal drift of charged particles and diffusion of electrons was considered. In this work, the authors simulate the discharge phenomena of the SF<sub>6</sub> gas using a model that considers both of the longitudinal and the transverse diffusion of electrons and the bidirectional drift of charged particles. They adopt a multichannel model: a double channel model; and a triple channel model. They expand the continuity equations by considering the conditions mentioned above and also take account or the photoionization process in the equations. Then they apply the FCT method to the multichannel model. The result of simulation based on the triple channel model shows that charged particles move actively within a certain radius. The simulation results using the multichannel model are a better approximation to the actually measured waveform of corona pulse current than those of the single channel model

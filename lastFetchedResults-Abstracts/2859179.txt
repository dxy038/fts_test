The rapid growth of companies, the departure of employees, the complexity of the new technology and the rapid proliferation of information, are reasons why companies seek to capitalize their expert knowledge. STMicroelectronics has opted for a Wiki to effectively capitalize and share some of its knowledge. However, to accomplish its objective, the Wiki content must correspond to usersÂ´ needs. Therefore, we propose a user centred approach for the definition of knowledge characteristics and its integration in the Wiki. Our knowledge representation is based on three facets &#8220;What, Why and How&#8221;. In this paper, the approach is applied to the Reporting activity at STMicroelectronics, which is considered as a knowledge intensive activity.

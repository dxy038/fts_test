Manufacturing shop floor dynamics such as tool breakage or machine breakdown will disrupt the execution of planned production schedules. To deal with such disruptions, a multi-agent system (MAS) based approach has been considered as a means to perform a local rescheduling of affected manufacturing activities by dynamically allocating resources while guided by the objective of minimizing the impact of such disruptions to the planned schedules in order to avoid a global rescheduling. A service-oriented architecture (SOA) was used to allow the negotiation process of dynamic resource allocation to be loosely-coupled between manufacturing resource consumers and manufacturing resource providers.

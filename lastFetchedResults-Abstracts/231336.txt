The model for the pre-equilibrium emission of light composite particles in the framework of the exciton model is used at intermediate energies. The main objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive and improved description of the energy spectra and double differential cross sections of nucleon and the light composite particle (deuteron, triton, helium and alpha-particle) emissions in the intermediate-energy range. The energy spectra and double differential cross sections for n + 208Pb reaction are calculated and analyzed by using nuclear theoretical models. Theoretical calculated results are compared with existing experimental data.

The particle swarm optimization algorithm presents a new way to find an optimal solution of a complex optimization problem, where each particle represents a solution to the problem. The particle swarm optimization algorithm can improves the global search ability by adding a constriction factor. In this paper, the algorithm is applied to pattern optimization of a 37-element hexagon antenna array. Simulation results show that the optimized pattern of antenna array approaches the objective pattern.

Objective: Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread protozoan parasite that infects a broad range of warm blooded animals and humans. The present study was investigated to evaluate testosterone, alkaline phosphatase activity and malondialdehyde in male rats experimentally infected by Toxoplasma gondii, RH strain.
Material & Methods: Male Wistar rats (n=20) were allocated into two groups, group one (n=10) that received 0.6 cc tachyzoites of T. gondii intraperitoneally (I.P.), and control group (n=10) that received nothing. Animals were kept in standard conditions. 30 days after inducing Toxoplasma infection, 5cc blood was collected for assessment of serum testosterone, alkaline phosphatase and malondialdehyde levels. Epididymis tissues of Rats in whole groups were removed and prepared for analysis.
Results: Alkaline phosphatase, and Testosterone were significantly increased in group that was infected by T.gondii in comparison to control group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in mean concentration of Malondialdehyde level in infected group in comparison to control group (p > 0.05).Epididymis weights in toxoplasmosis group was significantly decreased in comparison to control group (P < 0.05). Positive brown alkaline phosphatase were observed in epididym tissue  of infected toxoplasma group in comparison to control group.
Conclusion: This study showed that T. gondii has augmenter effects on alkaline phosphatase activity, testosterone and has harmful effect on epididymis tissue

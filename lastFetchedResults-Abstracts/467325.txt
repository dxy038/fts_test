Objective: Cells that were cotransfected with herpes simplex virusâ€“16 and the herpes simplex virus type 2 Xho-2 DNA induce tumors in nude mice. In a cross-sectional study, we investigated the role of herpes simplex virus type 2 as a cofactor to human papillomavirus in cervical cancer. Study Design: Cervical cells that were obtained with an endocervical Cytobrush brush (Medscand) from 439 women (50 women with cancer lesions, 65 women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 80 women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 244 healthy subjects) and DNA that was extracted from 150 cervical cancer biopsy specimens were analyzed with polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus type 2 Xho-2 and Bgl IIC transforming DNA sequences. Results: All 439 cervical samples and 150 cervical cancer biopsy specimens tested negative for herpes simplex virus type 2 Xho-2 and Bgl IIC DNA by polymerase chain reaction. Overall, none of 200 samples (0%) from women with invasive cervical cancer contained herpes simplex virus type 2 Xho-2 or Bgl IIC DNA (95% CI, 0.0-1.8). Conclusion: Although herpes simplex virus type 2 BglIIN transforms epithelial cells in vitro, it was not detected in cervical cancer specimens. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:129-34.)

This work focuses on the evaluation of the need and help required by elderly and dependent persons. We study the most widely used evaluation models in the health domain. We propose a new algorithm to assess and compare the performance of these models and the possibility to use them in future eHealth systems and platforms. The objective is to shed some light on the weakness of existing models and to gain a better knowledge about the context of persons in order to provide them with eHealth services that match their context and meet their needs.

The objective of the work is to propose a resource discovery model for distributed resources using grid brokering and dispute solving techniques in a grid environment. The synchronization between local and external schedulers and the effective utilization of the available resources can be achieved by dispute solving with periodical resource auditing processes by an agent technique. The discovery of resources after the dispute is the main focus of the work where the proposed Detachable Identifiable Secured COVERage (DISCOVER) algorithm discovers the resources in the case of resource conflicts and friction. The DISCOVER algorithm first detaches the misbehaving or faulty resources due to disagreement and identifies not only the compatible resources based upon the operational speed of the processes to complete the given task described by the Job Submission Description. The interoperability issues due to the varying operational environment like operating system, application and browser are considered in the discovery model. The model was checked with the integrated framework with Grid Bus Broker (GBB), a middleware Alchemi and SQL server.

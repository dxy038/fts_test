Academic Integrity is a fundamental condition for the mission of any university. Ethical problems undermine academic integrity and thus the mission of the university. The College of Engineering at the University of Puerto Rico-Mayagu&#194;&#191;ez (UPRM) has developed an ethics across the engineering curriculum program as a space for students and professors to connect engineering and its ethical implications. This paper will present the Introductory Freshman module whose objective is to create awareness around the subject of academic integrity. At the end of the module, participants complete an assessment instrument. The instrument evaluates the impact of the ethics module on academic integrity in two aspects: (i) the learning process and the perception of the students, and (ii) the impact on their ethical awareness and evaluation. This module is part of a strong commitment to social, ethical and global issues that the College of Engineering has made at UPRM.

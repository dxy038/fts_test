The objective of this paper is to give an overview of the findings of the Canadian chapter of the Northeast States
and Eastern Canadian Provinces Mercury Study, which was conducted between 1995 and 1998. The Canadian
chapter provided information on mercury emissions, sources and levels in air, water, biota and humans. Industry,
governments and universities provided information for the Canadian chapter. The study showed that the Northeast
States and Eastern Canadian Provinces  NESrECP. is a region impacted by airborne mercury. Annual mercury
emissions for the NESrECP region are estimated to be approximately 19 t  12%. of the combined Canadian and US
national anthropogenic mercury emissions of 155 tryear. 210Pb-dated lake sediment cores from Atlantic Canada
showed a mercury enrichment factor of 2.5 for coastal sites with mercury increases starting in 1860. Regional
mercury wet deposition for the NESrECP region was 7]11 mgrm2ryear. Provincial and federal fish health
advisories have been updated in the ECP for children and women of child-bearing age limiting the consumption of
freshwater fish, as well as fresh or frozen shark, tuna or swordfish.

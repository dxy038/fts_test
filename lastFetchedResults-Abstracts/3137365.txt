The goal of emergency rescue is to reduce casualties and property losses caused by unexpected events. How to improve emergency response speed is one of the most difficult problems in the area of emergency logistics. Therefore, the study of the optimal path selection problem for transport vehicles to improve emergency response speed is full of practical significance. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization evaluation model is introduced. The evaluation model aims at choosing the route with the shortest travel time, the least cost, and the smallest probability of risk on traveling. Finally this model is applied to a road network to prove its effectiveness.

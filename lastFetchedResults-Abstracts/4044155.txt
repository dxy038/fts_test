The paper discusses the application of an Elliott Arch 9000 computer to the BP Chemicals (UK) Ltd. acetic-acid process operated at Kingston upon Hull, England. The computer was used as a tool to assist in a detailed study of the process. The main objective of the work was to develop a process model of the plant for control purposes. The role of the computer was twofold: (a) to collect plant-performance data for offline development of the model (b) to provide direct digital control of certain key control loops important to the study. The project was a combined exercise with Elliott Process Automation, involved a total of 28 (graduate) man years and incurred a total cost of &#194;&#163;260000. A breakdown of these figures is presented. The difficulties of organising and administering such an extensive project are also discussed. Reference is made to the important role of process models in relation to the many control levels in a company hierarchy.

The use of a bidirectional DC-DC converter operating in the DC link of CRPWM-inverter-fed motor drives devoted to electric vehicles (EVs) application allows a suitable control of both motoring and regenerative braking operations, and it can contribute to a significant increase of the motor drive overall efficiency. This paper deals with the experimental study of a bidirectional DC-DC converter prototype which has been designed for application in small-size EVs propelled by axial-flux PM motor drives. The paper discusses the converter modes of operation and reports the experimental results taken from a converter prototype which has been constructed using an IGBTs power module rated 600 V, 50 A

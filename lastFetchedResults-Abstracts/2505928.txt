<p><strong>Background and Objective: </strong>Nowadays, the presence of extended-spectrum Î²-lactamases (ESBLs) producing strains in <em>Serratia </em>genus causes the emergence of resistance to many antibiotics. So, the lack of proper diagnosis of ESBLs strains can lead to failure in the treatment. The objective of the present study was to investigate ESBLs production in <em>Serratia </em>strains isolated from the clinical blood samples in Shiraz, Iran.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods: </strong>In this study, 39 <em>Serratia </em>strains isolated from the patients referred to Namazi Hospital, during a 2 year period were tested. The antimicrobial resistance of the isolates to 21 antibiotics was evaluated using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Combination disk method was used to determine the ESBL phenotype among the isolates. PCR was performed to investigate the presence of ESBL genes of SHV, OXA and TEM types.<br /><strong>Results: </strong>The lowest antibiotic resistance rates belonged to meropenem (7.69%) and imipenem (5.12%). Overall, positive ESBL phenotype was identified in 69% (n = 27) of the isolates, 70.37% (n = 19) for <em>S. marcescens </em>and 29.62% (n = 8) for <em>S. liquefaciens</em>. Results obtained by PCR showed that only 20.51% carried OXA gene and 15.38% carried SHV-1 gene. TEM gene was detected in none of the isolates.<br /><strong>Conclusion: </strong>This study showed a high prevalence of the emerging ESBL producing strains among clinical isolates of <em>Serratia </em>that could lead to an increase in antibiotic resistance. However, ESBLs genes other than those tested here may be more responsible for the emergence of ESBL phenotype among <em>Serratia </em>clinical isolates in our region.</p>

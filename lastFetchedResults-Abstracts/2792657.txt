A three-port converter (TPC) with the topology of a full-bridge converter (FBC) is presented for hybrid energy applications. It has merits of reduced number of switches, simpler topology and control and single stage power conversion. An input port with photo-voltaic (PV) source, a storage port with battery and an output port with a dc load is considered in this paper. The input port and the output port, then, become unidirectional ports and the storage port is bidirectional. Principle, operating modes, design considerations and pulse width modulation (PWM) schemes for the FB-TPC are explained. A generalized PWM scheme and a scheme based on design consideration are presented. Modeling of PV panel, FB-TPC in MATLAB/Simulink and the simulation results are also presented.

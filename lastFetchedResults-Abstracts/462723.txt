Objective
Although home collection HIV tests are available in the United States, home HIV tests providing instant results are not available. The objective of this study was to examine willingness to use instant home HIV tests and what test characteristics are most important to individuals.
Methods

Six questions were added to the 1999 California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) (n =2964). This state-representative survey is part of the ongoing, 50-state BRFSS sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to examine willingness to use instant home HIV tests and preferences for HIV test characteristics.
Results

Over one third (37%) of respondents would consider using an instant home HIV test. Respondents willing to use instant home tests were more likely to be Hispanic (odds ratio [OR]=1.55; confidence interval [CI]=1.03–2.34); to have not previously been tested for HIV (OR=1.72; CI=1.20–2.45); to be more likely to plan to be tested in the next 12 months (OR=1.17; CI=1.00–1.37); and to prefer urine sample collection (OR=1.56; CI=1.03–2.37).
Conclusion

Over one third of respondents in a large, state-representative sample would consider using an instant home HIV test. Hispanics, individuals who planned to be tested in the next 12 months, and individuals who had never been tested were more willing to use instant home tests.

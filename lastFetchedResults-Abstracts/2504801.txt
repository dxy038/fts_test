Background: When male animals die, spermatozoa within the body of animal will be degenerated. Because of unique chromatin structure of sperm, maybe this degeneration is different from other cells. However there is not any research which considered directly the integrity of sperm DNA by keeping the cadaver in refrigerator. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess viability, total motility and DNA integrity of sperm cells after death. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 24 male Swiss white mice were killed by cervical dislocation and then kept in refrigerator (4-6oC) for up to 12 days. On the 0 (immediately after death as control group), 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th and the 12th days after death cauda epididymides were removed and squeezed in Hamâ€™s F10 medium. The proportion of viable, motile and double stranded DNA spermatozoa was examined. Viability and DNA integrity of sperm cells were examined consecutively by eosin nigrosin and acridine orange stainings. Results: The data obtained from this study showed that viability and total motility of sperm cells were significantly decreased during 12 days after death (p < 0.001). In contrast with viability and motility, DNA integrity was without significant changes (even 12 days after death). Conclusion: This study suggests that integrity of sperm DNA would not change even after 12 days after death if the cadaver kept in refrigerator

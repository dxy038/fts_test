Globalization has prompted manufacturing firms to come to terms with environmental legislation and regulations, resulting in the manufacturing industry realizing the importance of adopting environmental friendly supply chain management (SCM) practices. A growing number of companies have realized that attaining effective SCM is only one side of the coin. The other side is to make SCM environmentally friendly. This has catapulted SCM to a new height that promises to give manufacturers a competitive edge over their rivals. In this paper a bi-objective model is developed for a reverse logistic network design. The first objective function aims to minimize the cost involved in the reverse logistics network model and the second objective is designed to minimize energy consumption during the logistics. The model is solved using a weighting method.

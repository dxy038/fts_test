OBJECTIVE: Intrauterine infusion of saline solution during transvaginal ultrasonography enhances visualization of the endometrium. We compared the accuracy and pain rating of saline infusion sonography with those of flexible office hysteroscopy. STUDY DESIGN: The uterine cavities of 130 patients with abnormal bleeding were evaluated by two physicians in an office setting. Findings of endometrial polyps, submucous myomas, synechiae, endometrial hyperplasia, or cancer were recorded independently and subsequently compared. Patients rated their pain after each procedure. RESULTS: Both procedures were performed in 113 of 130 patients. With saline infusion sonography pathologic findings were identified in 61 patients (54%). For all findings combined, sensitivity was 0.96 and specificity was 0.88, compared with hysteroscopy. The results of saline infusion sonography and hysteroscopy did not differ significantly (p = 0.18). The former was less painful for patients than hysteroscopy (p< 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Saline infusion sonography is an accurate and well-tolerated method to evaluate abnormal uterine bleeding, compared with hysteroscopy. (AM J OBSTET GYNECOL 1996;174:1327-34.)

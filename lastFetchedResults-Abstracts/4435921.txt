The authorsÂ´ objective is to develop a flexible, noninvasive 3-D wound surface reconstruction system which can be used to evaluate physical characteristics, such as perimeter, area, depth and volume of wounds. The authors describe here their system which relies on a new temporal structured light (SL) coding method using a LCD projection system. In SL, the scene is illuminated with a pattern of light and is observed from another vantage point. Analysis of this image gives the 3-D surface points after establishing correspondence and triangulation. The authors report on initial performance tests of this system on phantoms and compared the results to physical measurements and saline infusion method. A sample pig skin wound reconstruction is also given

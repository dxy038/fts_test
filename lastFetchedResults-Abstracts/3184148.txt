The main objective of this study is to analyze the pressure distribution on hydrodynamic journal bearing under different lubricants for various loading conditions and various operating parameters. The space between the shaft and the bearing is filled with different lubricants. Journal bearing test rig (JBTR) is used to test the 40 mm diameter and 40 mm long bearing. Test bearing is located between two antifriction bearings and loaded mechanically. At first the bearing is tested in JBTR under SAE20W40 of various load conditions such as 300N and 450N and speed ranges such as 1500 rpm and 1750 rpm and the pressure distribution results were observed and recorded. The vegetable oils such as rapeseed oil and soya bean oil were tested under the same operating conditions in the JBTR and the results are compared with the SAE20W40.

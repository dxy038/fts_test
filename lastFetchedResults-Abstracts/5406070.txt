Power Generators are presently being used to power large (&gt;1MW) radars whose pulsed-load profile can influence the GeneratorÂ´s performance and vice versa. This paper explores the limitations of the Generator in providing power to a pulsed-load, and how the power architecture may be modified to improve the coupling between source and load with the objective of maximizing performance. Simulated examples of a generic radar power system will be demonstrated showing progressive improvement as better coupling is attained, detailing generator limitation thresholds and overall system performance.

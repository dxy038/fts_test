The feasibility of physical layer security approach for communication in the presence of one or more eavesdroppers. In the previous scheme, the one-way cooperative networks can be used for transferring information from source to destination. At present this technique is implemented without the eavesdroppers and it becomes ineffective due to sometimes attackers can hack the file. In future this work is carried out in two-way cooperative networks using two-stage cooperative protocol and the objective is to design the system for secrecy capacity maximization or transmit power minimization. The information can be divided into two halves then transferred into intermediate nodes and then merge the files to the destination. By implementing two-stage cooperative protocol will maximize the secrecy capacity in the presence of eavesdroppers by selecting relay and jamming nodes.

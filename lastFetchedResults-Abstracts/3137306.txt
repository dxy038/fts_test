The multi-objective optimization problem in flexible job-shop scheduling was discussed. According to the characteristics of flexible job-shop scheduling, a new self-adaptive genetic algorithm was proposed, and the model of Multi-Objective Flexible Job-shop Scheduling (MOFJS) was set up. At last, by programming with Matlab and Visual C++, the algorithm was applied to solve the MOFJS problem in Chinese automobile manufacturing enterprises, and the optimization scheduling solution was obtained. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is feasible and effective for MOFJS.

This paper discusses the issue of stability analysis for a class of impulsive stochastic bidirectional associative memory neural networks with both Markovian jump parameters and mixed time delays. The jumping parameters are modeled as a continuous-time discrete-state Markov chain. Based on a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, the generalized Ito&#770;Â´s formula, mathematical induction, and stochastic analysis theory, a linear matrix inequality approach is developed to derive some novel sufficient conditions that guarantee the exponential stability in the mean square of the equilibrium point. At the same time, we also investigate the robustly exponential stability in the mean square of the corresponding system with unknown parameters. It should be mentioned that our stability results are delay-dependent, which depend on not only the upper bounds of time delays but also their lower bounds. Moreover, the derivatives of time delays are not necessarily zero or smaller than one since several free matrices are introduced in our results. Consequently, the results obtained in this paper are not only less conservative but also generalize and improve many earlier results. Finally, two numerical examples and their simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

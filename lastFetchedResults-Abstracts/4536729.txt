This paper presents an approach to high power THz generation that uses a Switched Oscillator (SwO) as a photoconductively-switched antenna. A simplified model is used to demonstrate the SwO as an effective THz radiator. Numerical simulations are used to optimize various parameters of interest with the primary objective of maximizing the radiated energy and minimizing lossess. The radiation Q and resonant frequency are obtained as function of each parameter.

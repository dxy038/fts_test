Angelica sinensis (Danggui in Chinese), a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, is also used as a health food product for women's care in Europe and America. Therefore, the demand for Danggui is enormous throughout the world. Due to the shortage of Angelica sinensis, Angelica acutiloba and Angelica gigas are commonly used as the substitutes of Danggui in the market of southeast Asia. However, the three common Angelica roots showed variation in their genetic and chemical composition. Up to date, it is thought that ferulic acid, ligustilide and other phthalides such as butylidenephthalide are the biologically active components of Danggui. In this paper, the contents of 13 compounds including ferulic acid, Z-ligustilide, E-ligustilide, Z-butylidenephthalide, E-butylidenephthalide, 3-butylphthalide, 3-butylidene-4-hydroxyphthalide, senkyunolide A, 6,7-epoxyligustilide, senkyunolide F, senkyunolide H, senkyunolide I, and 6,7dihydroxyligustilide were determined or estimated by using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) coupled with pressurized liquid extraction (PLE). The results showed that GC–MS coupled with PLE offered a simple, rapid and high sensitive method to analysis of components in Angelica root. And the contents of investigated compounds in Angelica sinensis, Angelica acutiloba and Angelica gigas, which are used as Danggui in China, Japan and Korea, respectively, were highly variant. It is thought that interaction of multiple chemical compounds contributes to the therapeutic effects of Chinese medicines. However, the overall clinical efficacy of these different Danggui has not been determined. Therefore, comparison of chemical components and pharmacological activities of different Angelica root is helpful to elucidate the mechanism of therapeutic effects of Danggui.

This paper presents a coordination of maintenance scheduling and hourly security-constrained unit commitment by using a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. The objective is to minimize the overall operating cost including of production cost, maintenance cost as well as start-up and shutdown cost. MILP continuous time slot based model is proposed to be able to schedule both unit commitment and unit maintenance simultaneously, in one-step optimization. Various constraints composed of operation and maintenance constraints are taken into account. In a case study, using a six-bus system, detailed analysis is performed to evaluate the proposed strategy. The solution is obtained with the aid of CPLEX optimizer, which employed branch and bound and cut method.

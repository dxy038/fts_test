This paper concerns the development of a real-time driving assistance system within the Prolab II French demonstrator. The framework of this demonstrator is the European Eureka Prometheus/Pro-Art project. The aim of Prolab II project is to design and to integrate into a real car a driver support system, or a co-pilot, with several perception devices, real-time decision capabilities and a dedicated human machine interface. The objective of the co-pilot is to provide a support to the driver either in form of useful help messages or by producing meaningful and accurately timed warnings. Our work concerns the real-time decision capabilities of the co-pilot which are intended to analyze the current situation and to generate to the driver warnings, advice or suggestions of possible manoeuvres according to the current situation of the world.

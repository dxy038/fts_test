The phloem is the main transportation channel of photoassimilate, which is of importance to vegetative growth of plants. The study discussed transport directions of materials in phloem between scion and stock afer grafting by tomatoÂ´ phloem tracing. This experienment took Zhongza No. 9 as the material. CFDA was respectively introduced to phloem in scion and stock of tomato and was detected with the transport of materials in phloem by confocal laser scanning microscope. After introducing fluorescent substance to different locations, the luminescence signals appeared both in their scion and stock. The above results conclude there exist bidirectional transport both from scion to stock and from stock to scion.

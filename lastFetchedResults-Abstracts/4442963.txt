The idea screening of a new product concept is perhaps the most critical activity in new product development (NPD). This paper presents a fuzzy synthetic evaluation method (FSEM) for selecting an optimum design alternatives based on fuzzy set theory. The process involves constructing a hierarchical objective, setting evaluation criteria, establishing a fuzzy judgment matrix and weight vector, and then ranking the order of design alternatives by a fuzzy number in the fuzzy sequencing vector. The proposed approach can efficiently aid managers in dealing with both ambiguity and complexity in product screening decisions. To verify the feasibility of this approach, a case study is conducted with a product design of Power Line Communication (PLC) in this study.

In this paper, a new method for optimization of cutting paths is proposed. In which the cutting forces and chatters concerned in the machining process are taken into account. The main objective of this work is to get a smooth variation in cutting resistance for the area where there is a sudden rise or decrease of cutting forces to avoid chatter vibration. Unlike the previously methods, the conventional tool paths are modified, and even additional tool paths are inserted according to the given maximal engagement angle to avoid the rapid changes of cutting forces. In our scheme, C-Bezier curve is applied to generate the trajectories of the additional tool paths based on the limit of variation in material removal rates induced on the cutting tool. The algorithm has been implemented for pocket milling, and simulation test was performed to verify the significance of proposed method.

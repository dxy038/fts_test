The query-based on the result is lack of limited relevant documents in retrieval results. Therefore, query performance is considered to retrieve more relevant documents across language boundaries by applying semantic and stemmers which are more significant as stemming semantic query (SSQ). Therefore, this study is conducted with the purposes to investigate the integration semantic and stemmers approach against the queries and vice versa. Furthermore, it is also conducted to investigate the performance query based on total retrieve and relevant. The retrieval however, included the irrelevant documents because of the translation polysemy. Results from the experiments suggest that SSQ is most important process in cross language information retrieval (CLIR). It also found that semantic approach with stemmers contributes to better performance in retrieving more relevant and related Quran document results.

The objective of this paper is to find an adaptive control strategy which would enable us to estimate the parameters of the ARX model as accurately as possible while keeping the output of the system below a specified level of variability. It turns out that this optimal experiment design problem can be solved by using the Astrom-Wittenmark self-tuning tracker (1973) with a specific choice of the reference signal

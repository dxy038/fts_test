This paper compares two valid mathematical formulations for solving a routing problem related to Personal Rapid Transit (PRT). The PRT is an innovative automated transportation system that provides an on-demand transportation service for its users. This is made possible by the use of small electric driverless vehicles. Our objective is to determine the mathematical formulation that minimizes the total energy used to satisfy passenger requests with respect to the battery capacity of each vehicle. For this purpose, we conduct numerical experiments over 760 randomly generated instances with up to 100 passenger requests.

In this article it proposes a high efficient soft-switching scheme based on zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) and zero-current-switching(ZCS) principle operated with a simple auxiliary circuit extended range for the front-end isolated DC-AC-DC-AC high power converter with an three phase three level diode clamped multi-level inverter by using Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization technique(APSO) with Total Harmonic Distortion(THD), Switching losses, Selective harmonic elimination maintaining with its fundamental values as an objective function. The proposed scheme realize zero-voltage-switching for leading of inverter leg and zero-current switching for lagging leg of inverter. The proposed ZCS scheme is effective by using a simple auxiliary circuit, and it is suitable for applications where low-voltage dc to high-voltage three-phase ac power conversion is required. Output from the inverter applied to three phase three level diode clamped inverter executed with a selective harmonic elimination technique by using APSO and found to be efficiency of inverter is increased with its quality output.

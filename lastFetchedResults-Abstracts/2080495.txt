Objective
tudy attempts to reveal how nanocrystallites on the ceramic surfaces of non-dispersive calcium phosphate cement (nd-CPC) participate in setting processes as compared with conventional CPC (c-CPC).
s
mpositions and morphologies of CPC during the early setting reactions were studied with X-ray diffraction and a scanning transmission electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy system. The pH values and dispersive properties of CPC during the early setting reactions were investigated as well as the compressive strength of nd-CPC after 24 h of immersion with varying liquid to powder ratios.
s
chanical strength of nd-CPC was approximately 60 MPa after a 24 h immersion in simulate body solution with a P/L ratio between 3.3 and 4.2 g/mL. The nanocrystallites on the particle surfaces of nd-CPC were shown to grow rapidly and provided interlocking sites that allowed rapid development of the apatite phase in the cement, and were also shown to be non-dispersive in solution as determined by an injection test of c-CPC.
sions
terlocking particles produced by whisker growth on the ceramic particles or new crystallites formed between the ceramic particles caused the cement to be non-dispersive in solution. The particles of reactants with nanocrystallites on surfaces also gave this cement the ability to be shaped easily as a paste during an operation or to be injected into a cavity.

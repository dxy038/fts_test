We propose a knowledge-based multiple access protocol for the extension of wireline ATM to wireless networks. The objective is to enable efficient transmission of all kinds of ATM traffic in the wireless channel with guaranteed QoS. The proposed protocol utilizes knowledge of the main characteristics of the traffic for allocating bandwidth efficiently to CBR, VBR and ABR/UBR connections by a compromise of assignment, contention, reservation and polling access techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol can achieve a very high channel utilization of 90% while providing guaranteed QoS requirements to a variety of ATM applications

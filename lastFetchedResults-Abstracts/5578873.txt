There are objective preconditions for computer integrated mining, such as deep mines and dangerous conditions of work. Future mining will be based on underground machines that will be controlled from surface. The paper is aimed to consider the sequence of automation towards computer integrated mining. System ldquoan operator on surface - a set of underground machinesrdquo is simulated by GPSS/Hreg as a mass service system. Decision-making for loading and transporting of useful minerals is simulated by Petri nets. Use of on-board RFID for mine planning is suggested. Some applications of mine robotics, mine simulation and animation, multi-agent mining are analyzed in the paper. ldquoCost-effectrdquo for mine automation and milestones to intelligent mine are considered in the paper.

The coordinated control system (CCS) is a complicated system with large delay, nonlinearity and strong coupling. Traditional control strategy is difficult to obtain satisfactory control effect because of the low tracking speed and large overshoot. In this paper, an improved generalized predictive control (IGPC) is proposed and it is applied to a 1000MW supercritical unit. In order to take full advantage of predictive information and use the change trends of the manipulated variables to amend the optimal control, the IGPC is designed as follows. Firstly, the optimal control is calculated by minimizing the objective function. Then the predictive information is fully used to obtain the improved control increment. Finally, the improved control law is obtained. This algorithm can achieve higher tracking speed and less overshoot than traditional GPC. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

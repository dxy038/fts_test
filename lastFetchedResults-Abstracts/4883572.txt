VHF SAR imagery has proven to be a powerful tool in several civilian and military applications. For a spaceborne instrument the ionospheric effects become significant. The impact of the VHF signal distortion on the SAR image formation process is an open question. The CARABAS-II radar system was configured on ground to collect VHF data at some of the occasions when the space shuttle was passing by during the SRTM experiment. The registrations at 84 MHz using a dual-polarisation antenna array are now in the phase of evaluation, with the objective to detect the target and examine the stability for a trans-ionospheric signal path

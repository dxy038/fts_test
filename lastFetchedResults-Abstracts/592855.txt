Background: Presumably, stem cells derived from mouse adipose tissue differentiate into lens fiber cells under induction by vitreous humor factors. Cataract is one of the most common ocular diseases that is highly treatable by replacing the ocular lens with artificial ones. The objective of this study was to find the natural lens replacements instead of the artificial ones. 
Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, stem cells from adipose tissue were obtained from inguinal fat pads from NMRI mouse. To demonstrate stemness potential of these cells, we used anti-OCT4, as stromal stemness markers with immunocytochemistry methods. This experiment took place for 14 days with different dosages of bovine vitreous humor. Express of ocular lens fiber cells markers (alpha crystalline) were detected by immunocytochemistry in experimental and control groups. 
Results: All murine stem cells were positive to OCT4 marker which is used for stromal cells. Morphological studies showed that cells induced with 40% vitreous humor in culture media were locally longer and more aligned in parallel compared to control group cells. Also, the fiber like cells had large nuclei with multiple nucleoli that showed increase in production of proteins in those cells. The proof of the induction of these stem cells to lens fiber like-cells is the positive response of induced cells for crystalline markers in media with 40% vitreous humor by ANOVA test. 
Conclusion: Based on morphological appearance and positive response of experimental group to specific markers of lens fiber cells, it can be concluded that stem cells derived from mouse adipose tissue differentiate into lens fiber cells by treating them with vitreous humor.

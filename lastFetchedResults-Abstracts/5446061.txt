In this paper, multi-objective design of an aperture coupled circularly polarized microstrip patch antenna, excited by a cross slot, is presented where an advanced version of differential evolution, namely, self adaptive differential evolution is used. Further the performance of this new algorithm is compared with normal differential evolution. Optimization is carried out with respect to both impedance matching and axial ratio bandwidth.

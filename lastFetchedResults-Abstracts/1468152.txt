Background: Varicocele is the most common cause of infertility in men. Increased release of free oxygen radicals is one of the most important mechanisms of damage in the pathophysiology of varicocele. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of saffron extract treatment on sperm parameters (sperm count, motility and morphology) in rats with experimentally induced varicocele. 
Methods: In this experimental study, 24 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: varicocele without treatment, sham, control, varicocele with treatment. Varicocele was induced in both varicocele groups. Saffron ethanolic extract (50 mg/kg) was daily administered intraperitoneally in the varicocele group with treatment for eight weeks. After eight weeks, the sperm parameters were studied in all groups. Data were analyzed using one way ANOVA. 
Findings: All sperm parameters in the varicocele groups were significantly reduced in comparison to the control group. The sperm parameters were significantly improved by saffron ethanolic extract. 
Conclusion: With regards to the results, crocin and safranal in saffron extract which probably eliminate free radicals can be effective in treatment of infertility caused by varicocele.

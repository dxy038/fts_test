When we are concerned with a learning method, such as regularization learning, which does not directly deal with generalization error, we usually use it to achieve some &#8220;true objective learning&#8221;. That is, we first have some objective such as minimization of generalization error, then we look for a learning method which could achieve the objective learning. There is, however, another situation. When we have developed a learning method, we wish to apply it to a wide range of different purposes. We discuss the latter problem. We clarify the bound of applicability of memorization learning within a family of projection learning. The bound is determined by the location of sample points and the nature of noise

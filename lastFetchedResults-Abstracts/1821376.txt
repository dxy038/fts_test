Objective
ostaglandins (PGs) released from osteoblasts can alter the process of bone remodelling. Recently, we showed that compressive force induced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-17s and their receptors in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and that IL-17A was expressed most highly. Consequently, in the current study we examined the effect of IL-17A and/or celecoxib on PGE2 production and the expression of cyclooxygenases (COXs) and inflammatory cytokines in MC3T3-E1 cells. We also examined the effects of PGE2 and cyclohexamide on the expression of inflammatory cytokines.
s
were cultured with or without IL-17A (0.1, 1.0, or 10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of 10 μM celecoxib, a specific inhibitor of COX-2, for up to 72 h. Cells were pretreated with or without 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, protein synthesis inhibitor, for 30 min, and then cultured with 10 ng/ml IL-17A for 24 h. Cells were also cultured with or without 1.5 ng/ml PGE2 for 24 h. PGE2 production was determined by ELISA. The expression of COX-1, COX-2, IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-11, and TNF-α mRNAs and proteins was determined by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively.
s
pression of COX-2, IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-11, and TNF-α, as well as PGE2 production increased in the presence of IL-17A, whereas COX-1 expression did not change. Celecoxib blocked the stimulatory effect of IL-17A on the expression of COX-2, IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-11 as well as PGE2 production, whereas it did not block TNF-α expression. Cycloheximide pretreatment suppressed the expression of IL-17-induced inflammatory cytokines. The expression of IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-11 increased by the addition of PGE2, whereas TNF-α expression was not affected.
sion
results suggest that IL-17A stimulates the expression of bone resorption-related inflammatory cytokines through an autocrine mechanism involving celecoxib-blocked PGs, mainly PGE2, in osteoblasts.

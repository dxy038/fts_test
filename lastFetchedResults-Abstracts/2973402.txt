In industrial production-distribution systems, production and purchasing rates, associated inventories, and sales are very critical in contributing to the profits of each component. The objective of this study is to investigate an effective information control for a production-distribution system by automatic feedback control techniques. A discrete-time ISFF dynamic control scheme is applied for the perturbed multiechelon production-distribution systems described by the capacity of available factory space and capital equipment, and the supervisory control is carried out to avoid reset windup and deterioration of system performance. Numerical example is illustrated to depict the efficiency of supervisory control for the dynamic controlled perturbed multiechelon production-distribution systems with saturating production capacity.

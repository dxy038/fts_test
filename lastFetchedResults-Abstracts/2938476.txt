There are hundreds of inspectors stationed around the country who have the responsibility of conducting inspections of merchant ships to insure their safety. The inspections include everything from the hull, the machinery and boilers to the lifesaving equipment. In 1992, the Coast Guard Research and Development Center began several projects which will attempt to identify tools and equipment which could make the inspections more efficient and safer, first for Coast Guard inspectors and then for commercial inspectors. The objective is to find technologies which will permit wider inspection coverage while providing a complete and accurate condition of the vessel. The first phase of this project focused on the basic technology items such as improved lighting, improved monitors to determine air quality, and use of visual enhancements such as binoculars and night vision equipment. This paper will describe the efforts on more advanced methodologies which may not find the actual damage but may provide clues to the inspector. These include laser ultrasonics, remote controlled lights and camera systems, magnetic climbers, rope access techniques, vibration monitoring, use of polarized light and time-elapse thermography

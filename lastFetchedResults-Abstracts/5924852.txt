This paper proposes evolutionary techniques to repair and adapt analog circuits. Such class of techniques is suitable for systems that need to perform for a long time in harsh environments such as those employed in space exploration missions and for situations in which sending a technician would not be possible. As each evolution´s objective has a different influence and importance in the resulting repaired circuit, it is necessary to distinguish their importance´s weight during the evaluation of the circuits. The methods proposed are for extrinsic and intrinsic evolutionary repair

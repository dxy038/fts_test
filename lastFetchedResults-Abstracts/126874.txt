Background: Invasive diagnostic procedures such as coronary angiography, in most cases, are accompanied by stress and anxiety in patients which in turn may affect the hemodynamic signs.
Objective: To determine the effect of premedication on hemodynamic parameters in patients under coronary angiography, who were hospitalized in heart and post-angio unit at shahid Beheshti heart center in Zanjan during the year 2003.
Methods: This was a quasi-exprimental study in which 40 patients under angiography were selected and marked as premedication and control groups for the purpose of this research. Data collection tools were two forms used to record hemodynamic parameters during 8-12 hours and half an hour pre-, during and post- angiography and also a questionnaire to record demographic data.
In premedication group, patients were taken drugs including Diazepam, Chlorpheniramine, Metoclopramide and Hydrocortisone. In control group, patients were taken only routine nursing cares. In both groups, hemodynamic parameters were measured during 8-12 hours and half an hour pre-, during and post- angiography. The data were analyzed statistically using SPSS.
Findings: There was no significant difference between control and premedication hemodynamic parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, L.V.P pressure, end diastolic pressure, systolic and diastolic aorta pressure) (p>0.05) . Conclusion: There were no significant changes in hemodynamic signs between control and premedication groups.

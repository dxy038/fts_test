Spatial mapping of electric field distribution is an important objective in many applications including antenna pattern, radar cross-section, and specific absorption rate measurements. Modulated scatterer technique (MST) based on small loaded dipoles has been successfully used for these purposes for many years. However, MST suffers from several inherent limitations. These limitations become more severe as the frequency increases. This paper introduces a new and efficient method based on a multiple loaded scatterer (MLS) approach. The proposed method allows for accurate recovery of an unknown incident electric field with measurements conducted at a single observation point. The formulation of the MLS method along with several key simulation results illustrating its efficacy for electric field distribution measurement is presented. In addition, the results of several comparisons with conventional MST are also provided.

Objective: To determine the frequency of dual and single chamber pacemaker complications in adults. Methodology: This study was conducted in 151 pacemaker implanted patients and they were followed every month for 1 year, for evaluation / programming of pacemaker function and examining for device related complications. Results: Out of 151 patients with pacemaker, 111(73.5%) patients received single chamber pacemaker and 40(26.5%) patients were implanted with dual chamber pacemakers. In one year follow up 21(13.9%) patients developed different complications while 130 patients had uneventful follow up. The different complications seen were infection 9(6%) patients, lead displacement 4(2.6%) patients, heart failure 3(2.0%) patients, Pacemaker syndrome, lead fracture, diaphragmatic twitching, pocket hematoma and keloid formation at scar site was noted in 1(0.7%) patient each. As a whole complications in single chamber was 73.5% compared to patient with dual chamber pacemaker which was 26.5%. Conclusion: The rate of complications associated with PPM is not significant, but the rate of complications were more in single chamber pacemaker compared to dual chamber pacemaker. Infection was the major complication seen.

The main objective of the present paper is to compare, by means of a problem permitting a closed-form solution, qualitative behaviour of solutions based on three models of pressure-dependent plasticity, the coaxial model, the double-shearing model, and the double-slip and rotation model. The constitutive equations of each model reduce to classical metal plasticity at specific values of input parameters. Nevertheless, the solution behaviour essentially depends on the model chosen, independently of how close the input parameters are to these specific values. In particular, such features of the solutions as non-uniqueness, non-existence and singularity are emphasized. It is concluded that the double-slip and rotation model only retains all features inherent to classical plasticity.

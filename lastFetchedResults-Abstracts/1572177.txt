Network support for variable bit-rate video needs to consider (i) properties of workload induced (e.g., significant auto-correlations into far lags and heterogeneous marginal distributions), and (ii) application specific bounds on delay-jitter and statistical cell-loss probabilities. The objective of this paper is to present a quality-of-service solution for such traffic at each multiplexing point in a network. Heterogeneity in both offered workload and quality-of-service requirements are addressed.

virtual-circuit framing structure and a pseudo earliest-due-date cell dispatcher are introduced to provide guaranteed delay-jitter bounds. Heterogeneous jitter-bounds are supported through software controlled frame-sizes which may be independently set for each virtual-circuit. The framing structure is a generalization of per-link framing introduced by Golestani. The proposed framing structure eliminates correcting for phase mismatches between incoming frames and outgoing frames, necessary in per-link framing. This results in reduction in end-to-end delay bound and buffer requirements, and a simpler implementation.

 auto-correlations typically seen in video traffic make equivalent bandwidth computations for heterogeneous cell-loss bounds intractable. To address this, the framing strategy is combined with an active cell-discard mechanism with prioritized cell-dropping, the latter utilizing the history of dropped cells and target cell-loss bounds for each virtual circuit. Upper bounds on the equivalent bandwidth needed to support a given workload with a target quality of service are developed. These are validated through numerical and simulation results from variable bit-rate MPEG-I video traces.

OBJECTIVE: The study assesses the efficacy and complications of Marlex mesh in repairing severe recurrent anterior vaginal wall prolapse. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-four patients with two or more postsurgical recurrences of severe anterior vaginal wall prolapse were divided into control and treatment groups. Transvaginal repair was similar between groups except for reinforcement of the anterior vaginal wall with synthetic mesh. Two examiners graded preoperative and postoperative support over the following 2 years (K = 0.9). Fisher's exact test, log-linear analysis, and analysis of variance were used to compare categoric and continuous variables. RESULTS: Four patients in the control group and none in the treatment group had recurrent anterior vaginal wall prolapse (p< 0.05). Three patients had mesh-related complications. CONCLUSION: Repair with a synthetic mesh decreased the expected incidence of severe recurrent anterior vaginal prolapse but was associated with common complications related to synthetic mesh. Mesh reinforcement is an effective treatment for severe recurrent prolapse of the anterior midvaginal wall. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1996;175:1472-5.)

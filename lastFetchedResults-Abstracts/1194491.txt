The main objective of this research was to identify factors that characterise the soundscape in urban open public spaces. The research was carried out through a series of field surveys. Stage one, as a pilot study, was a soundscape walk with 48 students in four typical urban open public spaces in Sheffield. Stage two was a detailed soundscape evaluation in two of the sites, with a total sample size of 491 from the general public. Stage three examined the soundscape evaluation by designers, with 223 architectural students. Semantic differential analysis of the results shows that although the description and evaluation of the soundscape in urban open public spaces is rather complicated, it is still possible to identify major factors which include relaxation, communication, spatiality and dynamics. In terms of the general soundscape evaluation, differences between sound level and acoustic comfort evaluation, sound preferences, and effects of demographic factors are briefly discussed. Compared to the general public, designers have stronger preferences to natural sounds and green spaces, and there is also more diversity in their evaluation.

Background: The number of interventional cardiology procedures performed has
increased rapidly over the past years. While these procedures help physicians avoid
using highly complicated invasive methods, it usually leads to high levels of exposure
to ionizing radiation of both patients and cardiologist. The dose received by the
cardiologist during interventional cardiology procedures is determined by a wide
range of factors such as clinical problems to be treated, the interventional technique
to be used, the x-ray system employed, experience of the cardiologist, the protective
measures taken as well as their use during the examination.
Objective: To measure the dose received by 22 cardiologists, radiology residents,
radiologic technologists and nurses during interventional cardiology examinations
performed in various teaching hospitals affiliated to Shiraz University of
Medical Sciences.
Methods: The radiation dose was basically measured by thermoluminescence
dosimeters (TLD). Other personal dosimetry devices such as film badges and pen
dosimeters were also used. According to IAEA guidelines, the dosimeter should be
worn under the lead apron (at waist level) for estimating the effective dose but due
to high workload in interventional radiology and since the areas of the body which
are not protected by the apron receive much higher radiation doses, in this study an
additional dosimeter was used over the apron (at collar level).
Results: The mean±SD monthly dose recorded by dosimeters of cardiologists
over the apron at collar level was 912.1±224.4 (range: 660.8–1176.4) ?Gy; hands
received doses up to 9674.4 ?Gy month?1 as recorded by TLD chips.
Conclusion: The annual effective dose received by interventional cardiologists
who use standard lead aprons hardly reaches the occupational exposure dose limit of
20 mSv/y.

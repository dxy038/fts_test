The design parameters of a functional-electrical-stimulation-based external control system are partly dependent upon the dynamic properties of the muscles involved. The dynamic response of muscle may be dependent upon its function, architecture, mass, length, fiber composition, and tendon length. The objective of this study is to discern the importance of these parameters in determining the frequency response of the major muscles in the catÂ´s shank

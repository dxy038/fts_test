OBJECTIVE: Over 1/3 to half of accurate medical diagnosis are based on x-ray examinations. The x-ray tube is the main part of a radiology set. X-ray production is a phenomenon with low efficiency and over 99.6% of the fast electrons energy changes to heat. This heat is also a limiting factor for the system function. The aim of this study was to design and manufacture an automatic heat control system in radiology tubes for multiple exposures. These exposures are allowed with regard to overload system but inappropriate intervaling in exposures causes heat damages in anode.
METHODS: The hardware of system was designed and manufactured by using of micro-controller system. Its software was written by 8051 Franklin preview software package and on the basis of mode cooling chart data and installed on micro-controller by Al-11 system.
FINDINGS: The designed system can calculate and display anode heat at every moment. Function mg test in 100 experimental exposures showed a reliability of 99.92 Â± 0.07%.
CONCLUSION: This system can be used as a suitable equipment in protecting and preventing radiology tubes against heat damages after frequent exposures.

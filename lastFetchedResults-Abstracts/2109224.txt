Optimal placement of dispersed generation in electrical distribution systems was carried out considering the voltage profile improvement indexes and decreased losses in this study. It is necessary to find an inappropriate location for dispersed generation, otherwise it may result in increased costs and adverse effects on network losses and the reliability. A model to determine the optimal location and size for dispersed generation using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is presented in this study. For this purpose, indexes mentioned above were used in the objective function. The proposed method was applied on the IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus system and the results of dispersed generation placement in the distribution network was examined in three design positions and a position with no dispersed generation. The results indicated the competency of the proposed algorithm.

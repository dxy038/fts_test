This article is devoted to the formulation and solution of general frictional contact problems in elasto-plastic
solids undergoing large deformations using variational inequalities. An updated Lagrangian formulation is
adopted to develop the incremental variational inequality representing this class of problems over the loading
history. The Jaumann objective stress rate is incorporated in the formulation of the elasto-plastic constitutive
equations to account for large rotations, while Coulomb's law is used to model the friction forces.
The resulting variational inequality is treated using mathematical programming in association with a newly
developed successive approximation scheme. This scheme, which is based upon the regularization of the
frictional work, is used to impose the active contact constraints identi ed to calculate the incremental changes
in the displacement  eld. The newly developed approach o ers the advantages of reducing the active number
of variables which is highly desirable in non-linear elasto-plastic problems. The merits of the formulations
are demonstrated by application to an illustrative example and to the analysis of the deep drawing process.

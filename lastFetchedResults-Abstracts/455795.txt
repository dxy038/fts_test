The objective of this study was to investigate the pattern of serum non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) fraction in association with atherosclerosis development. We have studied possible relationships between eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA) in the NEFA fraction and biochemical markers of endothelial activation or dysfunction. The study population consisted of 152 elderly men with high risk for coronary heart disease. The composition of fasting serum NEFA was analysed by gasâ€“liquid chromatography. Endothelial activation was evaluated using biochemical analyses of some markers of endothelial function. A significant inverse linear association was found between serum non-esterified EPA and DHA, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) (P=0.02 and 0.001, respectively). An inverse linear association was found between serum non-esterified AA and sVCAM-1 (P=0.001) and von Willebrand Factor (P=0.005). The significant inverse associations for DHA and AA were independent from the serum content of other NEFAs. Taken together, negative associations were found between sVCAM-1 and the serum levels of non-esterified DHA, EPA and AA. The inverse relation between the levels of sVCAM-1 and very long-chain n-3 fatty acids might indicate an anti-inflammatory effect of the latter.

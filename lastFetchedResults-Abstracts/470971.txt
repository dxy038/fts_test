Objective
The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review on the economic burden and health-related quality-of-life impact of cervical human papillomavirus disease.
Study Design
A systematic review of cost-of-illness studies and health-related quality-of-life studies was conducted. PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched with the use of predefined terms.
Results
Nine economic and 24 quality-of-life studies were identified. The annual health care costs of human papillomavirusâ€“related conditions in the United States range from $2.25-$4.6 billion (2005 US dollars). The burden of human papillomavirus is second only to human immunodeficiency virus among sexually transmitted diseases. Health-related quality-of-life areas that are impacted substantially by human papillomavirus include emotional, social, and sexual functioning.
Conclusion
The economic and quality-of-life burden of cervical human papillomavirus disease is significant and highlights the need for treatment and prevention options for this condition.

The objective of this work is to investigate the scan performance of infinite phased arrays of probe-fed cavity-backed microstrip patches printed on magnetized ferrites. The direction and/or the strength of the bias field, which strongly affect the active input impedance of the array, can be controlled while monitoring the active reflection coefficient as a function of scan angle. For a given design, the strength and direction of the bias field can be appropriately chosen to provide optimum scan performance in all or certain planes.

The objective of this study was to forecast amount of electricity consumption in agricultural sector of Iran. To achieve this objective, time series method of Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) were used. Annual data for period of 1967 to 2008 was used. The Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), Root of Mean of Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criteria were used for comparing the ability of different forecasting methods. Results showed that Feed Forward Artificial Neural Network with back proportion algorithm could predict electricity consumption with MAPE equal to 1.02% while the corresponding value for time series model was 1.13 percent. Other criteria also revealed the same result, so, ANN is expected to predict electricity consumption more precisely compare to ARMA model.

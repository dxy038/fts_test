Wheelchair users are at an increased risk for developing carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The objective of this study was to use electromyography (EMG) to describe wrist flexor activity (WFA) during wheelchair propulsion. EMG data on 3 flexor muscles for one subject were collected while he propelled at a constant speed of 0.9 m/s (2 mph). The flexor carpi radialis was the most active flexor muscle during the push phase with peak and average EMG at 51% and 33% of its maximum isometric contraction value

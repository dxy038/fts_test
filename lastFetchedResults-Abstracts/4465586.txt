Space-time adaptive processing (STAP) offers the potential for improved airborne surveillance radar performance in environments dominated by ground clutter and interference. This paper applies the GAMMA (generalized adaptive multidimensional monopulse algorithm) parameter estimation approach to solve for the target azimuth and Doppler for a STAP radar The GAMMA algorithm converts the maximization of the maximum likelihood objective function into a problem of finding a joint solution of a pair of two-variable polynomial equations. This obviates the computationally complex task of searching for a maximum over the array manifold. Simulations results comparing the GAMMA produced estimates to the Cramer-Rao bound are given, showing the near statistical efficiency of the new algorithm.

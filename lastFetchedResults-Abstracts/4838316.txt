Rapid and timely communication to the appropriate organization is crucial during life threatening events and is especially true for vehicular accidents which may involve crashes, rollovers leading to blasts, etc. Accidents in which a vehicle rolls over account for more than half of all single-vehicle crash deaths. An emergency system for a vehicle would detect and analyze the life threatening event, and, in an automated fashion, notify the emergency medical services (EMS) providers for immediate action. While there are few such systems available, most of them are costly, vehicle specific, requires human intervention, and do not provide information about the environmental condition of the vehicle. This prevents the EMS providers from rushing the required set of aids to the accident site at the earliest. The objective of this work is to develop a general purpose automatic emergency notification system for vehicles using various sensors that will monitor the vehicle and, in the event of a crash, automatically report all possible information (vehicle tilt, temperature, light, speed, location, date and time) to the EMS providers. The design and development although takes into consideration the United States of Americapsilas traffic and network infrastructure; the developed system is free from spatial constraints and may be used universally.

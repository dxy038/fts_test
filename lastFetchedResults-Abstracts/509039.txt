Background and Objective: There are some reports in Iranian
traditional medicine concerning the anti-inflammatory effect of
Saliva Officinalis (SO). In the present study with the aim of
decreasing analgesic dose of morphine, analgesic effect of
different doses of SO hydroalcoholic extract alone and
associated with morphine were evaluated by tail flick in rats.
Subjects and Methods: Analgesic effects of SO hydroalcholic
extract at doses of 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 mg/kg, i.p. were
investigated. Then the influence of these doses associated with
analgesic dose of morphine (2.5 mg/kg) was evaluated. Rats
were placed into restrainer and then transferred into the tail flick
apparatus with the intensity 55 C? and cut off time= 10 sec. In
order to verify the role of opioid receptors on analgesic effect of
SO extract, naloxone (1mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to one
group of rats 15 min before receiving 800 mg/kg extract. Then,
the data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by LSD
post hoc test and significant difference between groups was
accepted with P < 0.05.
Results: The Data have shown that, the SO extract relieved pain
in tail-flick test dose dependently and the most effective dose
was 800 mg/kg. The maximum analgesic effect of the extract
combined with morphine was observed at time point 45 min.
Naloxane, opioid receptor antagonist could reduce analgesic
effect of the extract.
Conclusion: On the basis the results obtained in this study, it
could be suggested that the SO extract potentiates morphine antinociceptive
effect and this means that the opioid system may be
involved in the analgesic effect of this plant extract.

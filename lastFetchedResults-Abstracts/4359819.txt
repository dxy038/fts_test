The objective of this paper is to specifically note the enhancement added to the Lee (1982, 1995) macro and microcell prediction models in order to handle the unique impact on radio propagation as a result of water. It is generally accepted that water enhances radio signals. However, there are many different impacts at varying levels dependant on where a mobile is located, relative to the positions of the water and the base station. An algorithm has been developed to deal with various scenarios in which water plays a critical role in predicting the effect of propagation loss. With water enhancement, the model can better predict the radio propagation which has directly impacted the cellular system engineering, most notably in coverage, handoff (HO), interference and thus capacity

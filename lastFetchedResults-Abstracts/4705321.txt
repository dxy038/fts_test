Tremor constitutes one of the most important symptoms of neurological disorders. However, its objective assessment is very difficult. The methods used for objectification require application of such devices as Schottky photodetectors, piezoelectric detectors or kymographs. The best results are achieved with the use of spectral analysis. To meet requirements of objective tremor measurement, the Institute of Fundamental Electronics of the Military University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland, designed a measurement set consisting of acceleration transducers, preamplifiers and multichannel A/D converter, plugged into the ISA slot of a microcomputer. The set includes special software.

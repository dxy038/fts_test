The cell manufacturing was played close attention widely by the enterprises and academe in the last 30 years. And cell formation is a key factor to implement cell manufacturing effectively. In the recently research of cell formation problem, the researchers mainly focus on the parts families and machines grouping, but forget another important factor-operators. A multi-objective dual resource-constrained system model for cell formation problem is considered in this paper, in which the part routing, cell number and annual demand of each part type, is known. This problem is characterized as optimally determining part-machine cell set and corresponding operators hired so that total intercellular part and operator movement, total operator hired and total operator workload imbalances are simultaneously minimized. Then this paper use the GA (Genetic Algorithm) to solution this model. At last a simple numerical example is given and it proves that the model is effective.

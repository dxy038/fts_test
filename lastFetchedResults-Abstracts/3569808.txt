In this paper, a technique based on nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is presented for solving the service restoration problem in an electric power distribution system. Due to the presence of various conflicting objective functions and constraints, the service restoration task is a multiobjective, multiconstraint optimization problem. In contrast to the conventional genetic-algorithm (GA)-based approach, this approach does not require weighting factors for the conversion of such a multiobjective optimization problem into an equivalent single objective function optimization problem. In this work, various practical distribution system operation issues, such as the presence of priority customers, presence of remotely controlled, as well as manually controlled switches, etc. have also been considered. Based on the simulation results on four different distribution systems, the performance of the NSGA-II-based scheme has been found to be significantly better than that of a conventional GA-based method. Besides, to reduce the software runtime of the NSGA-II algorithm, a faster version of NSGA-II has also been implemented.

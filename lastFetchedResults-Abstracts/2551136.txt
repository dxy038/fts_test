Objective: Myokines derived from skeletal muscle modulate metabolic, inflammatory, and other processes. Myonectin, a novel myokine, expression and circulating levels are tightly regulated by metabolic state and exercise. This study aims to investigate the effect of 4 weeks of endurance training on gene expression in myonectin muscle activity and plasma insulin resistance in adult male rats.
Methods: We divided 16 Wistar rats (mean weight: 230 ± 15 g; age: 8 weeks) into two groups: (1) endurance training and (2) control. Animals in the exercise group received 4 weeks of endurance training (5 sessions per week) that included running on a treadmill for 45 minutes. The control group did not undertake any exercise. We measured soleus muscle homogenates and myonectin gene expression by real-time PCR. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method measured insulin resistance. The data were analyzed by the independent t-test. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05.
Results: The endurance training groups had a significant increase in myonectin gene expression compared with the control group (P=0.048). Insulin resistance had no significant decrease comparison with the control group (P=0.500).
Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that endurance training increased the body’s metabolism through the secretion of myonectin.

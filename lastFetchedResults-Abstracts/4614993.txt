This paper establishes an economic operation model of microgrid including photovoltaic, wind energy, heat recovery boiler and battery. The emission of pollutant and greenhouse gases is taken into account and the minimum operation cost of microgrid is taken as objective function. The proposed model is solved by particle swarm optimization algorithm. Besides, the feature of battery is also studied, Test results indicate that scheduling battery according to the proposed model can effectively reduce operating cost.

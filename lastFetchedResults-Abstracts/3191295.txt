In this paper techno-economical evaluation of constructing an electric vehicles parking lot by a distribution company is discussed. Electric Vehicles (EVs) have been the centre of attention in recent years because they can be used to form a bidirectional connection to the power grid. In this scheme an aggregation of electric vehicles can be used to provide ancillary services for a power grid which is known as Vehicle to Grid (V2G) concept. Aggregation of EVs in a parking lot can be considered as a distributed generation (DG) unit. During off-peak hours, power grid provides electrical energy for charging the EVs in a parking lot while during peak hours some part of their stored energy should be given back to the grid. In this paper, it is considered that the parking lot belongs to a distribution company. Such parking lots is considered as a distributed generation (DG) unit which may offer some advantages like emission reduction, power quality improvement, reliability enhancement and deferral in distribution upgrades.

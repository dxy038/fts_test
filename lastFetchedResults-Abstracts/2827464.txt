This paper presents particle swarm optimization (PSO) based design of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for a twin rotor MIMO (multi-input multi-output) system (TRMS). The objective of the paper is to tune the gains of the PID controller automatically, by means of a global search method like PSO, so that the transient tracking error will be minimum. The modeling of TRMS exploiting the nonlinear characteristics and cross-coupling phenomena and proper designing of PID control law for it, is being realized in simulation environment. The proposed design methodology is utilized to explore different mode of operations of TRMS under different reference trajectories. The results demonstrate that the proposed design of PID controller is capable of tracking different reference trajectories in satisfactory manner.

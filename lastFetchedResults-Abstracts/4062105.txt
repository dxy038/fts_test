We have fabricated low loss, high coupling ratio bidirectional optical couplers for infrared light using multimode step-index chalcogenide fiber. Using a fusion technique similar to that commonly employed with silica fibers, we have found a temperature regime where fusion can occur while interdiffusion of the core and cladding materials will not. The resultant device has a roughly 3:1 coupling ratio, less than 0.3 dB of excess insertion loss, and preserves the guided modes of the fiber intact

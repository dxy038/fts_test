This article describes the use of predictive control for the decentralized cooperative control of unmanned aerial vehicles in an unfamiliar three-dimensional environment. It is assumed that each vehicle is equipped with an autopilot and a trajectory control unit. The autopilot insures the stability of the vehicle. The setpoints of the autopilot are calculated by the trajectory control unit, thus forming a cascade control structure. The trajectory control unit relies on a predictive control algorithm to calculate the optimal commands (autopilot setpoints) such that the vehicle will reach fixed targets at known positions while avoiding static obstacles that are detected en route. The advantage in using predictive control is that it offers great flexibility in the objective function to optimize while respecting constraints such as command limits, limits on the displacement that a vehicle can carry out, and the constraints that allow obstacle avoidance. The principle proposed in order to avoid static obstacles (that are assumed ellipsoid) is to verify that the predicted vehicle trajectory does not intersect these obstacles. With the objective to increase performance, cooperation between vehicles must also be privileged. Thus, if some vehicles are within the communication range, they can share the position and shape of the obstacles they have detected. Simulations illustrate the method and higlight the benefits of cooperation.

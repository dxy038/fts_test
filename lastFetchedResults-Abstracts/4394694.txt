In this paper, a computational intelligent technique genetic algorithm (GA) is implemented for the optimization of artificial neural network (ANN) architecture. The network structures are normally selected on the basis of the developerÂ´s prior knowledge or hit and trial approach is used for this purpose. ANN based models are frequently used for the prediction of future load, because of their learning and mapping ability to address the non linear nature of electrical load. The proposed technique provides a pathway to determine the best ANN architecture, prior to the training and learning process of neural network. Multi-objective algorithm is proposed in this research which optimizes the ANN architecture that leads to enhancement in load forecast accuracy and reduction in the computational cost. The results of several experiment conducted during this work, exhibits that forecast accuracy is considerably enhanced by using an optimized and reduced ANN structure.

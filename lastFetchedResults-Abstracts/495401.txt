This study examines the media diet of Richard Nixon, whose exposure to the news consisted almost
entirely of a White House-produced daily news summary. Nixon staffers repeatedly asserted that the
summary was the most effective way to give the president a comprehensive, objective account of
the previous day’s reporting. While the summaries covered a wide range of media sources, analysis of
the framing and filtering done by the White House raises doubts about the assertion that summaries
were an effective substitute for first-hand consumption of the news. Nixon’s handwritten marginal
notes reveal that the summaries provoked reactions in the president that had important implications
for his conduct of the presidency.

Simulation of accidents at nuclear power plant is designed to anticipate problems and unexpected situations. In a accident a large volume of information arrives disorderly and demands that decisions be taken quickly under pressure. This context asks for a system that supports decisions made jointly by the agencies responsible for the containment of the accident which has occurred. In order to study the emergency response process, we analyze the video and audio recordings of a simulated accident at a nuclear power plant in Brazil with the purpose of identifying cognitive requirements to build a future decision support system. In this work, we applied the methodology Applied Cognitive Work Analysis (ACWA), which was created with the objective of integrating the Cognitive Task Design and Software Engineering for the development of decision support systems.

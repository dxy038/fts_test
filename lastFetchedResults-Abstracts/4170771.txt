A bidirectional dual-frequency retrodirective array is presented, which uses intermediate frequency (IF) phase conjugation as the design concept. The proposed array has the ability of working at two different interrogating frequencies. For each interrogating signal, the frequency is converted to the other. This array contains the attractive features of simultaneously achieving bidirectional dual-frequency retrodirectivity and high isolation between the receiving and retransmitting signals. It is suitable for a full-duplex communication system. The proposed array is fabricated and demonstrated. Monostatic and bistatic measurements have been done to validate the performance of the system.

Objective
We have analyzed the prevalence and patterns of constipation in women with urinary symptoms and/or genital prolapse.
Study design
Seven hundred and eighty-six consecutive urogynecologic patients underwent a questionnaire and structured clinical assessment. Comparison between constipated and nonconstipated women was made. Fisher exact test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and logistic regression were used for statistical analysis (P< .05 for significance).
Results
Thirty-two percent of women were constipated (172 difficult stool passage, 13 reduced stool frequency, 64 both). A genital prolapse â‰¥2 degree Half Way System (HWS) was present in 44% of women. A posterior colpocele was more frequent in constipated women (35% vs 19%; P< .0001), resulting in a risk factor for constipation (OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.63-3.27). By contrast, higher degrees of anterior colpocele appeared to protect against constipation (OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.66-0.96). No differences in prevalence of constipation were observed for urinary symptoms or urodynamic diagnosis.
Conclusion
Bowel dysfunction correlates exclusively with posterior aspects of the pelvic floor support.

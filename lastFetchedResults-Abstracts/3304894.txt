Visual cognition results from the interaction between objective images and cognitive subjects. In this paper, the concept mental connectivity of visual imagery is proposed for the first time, based on which a novel interpretation of the visual invariance stimulated by objective images is made on the level of global visual cognition. In addition, according to the research on the cognitive difficulty based on visual imagery, it is concluded that cognitive difficulty is positively correlative with the varying degree of local characteristics.

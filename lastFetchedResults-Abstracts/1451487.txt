The sum coloring problem has many applications in scheduling. It is a variant of the vertex coloring problem where the objective is to minimize the sum of colors used in coloring the vertices. In this paper, we use tabu search to solve the sum coloring problem. Experiments are performed on instances extracted from the second DIMACS challenge. Results show significative improvements on some chromatic sum bounds.

Objective (s): This study aimed to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity among students in Marand, Iran
Methods: In this cross-sectional study 10679 students (elementary, pre-high school and high school students) were selected randomly. Then their weight, and height, was measured and body mass index (BMI) percentage calculated. BMI was used to assess students' weight status. Descriptive statistics were used to explore the data.
Results: The majority of the students (81.8%) had normal weight. More than 6% (6.25%) and 3.5% of students were overweight and obese respectively. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was more common among male students compared to females (P < 0.001). Also, the prevalence of overweight and obesity among pre-high school students was significantly higher than elementary and high school students (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: The findings showed a relatively low level of overweight and obesity among students in Marand. However, it seems that students would possibly benefit from a nutrition and health promotion program to reduce the tendency of overweight and obesity, especially among male students.

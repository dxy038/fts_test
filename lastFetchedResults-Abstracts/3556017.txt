SCNSOP is a program developed on a microcomputer for analysing arbitrary N-phase switched capacitor (SC) circuits. It performs time-domain, frequency-domain and sensitivity analyses and also multiple objective optimisation. It can also calculate the poles of an SC circuit. In the paper, the multiple objective optimisation for SC circuits is described, and the methods of calculating the poles of an SC circuit and the sensitivity of the circuit transfer function with respect to capacitor ratios are given. No topological or duty-cycle constraints have been imposed on the circuits. Two examples are included to illustrate the capabilities of the SCNSOP program.

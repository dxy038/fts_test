The 2001 International Symposium on VLSI Technology, Systems, and Applications was held 18&#8211;20 April in Hsinchu, Taiwan. The objective of the conference was to bring together scientists and engineers from all over the world who are actively engaged in research and development of VLSI technology, systems, and applications, to discuss current progress in this field with the experts from Taiwan´s local industry. There were two main changes made by the organizing committee: shifting the meeting from the traditional June time frame to take advantage of the beautiful spring season in Taiwan and moving the conference location from Taipei to Hsinchu, the center of advanced integrated circuit design and manufacturing in Taiwan. This year´s meeting attracted more than 600 attendees, a substantial increase over previous years and a strong indication of success, particularly considering the current economical climate.

Background: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are among the most common causes of illness in the world and have far-reaching health, economic and social consequences for many countries. Failure to diagnose and treat STIs at an early stage may result in serious complications and sequels. Objective: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis infection in patients who remain symptomatic after completion of their first episode of treatment for STI. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study on 49 patients suffering from symptoms or signs of sexually transmitted infections despite their first complete anti STI treatment. Conducting physical exam and smear preparation from vaginal discharge, diagnosis was confirmed by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method on every patientâ€™s first-voided urine sample. Results: Among the etiologic factors investigated in this study, Chlamydia was reported in 17 patients. Trichomoniasis, Candidiasis, Gonorrhea and nonspecific germs were next organisms with 11, 9, 6 and 6 patients, respectively. Sixteen specimens were PCR positive (32.65%), while 33 patients had negative PCR results (67.34%) for Chlamydia trachomatis. Conclusion: Gonorrheal infection was the most prevalent infection in patients with completed treatment (6/10), which must be remembered in patients follow ups, because this prevalence warrants empirical therapy for Gonorrheain similar clinical conditions. Chlamydia trachomatis was the responsible organism in approximately a quarter of patients (17/75) who despite their full compliance on anti-Chlamydial treatment still suffered from signs and symptoms of STI. This rate also recommends empirical therapy for Chlamydia trachomatis in the similar clinical signs and symptoms.

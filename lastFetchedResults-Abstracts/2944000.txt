Howard University is continually renewing its engineering program for fast integration of new and developing technologies. The continuing effort is to further incorporate design in the curriculum up-date of undergraduate engineering programs. The objective is to make our products more competitive in the new world and labor environment. This philosophy has been applied to a traditional electrical engineering option, the electric power engineering program, which had been experiencing decreasing intake. This paper presents a success story at optimizing a design based undergraduate power engineering education program at Howard University. The basic philosophy, methodology and results obtained are discussed. Sample projects carried out by students are briefly presented and these demonstrate the broad base and multi-disciplinary nature of the design projects. These design projects include `Integrated Optimal Power Flow and Dynamic Security Design´, `Hybrid Transit Electric Vehicle´, and `Medicine Bottle Opener´. The overall effect has been to improve professionalism and problem solving skills and increase self esteem of students, and thereby, their productivity. It has heightened interest and awareness of the electric power program, increased both the number of students graduating in the electrical power program and the retention ratio. The lessons learnt will be of value to other engineering schools

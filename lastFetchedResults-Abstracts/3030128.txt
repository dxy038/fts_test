In this paper, we study the resource management problem in direct sequence - wideband code division multiple access (DS-WCDMA) systems of mobile communication network. The transmission power and transmission rate control, in resource management are to be optimized while without violating the quality of service. Both single objective approach and multiobjective genetic algorithms have been investigated. Not only comparison has been conducted between the two cases, but their performance has also been compared with other currently available searching techniques.

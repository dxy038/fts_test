Objective Previous research has suggested
that psychosis is better described as a continuum
rather than a dichotomous entity. This study
aimed to describe the distribution of positive psychosis-
like symptoms in two large community samples
using an item response mixture model. Method
An item response mixture model was used to explain
the pattern of psychosis-like symptom endorsement.
This model incorporated two elements. First, a continuous
non-normal latent variable to explain the
observed pattern of data. Second, a categorical latent
variable to explain the variation in the continuous
non-normal latent variable. Results For both samples,
representing broadly and narrowly defined psychosis,
the best fitting model was a four-class solution. In
both cases, the classes differed quantitatively rather
than qualitatively. Conclusions The analysis showed
that psychosis-like symptoms at the population level
could be best explained by four classes that appeared
to represent an underlying continuum

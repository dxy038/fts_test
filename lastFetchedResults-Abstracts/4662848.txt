Nowadays, due to the development of power electronic technology, nonlinear electronic loads using power electronic circuits are widespread in power grids. The loads can consume more reliable and high-quality power through the power conversion circuits. However, the power grids can suffer significant harmonic currents caused by these power electronic circuits. This paper proposes a new harmonic compensation method of utilizing multiple power inverters that integrate distributed resources (DRs) to a microgrid. Therefore, harmonic problems can be solved without installing additional power filters to the grids. To coordinate multiple various DGs such as small distributed generators (DGs) and battery energy storage systems (BESSs), the proposed method considers multiple objectives in terms of energy cost, generation margins of DGs and energy margins of BESSs. The optimization algorithm is constructed based on fuzzy multi-objective optimization model so that the proposed method assigns the additional output power of each DR that is needed for harmonic elimination. Simulations of the suggested coordination strategy for harmonic compensation using multiple DRs are conducted in the microgrid including two inverter-based DGs and one BESS to verify the performance of the proposed method.

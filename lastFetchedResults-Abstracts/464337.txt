OBJECTIVE: We examined whether the presence of fetal fibronectin in cervicovaginal secretions can be used as a selection criterion for induction of labor at term.
STUDY DESIGN: Cervicovaginal secretions of 64 women who were scheduled for induction of labor were examined for fetal fibronectin and divided into group A (positive for fibronectin) and group B (negative for fibronectin). Both groups were examined for Bishop score, the number of prostaglandin tablets administered, and the interval between induction of labor and delivery.
RESULTS: In group A the interval between induction of labor and delivery was significantly shorter (p< 0.0001) than in group B. The number of prostaglandin tablets administered to group A was likewise significantly lower (p< 0.0001). Unsuccessful induction of labor only occurred in women with fibronectin-negative cervicovaginal secretions.
CONCLUSION: The assessment of the fibronectin content of cervicovaginal secretions constitutes a viable instrument in the decision-making process preceding induction of labor.

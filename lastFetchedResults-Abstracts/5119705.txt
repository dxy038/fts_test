System state monitoring is crucial in order to maintain the system security, reliability and quality of a power system. Considering the limitation of monitoring devices in distribution network, state estimation technique could be employed. State estimation is an action of appraising an unknown system variables based on limited number of real-time measurements. The main objective of this paper is to find the suitable state estimation that able to estimate the state of the islanded distribution network. In this paper, state estimation for a distribution network is developed and enhanced by incorporating composite load model. By incorporating this model, the calculated state variables of the network will be more accurate (to obtain the most practical value of the system state variables). Moreover, the proposed state estimation results are compared with backward-forward sweep load flow technique to justify the system state variables.

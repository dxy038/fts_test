Background & Objectives: Moderate changes in diet have been shown to prevent or delay complications of type 2 diabetes. Understanding beliefs about healthful eating among persons at risk for diabetes may help to develop interventions to change these beliefs as a mechanism for changing dietary behaviors in this population. Therefore objective of this study is to examine the validity and reliability of Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) scales for healthful eating for persons with diabetes.
Material & Methods: Cross-sectional study was conducted in Semirom diabetes clinic, using a self-administered questionnaire.
Participants were 142 adults who had not complications of diabetes. Variables measured were attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention to eat a healthful diet.  Construct validity was assessed with factor analyses. Reliability of the scales was assessed with Cronbach alpha and a 2-month test-retest.
Results: Factor analysis loadings were greater than 0.4. Cronbach alphas for attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention were .92, .91, .91 and .90, respectively. Factor analysis revealed that the constructs   fit well for predicting intention to eat a healthful diet. Test-retest revealed 2-month stability of the scales.
Conclusions: Questionnaire for measuring TPB constructs attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control were valid and reliable for use with adults with diabetes.

This paper mainly investigates the optimal design of a novel magnet structure of open-type superconducting magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) device. In order to obtain multiple optimization design objectives including high homogeneity in the imaging region, high magnetic field strength as well as low cost, a two-step optimization strategies are carried out, in which orthogonal design (OD) is, firstly, employed to define the key ones among several possible design variables and then response surface model (RSM) with high computation efficiency is utilized to simulate the objective function. The optimal magnet structure for superconducting MRI is obtained.

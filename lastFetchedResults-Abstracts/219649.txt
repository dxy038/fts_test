Mycobacterium thermoresistibile was first reported in 1981 as a human pathogen. Several studies have reported pulmonary infection and cutaneous  lesions due to this type of mycobacterium.
A five-year-old boy with cough, fever, and abdominal pain was referred to Masih Daneshvari Hospital. He had been treated with diagnosis of histiocytosis x. Gastric lavage was performed and examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Mycobacterium thermoresistibile was found. It seems that this case is the first report of an atypical tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium thermoresistibile in  a child.

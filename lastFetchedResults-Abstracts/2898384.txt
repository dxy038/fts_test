In recent years, the penetration of plug-in electric vehicles (PHEV) keeps growing up. On the other hand, power systems contained PHEVs would probably make increased system peaks and over loading of power system assets if they do not have proper control on charging and discharging of PHEVs. It means that a suitable charging and discharging schedule can avoid overloading of a network at the peak hours by charging on the off peak hours. First of all, this paper is modeled the demand of PHEVs by considering the PHEVs trips. Then it is purposed a decentralized smart-charging schedule which is derived from the algorithm based on Genetic Algorithm (GA). So the objective of this paper is to study how to manage the charging of the PHEV batteries and to represent an accurate model for PHEVs. The proposed algorithm is tested on a 77-bus distribution system. The results derived from simulation analysis show a considerable economic saving and reduction in peak demand and having a smoother profile of consumption.

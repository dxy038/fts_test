Objective: Attention - deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been increasingly recognized as a valid adult diagnosis. Yet, its prevalence and associated impairments in university students have received little attention. This descriptive study aimed to determine the rate of ADHD in a group of Iranian university students. Method: For this cross-sectional study, 409 university students living in Fatemeh-Al-Zahra dormitory (Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences) were selected through convenience sampling, and after excluding 165 students (by exclusion criteria) the rest were assessed using the self-administrated Conner's Questionnaire for ADHD. Statistical analysis was performed by chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Results: The prevalence of ADHD was 3.7% in the study population (according to ADHD index); subscale B (hyperactivity/restlessness) had the most frequency (7.8%) and subscales D (problems with self concept) and A (attention/memory problem) were least common (2%). ADHD group had higher rates of positive history of psychiatric problems and medicationuse. Conclusion: It seems necessary that university students be screened for this disorder and be referred to psychiatrist for further evaluation and treatment to improve their academic function and personal relations.

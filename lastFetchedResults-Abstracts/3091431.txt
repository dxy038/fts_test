The super-resolution algorithm constructs high resolution image using low resolution images. The ideal algorithm should be fast, and should add sharpness and detail, both at edges and in regions without adding artifacts. In this paper we propose a technique to yield a color super resolved image from four low resolution color images. We distinguish two major phases: registration and interpolation. Existing registration techniques are computationally time consuming. Current interpolation methods introduce blocking artifacts and also smoothens the edges and is unable to restore high frequency details in image. We propose efficient registration and wavelet based interpolation for SR image reconstruction. Our technique is efficient and computationally fast having clear perspective of real time implementation. PSNR obtained and objective test results presented in paper support our claim.

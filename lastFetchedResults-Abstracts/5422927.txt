In this paper we propose an iterative algorithm for solving the problem of extracting a sparse source signal when a reference signal for the desired source signal is available. In the proposed algorithm, a nonconvex objective function is used for measuring the diversity (antisparsity) of the desired source signal. The nonconvex function is locally replaced by a quadratic convex function. This results in a simple iterative algorithm. The proposed algorithm has two different versions, depending on the measure of closeness between the extracted source signal and the reference signal. The proposed algorithm has useful applications to EEG/MEG signal processing. This is demonstrated by an example in which eye blink artifacts are automatically removed from a real EEG data.

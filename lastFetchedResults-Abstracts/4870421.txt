Owing to the storage capacity of oil on the earth at most last for 40 years and being in the situation of unbalance of necessity and consume, the oil price has crazily risen up and this situation indirectly caused economic decline, goods price unstable, all those condition gradually caused global economic crises. Every country was conscious of the energy of earth was almost consumption danger, thus they positively developed the new energy of next generation such nuclear energy, windpower generator, solar energy, biologic energy etc. Among those methods nuclear energy was the better strategy for producing energy for its economical benefits, but it would generate large amount emission of CO<sub>2</sub>, and finally leading to second pollution and ozonosphere broken to form greenhouse effect and cause gradual ecological damage. That´s why all countries again developed all possible methods to conserve energy and decrease CO<sub>2</sub> emission and that meant not only regarded energy develop but also energy conserved. This research was mainly to meet with the government policy of energy saving which was positively promoted by Energy Bureau of Taiwan Economy Department and to use all brand-new technology of sensor and communication techniques to construct active intelligent energy-conserved system which was designed on the conception of module to correspond to different energy consumption condition. In this system &#8220;active&#8221; meant the system with auto-sensor and monitoring control techniques would detect the energy consumption conditions both in environmental factors and power system in addition to feedback control with optimal operating parameters such as voltage, current, power factor, harmony-wave factor that was arranged with intelligent agent technique. All those parameters in this system would be automatically detected by digital meters which was designed by researchers with DSP, high-speed A/D concerted card so as to real-time respond to system oper- - ation; as to recognition of objective environment such as persons, facilities, air conditioning, lights in the space would need to use RFID system; parameters would be transmitted to servo PC to be judged what´s the best feedback control parameters so there would develop ZigBee wireless sensor network technique; the controlled facilities would use Bluetooth modules which was operating with high frequency, non-disturbed, low power-consumption, non-direction features; as to long distance far away main servo PC the transmission mechanism would use embedded system to construct middle-way real-time respond system; the rear terminal control would design with power PLC.

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) on treatment response of refractory hypertension of the patients.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Method:</strong> This was a triple-blind randomized clinical trial conducted on female patients suffering from refractory hypertension and PMS at the same time. We obtained informed consent from 40 patients who had inclusion criteria and selected 20 patients for the intervention (sertraline 50 mg daily) and 20 for the control groups. The study period was five weeks. The mean of systolic and diastolic blood pressure before and after intervention was measured separately for each individual in each group and the mean of blood pressure of the members of the two groups were compared with each other.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Results:</strong> The mean age of the participants was 43.60 ± 4.57. In this study, systolic and diastolic blood pressure of both groups reduced after intervention. The mean of systolic blood pressure was reduced by 40.86 mmHg in the intervention group and this reduction was 16 mm Hg in control group after intervention (P&lt;0.001). Comparing this reduction between the two groups, we found that reduction rate in systolic blood pressure of the two groups did not have a significant statistical difference before and after the intervention (P = 0.11). Mean of diastolic blood pressure also showed reduction of 9.17 mm Hg and that of control group showed 6.7-mmHg reduction. Reduction rate of diastolic blood pressure in the intervention group had a statistically significant difference with that of the control group (P&lt;0.017).‎‎</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Administration of sertraline is more effective in controlling diastolic blood pressure in women suffering from refractory hypertension and comorbid PMS.</p>

The use of computational techniques in the processing of histopathological images allows the study of the structural organization of tissues and their pathological changes. The overall objective of this work includes the proposal, the implementation and the evaluation of a methodology for the analysis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) from histopathological images. For this purpose, a pipeline of morphological operators were implemented for the segmentation of cell nuclei and the Delaunay Triangulation were used in order to represent the tissue architecture. Also, clustering algorithms and graph morphology were used to automatically obtain the boundary between the histological layers of the epithelial tissue. Similarity criteria and adjacency relations between the triangles of the network were explored. The proposed method was evaluated concerning the detection of the presence of lesions in the tissue as well as the their malignancy grading.

A planar Ka-Band antenna demonstrator for nomadic satellite communication (satcom) is presented. A hybrid beam steering concept (mechanical/electrical) is proposed and implemented. Here, the electrical beam steering (phased array) with its fast response time can compensate for mechanical pointing errors and hence, reduce the accuracy requirements of the mechanical positioning unit. The aperture of the antenna is realized in conventional waveguide technology with an array of radiating horn elements to achieve an extremely high aperture efficiency and radiation efficiency. Measurements and simulations show an excellent agreement and confirm the high radiation efficiency. Finally, tests of the complete system have been conducted in a life bidirectional satellite link scenario.

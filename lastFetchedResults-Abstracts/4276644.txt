Summary from only given, as follows. The aim of this paper is to compute the high frequency parameters of transformer windings, by means of a 3D finite element method. These parameters include the inductive and capacitive parameters of a discretized windings. The formulation is based on the use of a scalar potential and allows the exact computation of the discretized parametes for any complex 3D geometry. The final objective is to study the propagation of steep front surges along the transformer windings. The application has been compared against classical analytical and 2D computations already made.

The objective of the research is to validate the AOT for estimation of V02max in
healthy males and females. Subjects included 55 males and 50 females
selected by purposeful stratified sampling based on health and age criteria.
Subjects participated in both field and treadmill tests during a one week period.
Age subgroups were 17-20, 21-25, 26-30, 31-40 and +41 consisting of at least
10 volunteers. The criterion measures were directly obtained from gas-analyzer
outputs during a treadmill workout using AOT protocol. For men mean (±SD) of
age, weight, height, maximal heart rate, 8MI and V02max were 31(±11 yrs),
74(±12kg),175(±6cm),191 (±11 beat),4.06(±3.9kg/m2),38(±6mllkg/min),
respectively. The same measures for women were 9(±10yrs), 62(±11kg),
.161 (±5cm), 191 (±12beat), 23.90(±4.0kg/m2
) , 33(±8ml/kg/min), respectively.
The study showed that increase in 8MI and aging results in decrease in
maximal heart rate and V02max. Compared to similar studies, produced
formulas are scientifically acceptable, and the estimations are sufficiently
accurate. High determination coefficients and low standard errors of estimate
indicate that V02max estimation by AOT protocols is considerably trustworthy.

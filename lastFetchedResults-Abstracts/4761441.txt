The current evolution in test and recording means leads to the development of assemblies in the form of basic modules that meet the growing requirement for simple, configurable, modular equipment allowing low-cost test campains, along with the testing of new radar waveforms and new associated signal processing algorithms. In this context, the objective of the Banc dÂ´Exp&#195;&#169;rimentation de Simulation et de Test (BEST) Bench, is to make available a test tool for these new radar waveforms, along with a recording tool for X-band data. The BEST equipment (Figure 1) includes: - a wealth of programmable waveforms, - electronic scanning in azimuth, - high reception and sampling swing enabling the observation of very close targets, - large radar coverage ranging from some km to several tens of km, - real-time processing capability providing precise localization of zones of interest, - fast speed recording capability. This equipment is totally autonomous : antenna, transmission, reception chain and control of sensor and includes real-time capability and high continuous recording capability enabling to be operated in a number of test configurations. The BEST bench therefore provides the user with better physical understanding of the nature of ground or sea clutter, along with improved mastering of target signature.

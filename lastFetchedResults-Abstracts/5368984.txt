In this paper we consider the scheduling of a batch of workflows on a service oriented grid. A job is represented by a directed acyclic graph without forks (intree) but with typed tasks. The processors are distributed and each processor have a set of services that carry out equivalent task types. The objective function is to minimize the makespan of the batch execution. Three algorithms are studied in this context: an online algorithm, a genetic algorithm and a steady-state algorithm. The contribution of this paper is on the experimental analysis of these algorithms and on their adaptation to the context. We show that their performances depend on the size and complexity of the batch and on the characteristics of the execution platform.

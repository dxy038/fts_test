Using a detailed waveform-based simulation framework, a study on the feasibility of LPI sonar is performed for covert range estimation. A frequency selective channel filter is applied for realistic ocean simulation. The platform uses matched filtering and the target uses energy detection for processing the received signal. The objective of the platform is to estimate the range to the target while ensuring that the target still fails to detect the platformÂ´s pinging LPI waveform. A platform-target encounter scenario was designed for Monte Carlo simulation. Evaluation of system parameters was performed to assess for the feasible conditions for covert range estimation.

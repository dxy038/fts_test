Objective(s):To evaluate the effect of Graptophyllum pictum on lipid peroxidation and tissue antioxidant enzymes in liver and kidney of gentamicin induced nephrotoxic rats.
Materials and Methods: Animals were grouped into 6: Group 1 received gum acacia, Group 2 received G. pictum ethanol extract (300 mg/kg), Group 3 received gentamicin, Groups 4, 5, 6 received gentamicin along with G. pictum at 300, 150, 75 mg/kg, respectively. Nephroprotective activity was evaluated by measuring thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), biochemical markers Â Glutathione (GSH), Glutathione-S Transferase(GST), Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), serum urea and creatinine levels.
Results: Results obtained showed that gentamicin induced nephrotoxic rats exhibited lower activities of biochemical markers and raised levels of TBARS, serum creatinine and urea. Remarkably, after treatment with G. pictum extract, anomalous levels of biochemical markers, lipid peroxidation and serum creatinine were returned to normal.
Conclusion: The results propose that G. pictum has nephroprotective effects, and can be a promising natural source against gentamicin induced nephrotoxicity.

The location management problem corresponds to the management of the network configuration with the objective of minimizing the costs involved. It can be defines using several different schemes that principally consider the location update and the paging costs. The location area and reporting cells are two common strategies used to solve the location management problem. In this paper we present a new approach that uses the differential evolution algorithm applied to the reporting cells planning problem, with the objective of minimizing the involved location management costs. With this work we want to define the best values to the differential evolution parameters and respective scheme, using 12 distinct test networks, as well as compare our results with the ones obtained by other authors. The final results obtained with this approach are very encouraging.

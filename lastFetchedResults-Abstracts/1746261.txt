In this paper, we present the main results of the BioSecure Signature Evaluation Campaign (BSEC'2009). The objective of BSEC'2009 was to evaluate different online signature algorithms on two tasks: the first one aims at studying the influence of acquisition conditions (digitizing tablet or PDA) on systems' performance; the second one aims at studying the impact of information content in signatures on systems' performance. In BSEC'2009, the two BioSecure Data Sets DS2 and DS3 are used for tests, both containing data of the same 382 people, acquired respectively on a digitizing tablet and on a PDA. The results of the 12 systems involved in this evaluation campaign are reported and analyzed in detail in this paper. Experimental results reveal a 2.2% EER for skilled forgeries and a 0.51% EER for random forgeries on DS2; and a 4.97% EER for skilled forgeries and a 0.55% EER for random forgeries on DS3.

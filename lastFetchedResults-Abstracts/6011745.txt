The objective of this paper is to make a review of the current status of the PolSARpro v2.0 software (polarimetric SAR data processing and educational toolbox), developed under contract to ESA ("Development of a Polarimetric SAR Image Analysis Tool", ESA-ESRIN Contract ndeg 17863/03/I-LG) by a consortium comprising I.E.T.R at the University of Rennes 1, DLR-HR and University of Adelaide. The objective of this current project is to provide educational software that offers a tool for self-education in the field of polarimetric SAR data analysis at university level and a comprehensive suite of functions for the scientific exploitation of fully and partially polarimetric multi-data sets and the development of applications for such data. The PolSARpro v2.0 software establishes a foundation for the exploitation of polarimetric techniques for scientific developments and stimulates research and applications developments using PolSAR and PolInSAR data

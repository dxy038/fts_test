The paper presents an investigation of a DC/DC bidirectional converter. A new state-space model has been developed to analyse the bidirectional current flow characteristics. This model has been incorporated into a simulation program for a stand-alone photovoltaic plant that includes a lead-acid battery for energy storage. An integrated control system is developed and evaluated in the simulated system. Results show that the model is accurate and offers a significant improvement in the computational efficiency.

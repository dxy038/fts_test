Consumer interest in 3D television (3DTV) is growing steadily, but current available 3D displays still need additional eye-wear and suffer from the limitation of a single stereo view pair. So it can be assumed that autostereoscopic multiview displays are the next step in 3D-at-home entertainment, since these displays can utilize the Multiview Video plus Depth (MVD) format to synthesize numerous viewing angles from only a small set of given input views. This motivates efficient MVD compression as an important keystone for commercial success of 3DTV. In this paper we concentrate on the compression of depth information in an MVD scenario. There have been several publications suggesting depth down- and upsampling to increase coding efficiency. We follow this path, using our recently introduced Edge Weighted Optimization Concept (EWOC) for depth upscaling. EWOC uses edge information from the video frame in the upscaling process and allows the use of sparse, non-uniformly distributed depth values. We exploit this fact to expand the depth down-/upsampling idea with an adaptive low-pass filter, reducing high energy parts in the original depth map prior to subsampling and compression. Objective results show the viability of our approach for depth map compression with up-to-date High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). For the same Y-PSNR in synthesized views we achieve up to 18.5% bit rate decrease compared to full-scale depth and around 10% compared to competing depth down-/upsampling solutions. These results were confirmed by a subjective quality assessment, showing a statistical significant preference for 87.5% of the test cases.

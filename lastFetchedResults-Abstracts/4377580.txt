An optimum electromagnetic design of a nonsalient magnetic-cored superconducting synchronous machine (SSM) is presented in this paper. First, self- and mutual inductances of a nonsalient magnetic-cored SSM are calculated using the magnetic energy method and analytical equations of magnetic vector potential. Then, a design approach for an SSM machine is proposed based on the inductances of the machine. An optimal design is finally performed using a genetic algorithm, considering the machine efficiency as an objective function. The finite-element method is utilized in each step to verify the analytical results.

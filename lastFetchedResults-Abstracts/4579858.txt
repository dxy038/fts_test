In the past decades, technical developments have enabled the delivery of sophisticated mobile spatial audio signals to consumers, over links that range very widely in quality, requiring decisions to be made about the tradeoffs between different aspects of audio quality. It is therefore important to determine the most important spatial quality attributes of reproduced sound fields and to find ways of predicting perceived sound quality on the basis of objective measurements.This paper first briefly reviews several subjective quality measures developed for streaming realtime audio over mobile network communications and in digital audio broadcasts. Then a experimental design on the application of the subjective listening test for mobile spatial audio is described. Finally, the conclusion is analysed and some future research directions are identified.

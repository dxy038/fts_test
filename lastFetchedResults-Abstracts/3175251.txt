A deblocking algorithm based on curvelet transform is proposed in this paper. This algorithm processes the curvelet coefficients separately which obtained by curvelet transform of the degraded images to recovery the images. The coefficients corresponding to block effect of the original image can be found for every layer and different layers using different methods. Then new coefficient matrixes are obtained, using which images are reconstructed. Experiments show that the algorithm retains more details and generates better recovery results than the traditional spatial domain and wavelet deblocking methods which used commonly on both subjective and objective evaluations.

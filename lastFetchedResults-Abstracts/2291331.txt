The main objective of the present paper is to simulate the tectonic evolution of normal faults by means of hypoplasticity. This constitutive concept is introduced with state limits for sand-like and clay-like materials. Combined with conservation laws, and initial and boundary conditions, hypoplastic relations provide normal fault patterns, which are validated by model tests. For a cross section of the Lower Rhenish Basin with synsedimentary subsidence, the observed normal fault pattern is essentially reproduced. A realistic evolution of a single normal fault with the distortion of a clay layer into a clay smear is also obtained. The potential of our method for other tectonic simulations is indicated.

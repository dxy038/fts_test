The objective of the study is a development of desk-top magnetic shielding system for the calibration of high-sensitive magnetometers, and the evaluation of their ability to produce a uniform magnetic field. This system consists of hexagonal tubes and a cylinder. The hexagonal tubes have a double-layered structure, an opening and an advantage in axial shielding performance. The cylinder has openings and an advantage in transverse shielding performance. A solenoid-like coil is wound around the hexagonal tubes to produce a uniform magnetic field. From the experimental results, the magnetic shielding and the calibration field properties are demonstrated. Within the half length of the system, the achieved total magnetic field (dc component) is less than 200 nT within &#177; 50 nT deviation, and the measured shielding factor is larger than 250. For producing a uniform magnetic field up to 10 kHz, we can use the 1/3 length of the system.

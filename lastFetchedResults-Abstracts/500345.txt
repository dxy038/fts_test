Since adding MTBE to gasoline leads to destructive biological effects such as untreatable diseases, it has been couple of years that this material is omitted from gasoline in developed countries. The main objective of this research paper is substituting ethanol for additive substance MTBE as well as studying the effect of ethanol as a fuel on the performance, pollutant production and fuel consumption of a spark ignition motor and finally achieving an optimal ethanol-gas composition. The Experiments were carried out regarding to cases of Full and Part load. The full load Experiment was performed in terms of varies speeds of motor and the part load one utilize speed ranging from 2000 to 3000 rpm. The ignition time (duration) was optimized in the entire Experiment The achieved outcomes demonstrate that when ethanol rate is changed in a composiÂ¬tion, the volumetric efficiency, power and torque of the motor is boosted. Besides, specific fuel consumption in low-speed is cut and it is increased in accelerations. On the other hand, ethanol in the composition has led to a considerable decrease in the amount of HC pollutant. CO pollutant is lessened to some extent while NOx rate shows a nominal accession. XU7JP/L3 motor is studied in this research pape

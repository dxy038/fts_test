Soft computing techniques have been applied successfully to various actual problems. In this paper, we propose a new decision support system for dealing stocks which improves the traditional technical analysis by using GAs. Further, we also briefly touch upon our trial utilizing NNs for this objective. Several computer simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed DSS.

An optimization model is presented with a posynomial objective function subject to a fuzzy relation equation. Then the structure of solution set and its solving method are related about fuzzy relation equations. Next the optimum solution is discussed, based on exponent of monomial among objective function, then a solution procedure is proposed. And finally, two practical examples are given for illustration purpose

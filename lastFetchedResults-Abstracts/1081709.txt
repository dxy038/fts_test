The objective of this work is to devise the regulation of total emissions in water and wastewater treatment employing the rapid coagulation processes (URC). The process consists of coagulation/flocculation and lamella settler adopting sludge return and weighted coagulants. It was applied for treating storm water, combined sewer overflow (CSO), stream water, and lake water in a pilot or field scale. The performance of the system was assessed by the removal efficiency of COD, BOD, T-P, and SS (potential water quality standards to regulate total emissions in water body). The results show effluent water quality parameters in pilot or field scale run can meet regulatory standards regardless of types of water or wastewater sources.

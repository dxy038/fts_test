A series of bromotyrosine-derived compounds, including marine natural products and members of a psammaplin A-inspired combinatorial synthetic library, were screened for their ability to inhibit the Mycobacterium tuberculosis detoxification enzyme mycothiol-S-conjugate amidase (MCA). Correlations between the structures and their respective IC50 values (which range from 3 Î¼M to 2.7 mM) should prove valuable when optimizing more potent inhibitors of MCA.

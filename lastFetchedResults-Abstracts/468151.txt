Objective: Our aims were to evaluate the full-thickness anterior rectal wall advancement flap in the treatment of primary and recurrent or persistent rectovaginal fistulas, evaluate the surgical exposure for composite repair of site-specific perineal defects, and categorize clinical manifestations of site-specific perineal defects caused by obstetric injury. Study Design: This is a prospective study of all patients with fecal incontinence from rectovaginal septal defects and complex perineal obstetric injuries treated by the Noble-Mengert-Fish operation. Results: Thirty-four patients were classified into groups on the basis of site-specific perineal defects. Anatomic success was 94.2%. Functional success was excellent in 76.5%, good in 14.7%, fair in 5.9%, and poor in 2.9%. Conclusion: The Noble-Mengert-Fish operation is effective for primary and recurrent or persistent rectovaginal fistulas. The circumanal surgical exposure permits concomitant repair of all perineal defects. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:1411-7.)

The paper reviews some of the most efficient wavelet approaches to image fusion for remote sensing applications and indicates open issues and future trends of this remarkable research. For the particular topic of spatial enhancement in multi-resolution image fusion, quality assessment of the fused image is considered. An objective analysis is described, based on both global and local score indexes. The problem of reducing possible visual artifacts is also discussed.

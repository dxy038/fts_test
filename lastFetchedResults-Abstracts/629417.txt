The objective of this study was to reassess 99Tc transit times and transfer factors, from Sellafield to northern Norway, and to determine the extent of 99Tc migration to the Barents Sea. Filtered seawater samples were collected on a monthly basis from Hillesøy, northern Norway, and in February 1999 from the Barents Sea. Results showed an increase in levels of 99Tc at Hillesøy where activity concentrations have increased from a baseline of 0.2–0.4 Bq m−3 to a maximum of 1.6 Bq m−3. A transit time of 42 months and a transfer factor of 6 Bq m−3 per PBq a−1 have been derived, using cross-correlation analysis. The current study predicts that future levels are unlikely to increase dramatically over the levels observed in 1998. Levels of 99Tc in the Barents Sea ranged from 0.2 Bq m−3 to 1.1 Bq m−3 showing the influence of new 99Tc inputs by early 1999.

This paper presents two adder compressors architectures addressing high-speed and low power. Adder compressors are used to implement arithmetic circuits such as multipliers and digital signal processing units like the Fast Fourier Transform (FTT). To address the objective of high-speed and low power, it is well known that optimization efforts should be applied in all abstraction levels. In this paper are combined optimizations at logic, electrical and physical level. At the logic level, the circuit is optimized by using multiplexers instead of XOR gates to reduce delay, power and area. At the electrical level, this work presents an architecture that generate the XOR and XNOR signals simultaneously, this reduce internal glitches hence dynamic power as well. And finally at the physical level, and automatic layout generation tool (ASTRAN) is used to make the adder compressors layouts. This tool has proved to reduce power consumption and delay due to the smaller input capacitances of the complex gates generated compared to manual-designed layouts.

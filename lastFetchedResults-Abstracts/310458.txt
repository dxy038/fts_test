Objective. To quantify individual forearm muscle passive forces and evaluate their impact on hand function.

Design. The passive force-length properties of the 24 extrinsic hand and wrist muscles were determined in five fresh frozen cadaver arms.

Background. Muscle force production is a summation of the active and passive force components. The passive properties of the extrinsic finger musculature and wrist musculature appear to strongly affect both hand posture and hand movement.

Methods. The passive force-length properties of extrinsic hand and wrist muscles were determined by applying a slow, continuous extension to each muscle and recording the resulting tension. Each force-length curve was fit using exponential regression and were related to specific joint rotations and seven hand postures by calculating the muscle excursions for those postures.

Results. The exponential passive force-length relationship explained over 97% of the experimental variance. The largest passive forces were elicited in the digital extensors in grips involving large flexion angles such as tip pinch, key pinch, and a briefcase grip.

Conclusions. The passive properties of the extrinsic finger musculature and wrist musculature affect both hand posture and movement especially in postures with flexed wrist and fingers.

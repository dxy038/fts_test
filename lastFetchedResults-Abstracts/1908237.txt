The objective of this review is to examine the published data regarding quality of life (QOL) in patients with bladder cancer. Not a single, randomized controlled trial exists. Most studies are retrospective, cross-sectional, and have serious methodological flaws. There is no single QOL tool preferably used in bladder cancer. While there is no long-term data after therapy for superficial cancer, most investigations compared the impact of different forms of urinary diversion on QOL. In contrast to the prevailing notion that patients who underwent cystectomy undergoing continent urinary reconstruction have superior QOL than those receiving a conduit, existing reports fail to show significant advantages of one technique over the other.

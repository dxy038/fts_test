Taxi GPS traces can inform us the human mobility patterns in modern cities. Instead of leveraging the costly and inaccurate human surveys about peopleÂ´s mobility, we intend to explore the night bus route planning issue by using taxi GPS traces. Specifically, we propose a two-phase approach for bidirectional night bus route planning. In the first phase, we develop a process to cluster &#8220;hot&#8221; areas with dense passenger pick up/drop off and then propose effective methods to split big hot areas into clusters and identify a location in each cluster as a candidate bus stop. In the second phase, given the bus route origin, destination, candidate bus stops, and bus operation time constraints, we derive several effective rules to build the bus route graph and prune invalid stops and edges iteratively. Based on this graph, we further develop a bidirectional probability-based spreading algorithm to generate candidate bus routes automatically. We finally select the best bidirectional bus route, which expects the maximum number of passengers under the given conditions and constraints. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, extensive empirical studies are performed on a real-world taxi GPS data set, which contains more than 1.57 million night passenger delivery trips, generated by 7600 taxis in a month.

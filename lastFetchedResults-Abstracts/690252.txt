The objective of this study is to clarify the regeneration of granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorbed trichloroethylene (TCE) using wet peroxide oxidation (WPO). TCE and TOC concentrations decreased during WPO, whereas Cl− accumulated in water indicating that TCE was not only decomposed but was also mineralized to Cl− and CO2 using WPO. Regeneration efficiencies (q/q0) of GAC regenerated at 150, 165 and 180 °C (initial pH 4) were 0.36, 0.45, 0.48, respectively. In addition, regeneration efficiencies of GAC regenerated in the solution of various initial pH (2.5, 3.0, 4.0) at 180 °C were 0.71, 0.60, 0.48, respectively. These results suggest that regeneration of GAC is more effective at higher reaction temperature and lower initial pH of the solution. In the repeated regeneration of GAC, the adsorption capacity of GAC for TCE gradually decreased and regeneration efficiency of the regenerated GAC at sixth step was 0.40. The adsorption capacity loss of regenerated GAC is probably due to oxidation of GAC during WPO.

Using the method of sensitivity analysis, the weight of partial similarity has been calculated based on researching on the calculation model of similarity in CBR(Case-Based Reasoning). The change of design target value has been calculated by using FEA(Failure Mode and Effect analysis )software to analyze the structure whose design variable was little changed. Based on the result of FEA, the similarity of design variable has been achieved by central-difference, then the weight of partial similarity and the importance degree of design variable has been computed. The example shows that the weight calculated by the method in this paper is objective and feasible, and the similarity of design variable is very valuable for variant and optimal design.

A computer-aided design (CAD) tool for the design of planar multi-layer coatings with high absorption for a desired frequency and angle range is presented. The tool uses deterministic and evolutionary optimization design methods. Both single and multi-objective design algorithms can be used and a single absorber design or the Pareto front can be found accordingly. A novel design technique utilizing PSO is also presented. A user-defined or a pre-defined design case can be selected interchangeably. The choice of selecting materials from pre-defined database is also available. The tool can be useful for both educational and research purposes. The efficiency of the tool is demonstrated through several design cases that are in agreement with existing literature data.

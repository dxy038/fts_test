Background:Preterm birth and low birth weight are important causes of mortality in infants.
Objective: This study aimed to determine the relationship between bacterial vaginosis, low birth weight, and PROM.
Methods:This analytical study was performed on vaginal discharge of 751 pregnant women within the weeks 23-26 of gestation in Qazvin health centers during 2008-2009. Cluster sampling was the method used in our study. Samples were analyzed according to Nugent criteria and the data evaluated with chi-square test. 
Findings:Results showed that 734 (97.7%) of specimens were negative for bacterial vaginosis and 17 (2.3%) cases positive. Migration of a number of study population made it impossible to check the delivery status. Of 697 patients with negative bacterial vaginosis, 72 (10.3%) had PROM while in other group there were four cases (23.5%) with PROM however, the difference was found to be insignificant, statistically.
Conclusion:Based on results found through this study, No significant difference was found between bacterial vaginosis, preterm delivery, and LBW.

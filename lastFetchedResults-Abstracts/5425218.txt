Objective assessment on the value of ecosystem service of protected area for water supply is very important to eco environmental protection of protected area for water supply, comprehensive management of water resources and eco compensation. The article structured a assessment system based on the classify of ecosystem service of protected area for water supply, which consisted of five values of ecosystem services: food production, gas adjustment, climate adjustment, hydrology adjustment and waste disposure, and quantifying assessed these values taking the Yunlong Reservoir of Kunming as a example. The result showed that the total value of ecosystem service of protected area for water supply is 6.139 hundreds of million, including direct use value is 0.191 hundreds of million and indirect use value is 5.948 hundred millions; adjustment service value is greater than supply service value, and the former is 31 times to the latter; the service value of forest ecosystem is 4.806 hundreds of million, and occupying 80% of the total value of study area, the service value of water area ecosystem is 1.009 hundreds of million, occupying 16.44%, and farmland only occupying 5.28%; the value of hydrology adjustment is the highest, the value of gas adjustment is close to the one of climate adjustment, the one of waste disposure takes second place and the one of food production is the lowest. In addition, the study thinks that the assessment method of ecosystem service of protected area for water supply is feasible, and combining with the types of land can make the research result having reality significance and guiding. But the research only assessed the value of current situation, and the further study should focus on the change value and space influence of ecosystem service.

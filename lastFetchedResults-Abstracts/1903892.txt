Optimal natural resources management depends on reliable as well as up-to-date data. For this
objective, land use map is among the important sources of information on the natural resources
management. The aim of present study is to compare two methods of pixel-Base and object-oriented
classification in land use mapping with using ETM+ image in Malekshahi town, Ilam province. After
supplying related image and geometric and radiometric corrections implement on image, the authors
used tow method classification to land use mapping. To assess the accuracy of classification method
they used index of overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, producer accuracy and user accuracy. The
results showed that the object-oriented classification method has more resolution in comparison to the
pixel-based classification method. The results of determine accuracy showed that method of objectoriented
in tow index of overall accuracy and kappa coefficient with (respectively) 96 percent and 93
percent was more accuracy related to pixel-based classification method. Based on the results the forest
and grassland covers about 98 percent of this town. The result of this study suggested that used from
object-oriented classification method to production of land use map.

The 18 papers in this special section focus on contactless energy transfer (CET) systems. These papers can be grouped into the following categories: 1) a review paper on acoustic CET systems; 2) capacitive coupled CET systems; 3) novel control methods applied for CET systems: adaptive sliding mode, phase-locked loop based, etc.; and 4) modern inductive coupled CET systems with uni- and bidirectional energy flow directions, multiple and individual users, etc.

To solve the direct current (DC) power flow model based static transmission network expansion planning (STNEP), a modified version of MOX algorithm named Improved-MOX which has fast computation time and having better exploration capability then the MOX algorithm is presented in this paper. The objective is to minimize the transmission investment cost. Transmission network expansion planning (TNEP) helps to find out the new line configurations to meet the necessary requirements of the system operator in order to maintain the stable operation of the system. Here STNEP is analyzed considering without generation rescheduling. GarverÂ´s six-bus, IEEE 24-bus and IEEE 25-bus test systems are used to check the validations of the proposed algorithm and along with the results obtained are compared with the existing in literatures.

Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between maternal ambulatory blood pressure monitor measurements during pregnancy and birth weight in a population of women considered to have hypertension according to conventional antenatal clinic measurement. Study Design: A prospective observational study was carried out within the obstetric departments of Leicester Royal Infirmary and Queen Charlotte’s Hospital. A total of 237 women were found to have hypertension (blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg) without significant proteinuria during examination in the antenatal assessment area. Sequential-day unit blood pressure recordings and a 24-hour automated ambulatory blood pressure recording were performed, and the results were compared with the principal outcome measure of birth weight. Results: A significant inverse association (gradient, –13.5; 95% confidence interval –23.4 to –3.6) was found between daytime ambulatory diastolic blood pressure measurement and birth weight. An increase of 5 mm Hg in daytime mean diastolic blood pressure was associated with a fall in birth weight of 68.5 g. This association remained after adjustment for potential confounders that included maternal age, maternal weight, smoking status, ethnicity, and gestational age at delivery. No such association was found between obstetric day unit assessment of blood pressure and birth weight. Conclusion: There is a significant association between blood pressure and birth weight in nonproteinuric hypertensive pregnancies. The best predictor of this association is the daytime mean ambulatory diastolic blood pressure measurement. This is further evidence that maternal blood pressure may be an important confounding and potentially genetic variable in the association between birth weight and subsequent adult hypertension.

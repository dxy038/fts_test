In this paper an optimal placement of
photovoltaic systems (PV) as a source of active and
reactive power in radial distribution networks is
considered. The objective function of this problem is
minimizing system losses and improving voltage profile.
Genetic Algorithm (GA) implemented for this purpose.
Photovoltaic solar systems can be used as STATCOM for
voltage regulation and power factor correction during
both nighttime and daytime. This novel PV solar system
application, beside other useful applications, makes it
very useful, so it can operate more effective by
considering its reactive and active power generation in 24
hours. In this study backward-forward power flow
method is applied on standard IEEE 33-bus system.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Seizure could occur in early stroke phase, which leads to clinical deterioration of the patients.
METHODS: In this prospective clinical study, consecutive 1000 patients with first ischemic stroke admitted in Valie-Asr hospital, Khorasan during 2000-2003. Diagnosis of stroke and early seizure was performed by neurologist. Topography of the ischemic lesions was detected by topographic maps of cerebrovascular territories in brain CT scan. FINDINGS: 6.1% of the patients had seizure within first week of stroke. Partial seizures with or without secondary generalization consisted 60% of these early seizures. Within middle cerebral artery territory infarctions ischemic lesions with cortical involvement were 2.43 times more preponderant to early seizures (p=0.003). Frequency of early seizure was not significantly related to diffuse extension of the ischemic lesions within middle cerebral artery territory infarctions.
CONCLUSION: Early seizure is an infrequent complication of ischemic stroke which is more frequent in infarctions with cortical involvement.

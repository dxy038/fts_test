While market conditions change over the investment period, portfolio optimization models identify an optimal portfolio and hold it during the investment horizon. Accordingly, this paper presents a strategy to divide the investment period into sub-periods and revise an existing portfolio at the beginning of each sub-period. This study develops a fuzzy multi-objective nonlinear portfolio rebalancing model to upgrade a portfolio considering investor profile, transaction costs and risk-free rate of return. Finally, the proposed method is validated for three different investor profiles by using the real data derived from Tehran Stock Exchange. The results show that the proposed strategy outperforms the market.

Based on data collected previously on the electricity market of the East China, we use stepwise regression method to find the approximate expression of the active power flow of each power sets on East Chinapsilas certain electrical network. Then classified discussion is carried out according to the difference of the capacity in and out of merit in order to obtain a simple and reasonable rule for calculating the block cost. Based on this, the objective programming model for output distribution of each unit is achieved. Exclude conditions step by step, and adjust the output allocation plan. Introduce flexible factors defining membership function to change fuzzy programming into non-fuzzy programming, and use genetic algorithm to get solution. The model considers both safety and cost so that different network operators can get their preferred allocation plan.

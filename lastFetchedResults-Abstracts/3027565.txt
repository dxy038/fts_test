Designing a decentralized reconfigurable control (DRC) system is considered for large-scale systems. The objective of the DRC system is to achieve performance requirements under normal and sensor failure situations. The objective is accomplished by integrating three schemes of: Nominal controller, fault detection and isolation, and reconfigurable controllers. These schemes have a decentralized structure for the reason that the implementation of a centralized reconfigurable control system for large-scale systems is usually not feasible with existing digital signal processors. However, with a decentralized approach the total task of the reconfigurable control system is divided into a number of relatively small tasks, which can be implemented by a number of processors working in parallel. The proposed design is demonstrated in reality on a segmented telescope test-bed.

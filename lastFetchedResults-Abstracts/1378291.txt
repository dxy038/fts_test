The objective of this work was to synthesize cyclic prodrug 2 derived from the parent RGD peptidomimetic 1 and to evaluate its chemical and enzymatic stabilities and antithrombic activity. Cyclic prodrug 2 was formed to improve the cell membrane permeation of RGD peptidomimetic 1 by transiently masking the unfavorable physicochemical properties of compound 1. Cyclic prodrug 2 was synthesized by linking the amino and carboxylic acid groups of parent 1 via the (acyloxy)alkoxy promoiety. The prodrug-to-drug conversion of cyclic prodrug 2 was evaluated in isolated esterase and human plasma in the absence and presence of the esterase inhibitor paraoxon. The rate of hydrolysis of cyclic prodrug 2 was significantly faster in plasma (t1/2=33.5±0.6 min) than in PBS (t1/2=314±11 min). Cyclic prodrug 2 was converted by esterase to the parent compound 1 and this conversion was inhibited by an esterase inhibitor, paraoxon. The IC50 (4 μM) of cyclic prodrug 2 was higher than the IC50 (1.9 μM) of parent drug 1. The antithrombic activity of cyclic prodrug 2 depends on the incubation time in platelet-rich plasma; the activity increases with incubation time, suggesting that the prodrug-to-drug conversion is time-dependent and mediated by esterase. Cyclic prodrug 2 was more stable under acidic and neutral conditions than under basic conditions, suggesting that handling and formulation of this prodrug should be undertaken under acidic conditions.

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between weight and shape concerns and attachment towards mother and father in inpatient obese youngsters. Method: In a sample of 39 inpatient obese youngsters weight and shape concerns were measured with the Children's Version of the Eating Disorder Examination and attachment was measured using the Relationship Questionnaire. Results: Pearson correlation analyses demonstrated that attachment towards mother was linked with both weight and shape concerns, whereas attachment towards father was uniquely linked with weight concerns. Conclusion: This study demonstrated an association between attachment and weight and shape concerns in inpatient obese youngsters. This suggests that relationships with attachment figures should be taken into account when these youngsters require treatment for eating disorder symptoms.

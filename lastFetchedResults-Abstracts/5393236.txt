Radio frequency identification (RFID) systems are very effective for identifying objects. In multiple object identification systems with active tags, the tags are designed for extremely low-cost large-scale applications such that battery replacement is not feasible. This imposes a critical energy-constraint on the communication protocols used in these systems. In this paper, we analyze energy consumption and identification times for several protocols. The objective is to decrease energy consumption of tags by reducing both total identification time and total active time.

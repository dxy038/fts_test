This papers describes the performance of objective algorithms when they are applied for stereosocopic image quality assessment. Specifically, the authors ascertained the performance of the objective algorithms after the combination with an weighting by means of the disparity. The IRCCyN-IVC 3D Images Quality database was used to verify the performance of the objective algorithms. Indeed, the obtained results suggest a significative enhance of the prediction capacity of the objective algorithms when they were combined with the disparity information contained in the original image signal.

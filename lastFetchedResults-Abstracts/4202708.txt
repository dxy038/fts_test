In this paper, data replication schemes are studied in the context of a distributed storage scenario to help balance the load in the network and significantly decrease the access latency experienced by end-users. The problem of static data replication is optimised with the objective of minimizing the cost associated with the read and write requests. A dynamic replication scheme is also proposed where nodes adapt to changes in the access pattern. Simulation is carried out to evaluate the performance of both schemes under static and changing access pattern.

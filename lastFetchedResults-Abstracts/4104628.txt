We discuss design considerations for wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)-based packet networks. In the near term, such networks are likely to consist of WDM links connected using some form of electronic multiplexing. The focus of this article is on the joint design of the electronic and optical layer with the objective of simplifying the network and reducing the protocol stack. To that end, we discuss the benefits of optical flow switching, network reconfiguration, traffic grooming, and optical layer protection. We also discuss the state of all-optical packet networking with particular focus on local area network technology

In the present work, dynamic stability analysis of power system is investigated considering proportional-integral-derivative power system stabilizer (P-I-D PSS) for multimachine power systems. Gain settings of P-I-D PSS are optimized by minimizing an objective function using genetic algorithm (GA). Dynamic responses are also compared considering P-I-D PSS and conventional phase lead-lag power system stabilizer (CPSS). Attempt is also made to examine whether gain settings of P-I-D PSS obtained at a particular operating condition works well or not to all other operating conditions. Analysis reveals that the P-I-D PSS gives better dynamic performances as compared to that of conventional power system stabilizer. Analysis also reveals that the optimum gain settings of P-I-D PSS obtained at nominal operating condition works well to other operating conditions without much deteriorating the dynamic responses.

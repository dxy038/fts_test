Arkel and Snoek (1934) reported on the dielectric behavior of concentrated solutions of dipole substances. They found that the polarization shows a marked decrease with increasing dipole concentration. In the present work, it is deduced that such a behavior can be explained by nonlinear electrostatic dipole interaction. At high concentration the counteracting dipolar fields become much higher than external field strengths usually applied to the dielectric. The polarization of <e1>N</e1>&#10877;400 nonlinear interacting bidirectional dipoles distributed randomly between two electrodes is calculated. Computer simulation shows that the electrostatic dipole-dipole interaction in disordered systems of bidirectional dipoles leads to a decrease of the static polarization of the dielectric. The effect increases with increasing dipole moment and increasing dipole concentration

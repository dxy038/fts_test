Summary
um (Se) is a naturally occurring trace element that is essential for animal and human nutrition, but the range between dietary requirements and toxic levels is relatively narrow. In this review, we are interested in the beneficial effects of selenium and we report on a number of studies of the selenium status of different populations in Saudi Arabia. The Status reflectes the geographical area inhabited by the populations. Apart from the few available studies reviewed here, no data on the human status of Se in Saudi Arabia has been obteined. A further objective of this paper is throw some the light on the direction of future studies.

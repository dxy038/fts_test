The First International Workshop on Web Wisdom (WW2012) is co-located with the 2nd International Conference on Social Computing and its Applications (SCA2012) held on November 1-3, 2012, Xiangtan, Hunan, China. Recent years, many new theories and technologies for Web Wisdom have made the Web much wiser. In Web wisdom, the machine can understand Web resources and provide personalization services for web users. To achieve the goal, the following related research areas should be pay attention to: Web semantic computing, Web semantic organization, Web resource semantic annotation, Web Information Retrieval, Web Intelligence Applications and so on. The objective of the workshop is to invite authors to submit original manuscripts that demonstrate and explore current advances in all aspects of Web Wisdom. WW2012 contains 2 papers. Each of them was peer reviewed by at least three program committee members. The workshop covers a broad range of topics in the field of web wisdom such as Theories and Practices of Web Wisdom, Computational Models for Web Wisdom, Data Link and Semantic, Link for Web Wisdom, Text Mining and Semantic Organization, Web Mining and Information Retrieval, Webbased Cooperation Model, Information Retrieval Models and Evaluations, Ontology-Based Web Mining, Ontology-Based Information Extraction and Retrieval, Semantic Web, Web Services, Web Knowledge Flow, Web Personalization, Web Knowledge Services and Fusion, Human-Web Interaction, Web-based Learning, Web Intelligence Application. We thank all the authors for submitting their innovative and sound work, and also the members of the WW2012 program committee for managing the reviews of submissions in such a short time. We believe these are the main driving factors attributed to our success.

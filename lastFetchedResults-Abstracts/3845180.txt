This work investigates the design of linear precoders for ARQ packet retransmissions in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. We consider transmitter precoder design based on partial MIMO channel information in the form of their covariance feedback. Our objective is to maximize the ergodic mutual information provided by multiple (re)transmissions of a packet subject to transmission power constraint. We propose a set of near-optimal successive linear ARQ precoders for flat fading MIMO channels. This progressive linear ARQ precoder combines the appropriate power loading and the reverse-order pairing of singular values in the current retransmission with previous transmissions. This reverse-order pairing is a special feature unique to our sequential ARQ preceding approach with demonstrated performance gains.

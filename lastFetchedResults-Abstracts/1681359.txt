The main objective of this study was to use the fermentability test to investigate the feasibility of applying various dilute acids in the pretreatment of barley straw for biological hydrogen production. At a fixed acid loading of 1% (w/w dry matter) 28–32% of barley straw was converted to soluble monomeric sugars, while at a fixed combined severity of −0.8 30–32% of the straw was converted to soluble monomeric sugars. With fermentability tests at sugar concentrations 10 and 20 g/L the extreme thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus showed good hydrogen production on hydrolysates of straw pretreated with H3PO4 and H2SO4, and to a lesser extent, HNO3. The fermentability of the hydrolysate of straw pretreated with HCl was lower compared to the other acids but equally high as that of pure sugars. At sugar concentration 30 g/L the fermentability of all hydrolysates was low.

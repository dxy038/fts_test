Most of structural parameters, such as material properties, geometric parameters, loads, and analytical models, are random in nature. Recent advances in stochastic structural analysis have made it possible to analyze the behavior of structures in which such parameters are modeled as spatially varying random processes or fields rather than as random variables. This article, applies a probabilistic nonlinear dynamic analysis of portal frames in which volume mass, modulus of elasticity and section dimensions are considered as random variables. The Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the random variables. Each variable is simulated for three kinds of probability density function (PDF) with three different coefficients of variations (COV). The objective of this paper is to evaluate the sensitivity of dynamic responses to the kind of PDFs and COVs. In doing so, the nonlinear dynamic analysis of structure portal frame with uncertain parameters is performed using numerical methods and the safety of the structure is investigated.

The objective of this project was to develop an electric air cleaning system for animal houses. An AC powered ferroelectric packed-bed plasma reactor was tested to destroy ammonia and odors in the air. The important parameters which affect the reactor performance were investigated. They are gas residence time in the reactor (four test levels, 0.2 to 1.3 s), power voltage (six levels, 0 to 15 kV), power frequency (two levels, 60 Hz and 18 kHz), and initial ammonia concentration (three levels, 21, 27 and 55 ppm). Up to 95% ammonia destruction efficiencies were obtained under a combination of test conditions. The plasma reactor was effective in destroying odors in the air taken from a swine room

Objective: The present investigation attempts to study the approaches, models and methods used for evaluating information systems. To this end, all aspects and featue of information systems and main issues in evaluation of information systems were offered as the basis for delineating evaluation approaches and methods
Methodology:  literature survey method was deployed. The literature analyzed and the prior researches consolidated served as the basis for presenting findings and discussion of results.
Findings: The literature concerning information system evaluation demonstrate that all types of methods and evaluation models are formed based on the type of outlook towards basic issues and basic postulations which in turn impose limitations and challanges on modes of evaluation. The “Context-Content-Process”(CCP) model provide an comprehensive prospect. CCP combines context, content and process with raison d’etre, nature, time and stakeholders’ viewpoints and reflects how they come to influence the evaluation of an information system. Theoretically, this model has encompassed the existing rules within various models and capable of absorbing new methods

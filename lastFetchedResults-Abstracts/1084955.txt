Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) developed by Albert Calmette and
Camille Guerin in France between 1908 and 1921 contained a live
attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis and was administered worldwide
to prevent tuberculosis. BCG vaccination is also administered at birth to all
the newborns in Iran. Disseminated BCG infection after BCG vaccination
is rare. Here in, we report 2 new cases of disseminated BCG infection
and review 15 additional cases identified from our previous retrospective
study during a 5-year period from 2005-2010. All of these reported patients
were vaccinated. Impaired immunity was detected in 10 cases (59%)
including severe combined immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous
disease, Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease, combined
variable immunodeficiency, and HIV infection. Response to therapy was
poor among those patients with immune deficiencies, but the overall
mortality rate was 32.3%. Disseminated BCG infection is a rare but
devastating complication of vaccination. Immune-compromised children
are at high risk of developing BCG related complications including regional
BCG-itis or disseminated disease; BCG-osis.

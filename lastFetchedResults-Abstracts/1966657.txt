The underlying validity of stated preference non-market valuation methods relies on the analyst's ability to identify, select, define, and articulate the goods being valued in a way that is relevant and understandable to the respondent, which requires detailed understanding of the respondents' experiences and points of view. Poor articulation of the good being valued will result in biased to useless information for decision-makers. It should therefore be of concern to economists and policymakers that the question of how best to perform pre-design qualitative work with local stakeholders is a neglected area of inquiry. This paper assesses Q-methodology as an objective, transparent, easily replicable, and statistically-rigorous approach to qualitative research to support the selection and definition of attributes for non-market valuation.

The main objective of this paper is to remove the high frequency measurement noise in real time from the output of the level transmitter which indicates the level of the process tank. The liquid level system consists of a level transmitter, PI controller and a control valve with actuator which when connected in closed loop can be approximated as a first order plant with time delay. The contaminated output of the liquid level system is de-noised using pipelined real time wavelet transform architecture implemented on FPGA using Xilinx System Generator and SPARTAN 3E development kit to ensure perfect reconstruction of the signal.

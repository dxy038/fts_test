The objective of M-C Power Corporation (MCP) is to design, develop, scale-up, and demonstrate commercial molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) stacks. In addition to stack manufacturing and power plant demonstrations, M-C Power, with the cooperation of the Institute of Gas Technology, is developing advanced cell component technologies. These advanced component technologies are designed to enable MCP to meet the cost per kilowatt and performance goals for the commercial MCFC power plants. Advanced component technologies which have reached the final stages of development prior to full-area manufacturing include a lower cost matrix and lower cost stabilized cathode. The development of advanced components capable of operating at market entry stack conditions including higher current densities (&gt;250 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>) has been initiated. Initial bench scale test results at market entry conditions are encouraging

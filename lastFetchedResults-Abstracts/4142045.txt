A non-polynomial (NP)-hard combinatorial optimization problem that is associated with expanding service capacities and increasing service reliability in grid-based utility computing is investigated in this paper. The considered problem is decomposed into master and slave subproblems, with theoretical justification, and a computationally efficient two-level iterative method that is used in solving it is proposed. To solve the slave subproblem, an ordinal optimization-based n-stage method, associated with an approximate model for objective value evaluation, is employed. To solve the master subproblem, a bisection method is used. Under some conditions, the solution obtained using the proposed iterative two-level method is optimal. The validity of the proposed method is tested by ten cases on a 12-node 17-link computing grid. Five of the ten cases are randomly selected, and the solutions that are obtained in these cases are optimal, rather than &#8220;good enough.&#8221; The average CPU time required by the proposed method in obtaining the optimal solution of the considered NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem is 2.278 h, when executed using a Pentium IV PC with a 2-GB RAM. Additionally, the computational efficiency of the proposed method greatly exceeds a genetic algorithm with an exact model.

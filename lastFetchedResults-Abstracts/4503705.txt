Interbasin transfer water (ITW) is an efficient solution to water scarcity in some large countries with sharp temporal and spatial variation of water resources. Considering the factors of society, economy and environment, five allocation principles for ITW are concluded based on water rights. Through quantifying the principles, a multi-objective model is obtained to allocate the limited water to different users of each subeara. In order to solve the model, the weighting technique is used to convert the multi-objective decision-making problem into a single objective issue. The weights not only reflect the information of indexes but also consider the preference of decision-makers. The numerical example of ITW allocation in Dalian shows that the model is flexible and practical, and it can be used to interbasin transfer project planning.

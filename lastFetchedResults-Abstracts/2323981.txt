Inroduction & Objective:Nucleus accumbens(NAC), prefrontal cortex(PFC) dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems are involved in regulating anxiety- like behaviors, whileNAc dopaminergic system activity is mediated by glutamatergic projections, via PFC.This study has investigated the involvement of NAc shell D1 dopaminergic and prelimbic glutamatergic systems on anxiety- like behaviors.
Material and Methods:Elevated plus-maze apparatus was employed to test parameters of anxiety-like behaviors After 5 days surgery of male Wistar rats in a stereotaxic frame ,Elevated plus-maze apparatus was employed for measuring parameters of anxiety-like behaviors due to intrabrain injection of drugsSKF38393(dopamine D1 receptor agonist),SCH23390(dopamine D1 receptor antagonist( ,NMDA(receptor antagonist), D-AP7) NMDA receptor antagonist  (onWistarmale rats.
Results: Unilateral intra- prelimbic injection of NMDA (0.9 ?g/?l), induced anxiolytic-like behaviors which has been blocked by D-AP7(NMDA receptor antagonist, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 ?g/?l). Moreover, unilateral infusion of SKF38393 (dopamine D1 receptor agonist, 3 ?g/?l) 0.25, 0.5 and 1?g/?l) into the left NAc shell induced anxiolytic-like behaviors which was blocked by SCH23390 (0.25?g/?l), while, SCH23390 (dopamine D1 receptor antagonistdid not so; Furthermore, intra-NAc shell administration of subthreshold dose of SKF38393 (1 ?g/?l) potentiated the lower dose, whereas decreased the higher dose of intra-left prelimbic NMDA response. In addition, the subthreshold dose infusion of SCH23390 (0.25 ?g/?l) into the left NAc shell, intra- prelimbic NMDA reduced induced anxiolytic-like behaviors. 
Conclusion: The results demonstrated a modulatory effect of NAC shell D1 dopaminergic system on anxiolytic-like response by injection in prelimbic NMDA.

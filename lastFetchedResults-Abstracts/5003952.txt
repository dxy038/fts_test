An advanced speckle correlation technique and electronic speckle pattern interferometry for the thermal deformation and vibration measurements of electronic devices are described. The optical system consisted by a long-focus lens with objective lens of the microscope and the project optical system is designed for the special uses of microelectronic devices. Some advanced techniques such as cross search method, correlation function of sub-pixel search and noise reduction using wavelet transform are developed that provide the thermal deformation and vibration measurement with high measuring accuracy and sensitivity. Two application examples of thermal deformation and vibration measurement for electronic device are presented in this paper. The measuring results have fully proved the capability of small objects and the powerful testing tools for the electronic devices

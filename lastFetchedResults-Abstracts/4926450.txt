Cellular manufacturing system which is based on one robot as a material handling device has been recognized as an efficient and effective way to improve the productivity in a factory. This paper addresses the machine layout problem in a flexible manufacturing cell served by a robot. The objective of the proposed approach is to obtain the optimum values of the locations and orientations of machines. The criterion to be minimized is the cycle time for completing a given sequence of operations, which is achieved by determining the relative positions of peripheral machines around robot on the work cell floor. Non-linear optimization models are presented which can be applied to find a collision free work cycle for an industrial robot. This optimization problem is solved by the genetic algorithm. An example of automatic planning robot work cell will be given.

Recent achievements of automotive telematics in the area of communication channels integration for providing a persistent bidirectional link between vehicle and cloud infrastructure have intensified research in the field of mobile multiprotocol networks of intelligent vehicles oriented on cloud and fog environmental services. Synchronization of multiprotocol unit system clock is crucial for intelligent vehicle networks in terms of security system functioning, navigation, driver and passenger services. In spite of the fact that clock accuracy requirements are comparable with those for stationary systems, limited lifetime route to server in the cloud or fog and substantial restrictions on wireless network traffic complicates the achievement of this objective. Method of mobile multiprotocol unit synchronization in dynamic wireless networks of different technologies with virtual cloud servers is presented drawing on Network Time Protocol (NTP). This method provides the required quality of multiprotocol unit system clock accuracy while minimizing network traffic. Synchronization path selection algorithm is described, as based on probabilistic approach and synchronization quality retrospectives in the chosen technology network. The way of local network traffic reduction while maintaining the required accuracy of multiprotocol unit system clock is shown. The method involved can be used for multiprotocol unit synchronization in intelligent transportation networks.

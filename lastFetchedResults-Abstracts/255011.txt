The monitoring of the stability of old mines constitutes an important research objective for
our institution, BRGM. The study reported here shows the contribution of high-frequency (>30 kHz)
acoustic emissions to the detection of the damage within a rock mass, during an experiment within a pilot
site of an old flooded iron mine. The experiment consisted of recording all the hydroacoustic events in a
broad frequency band (between 30 Hz and 180 kHz), during 18 months. The monitoring network has been
calibrated by a triggered block fall that made it possible to highlight a relationship between the occurrence
of high-frequency/low-frequency hydroacoustic emissions and rock falls. The events recorded have been
associated with the micro-failure of the rock mass near the roof, prior to the detachment of the blocks. This
monitoring showed important high-frequency hydroacoustic activity, which may be associated with
mechanical instabilities generated by the evolution of water pressure during the experiment. In conclusion,
the high-frequency hydroacoustic activity appears to be a good indicator of instability and, therefore, this
new technique constitutes a promising tool for monitoring abandoned underground cavities.

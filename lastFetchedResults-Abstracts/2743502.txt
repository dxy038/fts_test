The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) characterizes the energy-absorption ability of the vegetation canopy. It is a critical input to many land-surface models such as crop growth models, net primary productivity models, and climate models. There is a great need for FAPAR products derived from remote-sensing data. The objective of this research is to develop a new instantaneous quantitative FAPAR model based on the law of energy conservation and the concept of recollision probability (p). Using the ray-tracing method, the FAPAR-P model separates direct energy absorption by the canopy from energy absorption caused by multiple scattering between the soil and the canopy. Direct sunlight and diffuse skylight are also considered. This model has a clear physical meaning and can be applied to continuous and discrete vegetation. The model was validated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and field measurements in the Heihe River basin, China, which proved its reliability for FAPAR calculations.

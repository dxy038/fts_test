A methodology of generating recovery procedures in a robotic cell is described. The paper focuses on errors that occur during robotic system operation. Two phases are included in this approach: the preparation phase, and the generation phase. The primary objective of this approach is to formalize the process and representation required to generate recovery procedures and to integrate the process of constructing control software. Algorithms are developed along with these two phases and the structure of the error recovery module is also presented. As a result, the recovery procedures generated by this approach can be easily connected with the execution mode in a robotic cell

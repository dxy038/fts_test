This work suggests a NMPC controller for the urban perimeter control problem. The system model is based on the mathematical formalization of the problem, proposed in [1] expanded by describing the queue dynamics at the perimeter gates. For the extended model a multicriteria control problem is formalized: the conventional control objective of traffic network control, i.e. the improvement of TTD performance is accompanied by another control goal: the reduction of traffic emission. For the emission modeling, an average-speed based model framework is used, utilizing aggregated network parameters such as the total travel distance and the total time spent in the network. The NMPC controller is compared to a PID controller in a case study. The simulations show acceptable performance of the NMPC controller.

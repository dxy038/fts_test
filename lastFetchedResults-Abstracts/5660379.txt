Physical-layer attacks, such as high-powered jamming, can seriously degrade network performance and must be dealt with efficiently. Hence route lightpaths in such a way as to minimize the potential damage caused by various physical-layer attacks. A new objective criterion for the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem, which we call the maximum Lightpath Attack Radius (maxLAR) is used to formulate the routing subproblem as an integer linear program (ILP). Lightpaths, are established between pairs of nodes. Given a physical topology and a set of lightpath demands, the RWA problem consists of finding a - hysical route for each lightpath demand and assigning to each route a wavelength, subject to the constraints. The maxLAR is the maximum number of lightpaths any one lightpath is link-sharing with, where link-sharing is defined as a property indicating whether two lightpaths traverse at least one common physical link. Results indicate that the formulation achieves significantly better results for the maxLAR. For larger networks, a tabu search algorithm for attack-aware lightpath routing, in combination with an existing graph-coloring algorithm for wavelength assignment is used. Testing and comparing with existing approaches from literature indicate its superiority with respect to the maxLAR and thus the congestion is reduced effectively.

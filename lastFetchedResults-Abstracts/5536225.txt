This paper presents a nonlinear predictive control (NMPC) strategy applied to the continuous microalgae cultivation process in a closed photobioreactor. The photo-bioreactor system is programmed to operate in a constant biomass density mode, in order to maintain the culture at the optimal population density and sustain high biomass production levels. This objective is achieved by regulating the biomass density while tracking a reference culture medium feeding profile determined off-line. The proposed NMPC approach is validated in simulation, and performances and benefits for the cell cultivations are compared to those obtained when applying a generic model control (GMC) law.

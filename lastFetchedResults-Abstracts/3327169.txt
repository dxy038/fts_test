One of the main problems to resolve in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images processing is the reduction of speckle noise. This papers describes a method of speckle denoising and enhacement of SAR images in the wavelet domain. Specifically, we apply an edge detection on SAR images in conjunction with soft thresholding method. One of the principal objectives in a denoising technique is to verify if noise can be smoothed and at the same time maintain sharp edges and shapes. Experimental results over heterogeneous SAR images show that this proposed algorithm is a suitable tecnique for this objective and allow us to improve classification and detection performance for SAR based recognition.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trichomonas Vaginalis is the most prevalent nonviral agent that causes sexually transmitted disease (STD) in human. This organism causes vaginitis, infertility, preterm labour, premature rupture of membrane and low birth weight. This study was carried out to study the cellular immunity system's response to this infection through evaluation of CD3 and CD4 positive lymphocytes and cytokine interleukin 10 in the patients contaminated with this infection. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to compare 65 women having developed clinical symptoms of trichomonasis with control group in terms of age as well as social and economic conditions. They were compared in terms of the number of CD3 and CD4 lymphocytes and IL10 cytokine concentration in their blood. FINDINGS: Of 65 women studied, 25 (38.5%) were diagnosed with trichomonas vaginalis infection in the lab scale (vaginal discharge culture). More specifically, the percentage of T lymphocytes (CD3 positive cells) in infected women (79.75±0.7%) was (59.95±10%) higher than in the control group (p<0.0001). Auxiliary T lymphocytes (CD4 positive cells) in the infected women (67.94±0.96%) were also meaningfully (32.52±0.93%) higher than in the control group (p<0.0001). Moreover, a meaningful difference was observed in the IL10 serum level between the patient group (119 ±42% pg/ml) and the control group (1.02±0.14% pg/ml). (p<0.001) CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, cellular immunity plays a significant role in controlling trichomonas vaginalis infections. Therefore, another study with more samples and multi centers for confirmation are strongly recommended.

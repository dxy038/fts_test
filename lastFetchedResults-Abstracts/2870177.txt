In this paper, we consider the problem of secure communication in multiuser downlink wiretap networks where there exist a base-station (BS) equipped with multiple antennas, multiple legitimate receivers and a passive eavesdropper. The transmitter simultaneously transmits an information signal and artificial noise (AN) separately to the intended receivers and the eavesdropper, in which way, the secrecy rate at the eavesdropper can be seriously degraded without thinking about it location. Different schemes are studied about the power allocation of the multiple antennas in the BS, namely the average power allocation scheme and the Water-filling scheme. And in the average power allocation scheme, Zero-forcing (ZF) pre-coding scheme is used at the BS to eliminate the internal interference of all the security users. We obtain an analytical closed form expression of an achievable ergodic secrecy rate and use it as the objective function to optimize the power allocation rate between the information signal and the AN in the two schemes.

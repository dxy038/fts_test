The problem of optimization of induction motor design is tackled as a nonlinear programming problem. The objective function or the cost function is formed taking only the material cost into account. The specifications like pull out torque, starting torque etc. are put as constraint functions. These functions are expressed in terms of important dimensions of the machine which are assumed to be continuously variable. The sequential unconstrained minimization technique for nonlinear programming is used to obtain an optimum design. Analysis and synthesis programs needed for the problem have also been developed. The method is applied to a line of small single cage integral horsepower motors.

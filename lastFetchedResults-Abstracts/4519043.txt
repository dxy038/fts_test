Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) have gained a lot of importance in the recent years due to their flexible ways of operation, where mobile nodes form the network to communicate with each other, without the aid of any fixed infrastructure. Routing in MANETs is a challenging task mostly for its rapidly changing topology. Several routing protocols have already been proposed and implemented for ad-hoc networks. This paper proposes a new approach to evolve a suitable algorithm named Mobile Ad-hoc Network Routing Protocol (MOADRP). This algorithm is used to find routes for message transmission between mobile nodes in MANETs. The main objective of this newly implemented routing protocol is to reduce the overhead of maintaining a large routing table and also reduce the time delay for finding the route.

Pig bile(120), liver(120), spleen(120), mesenteric lymph node(120), faeces(126), and blood(120) samples were collected from 4 slaughterhouses lie in Shanghai suburb. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method was performed to detect HEV RNA from these samples. Positive RT-PCR bands specific for HEV were sequenced and the resulted sequences were phylogenetically analyzed. Our results showed that 4 bile, 4 serum, and 2 faeces samples were detected positive for HEV RNA and the positivity rate of them were 3.33% (4/120), 3.25% (4/123), and 1.59% (2/126), respectively. Bile was the most frequent specimen found to be positive in this study. Phylogenetic analyses showed that 6 of the HEV strains detected here belonged to genotype 3 while the other 4 isolates belonged to genotype 4. This confirmed that genotype 3 had become prevalent in China mainland. This study raises awareness that pork contamination with blood products, bile or faeces may pose a risk of HEV infection.

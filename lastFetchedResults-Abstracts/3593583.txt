Describes a group decision support system (GDSS) for a situation in which there are two groups of participants: a professional staff and the decision-makers (DMs). Through the participantsÂ´ reciprocation and complementation, a three-step decision process utilizing a general multiple-objective linear programming (MOLP) model is designed. The three-steps are the generation of alternatives, the group-decision operation, and the evaluation of the final results. The GDSS is evaluated with respect to four criteria: complete information, full participation, equity principle, and economic decision time. On the basis of these criteria, the system has shown its potential to improve the quality of decision-making and to shorten the time required for the process

This article reports experimental results of rapid or fast pyrolysis of rice straw (RS) and rice husk (RH) in a fluidised-bed reactor unit incorporated with a hot vapour filter. The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of pyrolysis temperatures and the use of glass wool hot vapour filtration on pyrolysis products. The results showed that the optimum pyrolysis temperatures for RS and RH were 405 and 452 °C, which gave maximum bio-oil yields of 54.1 and 57.1 wt.% on dry biomass basis, respectively. The use of the hot filter led to a reduction of 4–7 wt.% bio-oil yield. Nevertheless, the glass wool hot filtered bio-oils appeared to have better quality in terms of initial viscosity, solids content and ash content than the non-filtered ones.

Background: Easiness, accuracy, reliability and usefulness of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) have been frequently verified. This procedure is routinely used to diagnose the tumors of thyroid and parotid glands in head and neck areas.
Objective: To investigate the diagnostic value of FNAB in central giant cell granuloma (CGCG) of the jaws.
Methods: 16 cases out of the patients referred to surgery department of dental faculty were chosen based on radiolucent lesion in which a CGCG as a differential diagnosis was suspected. In each case the perforation and aspiration of lesion was performed using an 18 gauge syringe. Sampling was carried out in triplicate e.g., three syringes and three different points. The aspirated samples were smeared on slides, fixed with Patofix and sent to pathology department to be examined histologically.
Findings: in four samples from a total of 16 specimens obtained by FNAB, the pathology report was indicative of the presence of giant cells as well as bleeding, inflammation, lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear cells. Histopathological studies on postoperative specimens confirmed the presence of CGCG in three samples out of four. The results showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 75% for giant cell granuloma of the jaws using FNAB method.
Conclusion: Based on data found in our study, the application of FNAB technique, if performed precisely, in combination with clinical and radiographic findings will effectively help in diagnosis of CGCG. This will cause a reduction in expenses, size of stress and physical damage to patients and also prevent seeding of lesion.

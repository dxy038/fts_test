We evaluate the cascadability performance of a new semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) Mach-Zehnder interferometer-based nonreturn-to-zero wavelength converter in a loop experiment. We use the bidirectional data injection control scheme with an additional continuous-wave signal to optimize the gains and phases imparted by the SOAs. The scheme has been shown to be capable of eight cascaded, error-free wavelength conversions at 10 Gb/s.

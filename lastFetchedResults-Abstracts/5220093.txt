An optical network with wavelength-division multiplexing technology enables us to communicate with a large capacity. To minimize capital expenditure, cost-effective network architecture is urgently required. Network evaluation has been conducted using quantitative indices such as equipment cost and optical signal degradation. In fact, experts use a subjective equipment allocation balance when they evaluate the final network design. But it is still difficult to establish an objective criterion and an evaluation method. This study focuses on the communications equipment distribution balance as an evaluation criterion and proposes an evaluation technique using the Network Voronoi diagram.

Short-run productions are common in industrial environments where flexibility is required in the
manufacturing of parts and several product variants can be produced. Monitoring process stability during
the production run is strategic to avoid the occurrence of an excessive number of non conforming units
which can lead to excessive scrap or rework costs. The selection of the best control strategy can be
obtained with respect to an economic objective by minimizing the cost associated with the implementation
strategy. In this paper, several strategies including preventive maintenance, Shewhart, EWMA and
CUSUM control charts are compared to monitor process dispersion. Constraints related to the line productivity
and the inspection activities configuration have been included in the problem formulation. A
proper optimization algorithm has been developed to cope with the investigated problem. A large benchmark
of process scenarios has been investigated and the obtained results show that the selection of the
best strategy is not a straightforward task due to the influence of several process operating parameters.
Finally, a numerical example is detailed to get more insight about the investigated problem.

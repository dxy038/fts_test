Recent advances in the field of bioinformatics present a number of challenges in the secure and efficient management and analysis of biological data resources. Workflow technologies aim to assist scientists and domain experts in the design of complex, long running, data and computing intensive experiments that involve many data processing and analysis tasks with the objective of generating new knowledge or formulate new hypothesis. In this paper we present a bioinformatics workflow authoring and execution environment that intends to greatly facilitate the whole lifecycle of such experiments. Emphasis is given on the security and ethical requirements of these scenarios and the corresponding technological response. In addition we present our semantic framework used for supporting specific user-requirements related to the reasoning and inference capabilities of the environment.

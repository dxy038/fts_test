Background and Objective: The traditional diagnosis methods have been considered efficient to distinguish between active and non-active states of Periodontitis. These indicators will provide information about the severity and extent of disease rather than on the current activity of the disease. The present study was a guideline to determinate the effect of elastaese in salvia before and after treatment of periodontal disease.
Materials and Methods: This clinical trial study was performed on the chronic periodontitis. Full-mouth bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), Plaque index (PI), clinical attachment loss (CAL) and salivary elastase were recorded from all patients before and after six weeks of treatment (first phase of periodontal therapy). The levels of elastase were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Results: The results demonstrated significant differences in the above mentioned clinical parameters and levels of salivary IL-8 among study groups (P < 0.05). Smokers with periodontitis had the highest and non-smokers with healthy periodontium had the lowest salivary IL-8 level.
Conclusion:The levels of elastase in saliva before treatment were higher than post treatment. Therefore, periodontal disease seems to be related to higher levels of elastase in saliva.

We propose a novel handoff call control scheme to alleviate effectively this excessive use of channel resources. For CDMA cellular mobile systems consisting of homogeneous cells, a variety of traffic parameters are estimated by the detailed traffic analysis, based on which a Markovian queueing model is developed to analyze the performance of proposed call control scheme. Moreover, with a well-known performance objective, a mathematical problem of finding optimal call control parameters is proposed, along with its solution method

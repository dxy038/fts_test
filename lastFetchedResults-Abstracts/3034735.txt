We consider access control in a multiattribute hierarchy and propose a new approach to assign cryptographic keys for this hierarchy. Access control through authorization is important to a high-secure system in military or government where unauthorized users are not allowed to access secret data. A real application system for the high-secure military workflow is considered. Every particular working activity in the workflow must associate multiattributes. The application system is based on the Petri net model, we define the access control problem in our system as a multiattribute hierarchy environment. A Petri net is represented by a directed, bipartite graph in which nodes are either places (represent conditions) or transitions (represent activities). A token that is located in a place signifies that its condition is true. When all the places to a transition have a token, the transition is enabled. Our problem objective is to assign suitable cryptographic keys to this multiattribute hierarchy. Based on a description on security requirements, our algorithm can verify and generate the keys automatically.

This paper is devoted to the Fluorescence Diffuse Optical Tomography. This inverse problem (physical parameter estimation problem) relies on an iterative algorithm based on repetitive solutions of a set of partial differential equations. The main goal of the paper is to present a wavelet-based model reduction technique applied to the solution of the partial differential equations involved in the problem, with the objective of computation complexity reduction. The effectiveness of the approach is then illustrated on a practical example.

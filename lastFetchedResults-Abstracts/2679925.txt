This paper aims to propose the interference and also investigates the channel effect on power allocation issue. Here, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is employed in order to find the optimal solution. Because of the value of resources in the satellite telecommunication systems, optimizing the use of power allocation is very important. In these systems, because of non-zero side lobe, there exists an interference between beams that affects the allocation problem. To assess the efficiency of PSO algorithm, the obtained results are compared with the Duality Theory. The analogy is conducted through three different scenarios: In the first scenario, it is supposed to have interference between each beam and the three adjacent beams. The second scenario assumes that the first beam interferes with other beams. Finally, in the third scenario, the analysis of channel conditions of each beam and its effect on the power allocation problem is provided. The objective functions for the proposed method are the total system capacity and sum of the square of difference between the requested traffic and the allocated beam power. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm improves the solution in each scenario and implements justice to the power allocation issue.

Delamination of mating interfaces can cause serious reliability problems in different application areas. The causes of delamination are multiple. In the case of leadframe-based chip packages, a critical interface is that between the leadframe and the moulding compound. Delamination can magnify stress levels at the interface and can lead to fatigue of interconnects. The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of different causes of delamination on degradation of the leadframe compound interface by means of simulation, supported by targeted experiments. To this end two models have been devised, which show good convergence. However the different simulations are not yet compatible with each other and need to be validated.

The barium titratitanate is used as a substrate for two microstrip antennas designed on 900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands, respectively. The objective is to study the feasibility of miniaturization of the antennas used for microcellular and personal communications. The resonant frequencies, input impedances, and VSWR have been measured to assess the achieved performance of this type of antenna.

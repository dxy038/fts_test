The main objective of this study is to investigate the potential of cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua ISC67‎ in the biodegradation of crude oil and evaluation of oil effect on physiological responses. In this experimental study, the cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua ‎ ISC67 was obtained from the algal ‎culture collection. The growth rate of cyanobacteria in 1% treatment and control sample of crude oil measured at ‎‎750 nm and chlorophyll content in 0.5, 1, 2, and 4% treatments of crude oil measured at h nm ‎‎665nm wavelength using a spectrophotometer. For measuring of dry weight, firstly‎ using weighed ‎filter paper cyanobacteria were isolated from the culture medium and their weights were measured ‎after drying. ‎The rate of biodegradation of crude oil analyzed by gas chromatography. The results showed that the growth of this ‎cyanobacterium in the presence  of crude oil is almost same as of control sample.‎ So that these growth rates are nearly equal and sometimes lower than the control sample. Also, with increasing concentrations of crude oil, dry weight of this cyanobacterium in 0.5% and 2% treatments increased compared to the control sample and it chlorophyll rate in the various treatments of crude is reduced The average of petroleum hydrocarbon biodegradation in 14 days of treatment compared to the control sample was at a rate of 42.32 % and and 28 days was 54.21% respectively. In this study it was found that cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua ISC67‎ has great potential in biodegradation of crude oil. Therefore, these results indicate the potential of this cyanobacterium for its use as an indicator to eliminate pollution in contaminated areas.

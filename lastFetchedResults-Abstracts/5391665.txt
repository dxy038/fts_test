Fluxgate sensors are one of the most versatile magnetic field sensors, which are extensively used for various defense and industrial applications, fields ranging from 10<sup>-8</sup> T to 10<sup>8</sup> T cover a wide range of critical applications, applying from space navigation to medical applications. For advanced applications, fluxgate sensor should offer high magnetic field sensitivity as well as directionality. There has been a large demand for the integrated fluxgate sensors containing sensor and the supporting circuit on the same silicon chip. Since integrated circuits have driving current and weight limitation, the objective of this research is studying how to simulation and modeling ring-shaped core sensor smaller in size by geometrical change in order to reduce driving current while the high sensitivity of it doesnÂ´t change.

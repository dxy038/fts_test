The objective of this article is to develop boundary element techniques for static analysis
of cylindrical shell problems. The boundary integral equations are formulated by using the Maxwell-
Betti reciprocal theorem. On the basis of the singular solutions for shallow cylindrical shells in
complex variables proposed by Sanders and Simmonds, the displacements and tractions of the shell
under various concentrated loadings are derived as the kernels in the boundary integrals near the
singular points.@ 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

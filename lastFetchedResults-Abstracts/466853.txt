OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess the impact of glucocorticoid administration on the rate of regional anesthesia in women with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: Maternal records of pregnancies with HELLP syndrome managed between April 1994 and December 1999 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were identified with antepartum HELLP syndrome and 46 (66%) received glucocorticoids. The presence of thrombocytopenia at admission and the interval from presentation to delivery was evaluated to assess the impact of glucocorticoid use. In the 37 women who had platelet counts of <90,000/mm3, 0 in the untreated group (0 of 11) versus 42% in the steroid group (11 of 26) received regional anesthetic, P = .015. Furthermore, the rate of regional anesthesia increased from 0 in the untreated group delivered within 24 hours (n = 10) to 57% (8 of 14) in the glucocorticoid group, in which women attained a 24-hour latency from presentation to delivery, P = .006. The need for general anesthesia also decreased significantly in treated women who attained a 24-hour latency compared to untreated women who did not, 100% (n = 7) versus 22% (n = 9), P = .003. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of glucocorticoids increases the use of regional anesthesia in women with antepartum HELLP syndrome who have thrombocytopenia, particularly in those who achieve a latency of 24 hours before delivery.

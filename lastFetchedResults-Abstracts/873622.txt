We consider a multiobjective fractional programming problem MFP.involving
vector-valued objective n-set functions in which their numerators are different
from each other, but their denominators are the same. By using the concept of
proper efficiency, we establish optimality conditions and duality relations for our
problem MFP.under convexity assumptions on objective and constrained functions

This paper presents the preliminary results of a study of a composite-tube-reinforced concrete column. In such a column, the plain concrete was cast inside the prefabricated composite tube with no steel reinforcement. Two circular conventional reinforced concrete columns, as reference specimens, and three glass-fiber composite tube columns have been tested under quasi-static loading. The three-dimensional strain and horizontal displacement were measured with rosette strain gauges and LVDTs, respectively, while the micro-crack and failure processes were monitored by means of acoustic emission (AE). The objective of this test is to assess the mechanical behaviour (strength, ductility) of concrete columns reinforced with the glass-fiber composite tube. The composite-tube-reinforced concrete column shows greatly enhanced seismic resistance as compared to the conventional reinforced column. Hence, there is great future potential for the use of such structures in seismic regions.

Objective Childhood adversities have been
associated with adulthood depressiveness, but the
contribution of adult risk factors is seldom described.
We examined whether adult risk factors lie on the
pathway from childhood adversity to adult depressiveness
(pathway hypothesis) or whether the association
depends on life events (vulnerability hypothesis).
Method Among 21,101 randomly sampled workingaged
respondents [the Health and Social Support in
Finland (HeSSup) Study], the hypotheses were tested
with logistic regression analysis models studying the
associations between Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI)-assessed depressiveness and self-reported childhood
adversities alone and in combination with recent
adverse events. Results Childhood adversities were
consistently associated with depressiveness (women,
age-adjusted odds ratio 3.1, 95% confidence intervals
2.6–3.7; men, 2.6, 2.1–3.3), although the risks were decreased
by more than 30% after adjustments for adult
risk factors such as living alone, education, alcohol
consumption, social support and negative affectivity.
Childhood adversities combined with recent life events
were associated with depressiveness in an additive
manner.Women with childhood adversities and recent
person-independent events especially had increased
vulnerability for depressiveness. Conclusions The childhood
adversity–depressiveness associations were partly
mediated by adult risk factors, supporting a pathway
from childhood adversities to depressiveness through
adult risk factors. Increased vulnerability for depressiveness
was found among respondents with childhood
adversities in combination with recent death/
illness events. The findings emphasize the importance
of early risk factors when identifying persons
at risk of depression

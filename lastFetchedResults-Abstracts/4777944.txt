Managing of circuit parasitics is becoming increasingly more important since they have a direct bearing on conducted EMI. One of the challenges facing power electronics of the future is to control and use these parasitics to the benefit of the circuit operation. The distributed nature of the parasitics makes it difficult to analyze and pushes the capacity of circuit simulators to their limits. A new approach for the analysis of component parasitics is proposed which involves a step wise modelling of a physical structure. The objective is to model at different levels of complexity by introducing ideal conductive, dielectric and magnetic material into the physical model. Examples are discussed and some experimental results are presented

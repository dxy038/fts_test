An common difficulty in structured P2P networks is caused by the dynamic membership of nodes (churn). This results in constant reorganization of overlay topology. The objective of this paper is to handle churn in P2P networks by a flexible cluster-based protocol. In our protocol, a cluster of nodes work together to achieve efficient greedy routing and the size of each cluster varies between an upper bound and a lower bound. We show our protocol achieves a desirable level of stability to absorb the impact of membership change, and improves the rate at which nodes join and leave the overlay network.

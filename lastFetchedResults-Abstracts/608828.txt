Resurrection is examined from a variety of perspectives such as its possibility, as well as its necessity and manner, and is proved through a variety of methods (rational, narrative, and Quranic). Allameh Tabataba’i has explored the issue of resurrection in his works from different perspectives using different methods. In his Commentary, he referred to several verses of the Quran to investigate the possibility of resurrection. In all, resurrection is proved through three types of Quranic verses, each of which provide one type of argument. The first argument is the power of God. The unending and unlimited power of God and His power in creation of man and the world are indicative of the realization of the Hereafter. The second argument is revival of the earth in the spring which is a sign of the revival of humans in the Hereafter, as man’s resurrection on the Day of Doom is based on the same principles as revival of the plants. The third argument refers to the objective instances of resurrection. The Quran offers a series of instances referring to the revival of the dead so objectively that all are accurate examples of the life after death.

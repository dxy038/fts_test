Tools and methods currently in use for requirements capture and design are not integrated and are inadequate to support complex, product-oriented system engineering. A trade study was conducted to analyze model-based technology solutions. The most favorably rated tools were piloted to evaluate alternatives and improve existing practices between multiple disciplines. The objective was to use a model-based design environment to gather requirements and develop a model. The result was a process that linked and synchronized the work environment and improved traditional design approaches. Issues addressed include: requirements capture, early validation, requirements allocation and system design, traceability, requirements management, and configuration management. Model-based engineering is a means to provide significant reductions to cycle time for the life of a project. This paper will summarize what was accomplished and the best practices found for this particular application

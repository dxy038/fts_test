HF packet radio equipment was purchased for the Southern European Task Force Headquarters in Vicenza, Italy. The objective is to demonstrate the capability of HF packet radio to function as a base command, control, and administrative communication system. The HF packet radio system provides a voice and data capability, using commercial-grade, state-of-the-art HF communication transceivers with packet controllers. The authors address the need for propagation prediction algorithms to be integrated into each member siteÂ´s computer. PC versions of IONCAP (Ionospheric Communications Analysis and Prediction Program) are available for inclusion into the software that resides in the packet computer. There are a number of alternative prediction systems that are under consideration

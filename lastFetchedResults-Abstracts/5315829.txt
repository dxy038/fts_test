An LSI module placement algorithm which uses neural networks is presented. A formula which determines the weighting factors of the constraint and objective function in the energy so that they converge to a vertex, a point on the edge, or an interior point of the hypercube is derived. In a comparison with simulated annealing and min-cut methods, the proposed method was as good as the min-cut method but not as good as the simulated annealing method

The basic objective of congestion control is to best exploit the available network resources while preventing sustained overloads of network nodes and links. Appropriate congestion control mechanisms are essential to maintain the efficient operation of a network. Ensuring congestion control within vehicular ad hoc networks address special challenges, due to the characteristic and specificities of such environment (High dynamic and mobility of nodes, high rate of topology changes, high variability in nodes density and neighborhood, broadcast/geocast communication nature ...). In this context, we present in this paper a congestion control approach, based on the concept of dynamic priorities-based scheduling, to ensure a reliable and safe communications architecture within VANET. Messages priorities are dynamically evaluated according to their types, the network context and the neighborhood.

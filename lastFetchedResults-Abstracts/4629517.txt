The core of the abstraction-refinement verification is the analysis of the counterexample and refinement of the abstract model, which are the most expensive parts of the verification procedure. In this paper, we present a method that aims at reducing the complexity as much as possible. Our method combines the qualitative analysis with the reachability analysis. Qualitative analysis checks the feasibility of pair-wise transitions without the explicit numerical reachability computation. While reachability analysis employs bidirectional analysis strategy to minimize the region to be refined. Experiment shows that the integration of these strategies and techniques make the verification more efficient.

This paper deals with the control of a hybrid source combining a proton exchange membrane fuel cell and supercapacitors. To achieve this objective, an interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control in a sampled-data context is implemented. This paper first details with this new controller and shows that it ensures the stabilization of the hybrid system at its desired equilibrium point under large range of sampling periods. These considerations are followed by a detailed discussion on experimental results achieved on a 1.2-kW test bench.

New thresholding segmentation and contour tracing method for the surface image of Activated Carbon Fiber (ACF) are presented in this paper. ACF fibrous material image was obtained by Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM). Some traditional thresholding and contour tracing methods are not suitable for SEM images that have large noise and conglutination. In our algorithm, the whole pre-processed image is divided into sub-images according to the connectivity. Then the sub-image is divided into two classes by the distribution of gray-level. We also introduce circle fitting method in contour tracing. At last, a synthesis segmentation approach consists of region OTSU thresholding, fixed thresholding and contour tracing is expressed. Experimental results indicate that the algorithm is effective for SEM image objective extraction.

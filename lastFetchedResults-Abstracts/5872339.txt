The force that drives towards small satellites is mainly cost and fast realization compared to large satellites. The low-cost space system is built by maximizing the use of existing component and off the shelf technologies/standards and thus minimizing the development effort. Small satellites missions are highly demanded for the research, military, agricultural and scientific missions. In small satellite bus standard interfaces like Mil-1553 bus, CAN bus, RS232 bus, LVDS serial link, LVDS-Serializer-Deserializer link are preferred. CCSDS protocol/format are preferred for Data format/data link layer implementation. Standard CCSDS protocol/format will help satellite ground station support across the globe. Onboard systems can be standardized thus enabling a suitable platform for production. Further on-board development by third party is possible because of standardization. This enables to make low cost space systems. This paper address the configuration and design of an CCSDS complied onboard data handling system for small satellites. The paper address issues of minimizing mass, size and power which are the prime objective of a small satellites. The paper also addresses the test philosophy adopted for small satellite missions. A mini satellite bus configuration is also discussed here.

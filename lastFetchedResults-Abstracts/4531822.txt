The objective is to create a fully autonomous mobile robot that is able to perform obstacle detection and avoidance. The system reads data from an image processing module and performing specific triangulation computation to calculate the distance to an obstacle. The system then uses fuzzy logic to determine the next movement of the vehicle. A localization of the vehicle is also implemented, determined through world and object coordinates. Finally, the robot was able to reach the coordinate goal successfully.

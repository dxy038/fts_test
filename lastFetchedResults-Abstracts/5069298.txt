Current novel view creation approaches for scene navigation within FVV applications are both purely image-based, implying large information redundancy and dense sampling of the scene; or involve reconstructing complex 3-D models of the scene. In this paper we present a new multiple image view synthesis algorithm for novel view creation that requires only implicit scene geometry information. The multi-view synthesis approach can be used in any multiple camera environments and is scalable, as virtual views can be created given 1 to N of the available video inputs, providing a means to gracefully handle scenarios where camera inputs decrease or increase over time. The algorithm identifies a- nd selects only the best quality surface areas from available reference images, thereby reducing perceptual errors in virtual view reconstruction. Experimental results are provided and verified using both objective (PSNR) and subjective comparisons and also the improvements over the traditional multiple image view synthesis approach of view-oriented weighting are presented.

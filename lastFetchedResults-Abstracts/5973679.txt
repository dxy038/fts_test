The paper describes the design and implementation of a security architecture for a HLA/RTI prototype developed at ONERA/CERT. The major security objective is to protect the intellectual property of firms participating in a distributed interactive simulation. We describe the techniques used to implement the security services: controlled subscription lists and secure associations. We report the impact of these new services on the real-time behavior of our distributed interactive simulation environment

Objective The negative association between religiosity
(religious beliefs and church attendance) and the likelihood
of substance use disorders is well established, but the
mechanism(s) remain poorly understood. We investigated
whether this association was mediated by social support or
mental health status.
Method We utilized cross-sectional data from the 2002
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (n = 36,370).
We first used logistic regression to regress any alcohol use
in the past year on sociodemographic and religiosity
variables. Then, among individuals who drank in the past
year, we regressed past year alcohol abuse/dependence on
sociodemographic and religiosity variables. To investigate
whether social support mediated the association between
religiosity and alcohol use and alcohol abuse/dependence
we repeated the above models, adding the social support
variables. To the extent that these added predictors
modified the magnitude of the effect of the religiosity
variables, we interpreted social support as a possible
mediator. We also formally tested for mediation using
path analysis. We investigated the possible mediating role
of mental health status analogously. Parallel sets of
analyses were conducted for any drug use, and drug abuse/
dependence among those using any drugs as the dependent
variables.
Results The addition of social support and mental health
status variables to logistic regression models had little
effect on the magnitude of the religiosity coefficients in any
of the models. While some of the tests of mediation were
significant in the path analyses, the results were not always
in the expected direction, and the magnitude of the effects
was small.
Conclusions The association between religiosity and
decreased likelihood of a substance use disorder does not
appear to be substantively mediated by either social support
or mental health status

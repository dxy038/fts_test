The design of complex embedded systems involves the simultaneous optimization of several often-competing objectives. Instead of a single optimal design, there is a set of alternative trade-offs. In this paper we have proposed a multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithms called non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA), which suit to the requirements of designing a complex heterogeneous embedded system. Finally, we have discussed few open questions and future research direction for evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in heterogeneous embedded system design.

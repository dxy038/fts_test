Many image processing algorithms have been developed in the last decades. Evaluation of these algorithms is a primordial task in order to illustrate for example the benefit of a new algorithm. Different evaluation methodologies can be used in order to reach this goal. The main objective of this paper is to make a survey of these methodologies and to discuss their advantages and drawbacks. We illustrate our matter with different examples from the literature

Background
The evaluation of patient outcomes as a measure of quality control of patient care is being adopted in Korean hospitals. Since nursing care contributes to the bulk of patient care, it is important to identify nursing-sensitive patient outcomes, hereafter referred to as ‘nursing outcomes’, that will be useful in the evaluation of nursing care.
Objective
This study was conducted to identify nursing outcomes included within the Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) that are most sensitive for the evaluation of nursing care in Korean hospitals as well as being observable and measurable.
Design
Delphi technique modified for this study was used to gain a consensus from Korean nursing experts.
Settings
Participants were recruited from general hospitals in Korea.
Participants
Two hundred and thirty nurses working for Quality Improvement (QI) and Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) programmes were chosen as the nurse experts for this study.
Methods
Three rounds of data collection from all participants was undertaken. In the first data collection, the sensitivity of 260 NOC nursing outcomes (Johnson, et al., 2000. Iowa Outcomes Projects: Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC). C.V. Mosby, St. Louis) was examined, and more highly nursing sensitive ones were selected. In the second and third data collection phases, nursing outcomes which are most useful for the evaluation of nursing care were selected.
Results
Vital Signs Status, Knowledge: Infection Control, Pain Control, Safety Behavior: Fall Prevention, and Infection Status were identified as the five most useful nursing outcomes for the evaluation of nursing care in hospitals.
Conclusions
The nursing outcomes identified highly useful for the evaluation of nursing care in this study can be used effectively for the quality management of nursing care in Korea.

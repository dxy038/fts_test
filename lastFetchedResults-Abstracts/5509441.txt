Measurements of the optical near-field transmission of square and hexagonal nanohole arrays are performed, by making a magnified image of the backside of the hole array with a normal microscope objective. In these measurements it can be observed the surface plasmon (SP) propagation directly by strongly focussing the illumination spot on the array down to a size smaller than the SP propagation length.

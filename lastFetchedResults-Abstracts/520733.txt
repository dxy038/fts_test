Leachate, with regard to its high concentration of organic contaminants, is one of the environmental risks of landfills. Hence, the high-rate anaerobic treatment technology, such as utilization of UASB reactor, is the most widely and successfully used system for treating special type of high-contaminated wastewater. In this method, methane production rate depends on the efficiency of the anaerobic system. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effective parameters on biogas production and determine the fraction of methane in the biogas based on organic loading rate (OLR) and efficiency of organic materials removal. On the other hand, Biogas production rate depends on several parameters that the most important ones have been measured in this study. On this basis, an UASB pilot has been provided and several effective parameters on biogas generation have been measured. The results show that the COD removal efficiency and biogas generation decrease by increasing the influent COD at the

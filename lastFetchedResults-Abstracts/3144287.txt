EBG antennas have received intensive attention and large investigations during the last decade. Their main drawbacks such as narrow bandwidth, high side lobes, lack of knowledge on input impedance are now quite well studied and partly remedied. Therefore, real industrial applications for these antennas can now be envisaged. In addition to the engineering applications, the EBG antennas have contributed to unify the theoretical studies of several disconnected domains, such as leaky-wave, Fabry-Perot (FP) or stratified medium. The objective of this paper is to present the state of the art on the main properties and applications of the EBG/FP antennas in one hand, and to the bridge theoretical approaches that can be employed for leaky and EBG antennas in the other hand.

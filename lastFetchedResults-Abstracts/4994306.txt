In 1999, a demonstration project on sustainable product development was initiated in Belgium, financed by the LIFE program of the European Commission. The general objective of this project is to promote and implement ecodesign amongst Belgian industry. The project is subdivided into 3 phases: a 1st phase in which the potential for implementing ecodesign of the participating companies is assessed, a 2nd phase in which the companies gain insight into the environmental aspects of one of their products and a 3rd phase in which an alternative product concept can be developed. The paper describes the course of the project, the results and findings

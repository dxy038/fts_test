This paper deals with multiobjective optimization of symmetrically angle-ply square laminated plates subjected to biaxial compressive and uniform thermal loads. The design objective is the maximization of the buckling load for weighted sum of the biaxial compressive and thermal loads. The design variable is the fiber orientations in the layers. The performance index is formulated as the weighted sum of individual objectives in order to obtain optimal solutions of the design problem. The first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) is used in the mathematical formulation of buckling analysis of laminated plates. The modified feasible direction (MFD) method is used for optimization routine. For this purpose, a program based on FORTRAN is used. Finally, the effect of different weighting factors, number of layers, aspect ratios, load ratios and boundary conditions on the optimal design is investigated.

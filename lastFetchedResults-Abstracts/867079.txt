In this paper, we examine the classification performance of fuzzy if-then rules selected by a GA-based multi-objective rule selection method. This rule selection method can be applied to high-dimensional pattern classification problems with many continuous attributes by restricting the number of antecedent conditions of each candidate fuzzy if-then rule. As candidate rules, we only use fuzzy if-then rules with a small number of antecedent conditions. Thus it is easy for human users to understand each rule selected by our method. Our rule selection method has two objectives: to minimize the number of selected fuzzy if-then rules and to maximize the number of correctly classified patterns. In our multi-objective fuzzy rule selection problem, there exist several solutions (i.e., several rule sets) called “non-dominated solutions” because two conflicting objectives are considered. In this paper, we examine the performance of our GA-based rule selection method by computer simulations on a real-world pattern classification problem with many continuous attributes. First we examine the classification performance of our method for training patterns by computer simulations. Next we examine the generalization ability for test patterns. We show that a fuzzy rule-based classification system with an appropriate number of rules has high generalization ability.

In this paper we consider the problem of user assignment and power allocation in a small cell environment which is one of the most important problems in present wireless cellular network research. We consider a two-tier cellular network where randomly dispersed overlay femtocell base stations (FBSs) coexist with a macrocell. Our objective is to maximize the total number of users served by the FBSs while satisfying their signal to noise and interference (SINR) requirements. This problem is known to be NP-Hard and hence there is no known optimal solution to solve it in polynomial time. First we formulate the problem of maximization of allocated users under SINR constraints with constant transmit power as an integer programming problem. We provide two heuristic polynomial time algorithms. Then we propose a third algorithm for joint power and user allocation. We evaluate the complexity of the proposed algorithms and furthermore compare the results against the brute force optimal solution and a basic random user assignment through simulations. The results demonstrate the performance and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. We see in the simulation that the best proposed heuristic for maximizing the number of assigned users is only 3% less than the optimal while reducing the power consumption below that of the optimal user assignment algorithm.

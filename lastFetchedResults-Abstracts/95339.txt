The prime objective of the paper is to overcome the conventional restriction to the field of rational functions as far as the algebraic design of control systems is concerned. By adopting the affine parameterization approach from algebraic control synthesis for the controllers given as the socalled RQ-meromorphic functions an algebraic solution to time-delay system control design is opened where neither an introduction of 2D transfer functions nor the assumption of commensurate delays is needed. The proposed design results in controllers combining both the integrators and delayers due to this property referred to as anisochronic.

Objective: This study was conducted to investigate the prevallance of gastrointestinal obstruction, mortality rate and some associated factors in hospitalized neonates.
Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective descriptive one on 103 cases of hospitalized newborns with gastrointestinal obstruction at 17 Sharivar hospital in Rasht from 2009 to 2013. The data of these cases were collected which assessed, gestational age, gender, birth weight, morbidity and mortality rate.  Data were analyzed by SPSS (V. 20) software. 
Results: In this study, 103 hospitalized newborns with gastrointestinal obstruction were studied. Most of them were term, male, with normal birth weight and Apgar score at birth more than seven. Upper and lower gastrointestinal obstructions of these newborns were 39.8% and 60.2%, respectively. In addition, morbidity and mortality was observed in %0.9 and %5.8 of newborns, respectively.There was a statistically significant correlation between gastrointestinal obstraction and amniotic fluid volume as well as diagnosis time of obstraction (P < 0.0001).

Switch-mode DC-to-AC inverters using DC-to-DC converter topology have many advantages over the traditional bridge-type inverter. A bidirectional power circuit combined with a nonlinear robust control is proposed to form a high performance inverter. The output voltage of the inverter can be stabilized regardless of large changes in input voltage and output current. The distortion near the zero crossing point can be minimized. The load of the inverter can be resistive, inductive, or capacitive. Simulation results and experimental verification are provided

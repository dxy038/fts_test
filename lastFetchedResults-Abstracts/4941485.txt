The paper proposed a new analysis method in a design approach to achieve robust optimization for hard disk drive spindle motors. The objective is to minimize the cogging torque whilst reducing its variance for torque performance improvement. The response results and analytical data were normalized and grey relational coefficients were calculated. The grey relational grades indicated the effects of design factors on performance. The optimum torque performance was then obtained, and the comparison with Taguchi method was given.

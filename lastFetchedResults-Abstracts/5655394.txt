RFID technology automates several types of objects identification processes and improves lots of business transactions. Its ability to communicate through wireless networks gives huge advantages in comparison to optical barcode and manual identification systems. Unfortunately, the ability of RFID system to communicate through wireless communication opens up possibilities of being tracked by unauthorized reader or adversary and potentially violates user privacy. A truly strong anonymizer would be good for solving this issue because it can provide tags anonymity so that they cannot be traced by adversary. Past solutions on RFID with anonymizers have lots of issues regarding system integrity and availability. We propose a trust based solution based on trusted computing to provide system integrity to the anonymizer. This paper provides a technical framework for a trusted anonymizer for use in RFID Systems. Our main objective is to solve the major trust issue inherent in almost all previous anonymizer-based RFID protocols.

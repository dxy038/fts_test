A computational model is a computer program, which attempts to simulate an abstract model of a particular system. Computational models use enormous calculations and often require supercomputer speed. As personal computers are becoming more and more powerful, more laboratory experiments can be converted into computer models that can be interactively examined by scientists and students without the risk and cost of the actual experiments. The future of programming is concurrent programming. The threaded programming model provides application programmers with a useful abstraction of concurrent execution of multiple tasks. The objective of this release is to address the design of architecture for scientific application, which may execute as multiple threads execution, as well as implementations of the related shared data structures.

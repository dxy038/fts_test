OBJECTIVE: Abortion is defined as the termination of pregnancy before 20th week on the basis of first day of the last normal mense. Therapeutic abortion may be practiced as spontaneous or induced. Common treatment of abortion is dilatation and curettage (D & C). Expected treatment that clearly lowers the need for surgery is another approach.
METHODS: This descriptive and analytical study was done on patients referred to Shahid Yahyanejad hospital in Babol during 1999-2000. This study was done on 51 patients who had spontaneous abortion in the first trimester, spotting and endometrial line with 12mm and less in abdominal sonography. Obtained data was analyzed by x2 and paired t- tests.
FINDINGS: In this study, the mean age of partients was 25.5 ± 5.2 years and mean gestational age was 7.7 ± 1.5 weeks without any significant relationship (p<0.05). Only one (2%) case of the whole 50 required curettage and that was due to severe bleeding (p<0,05). No complication developed and only one patient presented back with severe hemorrhage after two weeks for which we performed evacutional curettage.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that abdominal sonography can be done on patients with spontaneous abortion and spotting. And endo. Line of 12mm or less is a good indication for expected treatment in order not to perform curettage and so avoiding its complications such as general anesthesia, surgery and hospital expenses.

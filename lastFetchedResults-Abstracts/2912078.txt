Variable dimension algorithms form a class of recent homotopy methods for solving sets of nonlinear equations. It is the objective of this paper to formulate a network equivalent, to discuss the applicability of these methods to the solution of nonlinear resistive circuits and to indicate their advantages as compared with other homotopy methods which are better known in circuit theory, such as KatzenelsonÂ´s algorithm

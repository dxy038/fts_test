Tuberculosis continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality all over the world. Various 7-substituted ciprofloxacin derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antimycobacterial activity in vitro and in vivo against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and for inhibition of the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase from Mycobacterium smegmatis. Preliminary results indicated that most of the compounds demonstrated better in vitro antimycobacterial activity against M. tuberculosis than ciprofloxacin. Compound 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-[[N4-[1′-(5-methylisatinyl-β-semicarbazo)]methyl]N1-piperazinyl]-3-quinoline carboxylic acid (3h) decreased the bacterial load in spleen tissue with 0.76-log10 protections and was considered to be moderately active in reducing bacterial count in spleen. The results demonstrated the potential and importance of developing new quinolone derivatives against mycobacterial infections.

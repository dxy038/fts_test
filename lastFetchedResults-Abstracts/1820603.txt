Objective
rpose of this study was to determine mean maximum bite force in adults with normal occlusion and to evaluate effect of face form on it.

 male and 20 female students with normal dentitions and between the ages of 19 and 27 participated in the study. A strain-gauge force transducer was developed to measure bite force and was calibrated with known loads. Three measurements were performed on each side of the dentition in the first molar region and mean values used for analysis. Face form was defined as square, tapering, square-tapering or oval and determined using digital photographs. Effect of gender and face form on bite force was statistically analysed using two-way ANOVA and Duncan tests.
s
aximum bite force and standard deviation (S.D.) in the sample population was 64.4 (24.0) kilograms (kg). In men, the mean was 73.6 (23.8) which was statistically higher than in women (53.0 (19.6) kg) (P &lt; 0.05). Mean maximum bite force in subjects with square face form was 93.7 kg, which was significantly higher than in subjects with other facial forms (P &lt; 0.05).
sion
sults showed higher bite force in men and those with square face form. Square face form may contribute to higher bite force values by maintaining a higher mechanical advantage for muscles of mastication.

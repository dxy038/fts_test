Nowadays, the use of Wearable User Interfaces has been extensively growing in medical monitoring applications. However, production and manufacture of prototypes without automation tools may lead to non viable results since it is often common to find an optimization problem where several variables are in conflict with each other. Thus, it is necessary to design a strategy for balancing the variables and constraints, systematizing the design in order to reduce the risks that are present when it is exclusively guided by the intuition of the developer. This paper proposes a framework for designing wearable ECG monitoring systems using multi-objective optimization. The main contributions of this work are the model to automate the design process, including a mathematical expression relating the principal variables that make up the criteria of functionality and wearability. We also introduce a novel yardstick for deciding the location of electrodes, based on reducing interference from ECG by maximizing the electrode-skin contact.

This paper presents a comparative study for multi-objective economic power dispatch considering emission using a new variant swarm optimization method, in the first stage the (EED) problem is solved without losses using a novel parameter automation strategy in which time varying acceleration coefficients (TVAC) are employed to efficiently control the local and global search, such a near global solution is achieved. When the optimal power generation vector has found the power flow based Newton-Raphson algorithm has been called to calculate the power transmission losses so the new optimal cost. The performance of this method has been compared and found to be superior compared to the results of classical (PSO) method in term of solution quality and convergence characteristic.

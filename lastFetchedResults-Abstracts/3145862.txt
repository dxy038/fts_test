It is shown that the objective of optimally specifying redundant actuators under constraints is commonly referred to as a control allocation problem. The problem is often posed as quadratic program (QP) problem, moreover considering the complex constraints case in engineering, some other mathematic programs maybe used, which are not QP. The second order cone program (SOCP), which has the more generality implementation, is one of them. In this paper, two innovative modes of mathematic program of control allocation problem are proposed based on the SOCP method, which are further generlized to account for the control allocation problem. A simulation is given to show that the above algorithms are fit for control allocation problem, the timing requirements are in the same range as other numerical algorithms proposed for mathematic program.

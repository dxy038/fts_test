The main objective of this research is an investigation and preparing of wind erosion intensity map. IRIFR model used in this study which has been developed by Iranian researchers for Iranâ€™s climatic conditions. At first, the working unit map was prepared Then nine effective factors in wind erosion such as Geological Formation, Landform and Topography, Wind and Climatic Conditions, Soil Surface, Plant Cover, Wind Erosion, Soil Moisture, Deposits of Wind and Management Process are determined for each working unit. Each factor scored according to IRIFR model and for each one a raster GIS layer was created. According to the results, active sand dunes and Saline Lands showed the highest value with the rate of annual sedimentation more than 3879.4 ton/km2 ,while medium sandy plain with low density showed the least value with an annual rate of sedimentation of 708.73 ton/km2. Also in whole area, 35.74 percent equivalent 46491.36 hectares are classified in high class and 63.73 percent equivalent 82902.43 hectares are classified in medium class of wind erosion.

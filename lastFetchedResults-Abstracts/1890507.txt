Today water supply issue in large cities seems to be a big
problem. This becomes more important with population
growth and urbanization extension. To cope with this problem
lots of irrigation and drainage projects have been implemented
and operated that subsequently many socio- economic and
cultural effects have been brought to the areas . The objective of
the present study is to survey the socio - economic and environmental
effects of Taleghan dam to compare the two periods before and
after the dam construction. The needed data have been gathered
by use of a questionnaire and by interviewing 400 samples in the
irrigation and drainage network’s region of Taleghan Dam, and
encoded questions and outcome data have been analyzed in spss
and lisrel software. The results showed an economic development
in the region, but some factors like, lack of trust, lack of economic
advantages and deficiency of facilities, decrease villagers’
willingness to invest. 63.3% of region’s environmental pollution
has been increased mainly by the tourists. Not only is there no increase
in Water sources but also they have been decreased. 98%
of individuals declared that the people were not questioned in
construction projects. About the coefficient of dam’s effect on region’s
socio- economic and environmental development, the
villagers have declared that the dam construction had no positive
effect on region’s development.

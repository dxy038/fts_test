Schedule-workspace interference is generated when workspaces that share parallel schedules and are physically adjacent to one another exist simultaneously. When workspace interference is generated, securing work performance safety is difficult and constructability can deteriorate due to increased collision risk between resources. The objective of this study is to realize an active simulation system based on building information modeling (BIM) after constructing a genetic algorithm (GA) process for an alternative schedule that minimizes the simultaneous interference level of the schedule-workspace. To accomplish this task, the impact factor of workspace interference, which simultaneously considers schedule overlap and adjacency, was analyzed. From the impact factor, an optimized algorithm based on a location-constraint GA that can minimize workspace interference is suggested. The GA visually simulates the optimization level of the execution schedule compared to the initial plan through interlock with four-dimensional (4D) computer-aided design (CAD). A 4D CAD system that can analyze workspace interference by a GA was developed, and for the developed algorithm and system, a case verification was attempted for a railroad construction project. The results show how a simple visualization-oriented BIM system can be extended to an active schedule management system equipped with decision-making functions of workspace analysis.

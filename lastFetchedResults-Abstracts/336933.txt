The initial interaction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis  with phagocytes through Toll-like receptors can affect induction of the adaptive response by inflammatory cytokine production, as well as begin the process of bacterial containment by induction of antimycobacterial functions. Advances in T cell research in tuberculosis include identification of antigens recognized by CD8+ T cells in infected hosts, elucidation of antimycobacterial mechanisms of T cells and the discovery of CD8+ T cells that recognize antigens presented by a variety of non-classical molecules.

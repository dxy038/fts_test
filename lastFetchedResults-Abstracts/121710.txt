Objective: To determine the potential role of stray dog and red fox in Echinococcosis/Hydatidosis life cycle in Lorestan province, Western Iran. Meanwhile the prevalence of hydatid cysts among sheep, goats and cattle as well as fertility rates of different types and forms of cysts isolated from infected animals and the viability of protoscolices were also determined.
Design: Observational cross sectional study.
Animals: 42 stray dogs (Mixed breed), 30 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), 6879 sheep, 3752 goats and 1968 cattle in Lorestan province inWestern Iran during three years (1997-2000).
Procedure: Stray dogs and red foxes collected from different parts of Lorestan. The animals were collected either died freshly across the road or shot in the study area. Following autopsy of the animal, the small intestine removed, slit open and the epithelium of the intestine scraped into a jar. To collect the worm from the intestine, the epithelial scrapings and the intestinal contents were passed through wire sieves. The contents of the sieves were washed with top water and Echinococcus was collected. Recovered worms were fixed in alcohol and stained with carmine. Meanwhile, sheep, goats and cattle were examined for hydatid cyst infection at three slaugtherhouses. Fertility rate of different types and forms of cysts isolated from infected animals and the viability of protoscolices were also determined using standard methods.
Statistical analysis: Measurement of prevalence of infection, mean and standard deviation as well as student "t" test for comparing of the means.
Results: Results indicated that, 30.29% of the dogs and 6.67% of the red foxes were infected with Echinococcus granulosus. 25.29% of the sheep, 11.08% of the goats and 55.94% of the cattle were also found to be infected with hydatid cyst. In sheep, 52.89% of the cysts were found in lungs, 28.29% in the liver and 18.73% in both liver and lungs. In goats, 61.54% of the cysts were found in lungs, 33.41% in liver and 50.50% in both liver and lungs. In cattle, 52.86% of the cysts were found in lungs, 33.41% in liver and 50.50% in both liver and lungs. The cysts isolated from liver and lungs of the sheep showed higher fertility rate than the cysts of liver and lungs of goats and cattle. In this regard, he fertility rates of cysts isolated from sheep, goats and cattle were 35.47%, 16.88% and 14.70% respectively. The viability rate of protoscolices of the fertile cysts isolated from the slaughtered animals were found mostly higher than 80%.
Conclusion:The infection rate of Echinococcosis / Hydatidosis in animal of Lorestan province especially in stray dogs is very high. Hence, it should be controled by sophisticated methods.

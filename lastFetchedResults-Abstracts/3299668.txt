The Long Term Evolution (LTE) standards are generated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for the Fourth Generation (4G) wireless communication systems. The Fourth Generation (4G) wireless communication standards use new physical layer signaling techniques in their physical layer. Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) are the two major signaling techniques used in LTE. OFDMA is used in the downlink of the Fourth Generation (4G) wireless communication systems for its high spectral efficiency and SC-FDMA is used in the uplink of the Fourth Generation (4G) wireless communication systems for its high power efficiency. The main objective of this paper is to design and implement the reliable and energy efficient architecture for LTE uplink system using FPGA. IFDMA is the most energy efficient subcarrier mapping scheme of SC-FDMA multiple access scheme. In IFDMA, the data symbols subcarrier mapping is not one to one instead each subcarrier carries a part from each data symbol transmitted at that time instant. The reason for the selection of IFDMA subcarrier mapping along with SC-FDMA multiple access scheme for LTE uplink comes mainly from its advantage to provide a low peak to average power ratio (PAPR) for the transmitted waveform. This results in less power consumption in the mobile station during uplink transmission. The reliability of the system is improved using interleaving process by avoiding packet loss. Convolution codes are less complex and are used to provide error free transmission. The enhancement of energy efficiency is done using the convolution coded IFDMA. The chosen energy efficient architecture must be more power efficient and support high data rates, which is the main requirement for the mobile user. The proposed reliable and energy efficient architecture for LTE uplink system is implemented using Xilinx system generator tool.

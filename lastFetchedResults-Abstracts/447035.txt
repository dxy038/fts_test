Purpoe
To develop a quantitative method for analyi of the topographic relationhip between tructural and functional damage in patient with glaucoma.
Method

We tudied 26 patient with primary open-angle glaucoma, focal optic dik damage, and focal viual field lo. The viual field wa evaluated with automated perimetry, and the optic dik topography wa aeed with a confocal canning laer ophthalmocope. Topographic meaurement were calculated in 10-degree ector and compared with a normative databae (n = 52). The topographic relationhip of tructural damage and functional lo wa analyzed.
Reult

Rim area ratio wa defined a the ratio of rim area in each 10-degree ector divided by the total rim area. Thi ratio reulted in the identification of one (46%) or more (54%) cluter of optic dik ector a outide normal limit in all 26 patient (12 and 14 patient, repectively). Twenty-two patient (84%) with uperior hemifield enitivity lo tended to have inferior rim defect, and vice vera. Naal viual field defect cloe to the horizontal midline were matched with damaged rim area cloe to the vertical midline.
Concluion

Thi mapping method allow an objective and quantitative evaluation of the optic dik and viual field in patient with glaucoma and focal damage. Although the topographic relationhip between tructure and function i characterized by coniderable interindividual variability, the identification of certain pattern may be ueful to aid in the evaluation of glaucomatou damage.

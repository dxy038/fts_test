Decision making processes during biological or chemical incidents represent a challenging and demanding issue. This task is
constituted by several complex activities and important decisions. In the case of unintentional accidents in agricultural plants
or within related industries, these decisions have to be made by personnel often not primarily trained for such situations.
Therefore any available support tool, which can increase the probability of successful management of these incidents, should
be employed. The main objective is to minimize the consequences, ensure the quality of products, and protect people and
animals and other crucial assets. From the technological perspective, various approaches or principles have already been applied
and intended for computer-based support of biological or chemical incidents management. Nevertheless, the multi-agent
technologies can be also effectively utilized. As an example, this paper presents a model applicable for the management of
biological or chemical incidents created in the multi-agent NetLogo environment. The main contribution to the scientific field
includes the characterization of specifics related to the discussed type of decision-making process. Moreover, within the paper
the description of the simulation model is provided, parameterization is explained, and areas for further research are outlined.

A TCM pulse detecting system consistent with pulse feeling of &#8220;three regions and nine divisions&#8221; in TCM is introduced in the article, including the design and features of three-region multipath pulse sensor, design of multipath pulse amplifier and design of multipath pulse analytical system. The article also introduces contents directly related with the pulse detecting system, such as associativity among pulse taking pressure at three regions, detection method of long and short pulse, detection method of width of pulse and safety in increasing pressure. It is believed that the three-region multipath pulse detecting system can simulate the pulse feeling method of &#8220;three regions and nine divisions&#8221; in TCM. The system can collect more pulse information and make objective description about width and length of different kinds of pulses, providing effective and reliable test facilities and method for breakthrough in TCM diagnosis and teaching patterns, and modernization and internationalization of TCM.

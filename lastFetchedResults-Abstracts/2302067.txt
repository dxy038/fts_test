Emissions of soil fumigants are regulated to protect air quality in California. Irrigation prior to fumigation can reduce fumigant emissions at relatively low costs; however, the optimum range of soil water content that reduces emissions without reducing efficacy is not clearly defined. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of soil water content [at 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 100% field capacity (FC)] on the emission and distribution of fumigants 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) and chloropicrin (CP) in columns packed with a sandy loam soil. After injecting equal amounts of cis-1,3-D, trans-1,3-D, and CP, fumigant emissions and distribution in soil were monitored for 14 days. Emissions of all three compounds showed similar response to soil water content except that CP emissions were lower than both isomers of 1,3-D. The emission peak flux was highest and occurred earliest in the driest soil while it was reduced and delayed as soil water content increased. After the peak, emission flux decreased rapidly in the driest soil but more slowly in higher water content treatments. Initially, higher soil water content resulted in substantially lower cumulative emissions among the treatments, but as time progressed, the differences in cumulative emissions decreased or even disappeared. These trends were likely due to the effect of the closed-bottom short soil columns which allowed fumigants to only move upward and contribute to emission. Higher fumigant concentrations in the soilâ€“gas phase were observed in high soil water content treatments, due to less emission loss and more fumigant retained in the soil.

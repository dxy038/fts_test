FLEX (FLuorescence EXperiment) is a candidate mission for the European Space Agency (ESA) Earth Explorer program. The main objective of the mission is the measurement the chlorophyll fluorescence signal emitted by vegetation at the red and far-red spectral regions (roughly 630-770 nm). The current FLEX mission design includes different instruments intended to provide the appropriate characterization of those atmospheric and surface parameters necessary for the retrieval and interpretation of the fluorescence signal. The complete processing chain for the derivation of fluorescence and reflectance products from the radiance data acquired by the different instruments included in the FLEX pay-load is described in this paper. Six processing modules have been implemented: cloud screening, aerosol optical thickness (AOT) retrieval, automatic spectral characterisation, columnar water vapor (CWV) retrieval, fluorescence retrieval and reflectance retrieval. The processing chain has been tested against a scene-based simulated data set which reproduces FLEX instruments and realistic atmospheric conditions.

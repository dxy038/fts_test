Cosmetic assessment of conservative breast cancer treatment plays a major role in the study of breast cancer techniques. Objective assessment methods are being preferred to overcome the drawbacks of subjective evaluation. In this paper a methodology for the objective assessment of conservative breast cancer treatment is proposed. The quantitative measures used in this research provide an objective way to calculate the overall cosmetic result. We report experiments using support vector machines to derive an optimal assessment rule. The results seem to indicate that it is possible to construct an algorithm for a complete objective classification of the aesthetic result of breast conservative treatment.

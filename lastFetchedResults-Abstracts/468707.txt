Objective
The first objective of this study was to evaluate lifestyle changes that occur during residency. The second objective was to determine whether residents in obstetrics and gynecology perceive greater changes compared with residents in other programs.
Study design
Residents in selected obstetrics and gynecology, family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, and surgery fields received surveys. Characteristics addressed before and after residency included eating habits, sleep hours, recreational time, exercise, and missed significant events. Unbalanced analysis of variance and unpaired Student t test were used when appropriate.
Results
All specialties noted a significant reduction in low-fat meals consumed, sleep hours, exercise, family interactions, and television viewing (P<.05). Residents noted a significant increase in missed significant events. Residents in obstetrics and gynecology perceived a greater reduction in television viewing compared with residents who were not in obstetrics and gynecology (P<.05).
Conclusion
Residents perceive significant changes in many areas of health and wellness during residency training. Overall, residents in obstetrics and gynecology do not perceive greater lifestyle alterations compared with other training programs.

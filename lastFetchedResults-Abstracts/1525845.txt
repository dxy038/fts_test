A novel analytical method has been developed for the determination of 14 trace chlorophenols in clam tissues by ion chromatography (IC) coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI-MS) in the negative mode. The method comprised a fast ultrasound-assisted extraction using a mixture of methanol/water (4:1 v/v) containing 5% triethylamine (TEA) as extraction solvent, solid-phase extraction with an Oasis HLB cartridge and gradient separation using KOH/acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min on an IonPac AG11 guard column (50 mm × 4.0 mm I.D.) and an IonPac AS11 analytical column (250 mm × 4.0 mm I.D.). The molecular ions m/z [M − H]− 127, 129; 161, 163; 195, 197 and 263, 265, 267 were selected for quantification in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode for monochlorophenols (MCPs), dichlorophenols (DCPs), trichlorophenols (TCPs) and pentachlorophenol (PCP), respectively. The average recoveries of the objective compounds spiked in clam tissues were between 80.2% and 98.2%. Within-day and day-to-day relative standard deviations were less than 12.6% and 13.2%, respectively. The optimum IC-APCI-MS conditions were successfully applied to the analyses of 14 trace chlorophenols in clam tissues.

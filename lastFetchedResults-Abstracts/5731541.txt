One of the most important research goals in media science is a computational model for the human perception of visual quality, that is, how to predict the subjective visual quality experience. This research area has converged to developing new and investigating existing lower-level measurable quantities, physical, visual or computational, which could explain the high level experience. A principal research question, whether the prediction of the visual quality experience based on any lower-level objective measurements is possible at all, has received much less attention. This question is investigated in this study. First, we describe a large psychological experiment where true factors of the human quality experience are pair-wise resolved for dedicatedly selected samples. Second, we describe a ranking measure which reveals the relationship between selected measurable quantities and the human evaluation. Finally, the presented ranking method is used to provide quantitative evidence that visual quality experience can be predicted using lower-level measurable quantities. This result is novel and by simultaneously revealing the underlying lower-level factors it should re-direct the future research towards the true model.

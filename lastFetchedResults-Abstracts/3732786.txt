In states where electromagnetic fields (EMF) is a public concern, it is reasonable and worthwhile to develop an interim EMF policy. For states where EMF has not been an issue, it is likely that a sound EMF policy would go a long way toward forestalling citizen fear and action against power line construction. In a time when individual and property rights issues are on the ascendance, an objective and balanced statewide EMF policy is essential for protecting both individual and larger societal interests. For policy makers, the best outcome to this issue would be for the scientific community to eventually reach a clear consensus and conclude that exposure to power line EMF is not a risk to human health. Even a conclusion that there are real health effects would be something of a relief. At least one might have a clear understanding of the true nature of the problem so that one could focus on solutions. The scientific evidence the author has seen to date, however, leads him to believe that this is not likely to happen any time soon. For the time being, policy makers will need to craft rational interim EMF policies, monitor scientific research, and share this information with the public. Perhaps public concern about EMF will wane. If not, then at some point it will be necessary for policy makers and scientists to work together to develop a regulatory consensus based on the best scientific knowledge available

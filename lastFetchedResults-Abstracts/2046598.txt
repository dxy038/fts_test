and difficulties in emotion regulation in prediction of muscle dysmorphia symptoms. Method: In this research, 240 male body-builders were selected from five gyms in Gorgan
(north of Iran). They were required to answer Muscle Dysmorphia Disorder Inventory
(MDDI), Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS), The Sociocultural Attitudes Toward
Appearance Questionnaire-3 (SATAQ-3), and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale
(DERS). The collected data were analyzed by Pearson correlation and multiple regression. Results: All variables were correlated with muscle dysmorphia symptom (P<0.01). Multiple
regression analysis showed that all three variables, the media, perfectionism, and difficulties in
emotional regulation can significantly predict muscle dysmorphia symptom (P<0.001). Conclusion: Importance and multi-aspect nature of social, cognitive, and emotional variables
in formulation of muscle dysmorphia disorder were emphasized in this research.

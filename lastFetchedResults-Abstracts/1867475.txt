The oyster mushrooms are of the Pleurotus genus and tree parser (primary saprophytic). Wheat straw and sugarcane bagasse as  cultivation substrates with nitrogen-rich supplements (powdered cottonseed 2%, powdered soy 2%  and  urea 0.5%)  were supplemented. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of supplements different amounts and growing media of types on the nutritional value of  Florida oyster mushroom. Factorial experiments in randomized completely design with 16 treatments were performed in triplicate. Enriched substrates compared to control (non-rich media) more protein and dry matter containing were. Supplements concentration increasing increase the amount of nitrogen, protein and dry matter, so much nitrogen, protein and dry matter of the highest supplements concentrations (powdered cottonseed 2% +  powdered + soy 2% urea 0.5%) were obtained, but had no significant effect on ash Florida oyster mushroom. The most nitrogen, protein, ash and dry matter obtained of sugarcane bagasse substrate. In this study, powdered cottonseed 2% +  powdered soy 2% + urea 0.5%  combination and sugar cane bagasse were the best nutritional supplement and growing media.

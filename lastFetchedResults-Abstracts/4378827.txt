In this letter, we propose a depth-assisted frame rate up-conversion (DA-FRUC) scheme which finds applications in 3D video processing. By considering the depth cue in video plus depth representation, we categorize the blocks of the interpolated frame as depth-continuous and depth-discontinuous groups. The motion vector (MV) outliers of the depth continuous blocks are then detected and corrected by layer-constrained MV refinement method. Moreover, a depth-based adaptive interpolation and block segmentation method is proposed to deal with the disocclusion and occlusion at the boundary of the foreground area. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better subjective and objective performance for the interpolated color frames. Additionally, the interpolated depth frames obtained by the proposed method is more accurate, which benefit the video quality in view synthesis.

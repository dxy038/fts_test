This paper presents a model predictive control (MPC) approach for the optimization of the energy produced by a microgrids (MGs) in a network. The objective is to present a control approach for interconnected cooperating MGs, where the main objective is to minimize the power purchased by each MG. Minimizing the energy purchased from other MGs and from the main grid is considered among main objectives to be achieved. In order to reach these objectives, a global central controller is responsible to find the best patterns for state of energy storage system and the power exchanges among MGs, where each MG can be modeled as an inventory system, locally producing energy by wind turbines. The MPC strategy is tested using an interconnected network of three MGs. Results provide a good reference on the economic benefits which can be obtained using MPC.

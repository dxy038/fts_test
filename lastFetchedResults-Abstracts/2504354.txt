Background: The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is one of the
major signaling pathways that transmit intracellular signals initiated by extracellular
stimuli to the nucleus. The stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun NH2-terminal
kinase is a subfamily of MAP kinases implicated in cytokine and stress responses.
Objective: In this study, we have examined total and phosphorylated c-Jun in the mural
and cumulus granulosa cells, and investigated also whether c-Jun can be responsible for
the difference in the expression of apoptosis between mural and cumulus regions.
Materials and Methods: A total of 14 consecutive couples participating in IVF
program were investigated. Aspirated follicular fluid was transferred into tissue culture
dishes and oocyte-cumulus cells complexes were isolated. The cells were centrifuge and
fixed with Bouin’s solution and then were put on a glass slide. After fixation, the slides
were stained by immunocytochemistry method.
The incidence of apoptotic granulosa cells was examined by a fluorescence microscope.
Results: The incidence of apoptotic granulosa cells was 1.27 ± 0.12 in the mural region
and 0.38 ± 0.07 in the cumulus regions.
All mural and cumulus cells expressed total c-Jun in 7 patients while phosphorylated c-
Jun was also expressed in all cells of the other 7 patients. There was no difference
between apoptotic and nonapoptotic cells in the expression of total and phosphorylated
c-Jun.
Conclusion: C-Jun may not be responsible for apoptotic effect on mural and cumulus
cells.

A method to tune the cavity-mode wavelength of resonant cavity-enhanced photodetectors (RCE-PDs) is proposed. The proposed method can enable monolithic integration of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers and RCE-PDs to be a cost-competitive choice for bidirectional optical interconnection by reducing the amount of component and packaging costs presently involved. The properly tuned cavity-mode wavelengths remain effectively aligned within a temperature range of -10&#176;C&#8764;50&#176;C.

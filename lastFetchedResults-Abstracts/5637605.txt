We boost the efficiency and robustness of distribution-based matching by random subsampling which results in the minimum number of samples required to achieve a specified probability that a candidate sampling distribution is a good approximation to the model distribution. The improvement is demonstrated with applications to object detection, mean-shift tracking using color distributions and tracking with improved robustness for low-resolution video sequences. The problem of minimizing the number of samples required for robust distribution matching is formulated as a constrained optimization problem with the specified probability as the objective function. We show that surprisingly mean-shift tracking using our method requires very few samples. Our experiments demonstrate that robust tracking can be achieved with even as few as 5 random samples from the distribution of the target candidate. This leads to a considerably reduced computational complexity that is also independent of object size. We show that random subsampling speeds up tracking by two orders of magnitude for typical object sizes.

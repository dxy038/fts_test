An optimization technique for a load performance estimation of DC motors is presented. Load performance models such as a speed, power and efficiency model equation according to load torque are simultaneously identified by using an optimization technique. A separate curve fitting results in a non-consistency of the characteristic values due to no constraints, so we suggest a weighted summation type of objective function in order to perform, instead of a separate curve fitting, a simultaneous curve fitting which corresponds to a multi-objective optimization problem. This is implemented by using the well-known quasi-Newton algorithm. Compared to the separate curve fitting method, our proposed scheme shows a robust estimation even though fewer measurements with a small range of a load torque are used for a data fitting

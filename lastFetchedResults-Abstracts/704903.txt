The major objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence rate of Toxoplasma gondii in children citizens of United Arab Emirates (UAE) main residential areas. Questionnaire information, clinical data and blood samples were obtained from 1006 primary school children residence of seven out of nine districts of UAE. ELISA was used for detection of antibodies against the immunodominant surface antigen (SAG1) of T. gondii. The sensitivity and specificity of the employed ELISA were 98.4 and 99.1%, respectively using ‘Eiken’ latex agglutination test as a reference test. The seroprevalence rates were remarkably variable in different residential areas and ranged between 3.5% for Dubai and 34.6% for Sharjah, with an overall prevalence of 12.5% for the seven districts. Rear of ruminants at home and consumption of raw milk associated significantly (P<0.05) with exposure to T. gondii. UAE children exposed to T. gondii infection had a significantly higher hepatomegaly rate (P<0.05) and complained more of various symptoms at the time of sampling (P<0.01) compared to unexposed children. This study urges for more population studies to further elucidate the prevalence rates of toxoplasmosis in UAE in relation to age, gender, place of residence and risk factors.

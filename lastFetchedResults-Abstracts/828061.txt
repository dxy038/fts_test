Climate change as a result of increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration and
other greenhouse gases may have major effects on productivity of crops in future.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of climate change on growth,
yield and water consumption of chickpea under rainfed and irrigated conditions of
Kermanshah. The studied scenarios were (1) doubling CO2 concentration (i.e., 700
ppm), (2) 4°C increase in temperature, (3) 2% reduction in the amount of
precipitation, and (4) a combination of 700 ppm CO2, 4°C increase in temperature
and 2% reduction in precipitation. Simulations were done using SSM-Chickpea
model for the mentioned scenarios. Simulation results showed that climate change
will cause 89% increase in grain yield under rainfed condition and a 33% decrease
under irrigated condition. Although increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2
had directly positive effects on yield of chickpea, but it was found that increased
temperature was more important. Water use efficiency enhanced by 81% under
rainfed condition, but decreased by 25% under irrigated conditions. In addition,
crop life cycle is shortened due to increase in temperature. According to the
simulation results, the amount of required water for irrigated chickpea is reduced in
the future. It was concluded that due to limitation of agriculture water, irrigated
chickpea will be less profitable in the future; although area under irrigated chickpea
is very low now.

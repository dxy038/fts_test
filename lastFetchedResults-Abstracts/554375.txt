Background and Objective: Psychological disorders, particularly depression are common in chronic renal failure and patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). These disorders have important influences on quality of life and increased mortality rate. This study was performed to evaluate the frequency of depression and its related factors among HD patients within two dialysis units.

Materials and Methods: The study population consisted of 120 patients on conventional maintenance hemodialysis who filled Beck questionnaires in order to depression screening. Data were collected by questionnaire, medical history and laboratory exams. The SPSS software (version 16) was used for data analysis and Chi square and Spearman's tests were applied.

Results: Frequency of depression among study population was 70%, so that 26.7% of them suffered from severe depression. There was no correlation between age, gender, underlying disease, HD duration, history of renal transplantation, anemia, marriage status, occupation, serum albumin level and depression (p>0.05). Frequency of HD sessions per week and dialysis adequacy (Kt/V) significantly correlated with depression severity (p=0.01 and p=0.04 respectively).

Conclusion: With regard to high prevalence of depression among HD patients, depression screening seems necessary in this population. Early diagnosis and treatment of depression could improve patients' quality of life.

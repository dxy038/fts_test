In the era of information technologies for the flexible delivery of instruction in both the public and private education sectors, process for ensuring a quality outcome are becoming increasingly important. Quality assurance/enhancement in education sector is very important for a university, institute, college, and school at all levels i.e. students, teaching staff, facilities and the systems. The low quality of intake, teaching staff and physical facilities, and lack of quality control has significantly affected the standard of ´quality´ of higher education in public as well as in private sector. The main objective of this study is to present status of quality in the higher learning institutions of Arab State Universities which is quite questionable in the global context in terms of knowledge, facilities and the systems. The current paper also highlighted the wisdom of quality assurance move in Arab State Higher education system when many of the conditions necessary for its success are not present. There is growing interest in the quality of higher education in Arab State Universities now that the structure of the system of Higher Education has been established and offering different programmes to thousands of students, is turning its attention to the quality of the system in the context of the challenges of a globalize world with its rapidly accelerating knowledge economy based on information technologies. For this objective, we propose the Quality Assurance Committee for the Arab Sate Universities. This committee will develop and regulate Quality Enhancement Cell (QEC) as focal point for quality learning in almost all the faculties of higher education in All Arab state universities. The analysis is based on data collected from more than fifteen (15) universities in Arab State. We also mentioned some output and recommendation in the study.

We have developed the set of numerical (finite-element) and analytical tools that are based on the self-consistent solution of the electrostatic equations coupled with material Ginzburgâ€“Landau equations with an objective to model the profile of domain textures in the entire temperature region. We calculated the evolution of principal parameters of domain texture: modulation vector, distribution of polarization, renormalization of critical temperature etc. In contrast to the Kittel approximation we conclude that the profile of polarization across domains in nanometric ferroelectric thin films is highly nonuniform.

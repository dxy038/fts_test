The primary objective of this work is to design a highly portable data logging embedded system for naturalistic motorcycle study with capability of collecting many types of data such as images, speed, acceleration, time, location, distance approximation, etc. The proposed embedded system design is based on an Arduino microcontroller and is capable of storing up to 220 hours of text/image data during a one month study period. We have successfully designed and implemented the system. The data acquired has been validated and found to be accurate.

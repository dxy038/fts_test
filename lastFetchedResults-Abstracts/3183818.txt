Generally due to the progresses in spatial resolution of SAR imagery, the methods of segment based image study for generating and updating geographical information are becoming more and more significant. Image segmentation is the most practical loom among virtually all automated image recognition systems. Fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering is one of famous unsupervised clustering methods, which can be used for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image segmentation. In this paper, we proposed spatial information with the FCM clustering for improving the SAR image segmentation result. Hear two different fuzzy clustering techniques on SAR images that minimize two different objective functions.

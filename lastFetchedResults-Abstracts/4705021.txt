In this paper, a novel power control algorithm for cognitive radio networks is proposed based on game theory. Taking power expenditure, quality of service (QoS) of both primary users (PUs) and cognitive second users (SUs) into account, we can model the power control problem as a multi-objective optimization problem. To solve this problem, a convex cost function is first constructed in terms of transmit power and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of each SU. Then, an efficient iterative scheme is proposed, in which interference power constraint is dynamically incorporated. Simulation results shows that the proposed algorithm can provide significant power savings compared with the power balancing algorithm with limited SINR reduction.

This paper presents FLOSSMetrics, a European Commission 6th Framework Programme- funded research project. The main objective of FLOSSMETRICS is to construct, publish and analyse a large scale database with information and metrics about libre software development coming from several thousands of software projects, using existing methodologies, and tools already developed. The project also provides a public platform for validation and industrial exploitation of results. The project is in its final stage, and some results and databases are already available, as is shown in this paper.

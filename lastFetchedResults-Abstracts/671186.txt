Sea-surface temperature (SST) and sea-surface height (SSH) observations collected from space between October 1992 and December 1993 have been assimilated into a realistic primitive equation model of the North Atlantic Ocean circulation at eddy permitting resolution. The assimilated SST data originate from AVHRR observations gathered and processed within the NASA Pathfinder project; the altimetric data consist of SSH maps computed as the sum of a time-invariant dynamic topography and gridded sea-level anomalies obtained by combining Topex/Poseidon and ERS altimeter data. The assimilation scheme is a reduced-rank Kalman filter derived from the Singular Evolutive Extended Kalman (SEEK) methodology [J. Mar. Syst. 16 (1998) 323], in which the error statistics is represented in a subspace of small dimension. The error subspace is initialized with a truncated series of Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) of the system variability. The analysis algorithm includes a mechanism to update the forecast error statistics adaptively using all pertinent informations from the innovation vector. Hindcast experiments have been conducted with a 1/3Â° model of the North Atlantic basin forced with ECMWF atmospheric reanalyses. The impact of the data assimilated during 1993 is assessed by examining how observed (SSH and SST) and nonobserved variables (such as velocity and thermohaline properties in the interior of the ocean) are modified by the assimilation scheme. Finally, the validation of the hindcast experiments with independent XBT measurements is performed in order to evaluate the objective skill of the procedure. The various diagnostics demonstrate the positive impact of the satellite data to hindcast the upper ocean circulation at eddy permitting resolution and the capacity of the scheme to estimate the geographic distribution of the forecast error.

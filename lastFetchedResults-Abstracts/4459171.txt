This paper presents an inexpensive antenna that has a bidirectional radiation pattern in the H-plane. It covers its construction, electrical characteristics, and evaluation results of the propagation characteristics in the street-microcellular environment. In this antenna, two printed dipole antennas are placed adjacent to each other, they are fed out of phase by reverse printing their radiation elements, and arrayed in the E-plane to achieve higher gain. As propagation characteristics, we compare propagation loss and space diversity characteristics to those of an omni-directional antenna

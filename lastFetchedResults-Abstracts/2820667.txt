This paper gives an interpretation of the meaning of the adjoint system and its variable, that are introduced in the process of shape optimal design of electro-magnetic systems with sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity formulas for the discrete and continuum approach are compared and the meaning of the adjoint system is discussed. The adjoint system simplifies sensitivity calculations, and provides the link information between the objective function and design variables.

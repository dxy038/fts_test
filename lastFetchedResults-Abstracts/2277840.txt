Crambe meal is a coproduct of Crambe processing; because of relatively high protein, it has potential as an animal foodstuff but is limited by high glucosinolate content. Crambe meal can be pelleted to improve handling characteristics, but the effects of pelleting on glucosinolate content are not known. The objective was to determine the effect of pelleting on the glucosinolate content of Crambe meal and the effect of diets containing Crambe meal on growing rats.

ing did not affect the glucosinolate content of Crambe meal or diets containing Crambe meal. Intake of diets containing 100 g Crambe meal per kg (dry matter basis) was similar to that of controls, but gains were lower for rats fed Crambe meal diets. There were no effects on blood parameters, but there were some minor tissue changes, reflecting the goitrogenic nature of the glucosinolates found in Crambe meal.

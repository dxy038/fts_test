This paper describes the work in measuring flow while interacting with multi-platform games interfaces. We identified different gaming platforms which are mobile and non-mobile platform. The objective of the study is to identify and measure the variation of flow in different platforms. The early pilot data are collected through a survey form that are designed based on GameFlow criteria. The GameFlow criteria consist of eight elements which are: concentration; challenge; skills; control; clear goals; feedback; immersion and social interaction. In this exploratory study, the questionnaires of the survey are slightly altered from the GameFlow criteria identified in the previous work. From the early survey data collected, it shows the variation of playerÂ´s expression and thought towards different kind of gaming platforms. Finding also shows that PC and Console are preferred by the respondent as their main platform to play games. The finding of this exploratory study can be used as additional guidelines in the future development of games application.

Objective
The aim of this study was to assess the three-dimensional mechanical symmetry of the human second metacarpal and provide sample size estimates for future mechanical intervention studies of the metacarpal.
Design

Bone densitometry and digital image analysis were used to assess the morphometric, geometric and densitometric symmetry of the second human metacarpal.
Background

An assessment of the left–right mechanical symmetry of the human metacarpal is important in considering the suitability of using the contralateral metacarpal as a control and in providing sample size calculations for future studies involving a mechanical intervention to the metacarpal such as implantation of a metacarpophalangeal prosthesis.
Methods

Metaphyseal sectional areas, diaphyseal cortical sectional areas, second moments of area, average periosteal and medullary radii and bone densities were measured at nine transverse levels for each of seven pairs of index metacarpals using computed tomography and bone densitometry. Polar Fourier regression was used to assess the morphometry of sectional periosteal and endosteal boundaries. Differences between clinically important left–right parameters were assessed.
Results

Mean differences between clinically important left–right parameters were small (<3%) and similar to the degree of experimental precision. There were strong significant left–right correlations for the morphometric, geometric and densitometric parameters considered, indicating a high degree of bilateral mechanical symmetry.
Conclusions

The contralateral bone is a suitable control for mechanical intervention studies of the human metacarpal, and the use of bilateral pairing results in an important reduction in sample size.

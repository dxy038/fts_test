A low cogging force permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) having 9 pole 10 slot structure is presented in this paper. An optimization strategy employing Kriging model and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to reduce the detent force for high precision purpose application. In this optimization method, the uniform sampling technique is used to obtain the sampling points in the design space, and the Kriging model is to construct the interpolation function which can approximate the objective function. The GA is applied to find the optimum point of the interpolation surface. The optimized results show the proposed method has the advantage of high efficiency.

Objective: We investigated the relative participation of each cerebral hemisphere during a lateralized task that can be performed by a single hemisphere. While our companion article (Clarke et al. 1999) focused on visual and motor event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded from occipital and peri-Rolandic sites, the present article is concerned with ERP correlates of intermediate stages of information processing from remaining cerebral regions.
Methods: Intracranial ERPs were recorded from temporal, parietal and frontal lobe sites in 13 patients with intractable epilepsy while they performed a lateralized visual oddball task.
Results: Visually-responsive N2 and/or P3 effects were recorded from medial temporal and supramarginal sites that appear to reflect activity along ventral and dorsal visual streams, respectively. Likewise, certain prefrontal sites, that are probably involved in working memory, were also visually-responsive. The majority of sites exhibiting N2, P3 and/or slow wave components, however, were unaffected by lateralized visual field or response hand effects. Target-evoked P3-like components were most frequently recorded from medial temporal and prefrontal sites. Post-response slow wave components were pervasive, and polarity reversals were present in the insula/operculum region, apparently reflecting somatosensory activity from SII.
Conclusions: The general absence of lateralized ERP effects despite lateralized stimulus input and response output suggests the importance of interhemispheric integration over hemispheric independence in the processing of this type of task

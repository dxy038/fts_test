We study coding techniques and information rate calculations for relay channels with frequency-selective (FS) fading. Our main objective is to extend the available results on flat fading channels to FS fading. We develop suitable channel trellises, and employ simulation-based techniques to calculate constrained capacity bounds. Furthermore, we propose a distributed turbo coding strategy and several detection/decoding schemes to ensure successful cooperative communication. Our results show that, with suitable turbo coding and iterative decoding, one can approach the constrained capacity limits closely.

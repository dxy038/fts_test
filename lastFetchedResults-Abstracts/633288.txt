In This paper a two stages Hybrid Flow Shop (HFS) problem with sequence dependent set up times is considered in which the preemption is also allowed. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of completion time and maximum tardiness. Since this problem is categorized as an NP-hard one, meta-heuristic algorithms can be utilized to obtain high quality solutions in a reasonable amount of time. In this paper a Genetic algorithm (GA) approach is used and for parameter tuning the Response Surface Method (RSM) is applied to increase the performance of the algorithm. Computational results show the high performance of the proposed algorithm to solve the generated problems.

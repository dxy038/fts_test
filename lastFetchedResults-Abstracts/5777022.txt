In this paper, a location optimization model is proposed and a hybrid modeling methodology is discussed. Then, a non-standard real-coded genetic algorithm is deployed to optimize this model. A multi-objective fitness function is also considered during the optimization process. This model and the corresponding optimization method are implemented in a master planning project in Guilin City in South China, and a satisfactory result is obtained

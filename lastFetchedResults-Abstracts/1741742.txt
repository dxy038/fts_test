A novel approach based on the phasing-filter (PF) technique and the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm is proposed to preserve quadrature Doppler signal components from bidirectional slow blood flow close to the vessel wall. Bidirectional mixed Doppler ultrasound signals, which were echoed from the forward and reverse moving blood and vessel wall, were initially separated to avoid the phase distortion of quadrature Doppler signals (which is induced from direct decomposition by the nonlinear EMD processing). Separated unidirectional mixed Doppler signals were decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using the EMD algorithm and the relevant IMFs that contribute to blood flow components were identified and summed to give the blood flow signals, whereby only the components from the bidirectional slow blood flow close to the vessel wall were retained independently. The complex quadrature Doppler blood flow signal was reconstructed from a combination of the extracted unidirectional Doppler blood flow signals. The proposed approach was applied to simulated and clinical Doppler signals. It is concluded from the experimental results that this approach is practical for the preservation of quadrature Doppler signal components from the bidirectional slow blood flow close to the vessel wall, and may provide more diagnostic information for the diagnosis and treatment of vascular diseases.

The wide spread and relatively easy use of internet and other technologies enables E-commerce to grow exponentially due to reduction of costs, increase efficiencies and improve customer service. E-commerce is a part of human communication and social system, though technical aspects of E-commerce systems are important, there are also social variables which should come to consideration, so any E-commerce system can be viewed from two main view points; Technical and Human/Social. Pure technical solutions can not lead to a successful E-commerce. The main issue of this study is how to create systems and websites which considered being useable. The objective of research is to evaluate human/social variables affecting usability of systems from customersÂ´ point of view and also to evaluate concepts like satisfaction and loyalty of online customers.

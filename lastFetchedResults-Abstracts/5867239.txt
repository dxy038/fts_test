As an infrastructure for data distribution, overlay networks have to feature efficient routing and adequate robustness to achieve fast and accurate data distribution in the environment with node churn. Considering that the existing overlay networks mostly focus on single optimization objective and fail to ensure routing efficiency and robustness simultaneously, a hybrid overlay network for content-based data distribution - Anadem is proposed in this paper. Anadem achieves a better compromise between routing efficiency and robustness by combining the inter-cluster multiple structured topologies with the intra-cluster unstructured topologies. Anadem also provides mechanisms for dynamic concurrent cluster creation, cluster departure and load balance to make data distribution more adaptive to the dynamic network environment. Experimental results reveal that compared with existing overlay networks, Anadem can support fast and accurate content-based data distribution even when large amount of nodes fail in the system.

A novel objective quality for image fusion based on structural similarity and visual attention mechanism (VAM) is presented. By giving higher weight to the salient areas in the input images, the quality measure can estimate how much visual meaningful information is preserved in the fused image. The correlation analysis between objective measure and subjective evaluation showed that our measures are more consistent with human subjective evaluation.

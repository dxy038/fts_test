The authors describe a new algorithm for the detection of significant changes in the ST segment that are presumably related with ischemic episodes. Due to its simplicity the algorithm can be executed in real time. The authors also carry out study of the optimal values of the parameters that control its behavior. This algorithm has been implemented on a real time monitoring system the authors have developed called SUTIL. It is aimed at patients interned in intensive care units or coronary care units. This system monitors three electrocardiographic (ECG) and one cardiovascular pressure (usually central venous pressure) channels. Its main objective is clinical research

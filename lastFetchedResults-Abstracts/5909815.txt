This paper proposes a Single-phase three-level PWM rectifier that can realize the bidirectional, analyzes voltage vector and proposes a simple Single-phase SVPWM control arithmetic. The paper analyzes the discriminance of mode choice, and establish the switch table. Finally, the simulation and experiment are given to verify the validity of the proposed theory.

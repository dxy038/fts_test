Sufficient, nutritious and diversified diet prevents malnutrition and reduces the risk of chronic diseases. To generate more scientific and rational computer-aided diet schedules for people, a multi-objective mathematic model for nutritional diet optimization and the detailed design process of nutritional diet optimization program based on quantum genetic algorithm (QGA) are proposed. Experimental results on actual nutritional diet optimization show that this diet optimization method based on QGA has the advantages of excellent convergence speed and global optimization performance over traditional algorithms and genetic algorithm (GA).

Objective
Aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the correlation of shear bond strength and marginal cavity adaptation, together with polymerization shrinkage and contraction stress, using the combination of four self-etch adhesives and three resin composites.
Materials and methods

Interactions were studied between one two-step and three one-step adhesives, and the hybrid-type resin composites, Beautifil (BEU, Shofu) and Venus (VEN, Heraeus), and an experimental nano-hybrid resin composite NEUN (NEU, Heraeus). For all 12 combinations shear bond strengths (SBS) were determined on human dentin. Marginal adaptation (MGW) was assessed in cylindrical butt-joint dentin cavities. Further, polymerization contraction and contraction stress of the resin restoratives were measured.
Results

Significant determinants of SBSs on dentin were time of testing (10 min or 24 h) and adhesives (p < 0.001). Marginal adaptation was best for NEU, followed by VEN and BEU. Only the resin composite used was a highly significant determinant of cavity adaptation. Polymerization shrinkage after 5 min was 2.58, 2.74, and 1.53% for BEU, VEN, and NEU, respectively. Polymerization contraction stresses were largest for BEU, less for VEN, and smallest for NEU (p < 0.05).
Conclusions

No correlation was found between bond strength and marginal cavity adaptation. In contrast, reduced shrinkage and low polymerization contraction stress of resin composites were identified as important determinants of marginal cavity adaptation.

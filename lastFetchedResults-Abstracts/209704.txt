Introduction: Low grade chronic inflammation can predict persons with risk of coronary heart disease (CHD)
and type 2 diabetes. Women with Poly cystic ovarian syndrome (peaS) are insulin resistant and have high risk
for CHD and type 2 diabetes.
Objective: Evaluate the correlation between low grade chronic inflammation and peos.
Materials and Methods: This case-control study was done on 27 women with peos who were defined base on
irregular menstruation and elevated androgen (clinical hyperandrogenism or byperandrogenemia) and 27 healthy
women who were matched 35 a control group base on similar body mass index (8Ml) and age. CRP, ESR.
SHBG and Testosterone were measured in all women in both groups. Determine of insulin resistance was
assessed by estimation the ratio ofFBS/ to Fasting insulin. The mean of testosterone. SHBG, eRP, ESR and the
ratio of FBSI to Fasting Insulin in the two groups were compared by t- test and the correlation between BMI,
testosterone. SHBG and ratio ofFBSI to §sling insulin with CR.P and ESR were analyzed by Pearson correlation
coefficient
Results: The finding showed: the mean of eRP was significantly difference in two groups and it was more in
case group. (549/67 ± 378138 & 2566 ± 10/22, P<O/OOI). The mean ofESR was 14/85 ± 12122 and 7/74 ± 3/6 in
case & control groups respectively and there was significant difference between them (P<O/007). Also. there
were significantly relation between log eRP and log ESR with BMI, there were a reversed significant relation
between them and SHBG. There wasn't any relationship between log CRP & log ESR with testcsteron. The
collorate with FBSlFasting Insulin and log CRP was significant and with log ESR was no significant.
Conclusion: This study indicated that level of CRP and ESR in patients is higher than control group. It seems
that low grade of chronic inflammation is a contribute- factor to increase risk ofCHD and type2 diabetes.

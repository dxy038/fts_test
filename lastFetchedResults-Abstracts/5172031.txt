The authors consider the problem of optimizing the polarimetric contrast between two targets or target and clutter for the coherent bistatic case. It is assumed that the scattering matrices for the target and clutter are known a priori. The objective is to use this information to find ways to achieve optimal signal contrast. The proposed method is applicable when one has to fix the receiving and transmitting polarizations. To validate the method the authors have compared the received power after maximizing the contrast power ratio due to different objects with known scattering matrices, and compared it with the attainable maximum.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Objective
rpose of this correlational study was to explore the physical activity and quality of life of postcoronary artery bypass graft patients with metabolic syndrome.
s
y patients were recruited via purposive sampling. Data were collected through three instruments: a demographic questionnaire, the Modifiable Activity Questionnaire, and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-Health Survey. The data were analyzed using SPSS software, version 17.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL), and data analysis included percentages, means, standard deviations, correlation coefficients, and forward regressions.
s
ts with a higher level of physical activity tended to have better quality of life. Our findings also indicated that the total Modifiable Activity Questionnaire score and age explained 15.1% of the variance in the physical component summary of quality of life, and 13.6% of the variance in the mental component summary of quality of life.
sion
on this research, nursing staff should develop physical activity-related interventions to promote quality of life.

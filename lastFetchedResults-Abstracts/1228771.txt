This work presents both experimental and computational ballistic results of layered Aluminum Nitride (AlN) targets. An L/D = 6 tungsten penetrator is used to impact AlN targets at a nominal impact velocity of 2100m/s. The primary objective of this work is to determine the ballistic performance of layered ceramic targets to hypervelocity impact. Various layering configurations are investigated including separating the AlN ceramic layers by thin, low impedance, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). PMMA thicknesses of 1 mm, 0.5 mm and 0 mm are used. The number of AlN ceramic layers is also investigated. Target configurations of two, four, six, and twelve layers are considered. All targets consist of 76.2 mm of AlN. The experiments show that target resistance decreases when PMMA is added. Target resistance is also reduced when more layers are used. A secondary objective of this work is to evaluate the ballistic effect of reducing the lateral dimension of the ceramic tile (reduction in self-confinement). The experiments show reduced target resistance when the lateral tile size is decreased. Computations of selected experiments are presented to provide insight into the behavior of the AlN targets. The computations capture the effect of layering, PMMA separation and lateral tile size and provide insight into the behavior of the ceramic when used in these types of configurations.

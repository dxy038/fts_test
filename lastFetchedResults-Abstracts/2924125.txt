Remote Access to Museum Archives (RAMA) is a RACE II project that began in January 1992. The RAMA Consortium is a combination of technical partners and museums. The technical partners are: Brameur (UK), Telefonica Sistemas (Spain), Telesystemes (France), Politecnica de Madrid (Spain), Eutelis (France), Comp-Art (Germany), L-Cube (Greece). The museums are: Ashmolean Museum (UK), Museo Archeological National (Spain), Prado Museum (Spain), Musee d´Orsay (France), Museon (Netherlands), Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Arts (Greece). The main aims of the project are: service provision piloting; service provision technology and standards support; and social and cultural impact. Within the service provision piloting area, RAMA´s main objective is the consolidation of efforts to open up the broadband services market. It addresses the segment where the service provider or the information owner is a cultural/educational organisation. The initial main target user group has been defined as `professional users´ (e.g. researchers, teachers, writers)

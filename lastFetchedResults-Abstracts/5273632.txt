In order to do some preliminary analyses on characteristics of ground penetrating radar (GPR) signal of objects in time and time-frequency domain, and discuss how to roughly estimate the size of an object as well as distance between two objects, firstly the characteristics of GPR signal in time domain was studied in this paper as the size and the distance were changing respectively, secondly the characteristics in time-frequency domain was studied through generalized S transform (GST), the extraction rule of twin-peak attribute was analyzed, the determination of transformation parameter and frequency point was solved. It is pointed out that the size of an object can be estimated in combination of time domain waveform and twin-peak attribute, the definition of a small object can be given according to the size and objective, the resolution of two objects can be improved by twin-peak attribute and the distance can be roughly estimated combined with the attribute and time domain waveform.

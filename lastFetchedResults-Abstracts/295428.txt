The present study investigates factors influencing the quality of life and social reintegration of burn victims. A study concept was developed to assess the functional and aesthetic long-term outcomes of burn victims. Objective data from a clinical examination was correlated with subjective data from completed questionnaires. The success of social rehabilitation was documented and an indicative profile of life quality evaluated. This profile could prompt early intervention if found necessary. Ninety-two patients were examined 5.4Â±1.1 years after trauma in relation to three factors: physical functions, localization of the burn injuries and extent of the body surface area burned. Physical functioning allows the best predictions for successful rehabilitation, because all areas of life quality are affected by it. Localization of burns in the face and hands creates disadvantages in social reintegration. Of less value in prediction is the extent of the body surface area burned, which is only closely linked to occupational rehabilitation and directly correlates to physical functional limitations. Our correlation showed, that even slight functional limitations were linked to severe depressions, similar to the values found with patients with serious functional impairment. Interdisciplinary cooperation between plastic surgeons and psychosomatic specialists will optimize early intervention with patients exposed to social maladaptation.

Abstract
Background: Several clinical studies suggest that melatonin is a neuroprotective molecule in neurodegenerative disorders and it showed to be reduced in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. MS also results in blurred vision, papillitis and diplopia. The main objective of the study was to asses the influence of Melatonin supplimentation on visual characteristics in patients with MS.
Materials and Methods: In a Quasi-experimental plan, approved by AUMS (Arak University of Medical Sciences) Ethical Committee (9-129-91, Grant No: 782), 34  patients (9 male and 25 female) with stable MS were asked to voluntarily participate in the study. All subjects (Mean EDSS; 3.14) were taking their routine medications. Visual funtions were evaluated by Visual Functioning Questionnaire (VFO-25) and standard Pattern Reversal Visual Evoked Potentials (PR-VEP) records. Serum melatonin levels were also measured using an ELISA assay. Recordings were performed after a single dose and after taking one tablet every night for 14 days, at the day 16th.
Results: In all subjects, serum melatonin levels significantly enhanced. VFQ scores also showed significat improvements. Except for the change in N75 latencies of left eyes, VEP latencies of P100, N145 of both eyes, and N75 of right eyes significantly (P < 0.05) decreased. 
Conclusion: Our findings suggest significat improvements of visual symptoms of MS after daily intake of 3 mg melatonin. The results call for further studies and clinical trails before asking all MS patients to take melatonin suppliment every night.

Endometrial calcification along with ossification is an uncommon clinical entity. Most of the cases
are asymptomatic or present with secondary infertility. Endometrial ossification associated with
repeated abortions has been reported very infrequently. Here we report a case of endometrial
calcification with ossification due to retained fetal bony tissue in a 38 year old symptomatic female
having previous history of two abortions. This case highlights the importance of detailed clinical
history, ultrasonographic and endometrial evaluation along with histopathological examination
in a patient having repeated abortions. It also emphasizes the need to consider endometrial
tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis of endometrial calcification and subsequent ossification
especially in areas where tuberculosis is rampant.

In the present paper, an analytical approach is proposed to determine the radial distributions of electric field, electrons, ion densities and temperature of a DC corona discharge in wire-to-cylinder geometry, using oxygen as feed gas. The currentâ€“voltage (CV) characteristic measured in experiments is used as an input in the calculation. The objective of this work is to provide approximated analytical solutions of the corona discharge with low computational cost, which can be useful in different technological applications, such as the generation of ozone or the decomposition of pollutant gases. The predictions of the analytical model are compared with the results obtained from a much more complete numerical simulation.

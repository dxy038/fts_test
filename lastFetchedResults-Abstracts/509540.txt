There have been introduced different criteria for distinguishing strategic form operational management till the emergence of strategy in management literature. We believe these criteria are not accurate and acceptable. Strategic approach is a separate view beside scientific, human relations, systematic and contingency approaches toward management. This view helps us consider issues in objective and subjective(conceptual) level, and complete management theories by aligning and integrating these two levels. Strategic formulation, implementation and control are three parts of comprehensive strategic management model that these parts complete each other and create synergy in organizations through alignment and integration. Strategic control is the control in conceptual level and defined as formal and informal procedure that helps the organization to establish or maintain its sustainable dynamic situation. This article introduces a comprehensive model for strategic management according to the definition and discusses the component of the model within two kinds of strategic control: strategic process control and strategic content control.

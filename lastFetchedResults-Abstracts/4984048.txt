A chewing machine is required to provide objective measurements of food texture. To do this it must closely simulate human chewing behaviour in terms of kinematics and force application to the food. A linkage chewing machine is developed to reproduce human chewing trajectory in 2D space. This research is aimed at enhancing this chewing machine so it is suitable for food texture analysis. An ATI force sensor is installed under the teeth to allow 3D force measurement dynamically. A spring mass system is developed to replace the shock absorber for feed forward force control. A SimMechanics simulation model of the chewing machine including linkage mechanism, velocity control system, spring-mass system and food resistance model is created. The model validates the design of spring mass system, provides simulated data of the dynamic force profile on teeth and will benefit the design of feedback force control methodology in order to implement human occlusal force profiles in the chewing machine. The chewing device will be a useful tool to quantify texture in foods.

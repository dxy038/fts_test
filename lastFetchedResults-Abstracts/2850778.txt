Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a kind of the automatic identification technology which identifies an object by radio frequency mode for non-contact bidirectional data communication. It has been applied in many industries such as supply chain management, retail management, logistics management, security supervising, traffic supervising, and so on. This paper firstly introduces the principle of RFID technology, and then presents the agricultural by product supply chain management system and security supervising system based on it. With the background that the present agricultural by product security crises occur frequently, RFID technology ensures the product safety to some extent, it also improves the efficiency and reduces the cost in the whole process. Lastly, the existing problems and future development of RFID technology are also suggested in this paper.

						Materials & Methods: PM10 data were taken from Ilam's Local Agency of Environment (I-LAE). The annual mortality, including total, cardiovascular, and respiratory due to PM10 were estimated, using AirQ2.2.3 software model. The relative risk (RR) and baseline incidence (BI) defaulted by WHO were used for this purpose.

						Results: The number of excess cases for total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality was estimated 161, 85 and 17 persons, respectively for a year exposure to PM10 among the people. About 3.95% of mortalities were occurred in the days with concentration levels less than 20 &mu;g/m3. The most percentage of person-days attributed to different levels of PM10 was found to be in concentration of 40-49 &micro;g/m3.

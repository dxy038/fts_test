This paper considers the Bicriteria Shortest Path Problem (BSP) with the two conflicting objectives, minimizing the transportation cost and the total travel time. Bicriteria Shortest Path Problems, are often NP-hard problems [P. Hansen, Bicriterion path problems. In: Multiple criteria decision making: theory and applications. Heidelberg: Springer, (1980):109-127], since obtaining the set of efficient solutions to a BSP problem is more difficult than solving the corresponding single-objective problem. This paper proposes a Bicriteria Genetic Algorithm approach to solve bicriteria shortest path problem.

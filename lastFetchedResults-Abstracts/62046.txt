Gastrointestinal (GI) parasitism represents a severe health problem in small ruminant production systems world-wide. The objective of the present study was three-fold: (i) to assess the prevalence of GI parasitism in dairy breeds of sheep and goats in selected areas of Greece; (ii) to determine the species of existing gastrointestinal parasites; and (iii) to investigate the effect of climatic factors on the seasonal variation of parasite population dynamics in dairy sheep and goats reared in two different geographical areas of Greece. The study was conducted in four flocks of either sheep or goats that were equally allocated in northern and central Greece. In each flock, faecal samples were randomly collected from 30 animals at monthly intervals and were used for nematode egg counts and coprocultures. Two animals from each flock were slaughtered monthly and their GI tract were examined for adult worm population and identification. The study revealed that the parasitic burdens in sheep were significantly (P<0.05) higher than those in goats. Faecal egg counts for both sheep and goats were significantly (P<0.01) affected by the month of the year and there was also a significant interaction between month of the year and area of study (P <0.01). Teladorsagia, Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus and Chabertia were the most prevalent nematode genera in both sheep and goats. Such information could be useful for the development of strategic treatments when sheep and goats are reared under systems similar to those described in this study.

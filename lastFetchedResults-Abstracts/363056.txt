Study objective
We characterize non–work-related finger amputations treated in US hospital emergency departments (EDs) and discuss implications for injury-prevention programs.
Methods
Finger amputation data from 2001 and 2002 were obtained from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System All Injury Program (a nationally representative sample of 66 US hospital EDs). National estimates are based on weighted data for 948 cases for finger amputations (including partial and complete) that occurred during non–work-related activities (ie, nonoccupational) activities.
Results
An estimate of 30,673 (95% confidence interval [CI] 24,877 to 36,469) persons with non–work-related amputations were treated in US hospital EDs annually. Of these persons, 27,886 (90.9%; 95% CI 22,707 to 33,065) had amputations involving 1 or more fingers; 19.1% were hospitalized or transferred for specialized trauma care. Male patients were treated for finger amputations at 3 times the rate of female patients. The rate of persons treated for finger amputations was highest for children younger than 5 years (18.8 per 100,000 population; 95% CI 12.3 to 25.2 per 100,000 population), followed by adults aged 55 to 64 years (14.9 per 100,000 population; 95% CI 9.6 to 20.1 per 100,000 population). For children aged 4 years and younger, 72.9% were injured in incidents involving doors, and for adults aged 55 years or older, 47.2% were injured in incidents involving power tools.
Conclusion
National estimates of finger amputations among US residents indicate that young children and older adults are at greatest risk. Parents or other responsible adults should be aware of the risk of small children's fingers around doorways, and adults should take safety precautions when using power tools.

Background: Health care workers are facing certain occupational hazards because of sharp
injury and exposure to human blood and body fluids as a result of handling wastes. Though
much attention is paid for the protection of these workers, the number of exposures and injuries
do not show a sign of decline from time to time.
Objective: To examine the occurrence of sharp injury and exposure to blood and body fluids
in health care workers in health care centers in Ethiopia.
Methods: In a case-control study, a randomly selected sample of 65 health facilities with
391 cases and 429 controls were studied. Data were collected through a self-administered
questionnaire. Detailed analysis of exposure among the health care workers was done by
logistic regression analysis with generalized estimating equations model to control correlation
effects of responses within the cluster of health facilities.
Results: The number of health care workers who got sharp injury was 217 (26.5%). 296
(36.1%) had exposure to blood and body fluids. Working at Harari region (adjusted OR 0.44,
95% CI 0.26 to 0.75) and East Hararghea (adjusted OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.94), being
male (adjusted OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.91), and a being nurse (adjusted OR 0.188, 95%
CI 0.06 to 0.63) were independent risk factors of the exposure.
Conclusion: Regardless of the anticipated low self-reporting for exposure status, the number
of health care workers reported having sharp injury and exposure to blood and body
fluids was high. Such high exposures indicate that health care workers are at h

The objective of this study was to compare the responses of horses of different breeds to a sympathetic training method used during an initial training period, before the horses started their first racing season. Subject animals were 72 horses: 24 Thoroughbreds, 24 Purebred Arabians, and 24 Angloarabs. Each breed group consisted of 12 colts and 12 fillies. The sympathetic method used to train the horses lasted for 3 days in a row, one session per day. Training was divided into five stages, each stage made up of particular tasks to be achieved. The horse’s reaction to the training was measured with the length of time (seconds) necessary to complete a stage and the horse’s heart rate (bpm) during the stages. Data were analyzed by using multifactorial analysis of variance, taking into account the effect of horse breed, sex, and training session. Results showed that horses of various breeds had different responses to the training. The Angloarabs took the longest to complete the training stages. The 3-day training period caused the highest reaction in the Angloarabs, and the 3-day period was too short to allow for more than half of them to be mounted. Heart rate was more increased in Purebred Arabian and Angloarab fillies than in colts, which shows that fillies require particularly gentle treatment.

Development and application of high-speed underwater vehicle is the motivation for many researchers to consider super-captivating flows. Frictional drag decreases and vehicleâ€™s velocity increases due to cavity generation. The objective of the present research is to find the coefficients of a relation to estimate cavity length around a submersible vehicle equipped with a wedged-shaped cavitator-which has important practical applications. For this purpose, the super cavitation phenomena has been simulated numerically around three bodies with different geometry. In the first stage, to validate the results of numerical simulation of present work a well-established experimental result of a cylindrical body with hemispheric cap is used for comparison. This comparison is used for parameters effecting numerical method, turbulence flow model and mass transfer model. As this comparison is confirmed, the simulation is continued in the second stage for super cavitation phenomena initiation around a wedged-shaped cavitator with three angles of 15 and 30 and 45 degrees. Inthe third stage, the super cavitation flow is analyzed around a submersible body equipped with a wedged-shaped cavitator. The cavity length and related coefficients are obtained for three cases using different cavitation numbers. The developed equation is similar for all cases with different coefficients. The averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved in transient case using finite volume method.

Consider the problem of image deblurring in the presence of impulsive noise. Standard image deconvolution
methods rely on the Gaussian noise model and do not perform well with impulsive noise. The main
challenge is to deblur the image, recover its discontinuities and at the same time remove the impulse noise.
Median-based approaches are inadequate, because at high noise levels they induce nonlinear distortion that hampers
the deblurring process. Distinguishing outliers from edge elements is difficult in current gradient-based edgepreserving
restoration methods. The suggested approach integrates and extends the robust statistics, line process
(half quadratic) and anisotropic diffusion points of view. We present a unified variational approach to image deblurring
and impulse noise removal. The objective functional consists of a fidelity term and a regularizer. Data
fidelity is quantified using the robust modified L1 norm, and elements from the Mumford-Shah functional are
used for regularization. We show that the Mumford-Shah regularizer can be viewed as an extended line process.
It reflects spatial organization properties of the image edges, that do not appear in the common line process
or anisotropic diffusion. This allows to distinguish outliers from edges and leads to superior experimental
results.

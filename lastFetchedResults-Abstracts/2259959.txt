Abstract
Context and objective: In most books and initiatives related to crime prevention, only three areas such as judicial prevention, social prevention and situational prevention are considered. Now the question is that policing prevention is focused in which area? In this paper, the segmentation of the United Nation in the field of crime prevention is considered as the basis of this research upon which the methods of crime prevention in I.R. Iran and Turkey are compared. 
Methodology: This research is document-based and is written using library sources. Lots of notes have been gathered from English and Persian books and reliable sources. One of the most important documents used here is the document of the UN about crime prevention
Findings: The police of Turkey employ three types of prevention such as social, judicial and policing prevention; however, there are differences in quality and quantity of enforcing methods in comparison with I.R. Iran police. In fact, in Turkey, the term of policing prevention is used instead of situational police. 
Results: According to the 156th principle of Iran’s Constitution, crime prevention is the duty of Judiciary Organ.  But in ordinary laws, we have some instances of crime prevention. Turkish Police have it own structure to prevent crimes and in this area it does not have any basic difference with Iran’s Police. 
Keywords: Crime Prevention, Judicial Prevention, Prevention Policing, Social Prevention, Situational Prevention.

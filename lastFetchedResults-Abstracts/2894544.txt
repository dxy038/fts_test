Summary form only given. Over the last decade, the European Technology Platforms (ETPs) have been very successful models to bring together technological know-how and stakeholders with the aim of producing a long-term strategic plan for research and development of specific technologies with a significant economic and societal impact. TPs are being created in other parts of the world with the objective of facilitating the effective collaboration between European and third-world countries counterparts on common research topics, addressing global R&amp;D&amp;I bottlenecks and facilitation of knowledge circulation in a global scale. As an FP7 Project, MOSAIC (cooperation with Mediterranean (MED) partners to build Opportunities around ICT and Societal And Industrial Challenges of Horizon 2020) proposes the creation of two TPs focused on the two regions of the Mediterranean area from a sociopolitical and geographical perspective: one TP covering Maghreb countries (Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia) and one TP covering Mashriq countries (Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria). MED TPs instruments will foster bilateral cooperation between European stakeholders and strategic partners in the MED region in R&amp;D projects within the EUÂ´s Programs (H2020) and also within MED country programs. The session will focus on providing awareness to Egyptian scientists and researchers for the Egyptian TP being built by TIEC, as the Egyptian Partner in MOSAIC Project. In this session, the possible methods and best practices to empower the Egyptian TP shall be discussed.

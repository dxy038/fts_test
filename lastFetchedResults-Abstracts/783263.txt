Background Results from previous
studies on the incidence rates for schizophrenia are
inconsistent, with some showing a declining rate
[e.g., Suvisaari et al. (1999) Arch Gen Psychiatry
56:733–740] and others showing an increasing rate
[e.g., Boydell et al. (2003) Br J Psychiatry 182:45–49].
Objective This study examines (1) whether incidence
rates are changing, (2) relationships amongst changing
incidence rates and age, period and cohort effects,
and (3) the impact of rate changes on rate projections.
Design A care-based cohort study carried out in
British Columbia, Canada, 1989–1998. Bayesian statistical
analyses were used to estimate rates and describe
secular effects. Classical tests of significance
were used to assess the relative importance of age,
period and cohort effects. Results Between 1989 and
1998, median rates per 100,000 persons changed from
77.1 (90% credible interval (CI): 42.1–137.7) to 89.9
(90% CI: 80.1–100.1) in females, and from 66.6 (90%
CI: 38.8–113.3) to 119.6 (90% CI: 107.4–132.4) in
males. Age effects were active for both males and females.
Period and cohort effects were stronger for
males than females. Conclusions In contrast to most
previous studies, we found an increasing incidence of
schizophrenia. Precise projections of schizophrenia
incidence beyond 5 years require large sample sizes
over prolonged periods of follow-up

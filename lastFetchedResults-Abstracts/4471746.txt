Wiener systems are characterized by a linear dynamic block followed by a static nonlinearity. In the paper a model-based predictive control (MPC) strategy is proposed for this type of systems. In this MPC algorithm the static nonlinearity is transformed into a polytopic uncertainty description of the output mapping which enables the use of robust linear MPC techniques. The optimization problem is given by a linear objective function subject to linear matrix inequalities. Nominal closed loop stability of this Wiener MPC strategy can be guaranteed

Objective
We describe the case of a woman with Bell's Palsy-induced blepharospasm (BPIB) of the right eye that appeared simultaneously with a complete left facial nerve palsy. The involuntary spasm was relieved by passive lowering of the upper eyelid on the paretic side.
Methods
The recovery curve of the blink reflex was evaluated on the non-paretic side in baseline conditions, after subcutaneous apomorphine and placebo administration and 8 months later, at recovery from the palsy.
Results
We found increased recovery of the test-R2 responses at short interstimulus intervals at baseline, which was normalised by apomorphine but not by placebo. At recovery the blink reflex R2 recovery curve returned to normal.
Conclusions
This report demonstrates for the first time a response of BPIB to a dopamine agonist.
Significance
Our findings are in agreement with an animal model of blepharospasm that suggests a combined role of weakness of the orbicularis oculi muscle and a dysfunction of the dopaminergic system in the pathogenesis of this disorder

To monitor the dynamic behavior of large power systems, like inter-area oscillations, measurements at different points of the power system are required. For this purpose, a wide area measuring system is currently built up within the European Power System. The obtained measurements are used to analyze the different power system oscillation modes and to validate respective simulation models. The main objective is the observance of trends regarding inter-area oscillations against the background of a changing power system, which is influenced by an increasing penetration of decentralized generation and wind power feed-in as well as deregulated energy market conditions. First measurements and simulations are shown in the paper and prove the functioning of the wide-area measuring system as well as the importance of the availability of measurement data for wide area power system analyses. The measuring system is intended solely for research purposes and follows no operational or commercial aspects.

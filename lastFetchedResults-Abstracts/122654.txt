Introduction & Objective: Plastination is a unique technique(was developed by gunthea hagen's in 1984) involves substituting the tissue water in a specimen with polymer. The aim of this study is plastination of 3.5-5 months human aborted fetuses.
Materials and Methods: This is a experimental applied study. 12 human aborted were plastinated after fixation in formalin solution, clearing in hydrogen peroxides, dehydration by acetone and forced imperegnation was carried. In the last step curing shrinkages was removed by positive pressure anatomical spaces, The data was analysed by T & Mann Whitney.
Results: Samples were obtained in this study compared with the samples. Two sampels have the same durablity but flexibility resin sampel are more than silicones , probably besause of insertion glycerin to resin polyester. Also matching of aboartion steps of forensic medicin was done in this collection .
Conclusion: A collection of 12 plastinated aboarted human fetuses were prepared and matchs the samples with the definition of forensic medicine. Silicone substituted by cheap resin polyester asseptable samples were obtained. Plastinated fetuses are usefull for teaching of embryology and forensic medicine for the medical students.

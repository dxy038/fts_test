 Objective/Hypothesis: To describe the ultrastructural changes occurring within pulsed-dye laser (PDL)-treated glottal tissues. Study Design: Prospective. Methods: Nine patients presenting with glottal dysplasia requiring biopsy to rule out microinvasive carcinoma were enrolled in this prospective study. At least two samples were obtained in each case: one from a PDL-treated area and another from a non-PDL-treated area (obtained from a nonphonatory region as an internal control). In some cases, a third sample was obtained from the junction between PDL- and non-PDL-treated areas. All samples were examined with light microscopy (H&E stain) and transmission electron microscopy. Observations were made of morphological changes within the epithelium, epithelial/ superficial lamina propria (SLP) junction, and the lamina propria of tissues treated with the PDL. Eight of nine patients were followed for a period of 9â€“25 months (mean, 18 months) with two recurrences that were retreated with awake-PDL and followed for an additional 8.3 and 9.5 months without recurrence. Vocal fold appearance returned to normal within 3â€“4 weeks posttreatment. Results: Intraepithelial desmosome junctions were preferentially destroyed, and regional blood vessels were coagulated. The PDL consistently caused a separation of epithelial cells away from the basement membrane. Conclusions: The PDL allowed for both a surgical and a nonsurgical multimodality method for treatment of precancerous lesions with minimal effects on the SLP.

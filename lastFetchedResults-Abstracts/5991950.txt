A CDMA system is under development for the next-generation digital cellular systems. One feature of the system is the inclusion of a pilot signal in the forward (base-station-to-mobile) link so as to provide a coherent reference to mobile stations. In the reverse link, however, no pilot is used for power efficiency considerations; thus, a noncoherent reception is used for this direction. The objective is to present a receiver structure that may be used in the reverse link and to analyze its performance in terms of the error probability. Assuming that the reverse link uses a noncoherent M-ary orthogonal modulation, the symbol error probability is derived analytically. In addition, the validity of the analysis results is demonstrated by computer simulations

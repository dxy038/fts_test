A three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of a contact tank is presented in this paper. The model results are compared against 3D velocities and flow through curve (FTC) data, representing a tracer concentration profile, from a 1:8 scale physical model. The objective is to demonstrate that CFD models can simulate both the FTC and the 3D velocity field quite well. Simultaneous validation of velocities and FTC is important in ascertaining the predictive capabilities of CFD models, as physical model studies indicate that different baffle arrangements can lead to similar FTCs. Therefore, a good prediction of only FTC, as presented in previous 3D CFD model studies, does not necessarily imply a correct simulation of the flow field.

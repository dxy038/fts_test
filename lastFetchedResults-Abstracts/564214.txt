The objective of this research was presenting a case model for determining of range suitability of central Taleghan region for sustainable bee keeping activities. After considering the factors affecting range suitability for beekeeping, final suitability map was created by using the suggested method of FAO and GIS software. Random sampling was done in vegetation types, using 30 (1Ã—1m) quadrates along three 200m long transect. Investigation on quality and characteristics of rangelands showed that three sub models of vegetation cover (flowering period, the rate of attractiveness of plants and vegetation cover percent), environmental factors (roads and access roads to vegetation, elevation, temperature and soil characteristics) and hydrology (water resources) played the main role in the determination of range suitability for bee keeping. Decreasing of nectar or pollen in the vegetation cover, an existence of low quality plants (classes III and IV) along with the shortage of flowering period, poor soil conditions and lack of roads in some vegetation types were among the most limiting factors of range suitability for bee keeping in the study area. In contrast, suitable distribution of water resources, elevation and temperature increased the rangelands suitability for bee keeping. According to our results from 37977.2 hectares of studied rangelands, 235 hectares (0.61%) classified as S1 of suitability (without limitation for bee keeping), 7798 hectares (20.53%) classified as S2 class (with limitation), 9961 hectares (26.29%) classified as S3 class (with high limitation),and 8861 hectares (23.33%) classified as N class (non suitable). Generally, 21% of the area had an acceptable score as excellent suitability for bee keeping.

Background and Objective: Chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori (H-pylori) that is associated with chronic atrophic gastritis increase susceptibility to typhoid fever. There are conflicting reports on this association in different parts of the world. The aim of this study was to estimate the association between H-pylori infection and typhoid fever. Subjects and Methods: In this case-control study, 50 hospitalized patients with typhoid fever diagnosed based on clinical features and positive blood or bone marrow culture and admitted to Razi and Abuzar hospitals in Ahvaz were investigated. For each patient one age- and sex-matched control (among classmates or hospital visitors) based on healthy appearance and lack of fever was chosen. All of the cases and controles were tested for IgG-anti H-pylori by ELISA. Data were analyzed by Chi squared test in SPSS software.

Results: Positive seroprevalence for H-pylori in case group was 66% which was significantly higher than those of control (44%) (P=0.02). H-pylori positive seroprevalence in subjects younger than 20 years of age in cases and control groups was 60.6 and 54.5% respectively (P>0.05). on the other hand, in subjects older than 20 years, was 39.4 and 45.5%, respectively (P=0.43). There was a significant difference between patients and controls among males (P=0.03), but not among females (P>0.05).

Conclusion: This study suggests that there is an association between H-pylori infection and typhoid fever. So prevention and control of H-pylori infection may also decrease the occurrence of typhoid fever. Sci Med J 2010;9(2): 107-113

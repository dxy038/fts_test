Background: Heart failure is a common, disabling, deadly, and highly threatening disease. Despite advances in the treatment of heart failure over the past decade, the prognosis remains poor. 
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the mortality frequency and length of hospital stay in elderly with systolic heart failure at Alborz Hospital in Karaj during 2009.
Methods: This was a cross sectional study in which a total of 154 heart failure patients aged ?65 years and low ejection fraction (EF)( < or=%.40) during 2003-2008 were investigated. Demographic, laboratory, and echocardiography data were collected from medical records. Data were analyzed by independent group t-test, chi square test, and Pearson correlation coefficient.
Findings: Hospital mortality was 7.1% and the mean length of hospitalization 11.59Â±10.94 days in elderly with systolic heart failure. Statistically, there was a significant difference in mean serum creatinine levels and blood urea nitrogen between the living and dead groups with heart failure (P < 0.001). The use of ACE inhibitors (P=0.039) and angiotensin II receptor blocker (P=0.038) was found to be significantly associated with mortality. Also, the length of hospital stay showed significant association with presence of COPD (P=0.035), asthma (P < 0.001), and administration of digoxin (P=0.028), nitrate (P=0.015), and warfarin (P < 0.001). Significant positive correlation was found between the length of hospital stay and both serum creatinine levels (P=0.002) and blood urea nitrogen (P=0.041).
Conclusion: Renal dysfunction and several comorbidities and drugs could increase mortality and length of hospital stay in elderly with systolic heart failure.

A dual circularly polarized waveguide antenna with bidirectional radiations of the same sense is proposed in this communication. Bidirectional circular polarization (Bi-CP) of the same sense was obtained by two identical rectangular metal slices installed on one lateral side of the waveguide with an intersection angle of 45<sup>&#176;</sup>. These two metal slices were horizontally perpendicular to each other and vertically spaced by a quarter guided wavelength. A rat-race coupler was employed to excite the two metal slices with the same amplitude, but with a 0<sup>&#176;</sup> or 180<sup>&#176;</sup> phase difference depending on the selection of two inputs. One sense of Bi-CP was realized when the two metal slices were fed in phase and the opposite sense of Bi-CP could be obtained when they were fed out of phase. A prototype for 2.4-GHz WLAN application was tested to verify our design. The measured common bandwidth for 10-dB return loss and 3-dB axial ratio at the two feed ports was 230 MHz (9.6%, 2.29-2.52 GHz) and 210 MHz (8.6%, 2.35-2.56 GHz), respectively. The measured isolation between the two feed ports was better than 30 dB over the whole operating band.

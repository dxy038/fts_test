In order to better prepare our soldiers for the wars of tomorrow, it is vital that the army investigates the benefits of implementing new soldier tactical mission system (STMS) alternatives in battle. The purpose of our research is to quantify the gain in mission capability as the technology attributes of the STMS are varied. We will use an agent-based model called map aware nonuniform automata (MANA) to simulate the actions of an infantry squad in a scenario. We will vary the attributes of the individual agents in MANA to represent three STMS alternatives: current soldier, the land warrior version 1.0, and objective force warrior technology. The measures of effectiveness for our experiment will be casualties over time and the time to complete the mission. Developing a model of this nature is important because it will show the benefit of new STMS alternatives and it will allow us to show a link between individual technology and mission capability.

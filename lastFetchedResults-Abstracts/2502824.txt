Introduction & Objective: Heavy metals are major pollutants that can spread in the atmosphere with particulate matter and dust and because of the toxic and carcinogenic effects, their meas-urement and control is very important. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess Co, Cr and Mn concentration in the atmospheric dry deposition collected from Hamadan city in 2014.     
Materials & Methods: After collection of 12 dust samples from 3 sampling stations and their laboratory preparation, metals concentrations were determined using ICPâ€“OES. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical package.
Results: The results showed that the minimum and maximum mean concentrations of Co were 0.19 and 0.29 mg/kg for high and low traffic intensity sampling stations, respectively. The min and max mean concentrations of Cr were 0.65and 1.02 mg/kg for high traffic intensity and suburb sampling stations, respectively and the min and max mean concentrations of Mn were 7.23and 8.82 mg/kg for high and low traffic intensity sampling stations , respectively. Also comparing the mean concentrations of assessed metals with WHO permissible limits showed a significant difference (P <  0.05). The mean concentrations of metals were significantly lower than the maximum permissible limits.
Conclusion: Although the mean concentrations of Co, Cr and Mn are  lower than the  standard levels, lack of continuous monitoring of heavy  metals concentrations in the dust and particu-late matters in  the air  can lead to the entrance of various types of toxic pollutants such as heavy metals into the air and result in adverse health effects.

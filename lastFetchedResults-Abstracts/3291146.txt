TanDEM-X, a single-pass SAR interferometer with adjustable baselines in across- and in along-track directions was formed by adding a second, almost identical spacecraft to TerraSAR-X and flying the two satellites in a closely controlled formation. With typical across-track baselines of 150 to 500 m a global Digital Elevation Model with 2 m relative height accuracy at a 12-m posting is being generated. Beyond this primary mission objective, TanDEM-X is also an important pre-cursor for future SAR satellite formations allowing demonstrating novel SAR techniques, with focus on multistatic SAR, polarimetric SAR interferometry, digital beam forming and super resolution.

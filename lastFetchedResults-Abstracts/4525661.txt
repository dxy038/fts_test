This paper presents a business concept for the provision of new high rate, high quality broadcast services mainly to mobile but equally well to fixed consumers by applying the newly developed DAB standard. All necessary elements to implement and operate such a system in the three main economic regions of the world make it a very attractive international system. Due to the state-of-the-art technology it could commence offering innovative services from the very first day of the 21st century. The system configuration is based on a study for the European Space Agency. The main objective of the system investigation was to identify a technically and commercially viable system concept. Each spot of the system represents an independent resource on its own. The capacity of a single DAB-multiplex transmitted in this spot comprises programmes and data services which are of special interest in the particular service areas

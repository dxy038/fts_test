This study deal with the simulation, design and experiments of an active magnetic bearing. Initially the mathematical model is formed and used to develop a simulation model in VisSIM<sup>TM</sup> environment. Later, design optimization is achieved by using FEM analysis and the comparison of the simulation results with objective performance values. Digital type PD controller is developed and a full scale experimental set up is formed. It is shown that, the system is stable at standstill operation and the simulation results are in good agreement with those of theory

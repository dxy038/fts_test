Indoor localization with the accuracy being better than few meters may be a quite challenging task when the system costs are an issue. This paper presents a frequency modulation continuous wave (FMCW) technology-based indoor localization system that has been built in the EU FP7 Confidence project. The main objective of the Confidence project is the development and integration of innovative technologies to build a care system for the detection of abnormal events, e.g. falls or unexpected behaviors that may be related to health problems of elderly people. In this paper, details on the hardware, firmware, and software parts of the developed prototype are provided. The localization algorithm based on the Kalman filter with the Gaussian averaging is presented. The localization performance is evaluated in the laboratory setting. Our first results indicate that in the case of localization in two dimensions the mean absolute position error is about 1 meter.

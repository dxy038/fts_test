This work had the objective of studying the pigment MgFe2O4 obtained by the polymeric precursor method, which is based on the formation of a polymeric resin, followed by a heat treatment in order to obtain the final oxide. The powders were calcined between 500 and 1100 °C, and characterized by thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, scanning electronic microscopy and diffuse reflectance. The pigment is single phase, with a cubic system and space group Fd3m (2 2 7). A low temperature synthesis was possible, with a crystalline material after heat treatment at 800 °C. The colors obtained varied, according to the crystallization of the MgFe2O4.

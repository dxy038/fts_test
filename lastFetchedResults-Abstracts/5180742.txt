In this paper, the concept of capacity flexibility is introduced into transit network, and the model of capacity flexibility of urban transit networks is formulated. A heuristic solution based on hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed to the model. GA-LS (Genetic algorithms with Local search) is applied to solve the model. It is also tested by a numerical example with a small transit network. The results show how the maximum additional passenger flows from each origin-destination (OD) pair are determined in a transit network and what extent the transit network supply meets the additional passenger demand in a certain level of service. These results show that the GA-LS method considerably improves the value of the objective function for same iterative times compared with the general GA, but spending more time.

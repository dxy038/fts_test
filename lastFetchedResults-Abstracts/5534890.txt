It is now accepted that photovoltaics is the most promising of the renewable energy sources for electric power generation. PhotovoltaicÂ´s ability to provide reliable, high grade energy over an extended lifetime is now well proven in both space and terrestrial applications. Widespread adoption of this clean, silent power source, however, still awaits the achievement of a number of outstanding technical and economic objectives. Extensive research into photovoltaic technology over the last two decades has done enough to conclude that all these goals can be met. The present challenge is to apply these results industrially and commercially so as to make the dream and reality. Photovoltaics can only provide an efficient service to its users if it provides a transparent and trouble free source of electricity. This involves the application of photovoltaic devices in well integrated systems which also include appropriate mechanical and electrical interfaces. The author focuses on one part of the system-the photovoltaic generator itself. This paper reviews the status of international developments and the contributions which they can make in achieving this objective

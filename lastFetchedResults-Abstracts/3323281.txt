The aim of this paper is to develop the design of a sensor and improve its characteristics by using the control theory. The sensor studied is a gyrometer. The gyrometer is an angular velocity sensor used for the design of the instruments of navigation for aeronautics. Its principle is based on the detection of Coriolis accelerations introduced by the mechanical vibrations. This sensor brings into mechanical phenomena (vibrations of a resonator) and electromagnetic (excitation and detection of these vibrations). The objective of the controller applied to this system is to guarantee the stability of the sensor. The main objective is to respect the PID structure of real time implementation. To solve this problem, this paper proposes to use a methodology based on LMI.

Objective : The relation of the mean age at natural menopause with socio-demographic factors was calculated among women in Shiraz. The data were obtained from a population-based cross sectional study carried out in the year 2000.
Materials and methods: Interviews were carried out and observation made on 948 women who had undergone a natural menopause, chosen randomly using postal zones housing framework.
Results: The mean age at menopause in this population was 48.3 + 5.3 year (95% CI : 47.97-48.62) with a median of 49 years. Groups of women with an average early menopause were those who never married (44.7 years, P<0.006), with low income level (47.4 years, P<0.002), low social class (45.8 years, P<0.000), tobacco use (47.9 years, P<0.014) and non consanguine husband (48.1 years, P<0.028).
Conclusion : This phenomenon must be documented in Iran because of its strong links with morbidity and mortality of the growing number of women who are reaching advanced ages and whose survival is calculated at a quarter century after menopause. The effects of genetic factors on the age of natural menopause are documented in the literature, however, we conclude that the age of natural menopause is affected by Socio-demographic factors.

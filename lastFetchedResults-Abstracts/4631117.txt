This paper reports on a study undertaken within the CEPT SE42 project team with the objective of evaluating the impact of adjacent-channel interference from TDD terminal stations (TSs) to FDD TSs in the 2.6 GHz band. The results confirm that the effects of TS-to-TS interference are very modest, even in high-density hot-spot scenarios, if the TS out-of-block emissions comply with a block-edge mask (BEM) baseline limit of -15.5 dBm/(5 MHz). In carrying out this analysis we have taken into account of interference experienced as a result of finite adjacent-channel interference ratios, inter-modulation products, and saturation effects.

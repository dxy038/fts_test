[Objective] This paper focuses on analyzing the energy resources and precipitation trends to the context of global warming in the western Liaoning Province in recent 60 years, where located in the northern hemisphere. Provide the basis study for the adjustment of agricultural structure and full use of energy resources. [Method] Use meteorological data of three cities in western Liaoning Province during 60 years, applying the conventional method of mathematical statistics to analysis the climate change rate in western Liaoning in recent years. [Results]: In the past 60 years, the annual average temperature and accumulated temperature &#8805;0&#176;C showed significant increasing trend in the western Liaoning, and the annual average temperature increase in the range of 1.3~2.2&#176;C, the accumulated temperature &#8805;0&#9633; increase in the range of 336~390&#176;C, Significant reduction trend in the annual precipitation, the decrease in the range of 59.3mm~83.7mm, And inter-generational scale of 10 years fluctuate markedly. [Conclusion]: Temperatures, precipitation decreases due to the climate warming and drying trend in Western Liaoning Province, which have an enormous impact the development of agriculture in western Liaoning. Warming has brought favorable conditions for agricultural restructuring, increased multiple cropping index, the late-maturing cultivated limit varieties northward, and the agricultural facilities rapid development. At the same time, the increase of temperature promote the development of pests and diseases, and also promote the evaporation temperature, precipitation, reduction, drought increased, agricultural production and environmental degradation, and promote the instability of food production increased in the western Liaoning Province. In order to deal with climate change, the study suggest that, reform of agricultural varieties, adjusting the layout of agriculture, cultivation, introduction of plant populations and strong- drought, improve farmland capital construction, and vigorously promote weather modification, develop cloud water resources to enhance the use efficiency of rainfall.

In the supply chain management of auto aftermarket, companies strive to manage inventory with low cost while maintaining a reasonable order fulfillment rate. To achieve this objective, a critical issue is to predict the demand for auto parts with high accuracy.

The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated with a case study of an auto 4s shop in Shanghai.

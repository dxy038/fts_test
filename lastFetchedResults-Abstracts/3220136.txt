Pitch prediction in time domain is of great importance to improve the coding quality of speech. In this paper, we propose a method of frequency-domain pitch prediction for the full band ITU-T G.719 codec. The results of both the objective and the subjective evaluation show that the proposed method achieves higher reconstructed quality for the speech signal than the original method, especially for the lower coding rates.

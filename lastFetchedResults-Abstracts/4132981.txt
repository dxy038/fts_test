A bidirectional wavelength-selective optical isolator that has opposite isolation directions for two interleaved sets of optical wavelengths is described. It was realised by inserting an adequate retarder in a polarisation independent optical isolator configuration. The insertion loss and extinction ratio of the demonstrated device were 1.6 and 22 dB, respectively, for a channel spacing of 0.8 nm

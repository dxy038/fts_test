Ganoderma lucidum belongs to Ganodermataceae family and is a famous
medicinal fungus with medicinal properties like antidiabetic, antihypertension,
immunomodulating, antiviral and antibacterial effects.
Objective: Due to its great medicinal effect and lack of investigation on Iranian species, this
study was performed.
Methods: In this study, we have investigated antibacterial activity of aqueous extract at four
concentrations (50, 125, 250, 500 mg ml) against 3 standard Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus
subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Entrococcus fecalis) and 2 standard Gram negative bacteria
(Pseudomonas aeroginosa and Escherichia coli) by using Disk diffusion method. Total
polysaccharide of the aqueous extract and sugar composition were analyzed by phenol
sulfuric acid method and GC/MS, respectivelyThe results indicated that the aqueous extract had antibacterial effect against
Pseudomonas aeroginosa at concentration of 500 mg ml-1. The polysaccharide content was
37.751 mg g-1 and the monosaccharideâ€™s constituents were identified.
Conclusion: Based on this finding the fungus contains a great amount of polysaccharides
that can be use for medicinal properties, but it is not recommended for antibacterial usage
according to its weak inhibitory activity.

Objective We sought to obtain an overview
of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) practice in
Bakirkoy Research and Training Hospital for Psychiatric
and Neurological Diseases, which is the biggest
hospital for psychiatry in Turkey. Method From
1st January 2006 to 30th June 2007, a form enquiring
about evaluation of ECT was filled retrospectively.
Results The total number of patients, admitted for
psychiatry during the survey period was 265,283. A
total of 1,531 patients (12.4% among inpatients and
0.58% in all psychiatric admissions) received 13,618
sessions (including multiple hospitalizations) of
ECT from 12,341 psychiatric inpatients during the
survey period. Ninety-eight patients had multiple
hospitalizations. The male-to-female ratio was 1.26–1.
Patients with bipolar affective disorder, current
episode manic with or without psychotic symptoms
received ECT most frequently (30.3%), followed by
patients with schizophrenia (29.5%), severe depressive
episode with or without psychotic symptoms
(include bipolar affective disorder current episode
severe depression) (15.2%), other non-organic psychotic
disorders (14.4%), schizoaffective disorders
(6.3%), mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive
substance abuse with psychotic disorders
(3.5%) and catatonic schizophrenia (0.7%). Patients
who received ECT were in age group of 25–44 years
(64.7%), followed by 45–64 years (17.7%), 18–24 years
(15.4%), 65 years and older (1.4%), and younger than
18 years (0.8%). All patients received modified ECT.
There were no ECT-related deaths during the survey.
Conclusion The rate of ECT among all psychiatric
inpatients during the survey period was 12.4%. The
majority of patients who received ECT were diagnosed
with bipolar affective disorder-current episode
manic and schizophrenia. ECT training programs for
psychiatry residents and specialists should be planned,
and conducted systematically.

This paper introduces Hybrid MLI as UPQC and the proposed UPQC utilizes Synchronous Reference Frame Theory as control strategy to generate reference signal. The main objective of this paper is to implement hybrid MLI as UPQC to regulate voltage sag under nonlinear balanced and unbalanced constraints as well as to compensate the harmonics, reactive and negative sequence currents. The analysis and performance are examined using MATLAB/Simulink platform.

The objective of this research was to devise a method of accurately and consistently locating both the dicrotic notch and the systolic peak from the arterial blood pressure signal for a range of heart rates, arrhythmias and irregular pressure waveforms. The pressure signal has been analyzed by applying the dyadic wavelet transform at several scales to the derivative of the waveform. Simultaneous occurrences of peaks in the magnitudes of the dyadic wavelet transform across several consecutive dyadic scales indicates a transient in the pressure waveform, from which the corresponding temporal location of the dicrotic notch is determined. A final algorithm analyzes the transform results and labels the locations of the dicrotic notch points as well as the systolic peaks

The objective of our work is to develop a measurement-based feedback system can enhance the ability to achieve coating microstructure, compensate for process variations (disturbances) and improve the capability of transferring process recipes to different systems. Successful development of an appropriate control structure (i.e. selection and connection of measurements to specific inputs), however, requires an explicit understanding of the process dynamics.

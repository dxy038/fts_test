This paper presents a comparative analysis of electronic ballast topologies that supply high intensity discharge (HID) lamps with a low frequency symmetrical square waveform. The analyzed topologies are based on the same technique of using two bidirectional DC/DC converters connected to the lamp in a differential way. This technique makes possible to obtain a low frequency output voltage, in spite of the high frequency switching operation of each DC/DC converter.

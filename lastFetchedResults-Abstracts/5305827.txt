This paper discusses a novel approach to developing a power conversion system (PCS) for distributed energy resources (DER). Many DER require the use of a PCS to develop useable electricity from an energy source. By reducing the cost of the PCS, significant overall DER cost reduction occurs that can result in increased DER penetration. The paper discusses various aspects of the design including inverter topology, power, control and power supply circuit designs, switching and protection equipment and thermal considerations. The critical objective of this PCS design is to reduce cost through modularity, novel thermal and packaging concepts and use of a low loss inverter technology

Rogowski coil is one of the popular current transducers for measuring currents either in the sinusoidal form or in the form of high-frequency pulses. In this study, first, the performance of the Rogowski coil is investigated through comprehensive experiments to be formed as a design methodology. Then, the results create a base for proposing two systematic approaches for designing Rogowski coils. The first approach is a knowledge-based approach and the second one involves a heuristic search method which results in optimum design according to the selected objective function, considering the practical limits in the physical parameters. The proposed design procedures cover Rogowski coils which measure large sinusoidal currents for power system protection purposes and also those for measuring impulsive currents with large as well as low peaks.

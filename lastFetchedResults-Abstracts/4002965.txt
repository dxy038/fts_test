The objective of this paper is to reduce the concept of a digital computer program to an analogous sampled-data control system, which can then be studied and analyzed by established theories and simulated on an analog computer. In this connection, the convergence and the rate of convergence of various programs are established by observing the stability and the transient response on an analog computer.

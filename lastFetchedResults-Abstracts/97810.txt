The objective of this paper is to analyze the dynamics of distribution systems that contain fuel cells and to enhance the stability of these systems by controlling the fuel cells. The models used in this second part of the two-part paper are the solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) models developed in part one. The fuel-cell control loops through the power conditioning units are first explained using a one-machine infinite bus system. Then, fuel cells are integrated into a power distribution test system, which initially contains gas turbines only. Simulation results show how a combination of fuel cells and gas turbines can help control frequency fluctuations, and supply power after islanding of the distribution system.

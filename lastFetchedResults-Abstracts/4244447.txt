Personalized learning is a critical issue in the e-learning field. In the process of developing personalized learning environments, it is necessary to consider various factors for personalized mechanism, in which the factor is used to identify the learner individuality and serves as a reference for providing e-learning materials. Hence, this paper uniformly formulates various factors into multi-objective functions, and enhances genetic algorithm (GA) to configure personalized e-courses for individual learners. To validate the practicability of the proposed approach, we investigate the achievements of students in actual learning environments. The investigated results show that: The learning achievements of the students whom are provided personalized e-courses are better than the students whom are provided a conventional uniform e-course.

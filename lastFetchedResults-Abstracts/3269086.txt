This paper presents an improved optimal power flow (OPF) model in large-scale power system incorporating wind power. In order to integrate the wind uncertainty into this model, the Weibull distribution of forecasted wind speed, a nonlinear wind power curve expression and the opportunity cost that quantifies wind uncertainty into objective function are proposed. Meanwhile, considering the safety requirement, the up and down spinning reserve constraints are added into this model. The primal-dual interior point method is employed to implement this OPF model. The modified IEEE 118 system and a practical Polish 3120 system are used to verify the feasibility of the proposed model and solution method.

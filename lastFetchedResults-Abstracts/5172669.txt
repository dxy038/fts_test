The router buffer sizing problem has been identified recently as an important problem in networking research. Contrary to static proposals and rules of thumb recent efforts have been attempting to develop simple practical algorithms for dynamic queue size management, where the problem is defined on a heuristic optimization basis and the objective is to track a volatile optimum point by continuously tuning at runtime the buffer queue size. In this paper we propose a robust extremum control solution to the problem. Furthermore we evaluate the efficiency of the optimization approach, the practical limitations and the problematic issues of the real implementation. The analysis is based on a plethora of data collected from several representative Ns-2 simulation experiments.

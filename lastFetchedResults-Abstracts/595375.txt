Objective: To determine serum lipid profile in controlled and uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetics and to know statistically significant differences in serum lipid profile between these two groups. Material and Methods: During study period, 100 Type 2 DM patients, 50 each having good glycemic control (HbA1c < 7%) and poor glycemic control (HbA1c > 8.2%) were selected on the basis of convenient purposive sampling technique. Brachial venous blood samples were collected for fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c and serum lipid profile from all subjects in the morning after 12 hours fast at presentation in out doors at CMH Kohat laboratory. Their dyslipidemia was compared with reference to glycemic control in type 2 Diabetics. Results: Out of 100 patients, 72%, were males and 28% females. The mean age of group 1 was 51.06 and group 2 was 52.86 and total mean of 100 patients was 51.96 with a standard deviation + 7.82 years. Mean total cholesterol was 4.38±1.09 mmol/L in group 1 versus 5.95±1.27 mmol/L in group 2 (P=0.001). Mean Triglycerides were 2.13-±0.74 mmol/L in group 1 versus 3.11±1.00 mmol/L in group 2 (P=0.001). Mean LDL-C was 2.34±0.95 mmol/L in group 1 versus 3.53 ±1.09 mmol/L in group 2 (P=0.001). Mean HDL cholesterol was 1.06-±0.007 mmol/L in group 1 versus 0.99 ±0.008 mmol/L in group 2 (P=0.002). Conclusion: In Type 2 DM patients good glycemic control is associated with statistically significant differences in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-C and HDL-C.

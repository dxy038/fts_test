In this paper, cuckoo search optimization based Fuzzy Logic PD Controller for inverted pendulum is presented. The PD type Fuzzy Logic Controller parameters are determine using nature inspired cuckoo search optimization technique. These controller parameters are used to stabilize the inverted pendulum and give the desired response. The objective function of this controller is taken as sum of the integral square error (ISE) and maximum overshoot. The simulation results showed the desire performance and result has been compared with some other standard technique proposed in the past research such as improved particle swarm optimization for the tracking control of the inverted pendulum.

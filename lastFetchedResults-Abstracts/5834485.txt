The growth of technology is increasing day by day to fulfill the human needs. The proposed system is implemented to make human work easier. ANPR is an image processing technology which uses number plate to identify the vehicle. The objective is to design an efficient automatic authorized vehicle identification system by using the vehicle number plate. The system is implemented on the entrance of a highly restricted areas for security e.g. Parliament, military zones, Supreme Court etc. The proposed algorithm consists of four major parts: vehicle detection, extraction of plate region, classification of a vehicle and recognition of plate characters. For vehicle detection moving object detecting algorithm is used. For extracting the plate region smearing algorithm and segmentation are used. The alpha numeric characters are recognized by using OCR. The resulting data is then used to compare with the database so as to come up with the specific information like the vehicleÂ´s owner, place of registration, address, etc. The system is implemented and simulated in Mat lab, and its performance is tested on a real image.

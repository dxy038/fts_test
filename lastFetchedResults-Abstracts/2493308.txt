The uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of intact rocks is an important geotechnical parameter
required for designing geotechnical and mining engineering projects. Obtaining accurate estimates of
the rock mass UCS parameter throughout a 3D geological model of the deposit is vital for determining
optimum rock slope stability, designing new exploratory and blast boreholes, mine planning,
optimizing the production schedule and even designing the crusherâ€™s feed size. The main objective of
this paper is to select the preferred estimator of the UCS parameter based on accuracy performance
using all the available geological-geotechnical data at the Sarcheshmeh copper deposit, located 160
km southwest of Kerman City, in south-eastern Iran. In this paper, an attempt is made to estimate the
spatial distribution of the UCS parameter using commonly-used statistical-structural and geostatistical
methods. In order to achieve the aim of the current study, the UCS parameter was measured along
with other qualitative geological properties, including the rock type, weathering, alteration type and
intensity of core samples taken from 647 boreholes. The 3D distribution of the UCS parameter is
obtained using different algorithms including statistical-structural (the nearest-neighbour technique),
linear (ordinary Kriging) and nonlinear (indicator Kriging) geostatistical methods. After estimating the
UCS parameter at block centres using the above-mentioned methods, the performance of each method
is compared and validated through 21 set aside borehole data. The assessment of selecting best
estimator of UCS parameter is based on scatter plots of the observed versus estimated data plus the
root mean square error (RMSE) statistics of the differences between observed and estimated values for
21 set aside borehole data. Finally, due to the special characteristics of the UCS spatial variability, it is
concluded that the nearest-neighbour method is the most appropriate method for estimating the UCS
parameter in porphyry copper deposits.

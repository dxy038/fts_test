The Feature Selective Validation (FSV) Method was originally developed as a standard technique to mimic an expertÂ´s opinion of concurrence between CEM and measurement datasets. It has recently expanded as a method to quantify agreement between various types of datasets. This paper presents a comparison of measurements obtained from different antenna positions in an overmoded cavity. Based on the field distributions within the usable area of the reverberation chamber these datasets should appear statistically similar. The objective is to present a credible evaluation of the FSV method using standard reverberation chamber theory.

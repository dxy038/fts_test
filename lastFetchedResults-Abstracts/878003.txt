We introduce a symmetric dual pair for a class of nondifferentiable multi-objective fractional variational
problems. Weak, strong, converse and self duality relations are established under certain invexity assumptions.
The paper includes extensions of previous symmetric duality results for multi-objective fractional
variational problems obtained by Kim, Lee and Schaible [D.S. Kim, W.J. Lee, S. Schaible, Symmetric duality
for invex multiobjective fractional variational problems, J. Math. Anal. Appl. 289 (2004) 505–521]
and symmetric duality results for the static case obtained by Yang,Wang and Deng [X.M. Yang, S.Y.Wang,
X.T. Deng, Symmetric duality for a class of multiobjective fractional programming problems, J. Math.
Anal. Appl. 274 (2002) 279–295] to the dynamic case.

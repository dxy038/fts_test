An architectural framework is studied that can perform dynamic reconfiguration. A basic objective is to dynamically reconfigure the architecture so that its configuration is well matched with the current computational requirements. The reconfigurable resources of the architecture are partitioned into N slots. The configuration bits for each slot are provided through a connection to one of N independent busses, where each bus can select from among K configurations for each slot. Increasing the value of K can increase the number of configurations that the architecture can reach, but at the expense of more hardware complexity to construct the busses. Our study reveals that it is often possible for the architecture to closely track ideal desired configurations even when K is relatively small (e.g., two or four). The input configurations to the collection of busses are defined as steering vectors; thus, there are K steering vectors, each having N equal sized partitions of configuration bits. A combinatorial approach is introduced for designing steering vectors that enables the designer to evaluate trade-offs between performance and hardware complexity associated with the busses.

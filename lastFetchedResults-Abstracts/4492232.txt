It is now well known that the prediction of intermodulation distortions at the system level using the AM-AM and AM-PM characteristics of power amplifiers may be of very poor accuracy if amplifiers exhibit nonlinear low frequency dispersion effects (memory effects). This paper presents a new cost effective method for computing the noise power ratio (NPR) of power amplifiers at the circuit level, hence providing a more accurate prediction and the possibility to include the NPR as a direct optimisation objective in the design of amplifiers. The method is particularly well suited to the design of high efficiency solid state power amplifiers.

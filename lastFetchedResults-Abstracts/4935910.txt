We implement the convolutional interleavers into MPEG-4 image transmission systems for the Rician fading channels. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the performance differences between applying the convolutional interleavers and our previously designed random interleavers. The simulation results show some improvement on the PSNR performance of about 1.4-5 dB for the case of the slow fading channels.

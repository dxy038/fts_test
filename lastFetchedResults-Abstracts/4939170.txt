The problem of jamming plays a very important role in ensuring the quality and security of wireless communications, especially now when wireless networks are quickly becoming ubiquitous. Since jamming phenomenon can be considered as a game where a player (jammer) is playing against a user (transmitter), game theory is an appropriate tool for dealing with the jamming problem. In this paper we study how increasing number of jammers impacts the game. Namely, we consider plots with one and two jammers and as an objective function to the user we consider SINR. We show that in all the scenarii the jammers equalize the quality of the best sub-carriers for transmitter on as low level as their power constraint allows, meanwhile the user distributes his power among these jamming sub-carriers and in two jammer case the jammers employ time sharing strategies to bring the maximal harm.

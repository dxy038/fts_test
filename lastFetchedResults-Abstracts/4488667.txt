This paper presents the development of a compliant motion controller for robotic manipulators by using the armature current of its motors for a local work space. For this purposes we use the mathematical model of the brushless motor of the robot. The main objective is to develop algorithms for compliant motion control without the need for other than internal sensors, like displacement transducers and current sensors of motors. Additionally, a reduced robot model is presented which is sufficient for this purpose.

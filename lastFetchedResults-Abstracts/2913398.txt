The author briefly discusses the evolution and development of rural telecommunications in Zimbabwe. In particular, the author highlights the experiences in the implementation and operation of multiaccess radio systems (MARS). Zimbabwe is a developing country which has embarked on a comprehensive development strategy to overcome the development bias of urbanisation by stimulating development of the rural areas. The experience gained in implementing MARS projects has reshaped Zimbabwe Posts and Telecommunication CorporationÂ´s approach to implementation and management of projects in the rural areas. In realising projects of this nature, the concepts have changed from only focusing on technical aspects, to include all other aspects such as back-up service, centralised monitoring and management. This is part of an on-going programme with the ultimate objective or providing high quality telecommunication service to the entire rural population

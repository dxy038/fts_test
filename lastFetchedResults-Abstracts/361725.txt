Study Objective: Video imaging of intubation as seen by the laryngoscopist has not been a part of traditional instruction methods, and its potential impact on novice intubation success rates has not been evaluated. Methods: We prospectively tracked the success rates of novice intubators in paramedic classes who were required to watch a 26-minute instructional videotape made with a direct laryngoscopy imaging system (video group). We compared the prospectively obtained intubation success rate of the video group against retrospectively collected data from prior classes of paramedic students (traditional group) in the same training program. All classes received the same didactic airway instruction, same mannequin practice time, same paramedic textbook, and were trained in the same operating room with the same teaching staff. Results: The traditional group (n=113, total attempts 783) had a mean individual intubation success rate of 46.7% (95% confidence interval 42.2% to 51.3%). The video group (n=36, total attempts 102) had a mean individual intubation success rate of 88.1% (95% confidence interval 79.6% to 96.5%). The difference in mean intubation success rates between the 2 groups was 41.4% (95% confidence interval 31.1% to 50.7%, P<.0001). The 2 groups did not differ in respect to age, male sex, or level of education. Conclusion: An instructional videotape made with the direct laryngoscopy video system significantly improved the initial success rates of novice intubators in an operating room setting.

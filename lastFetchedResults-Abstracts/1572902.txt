We propose two flow control algorithms for networks with multiple paths between each sourceâ€“destination pair. Both are distributed algorithms over the network to maximize aggregate source utility. Algorithm 1 is a first order Lagrangian method applied to a modified objective function that has the same optimal solution as the original objective function but has a better convergence property. Algorithm 2 is based on the idea that, at optimality, only paths with the minimum price carry positive flows, and naturally decomposes the overall decision into flow control (determines total transmission rate based on minimum path price) and routing (determines how to split the flow among available paths). Both algorithms can be implemented as simply a source-based mechanism in which no link algorithm nor feedback is needed. We present numerical examples to illustrate their behavior.

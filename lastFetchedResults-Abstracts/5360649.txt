Closed circuit television (CCTV) is an essential element of visual surveillance for intelligent transportation systems. The primary objective of a CCTV camera is to provide surveillance of freeway/highway segments or intersections and visual confirmation of incidents. CCTV is becoming more popular in major metropolitan areas around the USA. Since full coverage of all freeways or all intersections in an urban area would be cost-prohibitive, siting of CCTV cameras needs to be determined strategically based on a number of factors. This paper addresses these factors based on design experience in locating over 100 cameras on freeways and surface streets in California, with suggested guidelines for camera site selection. The preliminary and final camera site selection process is discussed. The innovative design and operation of the CCTV video van which is used in the video survey is also discussed as an alternative to bucket truck surveys

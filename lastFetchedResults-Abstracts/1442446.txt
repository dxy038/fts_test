The effect of addition of vitamin E (2025 IU animal−1 day−1) to the diet of beef bulls on the colour stability and lipid oxidation of minced beef was studied. Control and enriched diets were provided for the last 136 days before slaughter. Batches of freshly minced meat were prepared containing approximately 1.3 and 22.2 wt% fat, respectively. Half of the samples of minced meat from control (CON) and supplemented (SUP) beef were packaged on trays with oxygen-permeable over wraps and half in modified atmosphere (MA) packs (initial gas mixture: O2/CO2/N2=65/25/10). The minced beef was stored for 10 days at 7°C in an illuminated environment. The SUP meat at both fat levels was consistently more resistant to lipid oxidation than was the CON meat. The additional vitamin E had a greater anti-oxidant effect for the lean meat product. MA packaging in comparison to the oxygen-permeable foil over-wrap did increase lipid oxidation, the effect being most pronounced for the CON meat. A sensory panel considered the colour of the lean SUP meat during display as more attractive than that of lean CON meat, irrespective of packaging. A similar effect was observed occasionally for the relatively fat minced meat. These subjective findings were confirmed by objective assessment of colour. The stability of the colour of the MA packed meat was better than that of the oxygen-permeable foil-wrapped meat. Microbial growth patterns of enriched and control meat were similar. MA packaging retards the multiplication of mesophilic aerobic spoilage micro-organisms and Enterobacteriaceae.

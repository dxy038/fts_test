In this paper, we describe the progress toward the development of miniaturized imaging systems with applications in medical imaging, and specifically, detection of pre-cancer. The focus of the article is a miniature, optical-sectioning, fluorescence microscope. The miniature microscope is constructed from lithographically printed optics and assembled using a bulk micro-machined silicon microoptical table. Optical elements have been printed in a negative tone hybrid glass to a maximum depth of 59 &#956;m and an rms surface roughness between 10-45 nm, fulfilling the requirements of the miniature microscope. Test optical elements have been assembled using silicon-spring equipped mounting slots. The design of silicon springs is presented in this paper. Optical elements can be assembled within the tolerances of an NA=0.4 miniature microscope objective, confirming the concept of simple, zero-alignment assembly

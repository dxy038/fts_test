This paper formulates a multi objective zero-one course scheduling model. Through an optimization procedure, the model seeks to maximize faculty preferences to courses and times. The model seeks to assign faculty members to courses and to allocate courses to time-blocks simultaneously. The core of the procedure is formed by a matrix, with rows divided into three sections indicating course priorities (first priority in the first line, second priority in the second line, and third priority in the third line); and with letters indicating priorities for a specific time-block (“a” for first choice, “b” for second choice, and “c” for third choice). The paper then describes application of the model to the Department of Statistics, College of Business and Economics at the United Arab Emirates University. The results of the application demonstrate the model's capability to provide an assignment that satisfies departmental policies and procedures with regard to course offerings, as well as recognizing the personal preferences of the faculty for teaching particular courses during certain time-blocks.

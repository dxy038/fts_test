For evaluation of commercial vehicle steering characteristics, by analyzing the steering dynamic characteristics of commercial vehicle, this paper use the &#8220;speed - lateral acceleration&#8221; feature field map method to select the representative and independent performance indices, which could fully describe the vehicle steering performance, and match the relevant test conditions for every index. So a simple and efficient objective evaluation method for steering performance of heavy commercial vehicle is established. Three vehicles are carried out real field test, and the experimental data are compared and analyzed. The results show that the selected indicators could fully reflect the steering dynamical performance of heavy commercial vehicle.

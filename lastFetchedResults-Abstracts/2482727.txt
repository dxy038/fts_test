Objective: Organophosphorus (OP) compounds are used to control pests, however they
can reach the food chain and enter the human body causing serious health problems by
means of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition and oxidative stress (OS). Among the
OPs, chlorpyrifos (CHP), malathion (MAL), and diazinon (DIA) are commonly used for
commercial extermination purposes, in addition to veterinary practices, domestic, agriculture
and public health applications. Two new recently registered medicines that contain
selenium and other antioxidants, IMOD and angipars (ANG), have shown beneficial effects
for OS related disorders. This study examines the effect of selenium-based medicines
on toxicity of three common OP compounds in erythrocytes.
Materials and Methods: In the present experimental study, we determined the efficacy
of IMOD and ANG on OS induced by three mentioned OP pesticides in human
erythrocytes in vitro. After dose-response studies, AChE, lipid peroxidation (LPO),
total antioxidant power (TAP) and total thiol molecules (TTM) were measured in erythrocytes
after exposure to OPs alone and in combined treatment with IMOD or ANG.
Results: AChE activity, TAP and TTM reduced in erythrocytes exposed to CHP, MAL
and DIA while they were restored in the presence of ANG and IMOD. ANG and IMOD
reduced the OPs-induced elevation of LPO.
Conclusion: The present study shows the positive effects of IMOD and ANG in reduction
of OS and restoration of AChE inhibition induced by CHP, MAL and DIA in
erythrocytes in vitro.

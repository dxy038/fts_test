It is a very well-known fact that calculations necessary to analyze transient conditions in hydraulic systems are very time-consuming and difficult to organize, especially in complex systems. Nevertheless, such calculations are necessary to achieve efficiency and economy in the design and operation, as well as safety in these systems, since those objectives need precise calculations of pressures and flowrates. Suitable mathematical modeling of the different elements in a hydraulic system is necessary to get useful results, which help fulfill those objectives. In this paper, the mathematical model described in [1] is generalized to complex pressurized hydraulic systems. To model the behavior of the fluid within the ducts, use is made of the so-called elastic model, which is numerically solved by the methods of characteristics. Nevertheless, the main objective of this paper hinges on the treatment of the boundary conditions that allow developing a general model virtually representing every combination of elements at a given location of the system. The final objective is to provide the users with a powerful tool to devise the potential risks to which an installation may be exposed and to develop suitable protection strategies.

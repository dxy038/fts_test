High voltage composite insulators are being accepted increasingly for use in outdoor installations. This research work aims at assessing the experimental performance of the two types of polymeric composite insulators being prepared for use in high voltage overhead transmission and distribution networks. Experimental investigations were carried out to study the effect of ultraviolet radiations as well as heat on the performance of composite insulators simulating the environmental conditions of Central region of Saudi Arabia. To achieve this objective, modified accelerated aging test was performed as per IEC standard 61109 to simulate the field aging of the polymeric insulators and compared various electrical and optical tests results of the laboratory aged insulators with new ones. The results will help in assessing the performance and suitability of polymeric insulators for their applications in Saudi Arabia

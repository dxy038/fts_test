This paper describes the general multi-platform reconnaissance or information gathering task. It is shown that the general problem must be solved in a centralised manner using information supplied by every platform. However, if for a specific problem the objective function is partially separable it is shown the optimal control problem can be solved in a decentralised fashion for an arbitrary sized group. This is demonstrated for scenarios with Gaussian probabilities and an indoor mapping problem

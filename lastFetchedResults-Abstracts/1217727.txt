ABSTRACT

Background and Objective: Admission in intensive cardiac care units (CCU) is potentially a stressful event that pain and physiological disorders of patients due to acute illness, with secondary affective disorders, may lead to the CCU syndrome or delirium. This study examined the impact of multifactorial interventions on the incidence of delirium in patients hospitalized to intensive cardiac care units in Shiraz, Iran.
Materials and Method: In this study, a clinical trial was carried out on 120 patients (who were divided into two intervention and control groups) admitted to CCU of Shiraz’s hospitals, during 4 months, in 2012. In the Intervention group, patients were allowed to listen to the radio and also family visits outside the visiting hours. And patients in the control group received the normal and routine CCU cares. During interventions cognitive impairment in samples assessed by using mini-mental state examination (MMSE), twice a day, and suspected cases, for incidence of delirium, confirmed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) criteria. Data analysis was done by descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests.  
Results: Given the only incidence rate of 0.8% in control group, there was no statistically significant difference compared with the intervention group (P = 0.315). However, the results showed a significant increase in cognitive scores in the intervention group after interventions (26.58 ± 3.46) compared with pre-intervention phase (24.70 ± 3.74) and with the control group (24.72 ± 3.72), (P = 0.003).
Conclusion: The applied intervention in this study did not affect on delirium incidence rate but considering the increasing of mean cognitive scores, it can be applied as a non-pharmacological and safe method in CCU patients to prevent incidence of delirium.

In the new trend of high performance motors with highly sophisticated engines and low emission control systems, the data transfer for normal service maintenance and repairs has increased to such a complex level that it requires dedicated computer systems. The proposed basic portable computer design involves normal signal measurements like voltage, resistance, temperature and revolutions per minute of the crankshaft, and the on-board computer data stream acquisition. The objective is a simple device, which is upgradeable and capable of managing the data acquisition (DAQ), of different signals generated by the system and the transfer of information from the actual point of activity to a remote location using the existing communication systems - like serial through a local phone line or DSL. The study presents a simple system design, which is based on an analog-digital signal-processing component, which acts as a DAQ, a microcontroller and a modem that is used as an interface between the remote system and the central data service.

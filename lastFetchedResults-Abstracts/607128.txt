Objective: Objective of this study was to the effect of repeated bouts of eccentric exercise on some of  Functional markers of Delayed onset muscle soreness.
Methodology: 30 college males with mean age of 21.2, were selected and were divided into two groups randomly. Both groups performed five sets (10 repetitions per set ) of the eccentric contractions , at 85% of one repetition maximum (1- RM), Experimental group repeated this exercise 48h later. Range of motion at elbow joint Circumference of  nondominant elbow and Muscle soreness  were recorded before, after, 24, 48, 72, 96 (hr) after eccentric contractions.
Statistical Result: The repeated bout of eccentric exercise do not show any effects on Range of motion at elbow joint and Muscle soreness values in Experimental group and show significant increase on Circomference of nondominant elbow in both groups (p >  0.05).
Discussion: The results of this study suggest that the repeated bout of eccentric exercise produces an adaptation such that the muscle is more resistant to damage from a subsequent bout of exercise.

So their cigarette smoking prevalence was stimated to be 27.2% (CI 95%: 23.5%-31.1%).
The prevalence of smoking among teachers was not different in different educational districts (P=0.13). Also, there was no statistical difference between the prevalence of smoker born in Tehran and elsewhere (P=0.18). In addition, type of employment and smoking status were not associated (P=0.25).

Research regarding supply chain optimization has been performed for a long time. However, itÂ´s only in the last decade that the research community has started to investigate multi-objective optimization for supply chains. Supply chains are in general complex networks composed of autonomous entities whereby multiple performance measures in different levels, which in most cases are in conflict with each other, have to be taken into account. In this paper, we present a literature review of existing multi-objective optimization applications, both analytical-based and simulation-based, in supply chain management publications. Based on the literature review, the need for research in a multi-objective and multi-level optimization framework for supply chain management is proposed. Such a framework considers not only the optimization of the overall supply chain, but also for each entity within the supply chain, in a multi-objective optimization context.

Assembly process planning is a multi-objective optimization problem. Aiming to deal with such a complex multi-objective optimization problem, a new Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with fuzzy evaluating method is constructed in this paper. The optimization model of assembly process planning is established. Several key technology, such as Pareto optimal front, solution ranking method are described. A fuzzy evaluating method for Pareto optimal front is proposed, and GASA (hybrids genetic algorithms and simulated annealing algorithms) optimization strategy is applied in the proposed algorithms. A program, called MOGASA (multi-objective optimization program using GASA algorithms) is developed based on the algorithms to solve assembly process planning problem. A computation example is presented in the paper.

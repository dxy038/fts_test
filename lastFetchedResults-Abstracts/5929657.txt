Motion estimation and compensation is an essential part of existing video coding systems. Compared to the widely used block-matching algorithms (BMA), the mesh-based motion estimation (MME) produces better subjective and objective qualified image sequences in many cases, especially at low bitrates. However, the iterative refinement step of the MME is computationally too expensive. In this paper, we propose a fast MME scheme, which adjusts its interpolation patterns to the motion features of image sequences to achieve higher quality reconstructed results. Experimental results show notable rate-distortion improvement over both the BMA and the conventional non-iterative MME schemes, especially when applied on sequences with medium to high motion activities

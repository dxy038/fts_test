Traditional generation dispatch takes minimum of generation cost as the aim, whereas environmental economic dispatch (EED) would not only consider economic operation, but also consider environmental protection. From the point view of coordinated optimization, this paper discusses EED in interconnection areas. Purchase costs and pollution emissions are simultaneously adopted as objective functions. Setting weight of multi objectives in each sub-area is proposed. According to the principle of power grid decomposition and coordination, each sub-area is optimized simultaneously. Simulation examples show that this strategy would control the sum emission with as small as possible economic losses.

The publications of the Institute are designed to advance effectively the theory and practice of electrical engineering and the allied arts at minimum cost to members. The electrical industry today is highly specialized. To attempt to distribute all of the technical papers in specialized fields to a large membership would not only be prohibitive but wasteful and inefficient. With these views in mind, each of the different types of publications has been planned carefully to bring the most useful material to the greatest number of members. To enhance the usefulness of the service, each publication is reviewed briefly in respect to content and objective together with a statement telling how it may be procured. For those interested in greater detail the publication policy now in effect was announced in ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING for December 1946, pages 576&#8211;8. Reprints of the policy are available on request.

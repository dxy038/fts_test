Background
nction of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is to maintain serum calcium concentration within a narrow physiological range. Two types of mutations have been described: activating that causes hypocalcemia and inactivating, which leads to hypercalcemia. The objective was to assess the effect of CaSR gene A986S polymorphism on the lumbar spine bone mass, calcium metabolism parameters and markers of bone remodeling in hypertensive women.
s
udy included 48 patients (mean age 59 ± 10 years) with mild-to-moderate hypertension, according to JNC VI and who did not present any associated diseases. We determined the following in all patients: Ca, P, Mg, PTHi, 25-vitamin D, 1,25-vitamin D, osteocalcin, deoxypyridinoline in urine, 24-h urine calcium. A bone densitometry of the lumbar spine was also performed. CaSR gene A986S polymorphism was also studied in all patients by PCR.
s
pe frequency was 69% for AA, 27% for AS and 4% for SS, with a prevalence of 82% for allele A and 18% for allele S. Patients with a lack of allele S had lower levels of p (3.5 ± 0.5 vs. 4 ± 0.4, p = .034). No differences in calcium plasma levels, urinary calcium excretion and bone mass were observed.
sions
nd no clinical significance in the parameters studied of the CaSR gene A986S polymorphism in hypertensive women.

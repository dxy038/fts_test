The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that the classical controller is equivalent to a special case of the fuzzy logic controller (FLC). The FLC is basically a piecewise linear controller. Analysis of a mathematical equation for an FLC shows that the resultant output equation is a linear combination of the inputs over different ranges of operations. If the linear combination is the same over all ranges of operation, then the FLC is equivalent to the classical controller

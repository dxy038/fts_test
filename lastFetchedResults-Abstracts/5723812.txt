In order to extend the application of photovoltaic power generation, new integrated solutions with the environment have to be studied and adopted. In the near future, one important solution could be the application of photovoltaic power generator into railway stations. The present paper analyses the possible integration of the power supply of a railway station with photovoltaic panels and the contact line. In order to reduce the environmental impact and limit the use of the ground, the panels are integrated in the shelters using architectonic photovoltaic panels. The study concerns a preliminary technical/economic analysis and the calculation of the surface of the photovoltaic panels necessary for the electrical load supply in relation to the various station typologies as well as considering the possibility or not to sell the energy as defined in the Conto Energia Italian document. The objective of this paper is to provide a preliminary analysis of the cost and benefit of some possible solutions.

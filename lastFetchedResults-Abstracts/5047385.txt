Optimization model of protective actions is discussed in nuclear accidents. Optimizing alternative protective actions is a multi-objective system. On the basis of establishing multi-layer structure, a model in optimizing protective actions in nuclear accidents is developed based on interval analytic hierarchy process (IAHP). The model can make comparisons among alternative protective actions quantified, and the optimum protective action is selected out, which solved the uncertain and fuzzy problem of judgments by experts in nuclear accidents. Case study shows that the optimization result is much more reasonable, impersonal and reliable than subjective judgments, and it could be feasible references for nuclear accidents emergency.

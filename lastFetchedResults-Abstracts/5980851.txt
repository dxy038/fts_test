Due to the complexity of power systems combined with other factors such as increasing susceptibility of equipment, power quality (PQ) is apt to waver. With electricity in growing demand, low PQ is on the rise, the method of resolve those problem about power quality must be considered. In accordance with the familiar PQ problem, such as voltage sag, voltage swell, short interruption of supply voltage, harmonic suppression and short circuit fault. Basing on the H bridge cascade connection method, this paper design a new type regulator for the multiple objective control. Through the simulation software of PSCAD/EMTDC, the device can resume the voltage and restrain the harmonic dynamically and effectively, when there are voltage disturbances in the power system side. This device also could confine the short circuit current to a supportable level, when there is short circuit fault in the load side.

Background: Mother's position during labor has been a major concern for faster, easier and more tolerable birth. In fact, position change during labour be introduced as a solution for dystocia, prolonged labour and labour arrest. Furthermore, pregnancy outcome including the health of fetus and neonate is affected by upright delivery position. Objective: To determino the effect of sitting position on the duration of 2nd stage of labour and neonatal apgar score.
Design: This was a randomized controlled clinical trial. Samples: 100 women were selected consecutively and assigned randomly to one of trail or control group ( 50 in each).
Results: The duration of 2nd stage of labour was significantly lower in case versus comparative group (P=0.01).
The statistical significance wasn't found for the 1st and 5 minutes after birth apgar score in comparison between 2 groups.
Discussion: Although, sitting position was found shorten the 2nd stage of labour in this study, it is suggested that mothers be given the chance to choose their own position of delivery.

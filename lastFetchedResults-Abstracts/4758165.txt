Access network is the important part of Internet. But conventional access technologies do not support well on user management, service providing, authentication and accounting at present. We propose a new IPv6/IPv4 access router, which integrates access aggregation, edge routing and service policy into one box, and supports different services according to different service streams. The service stream table acts as routing table, neighbor address resolving table and access policy table. It can do user authentication and accounting, bidirectional traffic statistics, bidirectional rate control, prepaid traffic limit, access control list and off-line detection.

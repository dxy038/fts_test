The objective of the present research was to explore the effects of combined irrigation and fertilization (fertigation) frequency on growth, yield and uptake of water and nutritional elements by plants. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L., cv. Iceberg) was used as the model plant. Two experiments were conducted in a screen-house: compound fertilizer at a constant N:P:K ratio at different concentrations was used in the first, while in the second the concentration of P varied solely while the concentration of the other nutritional elements was kept constant. The lettuce was planted in pots filled with perlite and irrigated daily with a constant volume of nutrient solution at different frequencies. The major finding in the two experiments was that high fertigation frequency induced a significant increase in yield, mainly at low nutrients concentration level. Yield improvement was primarily related to enhancement of nutrient uptake, especially P. It was suggested that the yield reduction obtained at low frequency resulted from nutrient deficiency, rather than water shortage, and that high irrigation frequency can compensate for nutrient deficiency. Frequent fertigation improved the uptake of nutrients through two main mechanisms: continuous replenishment of nutrients in the depletion zone at the vicinity of root interface and enhanced transport of dissolved nutrients by mass flow, due to the higher averaged water content in the medium. As such, an increase in fertigation frequency enables to reduce the concentrations of immobile elements such as P, K and trace metals in irrigation water, and to lessen the environment pollution by discharge.

The objective of this investigation was to fabricate biocompatible hollow polymer capsules using the layer-by-layer adsorption technique to alternatively adsorb poly(L-lysine)(PLL) and hyaluronic acid (HA) onto a sacrificial template of poly-DL-lactic acid (PLA). The impact of incorporation of hyaluronase, an enzyme which digests HA, on the rate of self-degradation will be discussed.

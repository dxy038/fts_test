This paper presents the application of the adaptive filters for harmonic detection in shunt active power filters. Improve the transient response time of the adaptive filter is the final objective of the strategy. The Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm was used to adjust the coefficients of the adaptive notch filter. An algorithm based on the Clarke Transformation was used to detect the load current amplitude transients and then modify the step-size value. Simulations using Matlab/Simulink are presented to clarify the algorithm. Also practical implementation is performed using the DSP Texas Instruments TMS320F2812 and the experimental results depicted.

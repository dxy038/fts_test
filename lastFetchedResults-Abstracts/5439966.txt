The authors introduce a nonlinear integer programming problem to optimize the planning of telecommunication networks, considering logical and physical aspects. The objective function takes into account the economies of scale associated with the modularity of resources, and the model considers the existing network, as well as reallocation of installed switching and transmission equipment. The main aspect considered is the optimization strategy, composed of logical and physical network design. Emphasis is placed on the use of the constant &#955; to evaluate the number of additional channels to carry the overflow traffic; the alternative routing is previously defined, and the model permits one or ore first-choice routes and the network modularities. The function <e1>B</e1> properties are discussed and algorithms to treat the model are suggested

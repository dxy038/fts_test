This paper presents an extension of the concept of total elimination of crosstalk between signals propagating in multiconductor transmission lines. The assumption is that the crosstalk should be eliminated by proper feeding and matching at the line ends, in the presence of physical coupling between conductors all along the lines. Unlike previous publications on the subject, this paper investigates in detail the influence of configurations of input/output setups including non-ideal sources and bidirectional transmission. The concept is verified using SPICE circuit simulator. It is expected to be useful in various applications including fast interconnects.

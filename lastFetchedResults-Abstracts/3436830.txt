Reversible logic functions can be realized as networks of Toffoli gates. The synthesis of Toffoli networks can be divided into two steps. First, find a network that realizes the desired function. Second, transform the network such that it uses fewer gates, while realizing the same function. This paper addresses the above synthesis approach. We present a basic method and, based on that, a bidirectional synthesis algorithm which produces a network of Toffoli gates realizing a given reversible specification. An asymptotically optimal modification of the basic synthesis algorithm employing generalized mEXOR gates is also presented. Transformations are then applied using template matching. The basis for a template is a network of gates that realizes the identity function. If a sequence of gates in the synthesized network matches a sequence comprised of more than half the gates in a template, then a transformation using the remaining gates in the template can be applied resulting in a reduction in the gate count for the synthesized network. All templates with up to six gates are described in this paper. Experimental results including an exhaustive examination of all 3-variable reversible functions and a collection of benchmark problems are presented. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research.

In this paper, a new and novel method for optimisation of subarray partitioning is presented that is inspired from a biological process. The process is optimised using a recent multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and demonstrated on a 15 &#215; 15 element conformal array antenna. In installed arrays, element gain patterns are affected by mutual coupling and manufacturing tolerances and this optimisation technique takes these changes into account in order to optimise installed performance. Six objectives are used in the MOGA to optimise desired characteristics in the radiation pattern.

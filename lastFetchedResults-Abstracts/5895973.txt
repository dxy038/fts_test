A technique of estimating fisheye camera parameters, which uses three orthogonal vanishing points from one single image of 3D calibration pattern, is presented in this paper. For an image of 3D calibration pattern, three orthogonal vanishing points are firstly calculated using the image of the scene including three groups of parallel lines, whoes directions are different. And then the basic intrinsic parameters of fisheye camera are estimated from three vanishing points. Thus, the distorted model parameters of camera can be refined from the objective function. Finally, rotation matrix between fisheye camera and 3D calibration pattern can be computed from three orthogonal directions on the 3D pattern and their three vanishing points. Experimental results show that this method is simple and feasible.

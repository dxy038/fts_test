A new approach to model the conversational speech quality is proposed in this paper. It has been applied to some conditions of echo and delay tested during a subjective test designed to study the relationship between conversational speech quality and talking, listening and interaction speech qualities. A multiple linear regression analysis is performed on the subjective conversational mean opinion scores (MOS) given by subjects with the talking and listening MOS as predictors. The comparison between estimated and subjective conversational scores show the validity of the proposed approach for the conditions assessed in this subjective test. The subjective talking and listening quality scores are then replaced with objective talking and listening quality scores provided by objective models. This new conversational objective model, feeded by signals recorded during the subjective test, presents a correlation of 0.938 with subjective conversational quality scores in these conditions of impairment.

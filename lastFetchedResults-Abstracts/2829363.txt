Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a well-known design tool used to analyze component failures and identify the resultant effects. Traditional FMEA model requires engineersÂ´ input on estimating technical detection difficulty of part failure. Moreover, failure occurrence can only be computed based on historical maintenance data. However, under the IoT based environment, sensors installed on connected devices can transmit continuous signals of device status, which is greatly helpful to make the device failure analytical work more efficient, more objective and more accurate. In this paper, we propose a new FMEA model based on connected device data. A new failure a difficulty creator is proposed to objectively compute detection difficulty. Failure occurrence level is intelligently generated by a new occurrence creator. A house-roof shaped failure correlation creator is designed to mine the correlation of failures. Finally, a new risk RPN estimation method is used to rank the risk of failure.

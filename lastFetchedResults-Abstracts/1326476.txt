Concrete formwork is a labor-intensive and time-consuming operation. Many modular formwork systems have been developed to automate the process. Such systems improve the productivity as well as the cost-effectiveness of the operation. However, proper planning for the form reuse schemes in the design as well as the construction phases of a building, including resource allocations (modular form sets, cranes, workers, etc.), and the construction sequence, is vital for ensuring a successful use of modular formwork systems. Computer process simulation techniques are employed in this research for the study of different form reuse schemes to use gang forming systems in building construction. Five form reuse schemes are identified. The CYCLONE modeling methodology is employed to develop computer models for each of them. MicroCYCLONE simulations and sensitivity analyses of the schemes, using different numbers of form sets, cranes, and labor crews, are then conducted for a real case to assess their impact on the productivity as well as the cost-effectiveness of the operation. The objective is to better understand the characteristics of different form reuse schemes and, in turn, to produce better plans for gang forming construction. Thus, the application of modular formwork systems in building construction can be facilitated.

The objective of this research is to develop a realtime supervision and control software in the field of tunnel supervision and control. The integrated emergency response system of this software has the ability to organize all the emergency response units to work cooperatively against the emergency. With an expert subsystem embedded, the integrated emergency response system can provide on-line aid to the operators for intelligent decision making and preparation of response plans. The results in actual applications show the system´s good real time performance and fitness in the field of tunnel supervision and control, which can highly reduce the operators´ workload, save lives in time, prevent the potential traffic jam and make the loss minimized in case of an emergency

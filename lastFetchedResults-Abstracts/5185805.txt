This paper addresses the problem of QoE evaluation of multimedia image sequence streaming generated by IP-based security systems and impaired by coding factors and error-prone communication channel. The image quality assessment, communication channels and their performance are of extreme importance in the field of security imaging systems. In this paper, the authors adopt objective quality assessment metrics, in conjunction with a subjective userÂ´s evaluation, to study the perceived quality of image multimedia service generated from IP-based camera security systems and subjected to communication network error conditions - to benchmark a minimal visual object identification level (QoE threshold) on the degraded contents. Network transmission errors are introduced into the generated contents using a simulation tool.

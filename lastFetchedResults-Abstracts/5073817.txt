Based on the RS and statistics methods, the objective of this study is to ascertain the spatial differences of urban land cover conversion of regional land cover with the Landsat TM images of the years 1988 and 2007. This paper illustrates the spatial expansion process of urban land cover with fractal model. The result shows: the land cover types changed greatly during 1988 to 2007; the area of construction land, which belong to human dominated land cover types has decreased throughout the entire study period;the construction land convert mainly from grassland, forestland and unutilized land; the spatial structure of urban land cover features is tending to be more stable with the decrease of the fractal dimension; some land cover types converted to some extent to land for construction land, it indicates urbanization is the most important driving force factor which is affect the change of land cover types.

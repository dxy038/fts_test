OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to examine whether a correlation exists between the Revised Trauma Score assigned on admission and pregnancy outcome, as well as whether the Revised Trauma Score has any predictive value for optimal duration of cardiotocographic monitoring necessary to detect immediate adverse pregnancy outcome.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review was performed of 30 pregnant trauma patients admitted during a 1-year period. Evaluation of cardiotocographic data for either contractions or decelerations or both was performed without knowledge of Revised Trauma Score or maternofetal outcome at discharge.
RESULTS: Review of uterine activity and fetal decelerations did not detect useful predictive patterns unless the tracing was immediately ominous, although uterine activity did initially decrease over time.
CONCLUSIONS: The Revised Trauma Score lacks predictive value for both risk of adverse pregnancy outcome and need for prolonged cardiotocographic monitoring. A larger patient population needs to be studied for an accurate determination of whether the Revised Trauma Score has potential as a predictive tool. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;176:1206-12)

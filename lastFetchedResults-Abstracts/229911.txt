In the present article we make the first step towards the implementation
of a user-friendly, object-oriented system devoted to failure detection and
signal validation purposes. After overviewing different signal modelling, residual
making and hypothesis testing procedures, a mathematical tool is suggested to
describe a general failure detection problem. Three different levels of the abstraction
are distinguished; direct examination, preliminary decision support mechanism
and indirect examination. Possible scenarios are introduced depending both
on the objective properties of the investigated signal and the particular requirements
prescribed by the expert himself. Finally it is showed how to build up
systematically a complete, general failure detection procedure.

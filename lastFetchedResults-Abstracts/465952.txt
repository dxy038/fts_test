Objective: We sought to compare the acceptability of suction curettage abortion with that of medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol in American women. Study Design: We performed a prospective, serially enrolled, cohort analysis. The study population consisted of 152 subjects receiving mifepristone and misoprostol and 174 subjects undergoing suction curettage abortion aged ≥18 years with intrauterine pregnancies of up to 63 days’ estimated gestation. Questionnaires regarding expectations and experiences were administered before the abortion and at the 2-week follow-up visit. Results: Subjects undergoing medical abortions reported significantly greater satisfaction than those undergoing surgical abortions (mean rank, 121 vs 149; P< .01) but were no more likely to recommend the method they had just experienced to a friend (97% vs 93.3%). If a future abortion was required, however, 41.7% of subjects undergoing surgical abortions indicated they would opt for a medical abortion, whereas only 8.6% of subjects receiving medical abortions would choose a surgical abortion (P< .001). Failure of the abortion decreased satisfaction in the medical group and increased the likelihood of choosing a surgical abortion for a subsequent procedure (P< .001). Surgical subjects who experienced more anxiety than expected during the abortion were more likely to choose a medical procedure for a subsequent abortion (P< .01). Conclusion: Women receiving mifepristone and misoprostol were more satisfied with their method and more likely to choose the same method again than were subjects undergoing surgical abortion. Failure of a medical abortion and increased anxiety during surgical abortion were associated with preference for the alternative technique in a future procedure.

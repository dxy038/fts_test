The objective is to design, develop and utilize the high-efficient solar energy collectors for the purpose of laying down technical foundation for progressive expansion of the heating range in utilization energy collectors and apply them to solar energy air-conditioning system, solar energy industrial hot water system and solar energy power generation. In general vacuum tube collectors are used in solar process heat systems. Another possibility is to use transparent insulated flat plate collectors. A critical point however, is that most of the common transparent insulating materials cannot withstand high temperatures because they consist of plastics. Thus, temperature resistive collector covers combining a high transitivity with a low U-value are required. One possibility is to use capillaries made of glass instead of plastics. At the same radiation intensity by comparing the heat gain of both the flat plate and vacuum tube solar collector having same capacity tank, mass flow rate and absorber area. It find out that vacuum tube collector is 16.12% more efficient than flat plate solar collector.

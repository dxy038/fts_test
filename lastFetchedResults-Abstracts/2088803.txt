The design and performance of an ultra-high-resolution 300 kV electron microscope is described. The microscope is equipped with a newly developed low-aberration objective lens, a Schottky field emission source and a rotatable biprism for high-resolution off-axis holography. All instrumental parameters are measured to be within the specifications required to make the instrument capable of reaching an information limit of 0.1 nm. Tests performed show that this information limit has been attained.

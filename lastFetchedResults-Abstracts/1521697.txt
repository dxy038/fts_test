Two low-volume solvent continuous extraction methods are applied to the extraction of paper matrices. In the methods reported here, a complex mixture of fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs) and azo dyes (AZOs) used in paper materials intended to come into contact with foodstuffs was extracted by using subcritical water extraction (SWE) and dynamic sonication-assisted solvent extraction (DSASE). Rationale for the work is based upon migration concerns of these groups of analytes from the packaging to the packaged items, thus compromising their subjective and/or objective quality. In SWE, sample was extracted in 21 min with 0.5 mL of water, whereas the DSASE method required 11 min and used 7 mL of water. DSASE was further developed by incorporating an organic modifier in order to change water polarity, thus improving extraction of moderately polar analytes. This way, modified-DSASE used a total organic volume of 0.9 mL which represents a reduction of 200 times in organic solvent consumption (200 mL versus approximately 1.0 mL) and 11 times in extraction time (2 h versus 11 min) compared to the existing methods. SWE was able to extract only 9 out of 12 test analytes with average recoveries between 10 and 25% whereas modified-DSASE succeed in extracting all the target analytes with an average recovery of 89%. Complete discussion and explanation concerning these differences are provided in the text.

Angelman syndrome (AS) has emerged as an important neurogenetic syndrome due to its relatively high prevalence and easier confirmation of the diagnosis by improved genetic testing. In infancy, nonspecific clinical features of AS pose diagnostic challenges to the neurologist and these include any combination of microcephaly, seizure disorder, global developmental delay or an ataxic/hypotonic cerebral palsy-like picture. In later childhood, however, absent speech, excessively happy behavior, ataxia and jerky movements usually present as a recognizable clinical syndrome. Brain MRI shows nonspecific or normal findings but occasionally the characteristic EEG patterns alone can lead to the correct diagnosis. The physical, clinical and behavioral aspects appear to be attributable to localized CNS dysfunction of the ubiquitin ligase gene, UBE3A, located at 15q11.2. In certain brain regions, UBE3A normally has mono-allelic expression from the maternally derived chromosome 15. Several distinct genetic mechanisms can inactivate or disrupt the maternally derived UBE3A: chromosome microdeletions, paternal uniparental disomy, imprinting defects and intragenic UBE3A mutations. Those with the deletion type of AS are the most prevalent (about 70% of cases) and appear to have a more severe clinical phenotype. The unique epileptic patterns and distinct behavioral features may be related to multiple actions of UBE3A, possibly occurring during, as well as after, the time of neuronal development.

The objective of this paper is to design nonlinear excitation controllers for single-machine infinite-bus power systems. Because of the nonlinear nature of such systems, nonlinear controllers are more effective in providing larger stability margins than their linear counterparts. To take advantage of well-developed linear control techniques, the concept of feedback linearization is used. A characterization of the region over which the linearizing state transformation is guaranteed to be diffeomorphic is provided. Also, a new formulation for the linear controller design is provided to solve the problem of the terminal voltage regulation. Simulation results of a single-machine infinite-bus power system indicate that in the presence of major disturbances the proposed controller outperforms existing linear and nonlinear controllers in maintaining the system's stability, in damping the rotor angle oscillations, and in reaching the desired performance during postfault operations.

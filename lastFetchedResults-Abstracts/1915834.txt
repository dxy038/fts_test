Objective
luate the impact of detailed biopsy characteristics such as positive cores location or multifocality on the risk of initial reclassification in prostate cancer (CaP) patients eligible for active surveillance (AS).
als and methods
iewed data from 300 consecutive men eligible for AS (PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml, clinical stage T1c, Gleason score ≤6, &lt;3 positive cores, extent of cancer in any core &lt; 50%) who have undergone a radical prostatectomy (RP). Reclassification was defined as upstaged disease and/or upgraded disease in RP specimens.
s
 features showed 36% of CaP involving 2 cores and a mean total tumor length of 2.63 mm. The 2 most frequently positive sites were base and apex. Mean total tumor length was significantly associated with upgraded disease (P = 0.025). In a multivariate model taking into account PSA, PSAD, number of positive cores and total tumor length, a total tumor length &gt; 5 mm were independently predictor for a upgraded disease (OR 1.93, P = 0.046). The number, the multifocality and the bilaterality of positive cores were not associated with reclassification. Upgraded disease was significantly less reported in case of positivity at midline zone compared with positivity at base, apex, or transition zone (P = 0.013).
sions
ed biopsy data provide additional information on the initial risk of reclassification in AS patients. Patients having a total tumor length &lt; 5 mm and positive cores at midline zone are more likely to have favorable pathologic characteristics at diagnosis. These variables can be used for selection and monitoring improvement in AS programs.

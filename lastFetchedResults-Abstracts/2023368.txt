	This paper focuses on layout modeling and optimization for a space control system. Majority of recent research works consider design components as constant elements over time. A new approach based onvariable mass components is proposed in this paper for whichthe objective function is to minimize mass center variation (MCV) range over time. The proposed approach consists of Human-computer interaction (HCI) and Optimization methods to perform the layout. In the modeling phase, using defined inputs, all system components are determined. Then different configurations and layouts for subsystems are modeled and MCV over time in three dimensional space is calculated for each model. Following this, according to permissiblerange for mass center changes, the most appropriate layout in terms of MCV amplitude is achieved. In the next step, mathematical model of achieved layout is defined. Mathematical model includes objective function, constraints, variables and parameters, play an important role in choosing appropriate optimization method. Based on mathematical model and design space, a gradient optimization method is selected. By applying this algorithm, optimum layout is proposed. Results of optimization and HCI design are compared. Comparison of the results shows that the optimization technique can significantly improve the results of the layout problem. At last, the results have analyzed and validated with similar research works. The results comparison show more efficiency and accuracy for the proposed method.

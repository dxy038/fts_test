Study objective: To determine the effect of topical anesthetics on visual acuity (VA). Methods:  We studied 66 consecutive patients (73 afflicted eyes) who presented to a university hospital emergency department with the complaint of eye pain. VA was measured before and after patients were treated with proparacaine, a topical ocular anesthetic. Results: After proparacaine instillation, VA was improved in 33 patients (45%), unchanged in 34 (47%), and worse in 6 (8%). Conclusion:  Patients with eye pain often demonstrate improved VA after the instillation of a topical anesthetic.

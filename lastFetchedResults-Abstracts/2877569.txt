A new variant of the adaptive differential evolution algorithm was proposed and tested experimentally on the CEC 2014 test suite. In the new variant, the adaptation is based on the competition of several strategies. A part of strategies in the pool uses the rotation-invariant current-to-pbest mutation in the novel algorithm. The aim of the experimental comparison was to find whether the presence of the rotation-invariant strategy is able to improve the efficiency of the differential evolution algorithm, especially in problems with rotated objective functions. The results of the experiments showed that the new variant performed well in a few of the test problems, while no apparent benefit was observed in the majority of the benchmark problems.

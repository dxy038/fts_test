Objective: Brachial plexus paralysis is a serious form of neonatal morbidity. We determined its incidence and persistence of disability and evaluated whether its occurrence could be predicted by maternal characteristics or partographic analysis in a large cohort of recent cases. Study Design: During the years 1994 through 1998, all infants with neonatal evidence of obstetric brachial plexus injury were identified and followed 14; 1 year. Obstetric details in these maternal-infant pairs were compared with 108 control pairs, matched for maternal and gestational age, parity, and birth weight. Partographs of cases and control subjects were reviewed, in a blinded manner, by 3 obstetricians who were asked to identify likely cases of nerve injury. A risk score comprising eight recognized associated clinical features was assigned. Results: Fifty-four of 35,796 infants (1.5/1000) had evidence of brachial plexus injury; in 10 cases (19%), neurologic deficit persisted to 1 year. Although the risk factor profile was relatively higher in cases compared with control subjects, the highest score was 5 of 8 in six cases (2 cases, 4 control subjects). Obstetricians' partographic assessment identified “likely brachial plexus injury” in 13 of 54 cases (24%) and 16 of 108 control subjects (15%), and in only 3 cases (6%) did the assessors concur (positive predictive value, 7%-17%; negative predictive value, 5%-12%; sensitivity, 24%-50%; specificity, 66%-68%). Risk scores were similar among persistently and transiently injured cases. Conclusion: Our results indicate that brachial plexus injury is not predictable before delivery, either by risk factor scoring or by partographic analysis. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;187:1209-12.)

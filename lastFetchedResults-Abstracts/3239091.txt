The objective of the present work is to develop a method able to automatically determine mental states of vigilance; i.e., a personÂ´s state of alertness. Such a task is relevant to diverse domains, where a person is expected or required to be in a particular state. For instance, pilots or medical staffs are expected to be in a highly alert state, and this method could help to detect possible problems. In this paper, an approach is developed to predict the state of alertness (&#8220;normal&#8221; or &#8220;relaxed&#8221;) from the study of electroencephalographic signals (EEG) collected with a limited number of electrodes. The EEG of 58 participants in the two alertness states (116 records) were collected via a cap with 58 electrodes. After a data validation step, 19 subjects were retained for further analysis. A genetic algorithm was used to select an optimal subset of electrodes. Common spatial pattern (CSP) coupled to linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to build a decision rule and thus predict the alertness of the participants. Different subset sizes were investigated and the best result was obtained by considering 9 electrodes (correct classification rate of 73.68%).

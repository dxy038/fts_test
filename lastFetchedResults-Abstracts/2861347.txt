The paper considers so-called Integral sliding modes and how they can be employed in the context of fault tolerant control. One advantage is that a sliding motion can be achieved at the outset and hence there is no reaching phase. Two distinct classes of problem are considered: in the first a fault tolerant ISM controller is designed for a class of faults in an over-actuated linear system; in the second an ISM scheme is retro fitted to an existing feedback control scheme for an overactuated uncertain linear system with the objective of retaining as close as possible to the pre-existing nominal performance in the face of faults and failures.

This paper proposes an efficient constriction particle swarm optimization (CPSO) with mutation mechanism for solving the steady-state economic dispatch (ED) problem with contingency constraints and operating limits of series FACTS devices in power systems. The objective of security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED) is defined to not only minimize total generation cost but also to enhance transmission security, reduce transmission loss, and improve the bus voltage profile under pre-contingent and post-contingent states. Many non-linear characteristics of the generator, such as ramp rate limits and valve-point loading effects are considered using the proposed method for practical generator operation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated for the IEEE 118-bus system with series FACTS devices, and it is compared with the other stochastic optimization methods in terms of solution quality and convergence rate. The experimental results show that the proposed CPSO method was indeed capable of efficiently obtaining higher quality solutions in SCED problems.

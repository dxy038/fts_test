Large scale, high concurrency, and vast amount of data are important trends for the new generation of website. Node.js becomes popular and successful to build data-intensive web applications. To study and compare the performance of Node.js, Python-Web and PHP, we used benchmark tests and scenario tests. The experimental results yield some valuable performance data, showing that PHP and Python-Web handle much less requests than that of Node.js in a certain time. In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that Node.js is quite lightweight and efficient, which is an idea fit for I/O intensive websites among the three, while PHP is only suitable for small and middle scale applications, and Python-Web is developer friendly and good for large web architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to evaluate these Web programming technologies with both objective systematic tests (benchmark) and realistic user behavior tests (scenario), especially taking Node.js as the main topic to discuss.

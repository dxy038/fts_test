This paper presents a new technique to optimize the number, location, and size of shunt capacitors on a radial distribution feeder in the presence of harmonics and distortion. The optimization objective is to achieve maximum savings resulting from reduced line losses. The mathematical model devised is a mixed 0â€“1 polynomial program, with restrictions imposed to limit the harmonic current magnification that resukts from parallel resonance. A global optimization algorithm for polynomial programs is utilized to solve this formulation. The effectiveness of this state-of-the-art algorithm ensures optimality to a complex mathematical model which more accurately represents the physical problem than other formulations. The method presented is suitable for solution on a personal computer, and has yielded promising initial results.

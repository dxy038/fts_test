Introduction & Objective: Cryptosporidium is one of the most important zoonotic and oppor-tunistic protozoa and can cause diarrhea in those with impaired immune systems, as well as the children. Considering the high sensitivity of children against infection caused by crypto-sporidium, its zoonotic nature and lack of treatment, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of cryptosporidium infection in children under 10 years old, referred to the health care centers of Hamadan district.
Materials & Methods: This study was conducted in 2013 on 420 children (222 males and 198 females), who were referred to urban and rural health care centers in Hamadan district. Stool samples were examined using formalin-ether method and modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique. The results were analyzed with chi-square test.
Results: Of the 420 children studied, 2 individuals (0.47%) (A 16-month-old boy and a 6-year-old girl) were infected with cryptosporidium spp. The infection was observed only in rural areas and in children that were in direct contact with the animals.
Conclusion: The results of this study showed a presence of cryptosporidium in rural areas compared to urban areas and in children in contact with animals. Therefore it is necessary to promote the public health awareness of rural population.

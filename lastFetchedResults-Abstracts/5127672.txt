Recently, more attention was put on the noise control of automotive. To reduce the noise of intake system of some kind of automotive, a model of automotive intake system was found based on transfer matrix method and black box experimental method. Then to fulfill the requirement of design and realize better anechoic effect, single objective optimization and multi-objective problem was formulated. To get the optimal performance and the optimal structure parameters, the problems were solved by genetic algorithm (GA) and NSGAII through Matlab platform, and optimal analysis was carried out to get the optimal parameters under different requirements and soft constraints. The results of our work have the guiding sense to the reality production.

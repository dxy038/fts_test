The rise and spread of Anopheles gambiae s.l. (the major malaria vector sub-Saharan Africa) resistance to pyrethroids is of great concern owing to the predominant role of pyrethroid-treated nets in the WHO global strategy for malaria control. Use of pyrethroids for agricultural purposes may exert a strong selection pressure, favouring the emergence of insecticide resistance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of alpha-cypermethrin treated nets in settings where insecticides are used against pests. This was assessed in two ways, i.e. under laboratory conditions using the WHO standard cones test technique and in experimental huts, on Anopheles gambiae s.l. collected in two Malian rural sites, Koumantou characterised by cotton crops and high insecticide use and Sélingué, a rice field area with low insecticide use. According to the WHO standard cones test technique, there was no difference between mosquitoes collected in the two sites; KD50 time was less than 3 min and the KD95 time below 30 min. Nevertheless, in the experimental huts with alpha-cypermethrin treated bed nets, the mosquito mortality rate was significantly lower in Koumantou (102/361, 28.2%) than in Sélingué (122/233, 52.3%) (RR: 0.65, 95%CI: 0.56–0.76) (p &lt; 0.001). In addition, in Koumantou the percentage of unfed mosquitoes found in the veranda was much lower in the huts with untreated (26.0%, 33/127) than in those with treated nets (92.2%, 118/128) (p &lt; 0.01) while in Sélingué there was no difference between huts with treated and untreated bed nets. Alpha-cypermethrin treated bed nets had a significant effect on mortality and repelling behaviour of Anopheles gambiae s.l. though in Koumantou treated bed nets were less efficacious, possibly due to the intense use of pesticide for agriculture.

The compression efficiency of a scalable bitstream depends on the encoding configuration and on what combination of scalability types are used. Moreover, the wider the range of extraction points a scalable bitstream supports, the lower the compression efficiency at these extraction points. Therefore, we propose a multiple-objective optimization formulation in order to find the best encoding configuration for a scalable video coding in the existence of a predefined bitrate range. We also define some objective criteria as a measure of coverage, compression efficiency and rate distortion performance of a configuration.

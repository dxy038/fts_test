Introduction: Inflammation is a common recognized complication of metabolic syndrome. Our objective was to study the association between food groups, inflammatory markers and the metabolic syndrome in adults. Materials and Methods: This case control study was conducted on 80 subjects with metabolic syndrome as cases and 160 controls without the syndrome. Metabolic syndrome was defined based on criteria of the Adult Treatment Panel III. Anthropometric, biochemical profiles, blood pressure and inflammatory markers were documented. Statistical analysis were performed using logistic regression and linear regression. Results: Legumes, fruits, dairy product and red meat were inversely and starchy vegatables were found to be positively associated with metabolic syndrome. After adjusment for confounding factors, legumes, fruits and dairy remained significant. Compared with the lowest quartile category odds ratio for Mets in the highest quartile of legumes and fruits intakes was 60% lower, after adjustment for confounding factors. Also compared with the lowest quartile category metabolic syndrome odds ratio in the highest quartile category of dairy was 40% lower. In the highest quartile category of fruit, dairy and legumes, hs-C Reactive Protein concentration was significantly lower, after adjustment for confounding factors. Conclusions: Fruit, dairy and legumes consumption were inversly associated with metabolic syndrome and hs-C Reactive Protein concentration in this group of adult Iranians.

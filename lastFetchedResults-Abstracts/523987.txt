Objective: Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) catalyses the S-methylation of thiopurine
drugs. Low activity phenotypes are correlated with several mutations in the TPMT
gene and adverse drug reactions. The molecular basis for dissimilar enzymatic activity
of TPMT has been established in Caucasians, African-Americans and Southwest Asians,
but it remains to be elucidated in Iranian population. Until present, no study on Iranian
population has been performed on the known alleles of TPMT. The aim of this study was
to investigate the frequencies of four of the most common variants of this gene.
Materials and Methods: This study was conducted during 2007 at the Department of Hematology,
Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran. Using PCR-RFLP and allele specific
PCR techniques, allelic variants of the TPMT gene TPMT*2(G238C), TPMT*3B (G460A),
TPMT*3C (A719G) and TPMT*3A (G460A and A719G) were genotyped in a normal population
of 127 Iranians.
Results: In this study TPMT*2 showed a prevalence of 7.08%. TPMT*3C and *3A were
found in 2.47% and 2.18% of the samples, respectively. TPMT*3B variant was not detected
in Iranian subjects. 112 out of 127 participants showed homozygote wild type allele.
Conclusion: This study is the first to analyze TPMT allele frequencies in a sample of
Iranian population and indicates that TPMT*2 is the most common allele (7.08%) in this
population. These results can help to organize national pretreatment strategies in patients
with acute lympho blastic leukemia (ALL) or other diseases requiring thiopurine medication
in their standard therapy.

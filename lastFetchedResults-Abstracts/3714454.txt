In this paper, we evaluate different methods to estimate patient-specific scalp, skull, and brain surfaces from a set of digitized points from the targetÂ´s scalp surface. The reconstruction problem is treated as a registration problem: An a priori surface model, consisting of the scalp, skull, and brain surfaces, is registered to the digitized surface points. The surface model is generated from segmented magnetic resonance (MR) volume images. We study both affine and free-form deformation (FFD) registration, the use of average models, the averaging of individual registration results, a model selection procedure, and statistical deformation models. The registration algorithms are mainly previously published, and the objective of this paper is to evaluate these methods in this particular application with sparse data. The main interest of this paper is to generate geometric head models for biomedical applications, such as electroencephalography and magnetoencephalographic. However, the methods can also be applied to other anatomical regions and to other application areas. The methods were validated using 15 MR volume images, from which the scalp, skull, and brain were manually segmented. The best results were achieved by averaging the results of the FFD registrations of the database: the mean distance from the manually segmented target surface to a deformed a priori model surface for the studied anatomical objects was 1.68-2.08 mm, depending on the point set used. The results support the use of the evaluated methods for the reconstruction of geometric models in applications with sparse data.

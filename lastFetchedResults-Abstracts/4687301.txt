The problems related to design a customized courseware are of immense importance in the design of adaptive dynamic courseware taking into account of knowledge and objective of individual learner. To meet the requirement of individual learner, concepts of Learner Quanta (LQ) &amp; Learner Quanta Cloud (LQC) had been proposed in [9]. Concepts of the learner-centric LQ had been extended through a Graph based model in order to identify the appropriate data structure of the LQC [22]. This paper analyzes properties identified in [22] and proposes a query processor on the background mentioned here.

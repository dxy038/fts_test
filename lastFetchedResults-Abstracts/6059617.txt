Frequently, support equipment flexibility and adaptability are not primary issues facing recipients of a new military system. But they should be! Such support equipment is invariably provided as a part of a new military system field deployment - support equipment whose objective is narrowly defined and exclusively focused on one system, sub-system, or device. Unlike the Prime Contractor (who is motivated to support only their own products), an Independent PXI Systems Integrator is often able to consolidate test resources by broadening the mission of the support equipment. Utilizing COTS PXI technology, an Independent System Integrator could expand the mission of a Bench-Top Maintenance Tester to include a family of applications, including UUTs from multiple manufacturers, and ultimately save millions for ground support and depot support organizations.

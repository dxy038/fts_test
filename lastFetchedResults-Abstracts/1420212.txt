This study aims to develop an algorithm for designing the optimum shape of slider bearing and pressure distribution using an inverse method. The proposed algorithm only needs to obtain the load and moment conditions in order to simultaneously estimate the slider bearing shape and the pressure distribution. The algorithm is developed from the Reynolds integral, and from force and moment balance equations. The least-squares error method, variational method, Gauss–Seidel method and Newton–Raphson method are employed to calculate the optimum shape of slider bearing. Simulation results reveal that as the degree of the shape polynomial function increases, there are corresponding gains in the maximum pressure, load and torque are, and a corresponding decline in the minimum film thickness. On the other hand, the lower the degree of the objective shape polynomial function is, the more accurate the estimated slider bearing shape and pressure distribution are. With increases in degree of polynomial and number of grid points, the errors in the estimated slider bearing shape and pressure distribution can be reduced. The initial guessed values of the coefficients for the estimated slider bearing shape (Cj), the position of the maximum pressure (Xm) and the outlet film thickness (H0) have notable effects upon the estimated results for the present algorithm. Moreover, the greatest error of initial guessed value is that of Cj, followed by Xm, and then H0. The estimated pressure distributions are more accurate than the estimated values for film thickness. Consequently, the present algorithm is capable of providing accurate results for slider bearing shape and pressure distribution.

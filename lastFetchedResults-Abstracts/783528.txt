Objective A community survey evaluated
whether the development of a shared mental health
care intervention had an impact on health care perceptions
and mental health status of subjects with
common mental health problems (MHP). Methods
Adults <70 years old with common MHP (DSM-IV/
CIDI-SF major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety
or MHI-SF 36 psychic distress diagnoses), were
randomly drawn from the general population in the
intervention area (IA, n = 349) and in a control area
(CA, n = 360), and evaluated twice at an interval of 18
months (percentage of follow-up: IA = 69.3%, CA =
71.9%, P = .44). CA and IA groups did not differ for
the criteria of interest at baseline. Results At 18
months, compared to CA, IA reported significantly
different help-seeking attitudes or behaviours
(P = .02 for all subjects and .006 for subjects with
current MHP) and greater general satisfaction with
care (P = .03 for both). Remission rates and daily life
functioning did not differ. Conclusions After 4 years
of development of a mental health network based on a
consultation-liaison model, Shared Mental Health
Care was associated with greater satisfaction and
access with care among subjects with common MHP.
The association was not found with mental health
status, but the study lacked power to adequately
address the issues.

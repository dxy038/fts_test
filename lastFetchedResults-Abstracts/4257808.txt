The energy density of the inductive energy storage systems is one order of magnitude higher than that of the capacitive ones. Therefore they have potential applications in the future. In this paper, three inductive pulse power supply topologies, i.e. STRETCH meat grinder, XRAM, and non-mutual inductance pulse power supply, are discussed in depth. Firstly, their principles are analyzed. Then simulations are made to illustrate the principles and prepare the fundamental data for further comparisons based on a 4 kA charging current, 220&#956;H total inductance system under the environment of Simplorer<sup>&#174;</sup>8. Five vital indices reflecting their performances from different aspects are proposed in order to ensure objective and comprehensive comparisons. Based on those indices, the advantages and disadvantages are pointed out and some potential improvements are also presented.

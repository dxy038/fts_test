This paper deals with identification and control of a non linear Air flow process. The objective of the present work is to control the flow rate of air through the process pipe line. The process is identified as a first order plus time delay process using real time data. The Model validation is also done. The PI controllerÂ´s parameters are tuned using conventional and optimization techniques. The controller parameters are optimized using genetic algorithm (GA). The search range for optimization is based on the set of stabilizing controllers. The performances of the controllers are tested both in simulation and in real time.

Wastewater reclamation and reuse is one of the best alternatives for compensatingwater shortages. Water supply
and environmental conservation can be met through wastewater reclamation. Principally, treated wastewater is a
reliable water resource, especially for periodic droughts and in arid areas. This study designed and implemented to
investigatethe full scale application of effluent for irrigation use. A major objective of this study is to assess on health
effects and feasibility of crop irrigation by using stabilization ponds effluent of southern Hovaizeh Wastewater
TreatmentPlant located in Khuzestan Province. Two experimentalplots of about 0.5 ha. were constructed. One ofthe
plots irrigated by stabilization pond effluent and the other irrigated by Nisan River water. Basic parameters in two
plots such as type of cultivated crops, amount of fertilizer use and lack of soil contamination have been similar in
both. The only difference was the type of water applied for irrigation of agricultural crops. It was shown that high
salinity of soil reduced the growth rate of agricultural crops. So, removing salinity from area should be performed
before cultivation. Results gained on agricultural crops growth in two studied plots showed the growth rate and
quality of crops were increasedby using of stabilization pond effiuent in comparisonwith Nissan River water.

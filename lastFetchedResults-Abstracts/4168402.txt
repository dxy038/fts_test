This paper is one of a series for use in current operational problems (COPs) forums with the goal of focusing industry attention on high priority problems faced by electric system operators. The three ``short note reports´´ in this paper discuss operating experience with on-line load flows being used by electric system dispatchers. These short notes are intended to clarify the nature of this operating experience and suggest the way for future developments. It is the objective of COPs forums to solicit discussion and stimulate the creation of responsive solutions.

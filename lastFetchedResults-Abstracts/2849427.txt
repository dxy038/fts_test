Speech-laugh is a speech-synchronous form of laughter that often occurs in natural conversation. However, there are deviations in features of speech-laugh when compared with laughter and neutral speech individually. The objective of this study is to analyse the excitation source features to capture the deviations between laughter and speech-laughs in voiced regions. The features used in this analysis are based on instantaneous fundamental frequency and strength of excitation (&#946;) at epochs. Modified zero frequency filtering (ZFF) method is used to extract the features. Kullback-Leibler (KL) distances obtained show that there are deviations in excitation source features which can be exploited to develop a method to discriminate speech-laughs from laughter. Experimental results show that features used are robust and speaker independent in discriminating speech-laughs from laughter. Results showing deviations of laughter and speech-laughs from neutral speech were also presented.

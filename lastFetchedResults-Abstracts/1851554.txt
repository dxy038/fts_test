The treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is essentially palliative and should be based on hormone therapy or optimized chemotherapy designed to delay disease progression and maximize survival with good quality of life. Novel chemotherapeutic agents introduced in the 1990s include the taxanes (notably docetaxel), which are among the most potent of current anticancer drugs. Current research is also focusing on molecular targeted agents including those against the HER family of transmembrane receptors and vascular endothelial growth factor. Optimal effects are obtained when these compounds are used in combination with chemotherapy, as shown in preclinical models and more recently in clinical trials. Results of a large randomized trial have demonstrated a significant survival advantage for trastuzumab plus docetaxel compared with docetaxel monotherapy. Docetaxel plus bevacizumab combinations have recently been shown to significantly improve progression-free survival and objective response rate compared with docetaxel monotherapy. Overall, docetaxel in combination with novel targeted agents in MBC appears to be highly active in patients with MBC, and such combinations represent promising treatment regimens for clinical investigation.

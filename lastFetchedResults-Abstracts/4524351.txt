According to optimization on safety thickness of roof for underground mining, which is a complex problem affected by multiple factors. On the basis of Genetic Algorithm (GA), each influencing factor on safety thickness of roof is considered as different gene and used to express individual composition factor of population. Therefore, each arbitrary group composed by different influencing factors can be used as a population. Then, by constructing objective function, designing optimization variables and determining constraint condition, the mathematical model of optimization on safety thickness of roof can be constructed. By using the Evolver software, which is based on the thought of GA, the optimization on safety thickness of roof for stopping the orebody No.92, under the overlap zones in Tongkeng Mine, is studied. The optimized results show that more conformable and accurate of the safety thickness of roof compared with the results obtained by numerical simulation and mathematical prediction.

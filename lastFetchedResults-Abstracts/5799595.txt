A key element of the USA armyÂ´s transformation is the future combat system and objective force (FCS/OF). The FCS/OF will operate as a cohesive, mobile, lethal, survivable, and sustainable land combat force capable of rapid deployment and immediate employment upon arrival and able to defeat threats in the 2010-2025 timeframe. This is to be achieved through network-centric operations wherein the force is realized through the network. In this paper we consider three echelons of the objective force, the FCS at the lowest level, above which resides the unit of action and the unit of employment. A communications network architecture study has been conducted to determine how the mobile nodes of the FCS/OF network may be best configured to realize this force. The study has examined a number of potential architectural topologies and the performance that can be expected from each. Trade studies were conducted to assess the relative merit of various technologies to the FCS/OF network on the basis of measures of performance such as capacity, connectivity, coverage, protection, and scalability. The result is a recommended communications architecture that will most readily achieve the goals of the FCS/OF. A flat architecture at the lowest echelons exploits mobile ad hoc networking with directional antennas for terrestrial communications. Range extension is realized through relays of various forms including unmanned aerial vehicle and satellite communications. Unit of action communications are organized into subnetworks with relay to lower and higher echelons, as well as joint and coalition forces. The unit of employment network enables command and control on-the-move and reachback to continental USA and external forces.

Background. Notwithstanding the advantages offered by minimally invasive coronary bypass, valid concerns have been raised about the technical accuracy of the distal anastomoses that can be fashioned on a beating heart. The main objective of our study was to undertake early and complete qualitative angiographic graft analysis in all patients undergoing this procedure.

Methods. All enrolled patients (25) from January to October 1996 who had bypass done by one surgeon via left minithoracotomy (19) or median sternotomy (6) on a beating heart underwent postoperative angiography within 4 to 6 hours. These angiograms were then reviewed for qualitative analysis and compared with a similar series done under conventional cardioplegic arrest.

Results. There was 97.5% graft patency (28/29) and no anastomotic occlusions. One internal thoracic artery was damaged. There was no mortality and no perioperative myocardial infarctions. All patients are alive and symptom free. The follow-up is 100% complete and ranges from 15 days to 11 months. Of the 26 anastomoses that could be assessed, 21 (81%) were grade A and 5 (19%) were grade B. In comparison, 24/25 (96%) of the anastomoses fashioned on an arrested heart by the same surgeon were grade A (p = 0.175).

Conclusions. Minimally invasive coronary bypass can be carried out effectively and safely in a select group of patients, and the development of stabilizing devices and proper instrumentation should further improve results.

Maintenance of stable pH through provision of adequate buffering is of importance to many pollutant removal processes where either acid or base is produced as a reaction product. The objective of this study was to evaluate the suitability of pyrite (FeS2) as an in situ buffering agent for arresting pH increase during metallic iron assisted hydrogenotrophic denitrification. Pyrite is considered promising for this purpose because it is a mineral which is unstable under moderately reducing, i.e., anoxic conditions, where such denitrification takes place, and therefore expected to consume hydroxide ions produced due to hydrogenotrophic denitrification reactions and get oxidized to ferrous hydroxide Fe(OH)2. The theoretical basis for this buffering action was established through chemical speciation studies using the chemical speciation software, MINEQL+. Experimental evaluation of the buffering efficiency of pyrite showed that it was effective in arresting pH increase associated with denitrification in both batch systems and during flow through reactive porous media. Further, addition of pyrite had no demonstrable toxic effect on the denitrifying microorganisms, though elevated sulfate concentration was seen in the effluent after denitrification.

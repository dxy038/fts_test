In this paper, simulation and experiment of a symmetric voltage capability IGBT operating in a chopper cell as both the main switch and the free-wheeling diode are presented. We also propose a physical interpretation of the switching behavior under reverse bias on the basis of a physical description of the charge dynamics. The long-term objective of this work is the monolithic integration of a two-directional current and/or voltage switch controlled at turn off and turn-on

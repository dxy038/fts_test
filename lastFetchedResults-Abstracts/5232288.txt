As products/processes often possess several quality characteristics,Robust Parameter Design (RPD) problems are likely to be dealt with by considering multiple responses. Several researches have proposed solutions to this problem by using loss function. A weighted loss function approach to make a good trade-off between bias and variation components of the objective function built on these researches is suggested in this paper. In addition, an algorithm of the weight parameter is also proposed, which can be used when the prior information is vague. An example from the literature is given to illustrate the proposed method, and a numerical comparative analysis of the results from different articles is also provided.

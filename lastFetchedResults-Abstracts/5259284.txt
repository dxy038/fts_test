The objective of this paper is to develop a novel tip position control scheme based on an exact model for a two link flexible manipulator with all joints revolute. We assume that each link of the flexible manipulator is a uniform Euler-Bernoulli beam with Kelvin-Voigt damping. The exact model that is described by a set of ordinary and partial differential equations is derived by using HamiltonÂ´s principle. An output feedback strategy is developed based on potential energy shaping and dynamic extension. We prove that the controller locally stabilize the closed loop system by considering an invariant level set.

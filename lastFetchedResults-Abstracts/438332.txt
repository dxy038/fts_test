A 35-year-old woman underwent reconstruction of her right pulmonary artery for treatment of acquired right pulmonary artery stenosis. The stenosis was secondary to tuberculosis causing both an extrinsic and an intrinsic obstructive component. After her reconstruction, the patient made an uneventful recovery, and perfusion to the right lung was subsequent restored.

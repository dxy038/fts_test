The European network for integrated circuit testing education described in this paper addresses the shortage of skill in mixed-signal production testing by encouraging students at pre- and post-doctoral levels to attend innovative training courses in the field, jointly supported by industry. The objective of the present educational experience is to strengthen given leading educational centers in Europe, in the critical field of mixed-signal testing, with the active support and guidance of industry. The project is an expansion of the successful French experience on engineering test education which allows any distant student to have a remote access to one-and one only-test resource center equipped with up-to-date/high-tech testers.

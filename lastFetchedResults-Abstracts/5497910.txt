In this paper, we present an improved proof of global asymptotic stability of constrained robotic systems under model uncertainties. The control objective is to make the robotic manipulator´s end effector to track the reference trajectories in the task space. The proposed approach is an enough straightforward method without force and position control separation. It´s based on the Lyapunov Hamiltonian method and the stiffness control strategy. The robustness of the suggested robust controller is proved via simulation results.

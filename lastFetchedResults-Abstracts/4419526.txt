Automated analysis of retinal vessels is essential for the diagnosis of a wide range of eye diseases and plays an important role in automatic retinal disease screening systems. In this paper, we present an approach to automatic vessel segmentation in retinal images that utilises possibilistic fuzzy c-means (PFCM) clustering to overcome the problems of the conventional fuzzy c-means objective function. In order to obtain optimised clustering results using PFCM, a cuckoo search method is used. The cuckoo search algorithm, which is based on the brood parasitic behaviour of some cuckoo species in combination with the Levy flight behaviour of some birds and fruit flies, is applied to drive the optimisation of the fuzzy clustering. The performance of our algorithm is analysed on two benchmark databases, the DRIVE and STARE datasets, and encouraging segmentation performance is observed.

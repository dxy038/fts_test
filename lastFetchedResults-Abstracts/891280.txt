The objective of this study was to determine if feeding increased dietary arginine affects indices of inflammation and whole body N metabolism. Three diets were used in this study: a control (0.92% arginine), control plus 0.5% supplemental arginine, and control plus 1.0% supplemental arginine.  The diets were fed to 9 adult, spayed Beagles in a replicated 3x3 Latin Square experiment.  Experimental periods were 28 days long with blood collection on days 14 and 28, and total urine and fecal collections for the final 6 days of each period. Nitrogen intake was increased (P  <  0.0001) by increasing dietary arginine.  Dry matter digestibility was 1.4% lower (P = 0.0124) for the +1.0% Arginine diet.  Nitrogen digestibility was greatest (P = 0.0014) for the +0.5% diet.  Nitrogen absorbed was greater (P  <  0.0001) for both supplemented diets than control, however, N retained and urea excretion did not differ across treatments.  A number of inflammatory biomarkers and hormones were evaluated in urine and serum samples.  No differences were detected in any of these biomarkers. Despite some subtle changes in N metabolism, it does not appear that addition of dietary arginine to these diets is beneficial for the adult dog at maintenance.

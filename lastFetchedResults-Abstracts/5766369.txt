Summary form only given. The images used in this test are 87 slices of a head from a GE 9800 X-ray CT scanner. A slice is taken every 3 mm. Each slice is 512&#215;512 pixels with 12 bits per pixel data. Objective measures show that the DEI coding scheme yields better compression performance than the 2-D DCT, since it takes advantage of correlation between adjacent slices along the body

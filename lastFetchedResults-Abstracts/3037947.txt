Traditionally telecom copper based loop networks were optimized for voice and cable networks were optimized for broadcast video. As telecom and cable networks evolve both are being upgraded to support voice, video and data services. As the service layer for both networks converge there is an increasing similarity in the physical architecture of both telecom and cable networks. Telecom companies are challenged with cost-effectively delivering video on their networks and cable companies are challenged with cost-effectively delivering primary-line voice services. ADSL is now widely available and enables the local exchange carriers (LECs) to support high-speed data, although bandwidth and distance constrained by the frequency limitations of the copper plant. As LECs continue to deploy fiber deeper in the access network, the copper loop length can be shortened and higher bandwidths can be supported with DSL, but this is only achievable with significant capital investment and deployment of equipment in remote cabinets, in closer proximity to the customer premise. The objective of this paper is to present a more cost effective alternative access network and technology, herein referred to as the HFX architecture, that enables telecom companies to support voice, video and data services.

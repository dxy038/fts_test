The design optimization of synchronous reluctance (SyR) machine and its extension to internal permanent magnet (IPM) motors for wide speed ranges is considered in this paper by means of a Finite Element Analysis-based multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). The paper is focused on the rotor design, that is controversial key aspect of the design of high saliency SyR and IPM machines, due to the difficult modeling dominated by magnetic saturation. A three step procedure is presented, to obtain a starting SyR design with the optimal torque versus torque ripple compromise and then properly include PMs into the SyR geometry, given the desired constant power speed range of the final IPM machine. The designed rotors have been extensively analyzed by computer simulations and two SyR prototypes have been realized to demonstrate the feasibility of the design procedure.

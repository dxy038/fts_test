Regionalism has become very prominent in the global politics and theories of international relations since 1980, but the literature of regional studies, particularly model of regional security, do not offer the needed model for the analysis of regional security. Hence, the objective of the present paper is to offer a framework or an analytical model for the analysis of regional security. In fact, in the complicated system of analysis of security, the understanding of the security of units is not possible without understanding the regional network. Attempts have been made to offer a model based on network theory and geopolitical paradigm to make the understanding of the regional security and connection of different components possible. The Middle East network has been studies as a case.

Germanium-carbon alloys (Ge<sub>1-x</sub>C<sub>x</sub>) were first deposited on Si (100) by chemical vapor deposition using precursors containing Ge-C bonds. The stated objective of that work was to explore Ge<sub>1-x</sub>C<sub>x</sub> as a potentially lattice-matched system with Si capable of bandgap engineering. In step with renewed interest in Ge MOSFET devices due to the advent of high-kappa dielectrics, our group has revisited Ge<sub>1-x</sub>C<sub>x</sub> recently, and for the first time demonstrated pMOSFETs with enhanced hole mobility fabricated on thin (30 nm) Ge<sub>1-x</sub>C<sub>x</sub>layers deposited directly on Si. This abstract presents previously unreported yet relevant materials-related details of the Ge<sub>1-x</sub>C<sub>x</sub> films. The key result is that the Ge<sub>1-x</sub>C<sub>x</sub> films exhibit remarkably low threading dislocation densities despite significant strain relaxation

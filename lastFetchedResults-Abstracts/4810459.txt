VANETs (vehicular ad hoc networks) are emerging as a new network environment for intelligent transportation systems. Many of the applications built for VANETs will depend on the data push communication model, where information is disseminated to a group of vehicles. In this paper, we present a formal model of data dissemination in VANETs and study how VANET characteristics, specifically the bidirectional mobility on well defined paths, affects the performance of data dissemination. We study the data push model in the context of TrafficView, a system we have implemented to disseminate information about the vehicles on the road. Traffic data could be disseminated using vehicles moving on the same direction, vehicles moving in the opposite direction, or vehicles moving in both directions. Our analysis as well as simulation results show that dissemination using only vehicles in the opposite direction increases the data dissemination performance significantly

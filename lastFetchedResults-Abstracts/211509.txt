Objective: To explore the multifocal electroretinogram in patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy with clinically-significant macular edema. Methods: Forty-one eyes with clinically significant macular edema were tested. The latencies and amplitudes of average responses of 5 eccentric rings from 0 to 26 degrees relative to the fixation point were compared with normal values obtained from 13 nondiabetic subjects. Results: Local electroretinogram responses were significantly delayed and decreased in amplitude in patients with clinically-significant macular edema. Conclusion: Multifocal electroretinogram can be used to quantify the visual function in clinically significant macular edema.

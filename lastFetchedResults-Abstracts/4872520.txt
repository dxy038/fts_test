In this paper, a driver model is designed and developed including steering control loop and speed control loop for heavy truck trajectory matching problem. The objective is to match the simulation results with a set of data from field test, (e.g. trajectory, yaw rate, velocity, lateral acceleration), and to validate truck simulation model for the heavy truck simulation model for the heavy truck system for further vehicle maneuvering study. To this aim, a good driver model which can best interpret driver maneuver from the field test data and keep the vehicle moving according to the maneuver stably is important. Based on previous work, a two-loop look-ahead yaw rate feedback perception and PI compensation steering strategy is developed and achieved very good matching results. Stability is proved and comparison with other kind of driver model is given. Simulations are done in VDANL.

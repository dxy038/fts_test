Hypothesis/Objective: The aim of this study is to characterize the location and extent of moderate to large, relatively compact infarcts using ECG evidence. Method: In this paper, we proposed a method on the basis of vectorcardiography which assumes that heart vector is proportional to relevant active depolarization area(s). To examine our ideas, we used the normal VCG which includes the information of location, amplitude, and direction of heart vector at any instant. The model based comparison of cases under study and relevant normal VCGs gives region i.e. segment(s) and depth i.e. extent of myocardial infarction. Results and Conclusion: We evaluated the method on CinC/Physionet Challenge 2007 database. In our final entry the scores of EPD equal to 32 (ranked 3<sup>rd</sup>), SO equal to 0.933 (ranked 3<sup>rd</sup>) and CED equal to 1 (ranked 1<sup>st</sup>) are achieved. It also ranked the third among the other methods proposed to CinC/Physionet Challenge 2007.

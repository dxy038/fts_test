In this paper we investigate multi-path transmission of video over Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs). Our objective is to provide a transmission mechanism to improve the video quality perceived at the receiver while considering energy, bandwidth and delay constraints of the network. Our approach is based on packet and path priority scheduling in multipath video transmission over WMSN. Video packets are classified according to their types and more important packets are transmitted through paths with better conditions. Path conditions are evaluated by a score mechanism using variant parameters such as free buffer size, energy, hop count and packet loss. Since path conditions are changed over time, our proposed scheme updates path conditions and adapting packet scheduling accordingly. Simulation analysis of the proposed video transmission scheme shows its efficiency in increasing perceived video quality at the receiver.

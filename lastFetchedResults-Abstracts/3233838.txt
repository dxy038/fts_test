The Objective of Time Based Metering is to Find the `Sweet SpotÂ´ that Uses All Capacity Without Overloading NAS Resources Significant Challenges will Face the Implementation and Use of Time Based Metering in Broad Traffic Management Events Uncertainty Associated with Weather, Traffic Flows, and the Effects of Control Actions Accumulates Over a Longer Prediction Horizon - These Uncertainties Must Be Modeled and Managed Metering Geometries Must Explicitly Provide Buffer Areas for Additional Delay and Holding - Time Based Metering will Not Completely Remove the Need for Holding or Other Delay Maneuvers.

Objective: To investigate the acceptance and efficacy of hepatitis B immunization in women during the postpartum period. Study Design: A group of 157 consecutive women who were delivered of neonates between 1994 and 1999 under the care of a private, full-time faculty-based practice of obstetrics and gynecology participated in the study. All patients were screened for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody during their pregnancy. Susceptible patients eligible for hepatitis B immunization were offered the vaccine in the immediate postpartum period. The planned vaccine administration was a series of 3 intramuscular injections, with the second injection given 4 weeks later and the third given 6 months after the initial injection. Rescreening for hepatitis B surface antibody titers was performed at a visit after the last injection. Response to the immunization series was evaluated according to rate of acceptance, compliance, and achievement of seroprotection. Results: Thirteen (8%) patients had been immunized previously and had antibodies, whereas 8 (5%) patients had serologic evidence of a previous infection. Of the 136 patients eligible for the study, 113 (83%) agreed to participate, 16 (12%) declined, and 7 (5%) moved away from New York right after delivery. Of the 113 participants, 104 (92%) patients received at least 2 vaccine injections, with 80 (71%) completing 3 injections. Among patients who had postvaccinal antibody titers, 66 of 69 (96%) of the group that received 3 injections and 9 (75%) of 12 of the group that received 2 injections were found to have antibodies. Conclusion: Hepatitis B immunization in the postpartum period is feasible and effective.(Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185:355-58.)

The classical management system of working meals cannot satisfy the peopleÂ´s order. The management system of order and distribution working meals based on mass customization is presented, which applies the business intelligence and the electronic commerce technology. On the basis of classical single catering management model, the three layers management model of working meals is proposed, which is from center kitchen to planet kitchen, then to corporation users, last to employee users. The new management model achieves the bidirectional and closed-loop operation of material flow and information flow, guarantees the mass, individualized and standardized production and distribution of working meals. The software test and actual application indicates that the entire system runs well and it is very practical, advanced, and approved by users.

Objective: To measure and compare different parameters of tinnitus loudness obtained via matching and to investigate their associations with self-reported severity of tinnitus. Methods: From the audiology department 18 patients with unilateral tinnitus of sensorineural origin were selected. They underwent pure-tone audiometry, and in a matching paradigm their tinnitus pitch was estimated. Loudness was assessed at tinnitus frequency and at the frequency of best hearing and both were expressed in sensation level (SL) and hearing level (HL). Moreover, minimal masking level (MML) with white noise was assessed as well as thresholds for the tinnitus tone and a comparison tone in the contralateral ear when tinnitus was masked. Results: Annoyance and grading of severity were associated with measures of loudness expressed in HL, MML, and pure-tone audiometry. Loudness in SL was not associated with self-reported severity. Tinnitus loudness, matched at the frequency of best hearing instead of the tinnitus frequency, appears to be less dependent on HL, while still being associated with distress and grading of severity. Conclusion: Severity of tinnitus is related to hearing thresholds, and loudness in SL provides little clinically useful information.

With exponential growth of the Internet users in past few years, there is a need of context-aware information sharing among different inter-connected entities over the Internet. The prime objective of the inter-connected objects is that within a minimum use of available resources, maximum output with respect to parameters such as throughput and delay can be achieved. But, due to high velocity and irrelevant information propagation, there may be a performance degradation in some part of the network with respect to these parameters. To address these issues, we have designed novel algorithms for context-aware information propagation among the vehicles. The proposed scheme consists of algorithms for data access, data dissemination, and data suggestion. These algorithms are based on reliability of vehicle which is calculated as soon as vehicles enter the network and is updated after each successful execution of various operations of information propagation. The scheme works on by increasing the reliability which in turn solve the broadcast storm problem in which sometime irrelevant information may also be sent to the vehicles. Simulation results prove the merit of the proposed scheme over the other existing schemes with respect to parameters such as message overhead, connectivity ratio, and resources utilization.

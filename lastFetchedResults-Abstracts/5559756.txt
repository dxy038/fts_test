To guide the quality evaluation application of Web services in selecting from many available Web services, a evaluation model based on artificial immune network memory classifier is proposed. Evaluation tree which supports to customize evaluation attributes dynamically is defined to reveal the relation among QoS attributes. The objective and subjective synthetic approach is designed to compute the weight of every evaluation attribute. Also, a new data classification method, named fuzzy c-means artificial immune network memory classifier (FCMAINMC), is put forward for feature extraction and classification of Web services. Finally using membership matrix and a hundred-mark way, evaluation result is obtained. The prototype is designed, and the experiment results are veracious and reliable.

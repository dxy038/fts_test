Disturbances such as capacitor switching, voltage sags/swells, and harmonics have become an increasing concern for both electric utilities and customers. This paper discusses an aspect of a project to examine the causes of distribution system disturbances and correct them to supply clean power to customers. The overall objective of this paper is to detect and predict voltage sag and capacitor switching disturbances using a Kalman filter approach. The distribution system modeled using the Kalman filter is a radial distribution feeder. Two different Kalman filter models were tested and compared. A sensitivity study was also performed to examine the effects of Kalman filter model, type of disturbance, and time of disturbance have on the prediction error

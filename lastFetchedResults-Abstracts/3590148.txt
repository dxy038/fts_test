This paper presents a new solution for Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) problem. The main objective of our research is to improve computational efficiency for ATFM by combing grid computing with multi-agent coordination techniques. To balance the communication among Multi-Agents in ATFM for grid computing environments, ATFM in Grid Computing (ATFMGC) is proposed for such synchronization problem. To demonstrate the developed model, the function of the agents, their knowledge representation and inference processes are discussed and the grid architecture in which the agents execute is described. Also, as a criterion to measure the effectiveness to reduce the amount of communication among agents and the delay of the flights, a metric called Standard of Balancing among Agents (SBA) is used as a basic index. The simulation results show the efficiency of the developed model and its successful application in a case study.

The aim of this paper is to provide a general method for bidirectional converter simulation and evaluation. A developed PWM switch model is proposed for bidirectional power flow application. A typical buck/boost bidirectional converter is chosen as a test bench for evaluation. Small signal analysis results show mode transition between battery charging and discharging modes. It provides a fast simulation tool to investigate steady and transient response of converters. The accuracy of the modeling technique is verified by a detailed comparison of simulated results with the developed PWM switch model and component circuit.

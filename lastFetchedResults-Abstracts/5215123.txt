This paper investigates the application of a state feedback control technique to a bidirectional boost converter. The proposed control system is mathematically formulated such that the state feedback control gains become the gains of a proportional-integral controller for the voltage loop and a proportional gain for the current loop. The control design does not rely on manual tuning procedures neither use complex adaptive techniques. On the contrary, the control gains are rapidly and automatically calculated off-line, ensuring good transient and good steady state responses. A robust analysis evaluated a posteriori demonstrate that the closed-loop system has good robustness against uncertainty on the DC input voltage and on the load parameter.

Tuberculous pseudoaneurysm has been reported to be a fatal, but rare complication of tuberculosis. We report a case of a 68-year-old man who underwent successful surgical treatment for a tuberculous pseudoaneurysm of the thoracic aorta with bronchial communication, and review previous reports of patients who also underwent operation for similar lesions, focusing especially on the pathway of infection to the aorta.

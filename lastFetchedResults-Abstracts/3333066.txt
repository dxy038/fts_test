Over the past decade, with the rapid growth of tunnel percentage in ChinaÂ´s Midwestern highway construction, the tunnel operation cost rise quickly. In the cost, energy consumption of tunnel ventilation and illumination occupies a great proportion. For the purpose of realizing energy-saving and emission-reduction, there have been some new illumination technologies, for instance, the new type lighting lamp, the improved lamps installation arrangement method, and some new illumination control technologies. However, after a few new technologies were applied, the phenomenon of energy-saving but not money-saving appeared. For the scientific and objective evaluation of highway tunnel illumination technology energy-saving effect, construct evaluation index system from the three dimensions of technology usability, economy, and the application effect, and then evaluate the energy-saving effect based on matter-element model. The result of assessment will give decision support for the later selection of highway tunnel illumination technology proposal.

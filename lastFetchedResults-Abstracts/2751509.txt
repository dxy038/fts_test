This paper proposes a novel mobile crowdsensing (MCS) framework called EMC<sup>3</sup>, which intends to reduce energy consumption of individual user as well as all participants in data transfer caused by task assignment and data collection of MCS tasks, considering the user privacy issue, minimal number of task assignment requirement and sensing area coverage constraint. Specifically, EMC<sup>3</sup> incorporates novel pace control and decision making mechanisms for task assignment, leveraging participantsÂ´ current call, historical call records as well as predicted future calls and mobility, in order to ensure the expected number of participants to return sensed results and fully cover the target area, with the objective of assigning a minimal number of tasks. Extensive evaluation with a large-scale real-world dataset shows that EMC<sup>3</sup> assigns much less sensing tasks compared to baseline approaches, it can save 43%-68% energy in data transfer compared to the traditional 3G-based scheme.

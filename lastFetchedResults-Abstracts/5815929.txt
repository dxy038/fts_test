Nowadays, commercial lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are playing important roles as supplies for mobile phones, laptop computers and other electronics. In order to maximize the performance of Li-ion batteries, advanced charger is required. The main objective of an advanced battery charger includes short recharge times, high charging efficiencies and improved battery cycle life. This paper presents the design and implementation of a dsPIC-based fuzzy five-step Li-ion battery charging system. To obtain the optimal charging performance for the Li-ion battery, fuzzy-control-based five-step charging algorithm and a simple power stage is used in the proposed system. Using this control, the performance of the proposed system can be improved. In addition to the hardware, a graphical user interface is also presented in this paper. According to the experimental results, the proposed charger is capable of charging the Li-ion batteries with higher efficiency and lower temperature rise.

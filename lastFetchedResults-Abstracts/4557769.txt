A simultaneous shape and topology optimization method for designing patch antennas is discussed. The material distribution of a dielectric substrate is optimized using topology optimization concurrently as the metallic patch is optimized using shape optimization. The radiation amplitude in a specified mode at a selected frequency is chosen as the design objective and the resonance frequency is consequently matched to the selected frequency. In this paper, the basic method is constructed and its usefulness is verified using a simple numerical example.

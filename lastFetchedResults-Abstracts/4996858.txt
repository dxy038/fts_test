This paper presents a cost function-based predictive control strategy and its application to the control of power converters and drives. Discrete-time models of the system are used to predict the behavior of the controlled variables for all the possible switching states of the converter. A cost function defines the desired behavior of the system. The switching state that minimizes this function is selected and applied during the next sampling period. Different variables of the system can be controlled by defining an appropriate cost function, depending on the objective of each specific application

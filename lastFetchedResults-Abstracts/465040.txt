OBJECTIVE: Transsexual surgery is an unique area of rarely performed surgery. This study examines factors that have significance in the prevention of major morbidity in this unusual surgery. The role of the gynecologist in the psychologic, endocrine, and operative management is presented. STUDY DESIGN: Initial operations were complicated by fistulas at the urethra-to-phallus anastomosis site. After reviewing these complications, we modified our approach to include a two-stage procedure allowing for healing before microsurgery and sparing of the anterior vaginal wall during vaginal hysterectomy and colpocleisis. By sparing the anterior vaginal wall, we were able to better extend the urethra for later phallus attachment. RESULTS: Using the two-stage procedure at colpocleisis allowed a significant reduction in the fistula rate. (p = 0.0087) with the effective elimination-fistulas, the use of stiffeners during phalloplasty for better functional results is possible. CONCLUSION: Extending the urethra during colpocleisis allows for better healing and significantly decreased fistula formation. Proper blood supply for microvascular surgery and adequate tissue for the anastomosis site contribute to better results. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 1996;175:1443-50.)

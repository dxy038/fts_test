In h-adaptivity, a remeshing strategy is needed to compute the distribution of required element size using the estimated error distribution. Several authors have introduced different remeshing strategies yielding very different results. In this work these methods are included in a unified framework, emphasizing the role of the underlying hypotheses. Moreover, an objective tool to evaluate the accuracy of the resulting finite element solution is presented. Thus, a new remeshing strategy is introduced to optimize the accuracy of the adapted solutions. The different remeshing strategies are compared with well-known numerical examples.

Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) has been considered as a key technology for future wireless communications and mobile computing. Localization of primary user is crucial in enabling several key capabilities in CRNs. In this paper, we present a brief survey of representative methods dealing with user localization and location privacy preservation issues. The objective is to provide a comprehensive analysis and guide of existing efforts around localization and location privacy preservation in cognitive radio network. This survey is intended to help researchers in quick understanding existing works and challenges.

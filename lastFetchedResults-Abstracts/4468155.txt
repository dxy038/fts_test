Remote attestation was introduced in TCG specifications to determine whether a remote system is trusted to behave in a particular manner for a specific purpose; however, most of the existing approaches attest only the integrity state of a remote system and hence have a long way to go in achieving the above attestation objective. Behavior-based attestation and semantic attestation were recently introduced as solutions to approach the TCG attestation objective. In this paper, we extend behavior-based attestation to a model-driven remote attestation to prove that a remote system is trusted as defined by TCG. Our model-driven remote attestation verifies two compliance requirements to prove the trustworthiness of a remote system: expected behavior compliance and enforced behavior compliance.

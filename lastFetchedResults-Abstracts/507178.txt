Objective
Sensorineural hearing loss is believed to be the result of a physiologic malfunction
in the inner ear or acoustic nerve. Depending on the rapidity of progression
and severity, sensorineural hearing loss can be endlessly annoying, frightening
and can constitute a permanent after effect. Moreover, there is no surgical
procedure that can reverse or lessen the severity of a sensorineural hearing loss.
Furthermore, children with sensorineural hearing loss present with additional
disabilities in 30 to 40% of the cases. Children with profound sensorineural
hearing loss may exhibit abnormalities of vestibular structures, which may lead
to impairment of postural control, locomotion and gait. The development of
gross motor functions such as head control, sitting and walking are likely to be
delayed in these children. Evaluation of motor skills and balance are the core
of the pediatrician and physical therapistâ€™s expertise and practice. Knowledge
of the reliable, valid and inexpensive assessment tools for measuring motor
skills and balance are necessary to gauge the progression of the disease and
the impact of treatment. In this review, we aim to summarize inexpensive tools
such as TGMD-2, PBS, and P-CTSIB.

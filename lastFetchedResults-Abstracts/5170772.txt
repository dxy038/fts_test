For the success of developing software, Software development process model plays a crucial role in order to complete the task of developing software and to get high quality software. Since the advent of the first model (waterfall model), many software development process models have been brought out, but the software development process model is still evolving. The rules of evolution of software development process model have been researched from different perspective. The research has shown that: (1)For the evolution of software development process model, there are the driving forces from the objective world and subjective world. (2)Four models are the basis of evolution of the software development process model. They are waterfall model, rapid prototyping model, incremental model, component-based model. (3)Currently there are five trends in the view of evolution of software development process model. These trends of evolution are from the linear model to nonlinear model, from non-formal model to formal model, from the non-reuse model to reuse model, from single process model to integrated process model and from universal model to non-universal model. (4)In the future, there are four directions of evolution in the software development process model. These directions are to weaken complexity, to enhance pertinence, to enhance reliability and to enhance flexibility.

Objective: DM is a major medical problem in developing countries such as Iran. Blood sugar and lipids levels increase in diabetics exacerbates the onset of diabetes mellitus (DM) late complications. Researchers have focused on herbal medicines improve sugar and lipid levels against side decreasing effects and possible inefficacy of chemical drugs. This study has assessed the effect of curcumin on fructosamine, lipids profile and lipid peroxidation in patients with type 2 DM.
Materials and Methods: Sixty type II diabetics (40-60 years old) with history of diabetes above 10 years who had referred to diabetes center of Shahid Sadoughi medical university, were randomly divided in to two groups of case and control. The case group daily received two capsules of 250mg curcumin for 6 weeks and the control group took placebo over the trialperiod. Blood samples were collected in both groups at the beginning and end of the experiment .The cholesterol, Triglyceride, Low and high density lipoprotein were measured by auto analyzer (Auto lab). The rest of serums were frozen for measuring fructosamine and malondialdehyde by nitroblue tetrazolium and thiobarbituric acid tests in same condition. These tests were repeated after six weeks. Statistic alanalysis was done by SPSS 15, paired and independent T-tests.
Results Finally, 48 participants completed the study. After 6 weeks, the case group showed significant decrease in fructosamine, cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol, malondialdehyde and increase in HDL-cholesterol (P=0.001) .At the end of study significant differences were observed between the meansfructosamine (P=0.023) and HDL-cholesterol (P=0.013) in two groups of case and control. No significant changes were observed for mean cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol and malondialdehyde between two groups.
Conclusion: Consumption of curcumin capsules improved the lipid profile and decreased the fructosamine and lipid peroxidation

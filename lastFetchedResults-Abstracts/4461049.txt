Many attempts have been made to develop digital stethoscope for diagnosing auscultation. This study is part of current research project being undertaken at the University of Southern Queensland, Australia. The project addresses the issue associated with telehealth care system, through the development of a digital stethoscope. The objective of this article is to report the userÂ´s satisfaction with the information received from the existing digital stethoscope and guide the researchers to adjust its content to the best benefit to those uses the new improved digital stethoscope. University of Southern Queensland, Australia has developed a digital stethoscope composed of software and hardware components and user friendly. The system will be priced competitively and can be used both for telehealth diagnosis and for teaching of cardiology to medical students. The lack of specialized devices and professionals can be minimized with the adoption of solutions, such as this one. This could improve the diagnostic ability of remote clinics at a lower cost and avoid long hour travel.

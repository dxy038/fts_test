The purpose of the study was the non invasive investigation of the innervation zone (IZ) location of the gracilis muscle of both thighs by means of surface electromyography (EMG). Multichannel EMG signals were detected by means of a flexible array of 16 equally spaced silver bar electrodes. Tests were performed on both gracilis muscles on 15 subjects. The locations of the innervation zones of the active MUs were automatically identified by means of an algorithm based on the Radon transform. A statistically significant difference was found between the gracilis IZ position in the two sides, with more proximal IZs on the left side. This difference suggests a possible role of sEMG in preoperative evaluation of patients prepared for the dynamic graciloplasty procedure. This test would provide an objective criterion for the choice of the gracilis muscle to be transposed with the highest probability of success

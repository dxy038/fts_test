The objective of this research was to study the effect of the addition of common bean flour to semolina on the cooking quality and total phenolic content of pasta. Pasta was obtained at three temperatures (60, 70 and 80 Â°C) and two levels of added common bean flour (15% and 30%); plain pasta (100% semolina) was used as control. Moisture, optimal cooking time, cooking loss, water absorption capacity, colour change, firmness and total phenolic and furosine contents were measured. The cooking time and water absorption were diminished in spaghetti pasta with added common bean flour; cooking loss increased and firmness decreased as a function of the bean flour percentage. A linear relationship between colour change and common bean flour content in pasta was found. Increases of furosine and phenolic contents in pasta with the addition of bean flour were observed.

An enzymatic reaction has been monitored by on-line direct infusion electrospray ionization (tandem) mass spectrometry. Using this fast and sensitive technique, a key and transient intermediate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS)-catalyzed reaction has been trapped. The reaction catalyzed by indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase is part of the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway, and is not present in mammals, including humans. This peculiarity renders this enzyme a potential target for the development of biospecific agents with potential anti-TB activity. The present results indicate the presence of two intermediates in the mechanism of this enzymatic reaction.

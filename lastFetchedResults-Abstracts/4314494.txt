The authors describe Quality Vision 2000, a package of management systems improvements intended to build to total quality environment. They discuss quality elements and systems used during the 1970s and 1980s, and the results achieved. These include PPM, statistical process control, Cpk, designed experiments, and quality circles. It is noted that involvement with customers including technical seminars, design reviews, Beta sight testing, surveys, and overall perception will be a key to meeting the objectives of Quality Vision 2000. During the 1990s existing elements will be strengthened and new elements will be added to meet the objective of total customer satisfaction. Key elements, methods, and measurements for Quality Vision 2000 are presented

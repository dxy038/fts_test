The objective of the P.O. Pistilli Scholarship program is to increase the pool of professionals in Elecmcal Engineering, Computer Engineering and Computer Science from under-represented groups (women, African Aperican, Hispanic, Native American, and physically challenged). In 1989, the ACM Special Interest Group on Design Automation (SIGDA) established the program. Beginning in 1993, the Design Automation Conference provided the funds for the scholarship, and SIGDA continues to administer the program for DAC. DAC normally funds two or more US$4ooo scholarships, renewable up to 5 years, to graduating high school seniors. In 1999 the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society also began to sponsor these scholarships. The 2003 winners were: Julie Louise Sandberg - attending Univ. of Wyoming for computer engineering, and Krystal Vernce Watson - attending Comell Univ. for computer engineering.

This work is an analysis of crude oil samples from thirty wells in the Alturitas Field (Lake Maracaibo Basin, western Venezuela). Different biomarkers, ten trace elements, and porphyrins were analysed using GC–MS, ICP–OES and UV–visible techniques, respectively. The characterization of these crude oils leads us to conclude that they all fall into a single non-biodegraded oil family derived from a single pulse of hydrocarbon generation, migration and accumulation from the thermally mature calcareous La Luna source rock deposited in an anoxic marine palaeoenvironment under reducing conditions. The main objective of this work is to present a secondary oil migration model for the Marcelina reservoir of the Alturitas Field. The multivariate statistical study of trace-element concentrations, porphyrin contents, and polar compound proportions shows that these parameters can be split into two groups. The first group (Cd, Cu, Mo, Fe, P, Zn, Ca, and Mg) indicates a chalcophic association (Cd, Cu, Mo, and Zn) or colloidal complexes with naphthenic acids (Ca, Mg, and Fe). The other two trace elements (V and Ni), together with porphyrins and polar compounds, reveal that oil compositions has been affected by geochromatography, indicating a highly probable secondary migration pathway along a preferential axis orientated southeast to northwest.

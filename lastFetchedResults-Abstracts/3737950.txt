A fuzzy reasoning approach is proposed for the service restoration of a distribution system. After the location of a fault has been identified and the faulted zone has been isolated, it is important for the operators to reach a proper service restoration plan in order to restore the electricity service outside the faulted zone. The operators tend to use their past experience and heuristic rules to devise such a restoration plan because it must satisfy a lot of practical needs and objectives. In addition, the operators´ needs and heuristic rules are often expressed in imprecise linguistic terms. In this paper, fuzzy set notation is employed to deal with these imprecise linguistic variables and a set of fuzzy reasoning procedures are developed to implement the operators´ heuristic rules. These procedures can be employed to solve the multiple-objective problem of service restoration described in imprecise linguistic variables. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy reasoning approach, service restoration on a distribution system within the service area of Taipei West District Office of Taiwan Power Company is examined. It is found that a proper restoration plan can be reached very efficiently by the proposed approach

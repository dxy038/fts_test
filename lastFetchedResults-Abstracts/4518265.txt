To avoid the larger area coming under outages, the coordination of Overcurrent (OC) relays in an interconnected power system is required. Fast isolation of fault is possible by minimizing operating time of OC relays by optimizing Time Multiplier Settings (TMS). Coordination problem with constraints is formulated as a linear programming problem. This paper presents optimization of OC relays coordination using Genetic Algorithm (GA). The objective is to minimize the time of operation by finding optimum TMS of relays. Two case studies are presented in this paper. The optimal coordination is utilized to obtain the optimal TMS of OC relays in a realistic power system in India.

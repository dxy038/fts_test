Although there are solutions for the axial vibration of compound bars, i.e., bars of different cross-section connected in mechanical series, this note is to illustrate another solution. The primary objective is to analyze this problem by a relatively new technique originated in 1986 and known as the differential transformation (DT) method. The numerical solutions are compared with classical exact solution and other studies in the literature. The accuracy, simplicity, and effectiveness of the DT approach are demonstrated.

This paper analyzes evolutionary techniques in the repair and adjust analog circuits. These techniques are useful for systems that need to perform for a long time in harsh environments, such as those employed in industry. These techniques are based on single and multiobjective evolvable algorithms. Each objective has a different influence and importance in the resulting circuit, so it is necessary to distinguish their importanceÂ´s weight in the evaluation of the circuits. The methods proposed are for extrinsic and intrinsic evolutionary repair and are illustrated by repairing the circuits of an amplifier and a TTL gate.

According to the problems existing in the design of open-graded mixture, this study puts up grading blending design method and the skeleton constraint condition. From the application of practical engineering, this method has the advantages of convenient, the design objective is clear and suitable for aggregates, it has low picky, and the engineering deviation is small, easy to be controlled. It is significance for simplify the mixture design process, improve the quality of design and construction.

The retinal and cerebral microvasculatures share many morphological and physiological properties. Assessment of
the cerebral microvasculature requires highly specialized and expensive techniques. The potential for using noninvasive
clinical assessment of the retinal microvasculature as a marker of the state of the cerebrovasculature offers
clear advantages, owing to the ease with which the retinal vasculature can be directly visualized
in vivo
and
photographed due to its essential two-dimensional nature. The use of retinal digital image analysis is becoming
increasingly common, and offers new techniques to analyse different aspects of retinal vascular topography,
including retinal vascular widths, geometrical attributes at vessel bifurcations and vessel tracking. Being predominantly
automated and objective, these techniques offer an exciting opportunity to study the potential to identify
retinal microvascular abnormalities as markers of cerebrovascular pathology. In this review, we describe the anatomical
and physiological homology between the retinal and cerebral microvasculatures. We review the evidence
that retinal microvascular changes occur in cerebrovascular disease and review current retinal image analysis tools
that may allow us to use different aspects of the retinal microvasculature as potential markers for the state of the
cerebral microvasculature.

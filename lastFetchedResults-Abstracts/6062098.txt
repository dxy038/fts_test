Objective : To test the expression of PDGFR-&#946; in colorectal cancer stroma, and evaluate the relationship to lymphangiogenesis. Methods: Applying Immunohistochemistry SP method, the expression of PDGFR-&#946; in 90 patients with colorectal cancer and 20 normal tissues. Marked by D2-40, lymphatic microvessel density (LMVD) was counted. The expression of PDGFR-&#946; and its relationship to LMVD and clinicopathologic factors was analyzed. Results: The expression of PDGFR-&#946; was found significantly higher in colorectal cancer stroma than in normal tissues surrounding tumors[PDGFR-&#946;: 46.67%(42/90) vs 20%(4/20), P&lt;;0.05]. The LMVD in cancer tissues was found significantly higher than in normal tissues surrounding tumors (P &lt;;0.05). Higher LMVD was found in groups with lymph node metastasis (26.06 + 16.41 vs 17.26 + 12.97, t =2.582, P &lt;;0.05). Also higher LMVD was found in colorectal cancer with positive PDGFR-&#946; expression than with that corresponding negative expression [(27.63 + 15.46)vs (17.47 + 14.68), t =3.01, P &lt;;0.05]. High PDGFR-&#946; expression was significantly more common with lymph node metastasis (P&lt;;0.05). Conclusion: The expression of PDGFR-&#946; in colorectal cancer stroma was closely correlated with lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis.

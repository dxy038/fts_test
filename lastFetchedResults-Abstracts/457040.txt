Objective
Capillary isotachophoresis (cITP) is a technique for characterizing plasma lipoprotein subfractions according to their electrophoretic charges. We used this technique to examine the mechanism by which apoA-I/phosphatidylcholine (POPC) discs increase pre-Î² HDL.
Methods and results
The cITP analysis was performed using plasma prestained with a lipophilic dye on a Beckman P/ACE MDQ system. Plasma from a patient with lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency who had increased apoE-containing HDL was used to characterize the charge distribution of apoA-I/POPC discs. cITP analysis of apoB- and E-depleted plasma of the patient in the presence of apoA-I/POPC discs indicated two major subfractions of apoA-I/POPC discs with mobilities of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (fast and slow apoA-I). Incubation of whole plasma from a normolipidemic subject in the presence of apoA-I/POPC discs caused a reduction in cITP fast (f)- and intermediate (i)-migrating HDL, and fast and slow apoA-I, and an increase in slow (s)-migrating HDL. The changes in cITP lipoprotein subfractions were not affected by the inhibition of LCAT activity. ApoA-I/POPC discs increased the fractional esterification rate of cholesterol in apoB-depleted plasma.
Conclusion
ApoA-I/POPC discs remodeled cITP fHDL and iHDL to sHDL independent of LCAT activity.

Our objective is to describe learning scenarios´ tracks with its derived data; and, basing indicators´ elicitation methodology on these described data. From this viewpoint, our approach presents several interesting points. First, it allows tracks and its derived data description possible by the use of a usage tracking language. Then, it proposes a means of assistance to: (i) teachers in the learning session comprehension and learners´ activities evaluation, (ii) pedagogical analysts in tracks´ exploitation, and (iii) pedagogical designers in the tracking scenarios´ specification by indicators´ elicitation. Lastly, it will also allow the development of a tracks based system, which will support this elicitation methodology.

A new, oddly stacked, critically sampled, single side-band (SSB) [7] analysis/synthesis system based on Time Domain Aliasing Cancellation (TDAC) [1],[2] is described in this paper. The specifications for the analysis and synthesis filter responses are developed and a number of designs which satisfy the reconstruction requirements are described. The application of TDAC systems to Subband/Transform coding is also discussed and the objective performance of a 32 band coder using several different window designs is presented and compared with a coder based on Frequency Domain Aliasing Cancellation (FDAC) filter banks [3]-[5].

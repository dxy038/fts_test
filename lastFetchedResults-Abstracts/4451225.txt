This paper proposes a novel method for a dynamic ridesharing mechanism using the combination of several modern information and communication technologies. The increased personal usage of automobiles has caused several undesirable consequences. Waste of time, fuel and effort due to traffic congestion and scarcity of parking areas are the most obvious. Ride-sharing for routine travelling has been an accepted practice in the developed world as a solution. However, today´s travelling needs are more complex and therefore traditional ride-share systems are no longer adequate. The concept of instant ride-sharing has emerged consequently. The objective of the proposed system is to address these limitations with a novel approach of using Multi-Agent technology for instant ride matching between drivers and riders. Interaction between dedicated agents takes care of matching rides and possible uncertainties. Effective communication of users with the service provider is achieved through their mobile devices. The architecture of this system targets a robust rideshare application, which constantly takes care of users´ ride requirements without the need for frequent interventions.

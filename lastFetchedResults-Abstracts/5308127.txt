Nowadays, in many countries the increase of generating capacity takes place in small units of so-called distributed generation (DG), and among them in hybrid power (generating) systems (HPS). They use primary energy conventional sources as well as renewable energy sources (RES), and in many cases produce electricity and heat (CHP). It is very often that definition of distributed generation is connected with definition of renewable energy sources. Using of renewable energy sources is one of the crucial components of the sustainable development, giving rationale economic, ecological and social effects. Support for development of renewable energy sources utilization became very important objective within the European Union. In this article present state and perspectives of using of renewable energy sources and distributed generation in Poland are depicted as well as the main tools promoting their development and utilization.

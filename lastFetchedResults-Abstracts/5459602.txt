This article has the objective of showing the advantages of the graph chain representation (GCR) for distribution system reconfiguration. First of all, the combinatorial characteristic inherent to the reconfiguration problem of distribution systems is shown. Afterward, the GCR is briefly presented. In the following, the same equations are proposed in order to establish the advantages of the GCR for the representation of a general graph without closed chains with n connected component. Finally, the GCR advantages for the distribution system reconfiguration in the Sao Carlos city (which may be considered a fairly large distribution system) are shown

It is important to evaluate Building Life Cycle Energy Consumption which is the key problem of building energy-saving. In order to get the global optimization for the whole Building Life Cycle (BLC), the multi-objective optimization model is proposed in this paper. Ant colony algorithm is applied to analyze the BLC and find the minimum of energy consumption. This research will assist the implementation of Building Information Model(BIM) in the building energy-saving designing.

Background and Objective: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common thyroid malignancy. Expression of BCL-2, an apoptosis inhibitor, is higher in papillary thyroid carcinoma cells. Prognosis of PTC is associated with some factors such as age, gender, tumor size, capsular invasion and lymph node involvement. The aim of this study was to demonstrate relation between BCL-2 oncoprotein expression and these prognostic factors in PTC.

Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 85 pathology samples of PTC patients were analyzed for capsular invasion and BCL-2 oncoprotein expression by immunohistochemistry method. Other data such as age, gender, tumor size and lymph node involvement were collected from clinical records of patients. Data were analyzed by SPSS. 

Results: The mean age was 40.8 ±16.4 years (75 females and 10 males). The mean tumor size was 3.7±2.2 cm. Meanwhile, 11 samples had capsular invasion and the others were negative. Lymph node involvement was positive in 19 samples (22.3%). The BCL-2 expression was positive in 71 samples (87.1 %). There was no significant relation between BCL-2 expression and lymph node involvement and capsular invasion. A significant relation was seen between tumor size and BCL-2 expression. BCL-2 expression was associated with a larger tumor size. 

Conclusion: BCL-2 expression in PTC patients was high and has relation with tumor size. Lymph node involvement and capsular invasion have not any relation with BCL-2 expression.

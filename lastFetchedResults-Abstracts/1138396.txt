A design procedure, combining the geometry of the scroll profiles constructed from an involute of circle with variable radii into the CAE, has been developed. Thermal and structural analyses by means of the finite element method have been investigated in this study. When compared to the conventional scroll profile with the same suction volume, volume ratio and housing size, this new design confirms the smaller radial and axial deformations, and with better rigidity by carrying out the parametric studies. The reduction in the radial deformation of the scroll wrap is far larger than that in the axial deformation because of the lower wrap height and the wrap becomes thicker at the center as it decreases from the inside outwards. The increasing orbiting radius and the decreasing wrap volume also compromise each other to make an acceptable little increment in centrifugal force of the orbiting scroll. One of the studied cases has been recommended as the optimum solution towards the specified design objective and constraints.

The exponential growth of video traffic is expected to reach 62% of the global Internet traffic by the end of 2015 [1]. This presents as a significant challenge for the television service providers who need to employ networking technologies to monitor specific Quality of Service (QoS) parameters such as packet loss rate, jitter and delay, to ensure an acceptable level of quality. However, recent research has demonstrated that the quality experienced by the end-user does not correlate to the QoS parameters employed by most service providers [2]. This paper investigates the correlation between the QoS parameters and the quality perceived by the end. user. These results indicate that although the QoS parameters may sometimes achieve high correlation with respect to the quality perceived by the viewer, they still have large variances. This suggests that the QoS parameters are not enough to quantify the subjective quality with a high level of confidence. This work further compares a number of existing objective video quality metrics. The results presented in this paper show that the Full-Reference Motion based Video Integrity Evaluation (MOVIE) metric and the Spatio-Temporal Reduced Reference Entropic Differences (STRRED) metric achieve excellent correlation with the subjective scores. This research also demonstrates that the STRRED metric and its derivatives have several advantages over the MOVIE metric since less information needs to be transmitted and it is less computationally intensive.

This paper focuses on the high accuracy geo-location and co-registration performance operationally obtained for the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data via a robust production algorithm. The MISR instrument (which is part of the payload for NASA's Terra spacecraft) continuously acquires systematic, global, multi-angle imagery in reflected sunlight since it was launched in December 1999, with the objective of supporting ecology and climate studies. The moderate resolution data need to be autonomously geo-rectified prior to being used in subsequent scientific retrievals. This is particularly critical to the unique cloud height/wind retrievals which require sub-pixel co-registration accuracies on a global basis. In order to address this problem, the MISR ground data processing system is based on a fully photogrammetric approach and is complemented with a quality monitoring system used to verify performance globally and over desired time periods. The geo-rectification requirements were developed from a series of data quality investigations based partially on sensitivity requirements for the cloud height/wind retrieval algorithm. An update to the nominal production algorithm has been implemented, and the final operational results are presented in this paper.

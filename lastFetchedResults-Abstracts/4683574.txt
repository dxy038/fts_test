The objective of this paper is to present algorithm to create panorama images from stitching image sequences taken by camera on mobile phone with the Android operating system. The images for stitching to create panorama are captured in a fixed linear spatial interval and the orientation information are obtained from the sensors on the Android mobile phone. The processing method involves image warping to cylindrical projection coordinates, image matching based on SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) method as the feature detection and neighboring pairs alignment using RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) algorithm. The average weighted linear blending is applied to remove the transition between the aligned images. The presented image stitching algorithm is successfully able to create panorama image on the Android mobile phone.

A self-structuring electromagnetic scatterer (SSES) based on a novel conductor-backed template is proposed. The SSES with an embedded search algorithm can alter its electrical shape to fulfill different scattering objectives, such as RCS reduction (RCSR) or enhancement (RCSE). Each constituent element in this conductor-backed SSES template has a larger tuning phase range so that it outperforms the previous version without back conducting plane. The proposed SSES template with multiple-objective fitness function being used in the search algorithm is capable of RCSR or RCSE at not only one single specified direction but also within an angular range. The performance of the SSES is verified by full-wave simulations.

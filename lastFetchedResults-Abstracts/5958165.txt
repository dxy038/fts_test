This work presents an isolated full-bridge bidirectional DC/DC converter for battery charging/discharging operation. In the proposed scheme, the full-bridge isolated topology is used for the DC-DC conversion. The full bridge scheme is widely used for the high power application. High frequency transformer is used for isolation purpose. This paper deals with the effect of leakage inductance of high frequency transformer in the charging mode as well as discharge mode of operation. Phase shifted topology is used as control scheme. Effect of leakage inductance on output voltage, output current is shown in simulation. Simulation results are obtained using PSIM Software with a 7.75-kW load. Test result is given for effectiveness of the study. Battery rating 310 V, 25 A.

Objective
jective of this study was to investigate the association between pain and mood and anxiety disorders, as well as psychological symptoms, in a population-based sample of women.
s
tudy examined the data collected from 1067 women aged 20–93 years (median 51 years) participating in the Geelong Osteoporosis Study. Mood and anxiety disorders were diagnosed using a clinical interview (SCID-I/NP) and psychological symptomatology was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire. Pain was determined using a Visual Analogue Scale (0–100 mm) and deemed present if score ≥ 40 mm.
s
t mood disorders were associated with an increased likelihood of overall (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 2.0–5.1), headache (OR = 2.8, 95% CI 1.6–4.8), back (OR = 4.0, 95% CI 2.5–6.5) and shoulder pain (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.2–4.2). In those with current mood disorders, the pain interfered with daily activities (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.9–5.5) and was present most of their time awake (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.5–4.1). This pattern was similarly observed for those with past mood disorders. Current anxiety disorders were associated with an increased likelihood for overall (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.4–3.6), headache (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.3–4.0), back (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.1–3.0) and shoulder pain (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.0–3.5, p = .05). In those with current anxiety disorders, the pain interfered with daily activities (OR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.4–4.1) and was present most of their time awake (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.2–3.2). There was no association between pain and past anxiety. Psychological symptomatology was associated with pain at each site (all p &lt; .001).
sions
tudy is consistent with studies utilising clinical samples in reporting that mood and anxiety disorders, as well as psychological symptoms, are associated with higher levels of perceived pain.

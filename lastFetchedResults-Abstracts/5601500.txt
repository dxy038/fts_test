An inverse finite-element method for the design of nonlinear magnetic devices is presented. The objective of applying the finite-element method in an inverse manner is to yield the optimum geometry while maintaining the operating performance requirements of the device. A nonlinear iron-cored inductance coil, which involves a relatively complex magnetic circuit topology, was used as an application of the method. Several design problems in which certain output quantities are specified, while the geometry was determined by the inverse procedure have been studied. The results were verified using standard finite-element programs, and were found to be in complete agreement

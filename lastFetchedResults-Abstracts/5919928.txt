In spite of ABC theory was developed in parallel with pq theory, the second has been more widely used for reactive power compensation due to its flexibility. Indeed, conventional ABC theory is simple and efficient for balanced voltage sources but induces undesired zero sequence currents whether the voltage source is unbalanced. In addition, only one compensation objective is achieved. This paper presents a generalization of ABC theory taking into account not only conventional balanced and pure sinusoidal voltage source but also unbalances and harmonic voltage distortion. Four different compensations objectives are studied: Constant instantaneous active power, unity power factor, constant power and pure sinusoidal current. It is demonstrated this theory is as flexible as pq theory with a simpler implementation. Furthermore, proposed theory optimizes line currents and therefore minimizes network losses. A simulation study using PSIM is presented which considers the switching effect of the shunt converter and the control of its DC link.

The objective of the present study was to estimate genetic parameters for post-weaning
traits in Kermani sheep. Traits were included 6-month weight (6MW), 9-month weight
(9MW), yearling weight (YW), greasy fleece weight at first shearing (GFW) and greasy
fleece weights at various shearings (RFW). Data and pedigree information used in this
research were collected at Breeding Station of Kermani sheep during 1993â€“2004. Genetic
parameterswere estimated with single- and multi-traits analysis using restrictedmaximum
likelihood (REML) procedures, under animal models. Log likelihood ratio test indicated
the most appropriate model for 6MW and 9MW should included direct additive genetic
effects as well as maternal permanent environmental effects. However the most appropriate
model for YW and GFW had only the direct additive genetic effects. The effects of
sex, age of dam and year of birth were significant on body weight traits (P < 0.01). GFW
was influenced significantly by sex and year of birth (P < 0.01) but was not affected by
age of dam (P > 0.05). Type of birth was no significant effect on studied traits (P > 0.05).
Also, the age of lamb at weighing time was a significant influence on 6MW, 9MW and
YW. Direct heritability estimates for 6MW, 9MW, YW and GFW were 0.32, 0.03, 0.15 and
0.15, respectively. Maternal permanent environmental estimates of 0.09 were obtained for
6MW and 9MW. Genetic correlation estimates between mentioned traits ranged from 0.51
to 0.99. Phenotypic correlations were generally lower than those of genetic correlation
and varied from 0.05 to 0.79 for various traits. The environmental correlations estimates
between GFW with growth traits were low, but between other traits were positive and
high, ranged from 0.54 to 0.72. The value of repeatability estimated for greasy fleeceweight
was 0.22.

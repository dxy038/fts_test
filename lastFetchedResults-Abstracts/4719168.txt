We propose the semi-Markov decision process (S-MDP) model-based stochastic optimization scheme for QoS-guaranteed services in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) multicell cooperation networks. Our objective is to efficiently maximize the power efficiency at the base stations while guaranteeing the diverse QoS provisionings for mobile users through the multicell cooperation resource allocation. Considering the wireless cellsÂ´ varying traffic load, user mobility, and the channel state information (CSI), we propose the optimal resource control scheme, in terms of the subcarrier and power allocations for each mobile user in each mobile cell. In particular, we apply the multicell cooperation for increasing power efficiency and also develop the interference penalty-driven resource allocation algorithm for mitigating intercell interference. We also develop and evaluate the stochastic optimization for the multicell cooperation networks.

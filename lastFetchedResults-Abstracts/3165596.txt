A non-parametric (i.e. data objective) method of modeling nonlinear dynamic behavior of respiratory gas exchange system during high-frequency ventilation (HFV) is presented. The non-parametric approach is based on WienerÂ´s theory of system identification by use of broad-band random test inputs. The model has the form of nonlinear functional relation between input tracheal flow and output tracheal CO<inf>2</inf> tension. The motivation for this study is provided by the Importance of HFV as a form of artificial respiration. At present, none of the work done in modeling the phenomenon of gas exchange system is capable of explaining the nonlinear dynamic behavior of this system under HFV condition. The developed model increases our understanding of the respiratory gas exchange system, and should provide a more accurate approach to clinical assessments.

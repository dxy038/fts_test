Background and objective: Association of 6q loci, where IGF2R gene is located, with insulin resistance has been well established. In this study, relationship between 3'UTR and type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance indices in non diabetic subjects was investigated.
Materials and Methods: 350 participants (175 diabetic type 2 patient and 175 non-diabetic individuals) were entered in this study. Demographic data were collected. BMI and serum levels of glucose, lipid profiles and IGF2 of all participants were measured. Genotype polymorphism of studied participants was determined by PCR-RFLP method. Then, the relationship between genotypes and insulin resistance indices was measured and analyzed using statistical procedures of ANOVA and post hoc analysis.
Results: The genotypes frequency comprised CC (6.85%), AA (33.45%), and CA (59.55%), indicating that the frequency of carrier with CA genotype polymorphism was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in type 2 diabetic patients (80.6%) than in non-diabetic participants. Serum FBS levels of CA carriers were significantly (P=0.001) higher than carriers of other two genotypes (CC and AA). The mean levels of serum IGF2 in participants carrying CC and CA genotypes were significantly (P= 0.001) more than other participants carrying genotype AA.
Conclusion: (C > A) IGF2R3?UTR polymorphism was associated with type 2 diabetes and some insulin resistance indices especially FBS. However, the A allele may have a protective effect on developing type 2 diabetes.

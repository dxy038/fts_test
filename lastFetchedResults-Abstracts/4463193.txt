Data warehousing is one of the important approaches for data integration and data preprocessing. The objective of this project is to develop a web-based interactive courseware to help beginner data warehouse designers to reinforce the key concepts of data warehousing using a case study approach. The case study is to build a data warehouse for a university student enrollment prediction data mining system. This data warehouse is able to generate summary reports as input data files for a data mining system to predict future student enrollment. The data sources include: (1) the enrollment data from California State University, Sacramento and (2) the related public data of California. The courseware is designed to build the data warehouse systematically using a set of 4 demonstrations covering the following data warehousing topics: fundamentals, design principle, building an enterprise data warehouse using incremental approach, and aggregation.

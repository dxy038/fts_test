Background and Objective: The aim of this study was to compare dietary intake of vitamin D and
the serum levels of25(OH) D3 in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with those of normal subjects.
Material and Methods: Patients (31women and 6 men) were recruited from the MS Clinic of
Jundi-Shapur University, Ahvaz, Iran. The control group consisted of 37 healthy age/gender- and
physical activity-matched subjects living within a similar catchments area. Information on sunshine
exposure and the consumption of vitamin D-rich foods was obtained through interviews and a food
frequency questionnaire.
Results: Severe vitamin D deficiency was seen in over one-third of both groups (33% of the
patients and 37% of the controls). There was no significant difference in the serum level of 25(OH)
D3 between the 2 groups. The serum concentration of 25(OH) D3 in those individuals of the
healthy group who had a lower daily sunshine exposure Â«30 min) was lower than that of those with
a higher exposure (>30 min/d) (p<005). Duration of sunshine exposure did not significantly affect
the serum 25 (OH) D3 concentration in the patients, The data also showed that the serum vitamin D
levels had no statistically significant association with the consumption of fish, butter, cream, or
eggs in either group,
Conclusion: Severe vitamin D deficiency was seen in more than one-third of both the MS patients
and healthy subjects, There was no association between the duration of sunshine exposure and
dietary intake of vitamin D in the patients, However, in the healthy subjects higher sunshine
exposure was associated with higher serum levels of vitamin D,

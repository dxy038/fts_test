The joint routing and power allocation problem in a wireless full-duplex network with imperfect interference cancellation and a single source destination pair is solved. Our simplified interference model focuses on the effects of full-duplex by including residual self-interference and one hop interference while other interfering signals are assumed to be negligible. First, the optimal power allocation for a fixed route is identified. Then a modification of DijkstraÂ´s algorithm is used to find the joint route and power allocation to maximize throughput. Due to interference, the algorithm proposed has a non decomposable objective function; however, it is efficiently solved for every candidate route. Our solution in a full interference model, that does not ignore any interference, is at most a constant bound away from the optimal solution in the full interference model. Through simulations we evaluate several scenarios and show the behavior of the solution in both interference models.

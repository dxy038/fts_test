The paper considers a method to start the motor with permanent magnets, the definition initial the position of the rotor and the use of Observing System for speed. Feature of the system is the lack of sensors of the rotor position and speed. The article provides a description of the method for determining the initial position of the rotor converter control system, the results of mathematical modeling of this system.

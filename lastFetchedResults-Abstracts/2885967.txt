This paper presents a numerical approach for a scatterer localization based on the non-radiating equivalent source. We have been able to localize a scatterer by minimizing the non-radiating objective function and applying some constraints. Simulation is also used to validate its performance. The scatterer localization approach can be utilized as an EMISS calibration process for high-frequency tomographic imaging.

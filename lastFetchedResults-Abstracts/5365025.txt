In this paper a study on different Radio Resource Management (RRM) methods employed in a multi-carrier cellular system is presented. This work focuses on the rate-adaptive resource allocation (sub-carriers and power), as well as the utility-based packet scheduling algorithms. The objective of the paper is to study the trade-off between system spectral efficiency and fairness among the users when the considered algorithms are used.

The European School of Antennas (ESoA) is at its sixth year of life. Since its foundation in January 2005, this school had the objective to provide European training to PhD students, early stage researchers and young engineers in industry in antennas, propagation, and electromagnetic applications. This paper presents the objective of ESoA, the results, and the impact on the antennas and propagation community in the triennium 2007-2009.

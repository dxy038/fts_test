We propose a flatbed-type three-dimensional (3D) display system for multiple users as an improved version of our previous thin natural 3D display based on the ray reconstruction method. This is a tool for communication around a 3D image among a small number of people. It is a flatbed-type autostereoscopic 3D display system. It consists of a flat panel display and an improved holographic lens array sheet. Its notable feature is the ability to display natural 3D images which are visible to multiple viewers at the same time. Moreover, 3D real images float over the proposed flatbed-type display. Thus, proposed display allows two or more people surrounding it to simultaneously observe floating 3D images from their own viewpoints. The prototype display can be observed a 3D image from two directions, and it consists of an LCD and an improved bidirectional holographic lens array sheet. The number of the 3D pixels in each direction is 27 x 20. Reconstructed two 3D images are superimposed over the display. The reconstructed 3D image can be displayed from 72 mm in front of the display to 72 mm behind of the display. This paper describes a flatbed-type 3D display system, and also describes the experimental results.

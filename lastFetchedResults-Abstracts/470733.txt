Objective
Advanced glycation end-products are considered to be markers of oxidative stress and to be involved in the atherosclerotic process. We investigated skin autofluorescence, which reflected advanced glycation end-product accumulation, in recently preeclamptic women and its relationship with intima-media thickness, which is a marker of atherosclerosis.
Study design
Skin autofluorescence of the arm and leg was measured in 26 preeclamptic women and 17 control subjects at 3 to 13 months after delivery. Lipid profiles, smoking habits, and intima-media thickness of 5 carotid and femoral artery segments were recorded.
Results
The preeclampsia group was younger and had higher values for blood pressure, insulin resistance, common femoral artery intima-media thickness, and skin autofluorescence of the leg. With the use of linear regression analysis, the difference in leg autofluorescence was explained only by preeclampsia. In the preeclampsia group, skin autofluorescence of the leg correlated with smoking and common femoral artery intima-media thickness.
Conclusion
These results support the hypothesis of accelerated atherosclerosis in recently preeclamptic women and the possible involvement of advanced glycation end-product accumulation.

Basically, behaviour of dielectric materials is experimentally described by the electrical conductivity and the dielectric permittivity measurements over the necessary frequency range from the very low up to the very high frequencies. The whole field of dielectric measurements covers a wide frequency range requiring a large number of tools and laborious frequency domain techniques. This is why, for some decades, Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) methods have seemed to be the alternative to the point by point approach in the Frequency Domain. The objective of this paper is to present an approach of models describing the polarization mechanisms including dielectric relaxation and electrical conductivity.

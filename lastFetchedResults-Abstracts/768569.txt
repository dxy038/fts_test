The objective of this study was to clarify the development of the stapes in humans and its relationship with the
cartilage of the second branchial arch. The study was carried out in 25 human embryos between 6 and 28 mm
crown-rump length. The stapes develops at the cranial end of the second branchial arch through an independent
anlage of the cartilage of this arch. Between the stapedial anlage and the cranial end of the Reichertâ€™s cartilage
there is a formation called the interhyale, the internal segment of which gives rise to the tendon of the stapedial
muscle. The stapedial anlage is a unique formation with two distinct parts: the superior part that will comprise the
base and the inferior part that will be crossed by the stapedial artery during embryonic development and will constitute
the limbs and the head of the stapes. According to the results, the otic capsule is not involved in formation
of the base of the stapes.

Introduction & Objective : The objective of this study was to determine the evaluation of intrathecal sufentanil for labor analgesia with respect to duration of labor stages and relief of pain during labor.

Materials & Methods : In a clinical trial 60 subjects with ASA class I were selected and randomly divided in two equal groups. 30 subjects had received sufentanil 10 jigr in 1 ml of saline during active phase of first stage of labor. The other group as controls, did not receive anything for analgesia. Parturient visual analog scale (VAS), HR, RR, BP, sensory and motor block, FHR and complications such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus and duration of stage I been monitored recorded and compared among those two groups.

Results : Comparison of results in two groups have showed that sufentanil does not prolong the duration of labor in stage 1 and 2. We observed lack of hypotension and respiratory depression in sufentanil group FHR changes that had been associated with adverse neonatal out come had not occurred. The apgar scores in two groups were identical. There was itching in majority of parturient who had received sufentanil (83.3%). The pruritus were defined as mild and moderate.

Conclusion : Intrathecal sufentanil provide a good analgesia in stage I labor and does not prolong the duration of labor with minimum adverse effects on parturient and fetus.

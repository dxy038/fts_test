In a competitive market, quality is essential to the software. Software test plays an important role during the software-developing period. Any saving on software test will greatly reduce the total cost of software. The key point of this paper is to build a software test process with the cost control management and to make tradeoff between the quality and the cost. Typical software testing model are analyzed and compared. A novel QC 3-D test model is introduced. The model combined with software test process, software quality cost and testing type. The computational formula is defined to calculate software quality cost. A software quality balance law is introduced to balance control cost and failure cost. By adjusting software test method and strategy, organization can reach the objective of the best balance between software quality and cost. An enterprise case is studied and the result is analyzed to prove the basic law. The result shows an optimistic point that will prove the accurate of the model and the law

Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders which cause anovulatory infertility and hyperandrogenism in young women. The common feature in PCOS women is increased ovarian androgen secretion which can effect on the prevalence of miscarriage rate.
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of PCOS patient's serum on in vitro developmental stages of mouse embryo from two cells to hatching blastocyst.
Materials and Methods: After superovulating and fertilizing Balb/c mice, 219 two cells embryos were retrieved, 109 embryos were cultured in 10% PCOS patient's serum and 90% medium and 110 embryos were cultured in 10% normal serum and 90% medium to hatching blastocyst stage. The PCOS patient's serum which added to medium had higher hormonal concentrations than normal serum. The early developmental stages of embryos were studied in 2, 4, 8 cells, morula, early, late and hatching blastocyst stages.
Results: The statistical analysis confirmed the decreasing rate in the number of embryos in all developmental stages from 2 cells to hatching blastocyst in PCOS group in comparison with the normal group (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: The PCOS patient's serum causes the decreasing rate of in vitro development of the early stage in mouse embryos.

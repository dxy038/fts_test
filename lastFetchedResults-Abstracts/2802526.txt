For Intelligent Transportation Systems(ITS), dynamic traffic route choice is one of the most important technologies. Practical applications have shown that static route choice models can not meet passengersÂ´ travel demands, because route choice is a typical multi-objective programming problem affected by many dynamic factors, such as real-time traffic state, link travel time, traffic incident, intersection delay and so on. In this paper, I proposed a multi-objective dynamic route choice function with the minimum of link travel time and distance as the target, which travelers paid most attention to when they chose the route. Also I got travel time reliability as the model constraint to against the complexity and indetermination of traffic flow. And I obtained the link travel time by short-term forecasting based on measured traffic data of the network. Finally, in order to test its reliability, I established a simulation road network for realtime traffic data, and solved the model I put forward by improved genetic algorithm. Fortunately, I obtained an exciting result.

The paper demonstrates the application of the immune system reaction concept to sequential control by determining control sequences of sequential control plants modeled by PI*-nets, a sub-class of Petri nets with modular modeling characteristics. We propose an approach for finding control sequences based on the immune system response mechanism, where the problem is formulated as a firing sequence problem. The original problem is divided into several smaller sub-problems, the model itself is divided into several sub-models and local firing sequences that will compose the original model firing sequence are selected by interacting common transitions of these sub-models through local objective functions. Local objective functions are set dynamically by internal and inter sub-problem interactions based on the immune system response regulatory model. Simulations demonstrated the validity and promising performance of the proposed approach

In this paper, flow shop scheduling problem (FSSP) with parallel machine and special procedure constraint is studied. The scheduling objective is to minimize the makespan, and a genetic algorithm is presented for solving the optimization scheduling problem. Researches are made in aspects such as problem modeling, coding (decoding), crossover and mutation of genetic algorithm and so on. Digital computation results show the effectiveness of the proposed genetic algorithm.

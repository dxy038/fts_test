The United Nations Atlas of the Oceans (http://www.oceansatlas.org) has been developed by various groups (UN and national agencies and NGOs) and individuals having an interest in the sustainability of oceans and coastal areas. Its objective is to contribute to sustainable development of the oceans and coastal areas and to the advancement of ocean science through development and assembly of information and a means to disseminate it. The Atlas is Internet-based and was opened to the global community in June 2002. It is designed for policy makers, scientists and resource managers but is also a major attraction to the public and students. The Atlas includes: 1. an encyclopedic About the Oceans section - from how oceans were formed, to their physiology, biology, and climatology, including maps and data bases; 2. the Uses of the oceans - from sources of food, livelihood, recreation and energy to conservation, shipping, mining; and, 3. Ocean Issues - such as food security, governance, global change, and pollution. Scientists and engineers in many types of organizations and teachers and students at all levels are already heavy users of the Atlas. There are 12 formal (signed MOU) and 12 less formal partners participating in the development of the Atlas. It has become a valuable tool for learning about oceans and their sustainability.

The objective of this research was to discriminate the best dietetic cookies formulation for diabetic and heart patients. For this purpose, isomalt up to 36% of flour weight was used as a substitute for sucrose. As a result, blood sugar and insulin levels did not change significantly after consumption. Licorice root powder (1, 2, and 3%) was added for maintenance and producing desirable flavor. In addition green tea extract was used for its high antioxidant capacity. Green tea extract can be effective against diabetes, because it boosts insulin activity in the body. Olive oil was also used in the formulation to reduce glucose levels, LDL and triacylglycerol levels in blood. Based on chemical analysis (moisture, protein, fat, ash and carbohydrate content) and organoleptic analysis, an optimized formulation determined for production of a dietetic and low calorie cookies.  Addition of licorice root at level of 3% produced a significant bitter after taste but 2% licorice root did not affect flavor desirability and total acceptance (P < 0.05). Addition of 4% green tea extract and 3% olive oil did not have significant effect on flavor, texture and water content of the product. Blood glucose concentrations of six non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients were compared using duncans multiple range test after 0, 1 and 2h of consumption of control and sample 2. Fasting blood sugar levels of these patients did not have significant differences (P < 0.05) but after 1h, blood glucose concentration in patients that consumed control sample was increased significantly.

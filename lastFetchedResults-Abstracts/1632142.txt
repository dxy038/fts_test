The primary objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of reducing reagents on the hybrids from cellulose and Ag, which have been successfully synthesized by using fructose and glucose as reducing reagents via a hydrothermal method, respectively. The hybrids were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential thermal analysis (DTA). The influences of the various reaction parameters including the heating time, heating temperature, and types of reducing reagents on the hybrids were investigated. Silver particles can be better dispersed in the cellulose matrix by adjusting reaction parameters. Experimental results demonstrated that the types of reducing reagents played an important role in the shape and dispersion of silver particles in hybrids.

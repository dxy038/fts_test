The goal of this study is to better understand the thermal characteristics and molecular behavior of two poly(desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine arylates). These two polymers were chosen from a combinatorial library of polymers developed by changing the type and size of the two substitutable chain locations. The objective of this work was to describe the origin of the complex relaxation processes that have been observed by thermal analysis methods. DSC, TMA and TSC studies were conducted on poly(desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine dodecyl dodecanedioate), poly(DT 12,10), and poly(desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine ethyl succinate), poly(DT 2,2), in film and fiber form. DSC experiments on poly(DT 2,2) show only a glass transition at about 80 °C which is characteristic of an amorphous polymer. The DSC of poly(DT 12,10) shows multiple thermal events indicative of a more complex internal structure. The thermally stimulated current (TSC) analysis results for poly(DT 2,2) indicate a region of molecular mobility at about 80 °C consistent with the Tg from DSC. For poly(DT 12,10) there is a dipole relaxation process observed at about 40 °C. An additional region of mobility at 60 °C for poly(DT 12,10) fibers is observed. The comparison of conventional TSC with a modified TSC procedure suggests that this process represents a spontaneous reorganization of the internal structure of the solid. The comparison of DSC and TSC results suggests that poly(DT 12,10) has two distinct modes of organization with a transition between these modes at about 60 °C. Previously published results indicate that solid state structure formation is related to two different modes of hydrogen bonding in the internal structure of the solid.

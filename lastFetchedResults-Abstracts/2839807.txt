Social media online forum is one of the most popular platforms used by students to communicate. Unfortunately, these media have been hijacked by people to plan and commit online fraud and societal evils. Some of the secondary and university campuses in Nigeria have been turned to cultist environments leading to killings and anarchy amongst students. This situation has defied solutions in most tertiary institutions in the country, particularly in the public institutions. The objective of this paper is to provide an anti-cultism social media educational system that will be accessed using three modes: Web, Mobile and Voice. The system will support learning and interaction on campus while at the same time helping to curb cultism on campus through filtering of communicated social media keywords that are cultism or crime related, among students. In carrying out this project, appropriate research methods and implementation tools were deployed. The project offers a multimodal platform that will foster and encourage active learnersÂ´ participation in the school system.

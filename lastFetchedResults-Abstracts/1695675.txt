The objective of this sudy was to detection of polymorphis in IGF-1 gene and its association with milk producton and growth traits in Mahabadi goats using PCR-SSCP method. For this purpose, blood samples were taken from 140 (89 mature goats and 51 kiddings) Mahabadi goats reared in the farm of department of animal Scince Tehran University(Karaj). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood using modified salting out method.The Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) used to amplify of 326 bp fragment of exon 4 of IGF-I gene. PCR products were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gel (method SSCP) and stained with silver nitrate method to distinguish different patterns.The results revealed two band patterns.The frequency of two Patterns is 65.7% and 34.2% respectively. The polymorphism of  the IGF-I gene were associated with milk production(p < 0.05), But fat percent, protein percent, somatic cell count and  also birth weight, weaning weight,daily gain, feed intake and final weight among two genotypes were showen not significantly.

This paper analyses the relation between two slot-based contention resolution algorithms for channel reservation namely UNI and CAP. For each algorithm the system performance is derived as a function of the number of request slots per frame and the number of users. The objective of this paper is to investigate the relationship between the UNI and CAP schemes. A relation of these two techniques is mathematically derived in details. The numerical results show that in a special case where the permission probability of CAP is set to 1/number of remaining users the CAP becomes the UNI.

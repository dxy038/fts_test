Black Sea Tele Diab, a diabetes computer system and communications network for the Black Sea region, is a new multidisciplinary research project, led by Sheffield University, UK, and supported by the EU Inco-Copernicus programme, whose aim is to promote the exchange of healthcare information between clinicians and scientists in countries of the Black Sea area to provide a means by which the care of patients with diabetes may be enhanced. In this project, the first objective is the building of a modern communication infrastructure for the transfer of clinical data, including text, sound, waveforms and images, by structured E-mail among institutions in each participating country. Since this is new to most medical doctors, the aim of this research was to develop a few standard instructions for the storage and transfer of medical information and healthcare data between the national district centres and the transnational centres in the Black Sea area

Web service is expected to be one of the most important resources on the Internet. However, as Web services proliferate, itÂ´s more and more difficult to compose them into complex yet new and useful web processes automatically. In view of the poor accuracy and low efficiency of Web service composition on current Internet, this paper based on a novel service infrastructure named Service Network, utilizes the precedence, exact, subsume and so on semantic relations between services to create a service semantic relation graph in the interface layer, and adopts a Kth shortest path algorithm implemented with bidirectional search to get the K service chains that cost minimum Qos. Finally, the experiments show that the approach proposed in this paper can greatly improve the accuracy and efficiency of service composition.

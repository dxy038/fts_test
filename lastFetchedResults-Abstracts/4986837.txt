Testing Global software differs from conventional software testing in that the test design approach and the testing methods must consider the defined and implied issues of specific culture, language, date format, and currency format. In the case of Bidirectional software testing (Software targeting Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, and Urdu markets) there are many unique and crucial aspects that require thorough and carefully planned and executed tests. In this paper we propose testing methods that can be used to test critical aspects of bi-directional software in general and specifically Arabic software. These testing methods are discussed in the context of the Dynamic Systems Development Methodology (DSDM) process lifecycle that integrate internationalization (I18 n) and localization(L10 n) processes into the software lifecycle.

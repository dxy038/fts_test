In this note, we discuss finite-time state consensus problems for multi-agent systems and present one framework for constructing effective distributed protocols, which are continuous state feedbacks. By employing the theory of finite-time stability, we investigate both the bidirectional interaction case and the unidirectional interaction case, and prove that if the sum of time intervals, in which the interaction topology is connected, is sufficiently large, the proposed protocols will solve the finite-time consensus problems.

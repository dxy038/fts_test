A network wide zone-based bidirectional tree is constructed to achieve more efficient membership management and multicast delivery. The position information is used to guide the zone structure building, multicast tree construction, and multicast packet forwarding, which efficiently reduces the overhead for route searching and tree structure maintenance. Several strategies have been proposed to further improve the efficiency of the protocol. Making use of the position information to design a scalable virtual-zone-based scheme for efficient membership management, which allows a node to join and leave a group quickly. Geographic unicast is enhanced to handle the routing failure due to the use of estimated destination position with reference to a zone and applied for sending control and data packets between two entities so that transmissions are more robust in the dynamic environment Supporting efficient location search of the multicast. Group members, by combining the location service with the membership management to avoid the need and overhead of using a separate location server. An important concept zone depth, which is efficient in guiding the tree branch building and tree structure maintenance, especially in the presence of node mobility. Nodes self-organizing into zones, zone-based bidirectional-tree-based distribution paths can be built quickly for efficient multicast packet forwarding.

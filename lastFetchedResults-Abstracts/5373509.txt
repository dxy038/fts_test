The metaheuristic are approximate methods which deal with difficult optimization problems. Work that we present in this paper has primarily as an objective of presented the adaptation and the implementation of one of advanced metaheuristic which is the Electromagnetism Metaheuristic (EM) applied to the systems of production of the type Hybrid Flow Shop (FSHs) for the scheduling and the assignment problem. Electromagnetism Metaheuristic is a recent method of optimization which takes its inspiration in the electromagnetic law (attraction and repulsion) of Coulomb on the charged particles. For this metaheuristic, we will start by presenting his general principle, its principle algorithm, its most important main features and parameters like its scopes of application. We will propose then an adaptation of this method to the discrete case on the scheduling problems of the production systems of the type Hybrid Flow Shop (FSHs). We present then the comparison between the metaheuristics (Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization method (PSO)), and the hybrid metaheuristic (Electromagnetism Metaheuristic EM) applied to the same FSHs problem. Finally we will present the results obtained by this method (EM) applied to FSHs for the two problems: scheduling and assignment.

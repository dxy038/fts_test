The objective of this paper is to explore feasibility of using arm blood pressure cuff pulse waveforms for estimation of hemodynamics. An experimental dual-cuff system was used to acquire pulse waveforms during blood pressure determination procedure. The waveforms from the wrist cuff and the arm cuff were acquired simultaneously. Ten waveform segments were processed to determine stroke volume, cardiac output, left ventricular ejection time, systemic arterial compliance, and total peripheral resistance. Blood pressure values were also computed. The values from the arm cuff were compared with those from the wrist cuff. The results indicated that it may be possible to estimate hemodynamics from the arm cuff waveforms.

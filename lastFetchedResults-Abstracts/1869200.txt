Background and Objective: The Outbreak of human parasitic diseases associated with the consumption of raw vegetables often occurs in both developing and developed countries. This study aimed to evaluate parasitic contamination of edible vegetables in Golestan Province.
Material and Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in the cities of Golestan Province for six months, 2012.  The samples (N = 100) were randomly chosen among different vegetables (parsley, lettuce, radish, and cress), and examined for the presence of helminthic and protozoan parasitic contaminations following washing, centrifuging and sedimentation. 
Results: Thirty-seven (37%) were found to have parasitic contamination, and of these 30 (81.1%) and 7 (18.9%) were helminths and protozoa, respectively. The highest rate of contamination was detected in parsley (37.9%), and the lowest in radish (12.0%). Moreover, free living larva with 58.6% and Hymenolepis nana ova with 5.1% were the highest and lowest contaminated rates, respectively.
Conclusion: Based on our results, consumed vegetables in Golestan Province is considered as a potential risk for some human parasitic infections.

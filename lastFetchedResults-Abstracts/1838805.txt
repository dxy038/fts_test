The basic objective is the development of multifunctional multimaterial protective coatings using cold spraying (CS) and computer controlled detonation spraying (CCDS).

 as CS is concerned, the separate injection of each powder into different zones of the carrier gas stream is applied. Cu–Al, Cu–SiC, Al–Al2O3, Cu–Al2O3, Al–SiC, Al–Ti and Ti–SiC coatings are successfully sprayed. As to CCDS, powders are sprayed with a recently developed apparatus that is characterized by a high-precision gas supply system and a fine-dosed twin powder feeding system. Computer control provides a flexible programmed readjustment of the detonation gases energy impact on powder thus allowing selecting the optimal for each component spraying parameters to form composite and multilayered coatings. Several powders are sprayed to obtain composite coatings, specifically, among others, WC–Co–Cr + Al2O3, Cu + Al2O3, and Al2O3 + ZrO2.

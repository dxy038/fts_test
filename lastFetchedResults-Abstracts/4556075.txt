The transient performance of a small-scale plant consisting of a photovoltaic (PV) and a pumped hydro storage (PHS) system has been evaluated. An indirect field oriented control (IFOC) based state-vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) drive connects the plant to the distribution system. The drive system includes two six-pulse IGBT converters interconnected through a DC link, to which the PV plant is interfaced via a single-stage bidirectional boost converter. The electrical system of the PHS plant consists of a squirrel-cage induction machine supplied by the machine side converter. The hydraulic system of the PHS plant includes separate turbine and pump units where a scaled linearized model is adopted to represent the elastic water column and surge tank. In the present study, the PV generated power has a control scheme designed to regulate the performance of the overall system. Simulation results are provided that show the transient performance of the plant during pumping and generating cycles of the PHS system.

This paper gives a review based literature on latest researches done till now for scheduling of power plants. The most common of them is the Short-Term Multi Objective Hydro Thermal Scheduling, Nuclear power plant Scheduling, etc. Enormous algorithms and techniques had been implemented for the Short Term HTS. These techniques consist of both conventional and non-conventional techniques. The emphasis in this work is to cover the latest researches based on fuzzy logic which are helpful for scheduling of Hydro and Thermal Power plants for Short-term. The latest researches are in the direction to the fuzzy adaptability of existing conventional/soft-computing based approaches so that these algorithms become easier to understand and implement in physical world.

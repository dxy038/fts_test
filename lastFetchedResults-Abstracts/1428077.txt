Objective
estigate the association of early improvement and treatment emergent suicidal ideation in a large sample (N = 705) of naturalistically treated inpatients with major depressive disorder.

e with previous reports early improvement was defined as a 20% HAMD improvement within the first two weeks of antidepressant treatment. Treatment emergent suicidal ideation was defined by a sudden increase from 0 or 1 to at least 3 on HAMD item 3 and from 0.1 to at least 4 on MADR item 10 for suicidal ideation. Early improvers were compared with non-early improvers with respect to the occurrence of treatment emergent suicidality during treatment.
s
improvers were 3 (MADRS) to 3.4 (HAMD) times less likely to experience new emergence of suicidal ideation during the treatment course than non-improvers. In addition, early improvement was associated with significantly less pessimistic thoughts.
tions
alysis is based on secondary analysis of prospectively collected data. No controlled study design.
sion
improvement is associated with significantly less treatment emergent suicidal ideation for it may provide rapid symptom relief and reduce hopelessness.

This paper descirbes experimental tests about adopting improved PSO algorithm to solve the deficiency of QoS optimization in Web service composition. After web service composition problem is converted into a multi-objective optimization problem according to usersÂ´ requirements for Qos, improved PSO algorithm is adopted and repeatedly tests the optimization model by constantly adjusting the step size and learning factor. Experimental results show that the web service composition model by adopting finally determined step parameters could improve speed and performance for finding the optimal solution.

The ESA DUE project &#194;&#191;DIVERSITY aimed at supporting the implementation of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity by establishing dedicated information services based on repeatable approaches and earth observation data from space. The experiences gained in the project can support the objective of developing a Global Biodiversity Observation System with respect to data and products specifications and priorities.

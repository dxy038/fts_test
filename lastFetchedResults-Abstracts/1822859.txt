Objective
marize the phenotypic characters of Chinese X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED) subjects.

 affected and 24 carriers from seven Chinese pedigrees were recruited. The development of their hair, tooth, skin and sweat gland was (semi-)quantitatively evaluated. From 100 to 250 normal controls were used to exclude polymorphisms in each family.
s
ent from the previous reports, these Chinese subjects had more symmetrical and severe oligodontia. The mean number of permanent teeth missing was 23.5, and mandibular molars were preferentially affected. Compared to the age- and gender-matching controls, the affected had evident deep and well-defined facial wrinkles especially in the forehead, periorbital and cheek. Missing anterior teeth, conical canines and slow growth of hair were the main findings of female carriers. In addition, there was no evident relationship between phenotype and genotype.
sions
 best of our knowledge, this was the first semi-quantitative phenotypic report of subjects of Chinese descent.

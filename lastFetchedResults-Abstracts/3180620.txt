The H<sub>&#8734;</sub> filtering problem is considered for a class of nonlinear discrete-time systems for which a novel solution is developed by embedding the unscented transform technique into the extended H<sub>&#8734;</sub> filter structure. This article compares a Scale Unscented Transform H<sub>&#8734;</sub> filter (SUT H<sub>&#8734;</sub> - ) and UKF for the bearings-only tracking problem in Modified Polar Coordinates (MPC) and Cartesian coordinates (CC). Its objective is to track the kinematics (position, velocity) of a moving target using noise-corrupted bearing measurements. The SUT H<sub>&#8734;</sub> - filter achieves higher accuracy and robustness against model uncertainty. Simulation results for the bearings-only tracking (BOT) are presented to illustrate that the MPC is better than CC in long distance.

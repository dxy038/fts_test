The objective of this article is to discuss the clinical application values of multi-slice CT (MSCT) and image post-processing technique in the diagnosis of occult rib fracture. Method: after chest X-ray, 40 cases of chest trauma patients done 16 layers spiral CT scan, and the data from 16 layers spiral CT would be via the workstation to do multiple planar reconstruction (MPR) and volume reconstruction (VR) to rebuild images combined with axial images to make the diagnosis of fracture. For suspected fracture line we can use curved planner reconstruction (CRP) to make a diagnosis, and evaluate the situation of intrathoracic tissue after trauma. Results: 40 patients by used MSCT reconstruction, MSCT and reconstruction images found all the fracture showed by X-ray, 29 patients who were showed in X-ray failed to clear 36 rib fractures, and at the same time found 1 sternal fracture and 3 clavicle fractures which X-ray undiscovered, 3 cases of small amount pleural effusion, 2 cases of pulmonary contusion, 1 case of hepatic contusion, and 2 lumbar transverse process fracture. 2 patients with fake shadow because of respiratory motion, but reconstruction images show obvious false fracture line. Conclusion: MSCT thin layer image with post-processing reconstruction image is better diagnosis method for traumatic chest rib occult fracture, basically can satisfy the need of clinical for trauma caused by fracture and soft tissue injuries, hemopneumothorax, pulmonary contusion of thoracic trauma.

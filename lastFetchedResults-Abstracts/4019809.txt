High conversion efficiency is desired in switch mode power supply converters. Computer-aided design optimization is emerging as a promising way to design power converters. In this work a systematic optimization procedure is proposed to optimize LLC series resonant converter full load efficiency. A mode solver technique is proposed to handle LLC converter steady-state solutions. The mode solver utilizes numerical nonlinear programming techniques to solve LLC-state equations and determine operation mode. Loss models are provided to calculate total component losses using the current and voltage information derived from the mode solver. The calculated efficiency serves as the objective function to optimize the converter efficiency. A prototype 300-W 400-V to 12-V LLC converter is built using the optimization results. Details of design variables, boundaries, equality/inequality constraints, and loss distributions are given. An experimental full-load efficiency of 97.07% is achieved compared to a calculated 97.4% efficiency. The proposed optimization procedure is an effective way to design high-efficiency LLC converters.

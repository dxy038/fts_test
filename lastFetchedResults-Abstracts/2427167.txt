A posteriori error estimation and adaptive refinement technique for fracture analysis of 2-D/3-D crack problems is the state-of-the-art. The objective of the present paper is to propose a new a posteriori error estimator based on strain energy release rate (SERR) or stress intensity factor (SIF) at the crack tip region and to use this along with the stress based error estimator available in the literature for the region away from the crack tip. The proposed a posteriori error estimator is called the K–S error estimator. Further, an adaptive mesh refinement (h-) strategy which can be used with K–S error estimator has been proposed for fracture analysis of 2-D crack problems. The performance of the proposed a posteriori error estimator and the h-adaptive refinement strategy have been demonstrated by employing the 4-noded, 8-noded and 9-noded plane stress finite elements. The proposed error estimator together with the h-adaptive refinement strategy will facilitate automation of fracture analysis process to provide reliable solutions.

The biofilter and the ionisation system are two oxidative treatment techniques for purification of waste gas streams with low concentrations of volatile organic compounds. In this paper, the authors present the investigations of an ionisation technique aimed at increasing the efficiency of the reduction of the odorant concentration in waste gas streams from biological waste treatment plants. The objective is to enable advanced odour emission reduction and to adjust the existing biofilters to stricter requirements. In a first step, the odorous substances which are major contributors to the overall odorant concentration are identified on basis of various emission data sets with the help of a method of life cycle impact assessment. Thereby limonene, alpha-pinene, ethyl butyrate and dimethyl disulphide were identified as crucial indicators. In a second step, experimental investigations using limonene as a model compound were conducted to gain an understanding of the ionisation process itself and at last for the evaluation of the system.

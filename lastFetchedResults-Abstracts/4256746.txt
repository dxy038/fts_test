The modern power network incorporates communications and information technology infrastructures into the electrical power system to create a smart grid. The smart grid will utilize digital information technology to create a more efficient, reliable, flexible and responsive network. The objective of this paper is to apply the concept of real time analysis in a smart grid by developing a test-bed smart grid in power system laboratories. The laboratory experiment and analysis guarantee a high level of reliability when the smart grid is implemented in the actual field. Educational application of the laboratory-based smart grid and its real-time analysis capability, provide the platform for investigation of the most challenging aspects of real power system.

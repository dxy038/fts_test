The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is nearing the completion of a high voltage transmission system designed to integrate the power systems of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman. The objective of this paper is to review the underlying economics of electric supply within the GCC before interconnection, to evaluate the plans for further developments in generation by fuel type planned largely independent of the grid and finally to model and thereby provide an initial analysis of the market economics likely to exist once the countries are interconnected.

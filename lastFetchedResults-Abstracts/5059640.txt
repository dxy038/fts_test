This paper presents the reconfiguration of multicast tree at the instance of node migration in cellular wireless networks. We consider a novel, and highly practical, formulation of the real-time multicast problem. Unlike the traditional notion of source to leaf node message transmission time being the measure for real-time, we consider the multicast tree re-construction time (in the event of a node migration) as the measure for real-time constraints. The overall goal is to minimize both the delays-i): delay of re-constructing the multicast tree and ii) source to destination transmission delay. In this paper we introduce and provide solutions for the first objective, while the current research in real-time multicast tree considers the latter objective only. We propose three heuristics to solve the real-time multicast tree re-construction problem and present analysis and simulation results for different factors that contribute differently to the reconstruction delay

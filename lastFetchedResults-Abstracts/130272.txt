Objective: The aim of present study was to determine the maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) and maximum heart rate (HRmax) in chemically injured patients who had normal functional tests but suffer from exertional dyspenea, and to compare the data with predicted values.
Materials and Methods: VO2max and HRmax was measured in 19 chemically injured patients underwent the exercise test and then compared with predicted values.
Results: Data showed that measured VO2max and HRmax were significantly lower than predicted values (P<0.05). There was a relatively strong correlation between measured VO2max and HRmax (1=0.75, P<0.05).
Conclusion: VO2max and HR., in chemically injured individuals is lower than predicted values, in spite of normal functional tests it also seem possible to predict VO2max after determination .

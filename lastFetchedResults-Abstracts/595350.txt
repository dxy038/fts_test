Objective: To assess the results of conservative treatment of extension-type displaced supracondylar fractures of humerus in children. Material and Methods: This prospective study was conducted at the Accident & Emergency Department of Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar from Feb 2004 to Jan 2008. A total of 40 children having extension-type displaced supracondylar fracture of humerus (Gartland type II and III) were included in this study. They were treated with blind closed reduction of the fracture and a plaster of Paris back slab. Follow-up was done up to 12 months. Results: All the 40 children included in this study were in the age range of 1 year to 10 years. Among these 22 were males and 18 were females. There were 23 type II and 17 type III fractures according to Gartland classification. The outcome was graded according to Flynn criteria in to excellent, good, fair and poor. Out of 23 type-II fractures, 10 (43.47%) cases showed excellent results, 5 (21.73%) had good, 5(21.73%) had fair and 3 (13.04%) had poor results. Out of 17 type III fractures, 5 (29.41%) cases had excellent outcome, 3(17.64%) had good, 2(11.76%) had fair and 7(41.17%) had poor results. Conclusion: The results of this study were entirely satisfactory in Gratland type -II fractures. However the results were not good in type-III fractures which require other advanced techniques of secure fixation like closed pinning under image intensifier.

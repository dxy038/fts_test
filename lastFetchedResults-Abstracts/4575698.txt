This paper addresses evaluation of a decentralized procurement plan for the support of the discussion among decision-makers with considering a catastrophic disaster. For the evaluation of the decentralized procurement plan, we have formulated the decentralized procurement planning problem as 3-objective optimization problem. However, multiple-objective genetic algorithms (MOGA) to solve the problem take several minutes and display many Pareto solutions. We propose the interactive evaluation method of the decentralized procurement plan that is an expanded interactive MOGA (iMOGA) with loss evaluation simulator and solution selection by characteristics of the decentralized procurement plan. Experimental results show that the proposed method can allow the decision-makers to find their preference solutions with 38% fewer interactions than the basic iMOGA can.

The stochastic fluctuating offer of wind energy limits the capacity of supply in electrical grids by means of technical and economical reasons. To increase the supply, a concept of dynamic conditioning with the objective to increase the quality of supply was developed. This contribution describes the construction and the effect-principle of an electronic synchronous machine with active damper-circuit as well as its possible use to the energy respectively power conditioning and improvement of the power quality. The behaviour of synchronous machine is reproduced by static converters and short time storage. By the four-quadrant operation of the converters, short time fluctuation of the energy sources and changes of the load can be absorbed or smoothed directly on location. With the use of dynamic storage systems an intermediate storage of the stochastic offered primary energy is done. This low order energy can thereby be converted into high order recallable energy, which even can be used to satisfy peak demands. The local compensation of the fluctuation of the energy supply on the one hand and of the changes of the demand on the other hand, allows a more steady energy demand from the nationwide electrical grid.

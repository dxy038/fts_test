The objective was to determine the relationship of muscular and skeletal scores taken on the live animal and carcass conformation
and fat scores with carcass composition and value. Bulls (n548) and heifers (n537) of 0.75 to 1.0 late-maturing breed
genotypes slaughtered at 16 and 20 months of age, respectively, were used. At 8 months of age (weaning) and immediately
pre-slaughter, visual muscular scores were recorded for each animal and additionally skeletal scores were recorded pre-slaughter.
Carcass weight, kidney and channel fat weight, carcass conformation and fat scores, fat depth over the longissimus dorsi
muscle at the 12th (bulls) or 10th (heifers) rib and carcass length were recorded post-slaughter. Each carcass was subsequently
dissected into meat, fat and bone using a commercial dissection procedure. Muscular scores taken pre-slaughter showed positive
correlations with killing-out rate (rE0.65), carcass meat proportion (rE0.60), value (rE0.55) and conformation score
(rE0.70), and negative correlations with carcass bone (rE20.60) and fat (rE20.4) proportions. Corresponding correlations
with muscular scores at weaning were lower. Correlations of skeletal scores taken pre-slaughter, carcass length and carcass
weight with killing-out rate and the various carcass traits were mainly not significant. Carcass fat depth and kidney and channel
fat weight were negatively correlated with carcass meat proportion and value, and positively correlated with fat proportion.
Correlations of carcass conformation score were positive (r50.50 to 0.68) with killing-out rate, carcass meat proportion and
carcass value and negative with bone (rE20.56) and fat (rE20.40) proportions. Corresponding correlations with carcass
fat score were mainly negative except for carcass fat proportion (rE0.79). A one-unit (scale 1 to 15) increase in carcass
conformation score increased carcass meat proportion by 8.9 and 8.1 g/kg, decreased fat proportion by 4.0 and 2.9 g/kg and
decreased bone proportion by 4.9 and 5.2 g/kg in bulls and heifers, respectively. Corresponding values per unit increase in carcass
fat score were 211.9 and 29.7 g/kg, 12.4 and 9.9 g/kg, and 20.5 and 20.2 g/kg. Carcass conformation and fat scores explained
0.70 and 0.55 of the total variation in meat yield for bulls and heifers, respectively. It is concluded that live animal muscular
scores, and carcass conformation and fat scores, are useful indicators of carcass meat proportion and value.

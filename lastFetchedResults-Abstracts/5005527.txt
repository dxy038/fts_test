We consider the application of a conditional integrator based sliding mode control design for robust regulation of minimum-phase nonlinear systems to the control of the longitudinal flight dynamics of an F-16 aircraft. The design exploits the modal decomposition of the linearized dynamics into its short-period and phugoid approximations. The control design is based on linearization, but is implemented on the nonlinear multiple-input multiple-output longitudinal model of the F-16 aircraft. We consider model following for the angle-of- attack, with the regulation of the aircraft velocity (or the Mach- hold autopilot) as a secondary objective. It is shown through extensive simulations that the inherent robustness of the SMC design provides a convenient way to design controllers without gain scheduling, with transient performance that is far superior to that of a conventional gain-scheduled approach with integral control.

The objective of this work was to develop possible materials for optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosimetric applications in real-time measurement. A novel material of LiMgPO4:Tb,Sm,B was prepared by solid-state diffusion method at 900 Â°C. The structure and optical properties of these phosphors were characterized by X-ray diffraction, fluorescence spectrophotometer, and OSL reader. The results showed that the full discrimination between the stimulation and emission spectra made them very fit for the optic-fibre dosimetry. The OSL vs. dose response was linear in the dose range of 0.1 to 216 Gy. It also showed a significant improvement in the stimulation time compared with LiMgPO4:Tb,B. Hence, the phosphor could be used in the real-time dosimeter based on the OSL technology for medical monitoring as well as for environmental dosimetry and space dosimetry.

The problem of positioning of actuators and sensors on smart materials has been a point of interest in recent years. This is due to the fact that in many practical applications there are limitations in space, weight, etc. of the smart structures, which make the problem of positioning more complex. In addition, it is required that the actuators/sensors have the best possible performance. The development of smart structures technology in recent years has provided numerous opportunities for vibration control applications. The use of piezoelectric ceramics or polymers has shown great promise in the development of this technology. The employment of piezoelectric material as actuators in vibration control is beneficial because these actuators only excite the elastic modes of the structures without exciting the rigid-body modes. This is important since very often only elastic motions of the structures are needed to be controlled. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a novel approach developed for optimizing the location of piezoelectric actuators for vibration suppression of flexible structures. A flexible fin with bonded piezoelectric actuators is considered in this study. The frequency response function (FRF) of the system is then recorded and maximization of the FRF peaks is considered as the objective function of the optimization algorithm to find the optimal placement of the piezoelectric actuators on the smart fin. Three multi-layer perceptron neural networks are employed to perform surface fitting to the discrete data generated by the finite element method (FEM). Invasive weed optimization (IWO), a novel numerical stochastic optimization algorithm, is then employed to maximize the weighted summation of FRF peaks. Results indicate an accurate surface fitting for the FRF peak data and an optimal placement of the piezoelectric actuators for vibration suppression is achieved.

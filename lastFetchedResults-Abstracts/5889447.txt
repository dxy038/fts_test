The bi-directional negative resistance transistor (BNRT) is an integrated device composed of two npn longitudinal bipolar transistors with common base and collector as well as an npn lateral bipolar transistor with the same base. We can get S type negative resistance characteristics between the two emitter terminals of both longitudinal transistors E<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>2</sub>. By photosensitizing the BNRT, we have designed and fabricated a photo-bidirectional negative resistance transistor (PBNRT) for the first time. This new optical switching device has both photo-sensitive and negative resistance characteristics in a same device. In this paper, the relationship between light intensity and gate voltage affecting the I-V characteristics of the PBNRT have been measured and analyzed. The characteristic parameters dependence on light intensity and gate voltage have been simulated with the ATLAS device simulator. The simulation results are in agreement with the experimental data.

The Multipoint Communications Network (MCN) is a distributed multi-microprocessor based message control and switching device developed specifically to replace the antiquated teletypewriter control circuits in the Defense Communications System (DCS). The objective of this new product line is to reduce operating and line costs and to provide the DCS with an open-ended network that allows growth and system evolution into the 1990s. Operational experience in the past three years has indeed proven the value of the MCN, and currently there are a number of enhancements in the development or planning phases that are aimed at taking these systems well into the 1990s.

Objective Research on status inconsistency
(SI) and its impact on mental health has been
dormant for many years. This study tested the association
between SI and emotional distress, anxiety and
mood disorders. Methods Data were gathered from
the Israel-based component of the World Mental
Health Survey (n = 4,859). SI was defined by the
combination of high education (13+ years) with low
income (1st decile). Mood and anxiety disorders were
diagnosed with the composite international diagnostic
instrument (CIDI), and emotional distress was
measured with the 12-item general health questionnaire
(GHQ-12). Results Multivariate analysis showed
increased risk for mood or anxiety disorders among
SI subjects (n = 231), odds ratio (OR) = 1.75, 95%
confidence interval (95% CI) 1.13–2.63. The estimate
was slightly attenuated when marital status was added
to the model (OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.0–2.39). SI subjects
showed higher GHQ-12 scores. Conclusion SI,
which can disrupt an individual’s sense of coherence,
is associated, although not causally, with increased
12 month prevalence rates for mood or anxiety disorders
and with higher psychological distress

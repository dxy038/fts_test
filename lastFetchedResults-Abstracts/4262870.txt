Summary form only given. Efficient production of soft X-rays (1 to 5 keV) has been achieved in many laboratories using Z-pinch plasma radiation sources (PRS) driven by short pulses of mega-ampere currents. Empirical and theoretical scaling laws for &lt;100-ns implosions show that the optimum X-ray yield increases strongly with current. The objective of the present work is to extend the implosion time for longer current pulses while maintaining high radiation efficiency. The long implosion time PRS approach will reduce the cost and risk of pulsed power generators required for higher X-ray yields, because it reduces the voltage and power required to drive higher currents into the inductive PRS load. The Decade Quad Simulator, for example, should drive &gt;8 MA with a rise time of 300 ns, coupling &gt;400 kJ to kinetic energy in the Z-pinch.

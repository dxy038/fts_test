Introduction & Objective: Posterior capsule opacification
is one of the important complications of cataract surgery. This study aimed to determine the effect of anterior capsulotomy methods on posterior capsule opacification after cataract surgery. Materials & Methods: This is a descriptive-analytic and retrospective study. Patients who undertaken cataract surgery in Day and Rawl Akram hospitals during 1370-79 were the subjects of this study .Patients were divided into two groups based on anterior capsulotomy techniques, envelope capsulotomy and continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC). Collected data were analyzed by SPSS software.
Results: Patients were followed up for 6-94 months (mean 42 months). From 314 examined eyes, posterior capsule opacification was observed in 57 eyes. Posterior capsule opacification (PCO) was observed in 40 of 168 eyes (23.8%) in envelope capsulotomy and 17 of 146 (11.6%) in CCC capsulotomy .Results of this study show that PCO is significantly less (p<0.05) in patients who had an anterior capsulotomy with CCC compared with those who had envelope capsulotomy . Risk of PCO was significantly higher in patient who had envelope capsulotomy.
Conclusion:CCC reduces the incidence of PCO compare to envelope capsulotomy .

A blind estimation of MIMO channels using genetic algorithm was proposed for the frequency selective channel. By exploiting the output statistics, an objective function that coming from blind estimation of MIMO channels based on the subspace could be obtained. Then the fitness function based on the objective function is proposed for optimization by a genetic algorithm-based approach. It has been proved that this new method could be used in channel estimation. Compared with the existing blind estimation method, this method in this paper brings forward a new point of view to solve the channel estimation. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

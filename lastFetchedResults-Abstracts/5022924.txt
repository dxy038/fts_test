The main aim of this paper si the improvement of the output voltage quality of the AC/AC choppers to minimize the harmonics continents and to increase the power factor of the voltage source. Several works were done in this field using classical algorithms to fulfill the objective mentioned. In the present paper the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to achieve the minimization of the harmonic continents of the delivered voltage, to improve the power factor of the voltage source and finally to increase the control range of the outer voltage.

A hybrid wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) transmitter/receiver module with a planar lightwave circuit (PLC) has been developed using alignment free assembly techniques. The newly developed WDM module consists of three optical components. One is an LD-fiber coupling unit, the second is a PLC unit on which two kinds of fibers and an LD-fiber coupling unit are mounted, and the last is a ceramic package on which a bare receiver-amplifier and photo-diodes are mounted. These three components can be assembled without optical adjusting, so that high productivity and a compact size of 36 mm &#215;12.5 mm&#215;3 mm are achieved. This WDM module can transmit/receive 1.3 &#956;m bidirectional signals by time compression multiplexing and multi/demultiplex 1.3/1.5 &#956;m signals

The paper makes an attempt to examine the nexus between flow of foreign
institutional investment and other macro economic variables namely the return on
domestic and international stock market, exchange rate and call rate, with focus on
the issue of causality. The paper addresses this issue in the Indian context, after the
eruption of global financial crisis. Analyzing the daily data from Jan2008-Feb2012
the paper finds that FII flow in India is more a consequence than a cause of stock
market return in India and abroad. The study also shows that there exists strong
bidirectional causality between exchange rate and FII flow, at least for shorter time
lag. Moreover there exists a very weak contemporaneous correlation between FII
and other economic variables considered in the paper.

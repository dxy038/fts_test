Although the first-stage Norwood procedure mostly has been used for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, there are other anomalies in which the Norwood procedure can be applied. Since 1991, 18 newborns without hypoplastic left heart syndrome underwent a first-stage Norwood procedure. All had a hypoplastic aortic annulus, ascending aorta, and transverse aorta. Ten had normally related great arteries: aortic atresia or aortic stenosis with inadequate left ventricle in 4, mitral atresia or stenosis in 4, and interrupted aortic arch in 2. The 8 others had double-outlet right ventricle with mitral atresia or complete transposition with a hypoplastic right ventricle. Age ranged from 2 to 77 days (median, 6 days) and weight from 2.4 to 4.4 kg (mean, 3.0 kg). The patients with interrupted aortic arch simultaneously underwent primary repair of the interruption. There were 17 hospital survivors (94%). There have been no late deaths in follow-up from 4 to 30 months (mean, 15.5 months). Thirteen children have had subsequent creation of a bidirectional Glenn shunt with takedown of the original systemic to pulmonary shunt. The 2 with interrupted aortic arch underwent a Rastelli-type biventricular repair. These results show that the Norwood procedure can be applied to infants without hypoplastic left heart syndrome who have hypoplastic aortas and excessive pulmonary blood flow with very low mortality and excellent palliation.

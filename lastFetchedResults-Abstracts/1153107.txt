Recently, the numerical simulation of sheet metal forming processes has become a very powerful tool in the automotive industry. It is applied to check part geometry at an early stage of design, as well as to optimize the shape parameters for a safe production. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive approach to make die shape optimization for sheet metal forming processes. Our objective is to optimize stamping quality, by minimizing the risk of rupture, wrinkles and unstretched areas. The design variables include shape perturbation vectors on addendum surface and draw bead height on binder surfaces. A modified sweeping simplex algorithm is adopted in the optimization process. The forming process of a front fender is used to validate this proposed approach.

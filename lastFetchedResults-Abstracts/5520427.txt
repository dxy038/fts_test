This paper considers the use of adaptive &#946;-order minimum mean square error (MMSE) speech enhancement algorithm for hands-free mobile communication in a car environment. For system simulation, we use recordings of real-life noises to contaminate speech signals chosen from the TIMIT database. In terms of subjective and objective evaluation, our proposed algorithm achieves better enhancement results as compared to many existing speech enhancement algorithms.

The objective of this report is to introduce the novel concept of utilizing sulfenamides as prodrugs for compounds containing an NH-acidic functionality, particularly weakly acidic amide-type functionalities (amides, ureas, carbamates, etc.). Included are the syntheses and physicochemical characterizations of some model sulfenamides to illustrate the promise of this new prodrug technology.

In this paper, we have developed a new scheme for the application of sign language recognition and synthesis technology in Intelligent Building (IB). To address the problem of feature extraction, an integrated algorithm is developed to characterize the sign language gestures. Both the vision-based sign language recognition system and the speech-driven sign language synthesis system are developed more completed for ease of use. A special sign language/speech bidirectional translation system is designed for the barrier-free intelligence community. To illustrate the principle of the system, an instance of a deaf-mute visitor is showed at last.

In this paper, a high-gain nonlinear observer based fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) approach is proposed for a general class of nonlinear uncertain systems with measured output probability density functions (PDFs). The objective of the presented FDD algorithm is to use the measured output probability density functions (PDFs) and the input of the system to construct a exponential observer-based residual generator such that the fault can be detected and diagnosed. The main result is given in a constructive manner by developing a novel nonlinear observer, without resort to any linearization. By a coordinates transformation, the design of the proposed observer does not necessitate the resolution of kind of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and its expression is explicitly given. The exponential convergence of the errors in the presence of parameters uncertainties is proved to guarantee the fastness of the proposed fault diagnosis scheme. Furthermore, the bound of the estimation errors in the presence the faults is minimized by appropriately choosing the parameters of the presented observer. Finally a simulation example is given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed fault detection and diagnosis method.

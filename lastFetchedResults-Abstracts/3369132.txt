Fuel cells probably represent the power-production technology receiving the most development attention. The objective of this paper is to regulate the output voltage of inverters for fuel-cell power plants. This letter describes an effective fuzzy-logic (FL) flux control. The paper demonstrates that the proposed method provides an improved response compared to the conventional flux-control method.

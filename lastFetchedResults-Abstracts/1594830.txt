The paper describes an objective function hyperplane search heuristic for solving the general all-integer linear programming problem (ILP). The algorithm searches a series of objective function hyperplanes and the search over any given hyperplane is formulated as a bounded knapsack problem. Theory developed for combinations of the objective function and problem constraints is used to guide the search. We evaluate the algorithm's performance on a class of ILP problems to assess the areas of effectiveness.

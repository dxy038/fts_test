In this paper, the optimum control technology of an independent type of hybrid power system with wind and solar power generation, which enables a stable power supply to the loads, proposed and developed. This system comprises wind power generation inverter, solar power generation inverter, bidirectional inverter for storage batteries, and engine generator. Each inverter is connected with engine generator in parallel, and is operated under redundant mode.

This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization model for setting unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) attitude controller parameters. Bacterial Chemotaxis (BC) algorithm is one of the new heuristic algorithms based on colony intelligence. The BC optimization algorithm is introduced for the first time in the setting of the attitude controller parameters of UAV. A case on the UAV attitude controller parameters optimal setting problem is presented to illustrate the methodologyÂ´s feasibility and efficiency, compared with the existing optimal planning methods, the search time of the bacterial chemotaxis optimization method is shorter.

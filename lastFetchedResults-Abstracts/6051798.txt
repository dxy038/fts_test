Radio spectrum is a scarce resource in wireless communications. This has led to extensive research in radio resource management (RRM) with the objective of improving achievable system capacity and supporting the rapid growth of a wide variety of data services with different quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we quantify the considerable performance gains obtainable with multi-flow merging (MFM) in scheduling for flow-based wireless networks in terms of user throughput, user latency and user packet drop probability.

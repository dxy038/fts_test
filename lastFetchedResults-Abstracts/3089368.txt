The genomic signal analysis of nucleotide sequences reveals features difficult to identify using only the symbolic representation in the genomic data bases. Some genomic signal features correlate well with functional features at phenotype level. The paper presents results of GSA applied in the study of <i>Mycobacterium</i> <i>tuberculosis</i> rpoB gene mutations known to confer rifampin resistance.

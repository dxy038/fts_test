Objective: This study was undertaken to determine whether the frequency of fetal surveillance could be safely reduced from twice weekly to fortnightly in the case of small-for-gestational-age fetuses with normal results of umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry studies. Study Design: Pregnant women between 24 and 36 weeksâ€™ gestation (n = 167) with small-for-gestational-age fetuses and normal results of umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry studies were randomly allocated to undergo twice-weekly or fortnightly fetal surveillance. Statistical analysis was carried out according to intention to treat. Results: Eighty-five women were randomly assigned to undergo twice-weekly fetal surveillance and 82 were randomly assigned to undergo fortnightly fetal surveillance. Those randomly assigned to twice-weekly surveillance were delivered 4 days earlier (264 vs 268 days; P = .04) and were more likely to have labor induced (n = 70, 82%, vs n = 54, 66%; P = .02) than those randomly assigned to fortnightly surveillance. Fifty-four babies (23%) were admitted to the neonatal nursery, but there were no differences in neonatal morbidity between the groups. Conclusions: Maternal intervention (induction) was more common in the twice-weekly group. No differences in neonatal outcomes were detected. A much larger trial is required to determine the safety and potential benefits of less frequent surveillance of small-for gestational-age fetuses with normal results of umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry studies.

In this work, polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and PEEK/SiC-composite coatings were deposited on Al substrates using a printing technique to improve their surfaces performance. The objective of this work was to investigate coatings friction and wear behaviour. Especially, the effect of sliding velocity and applied load on coatings friction coefficient and wear rate was evaluated in range of 0.2–1.4 m/s and 1–9 N, respectively. Compared to Al substrate, the coated samples exhibit excellent friction coefficient and wear rate. For PEEK coating, under an applied load of 1 N, the increase in sliding velocity can result in decreasing of friction coefficient at a cost of wear resistance. Under a load of 9 N, however, PEEK coating exhibits the highest friction coefficient and wear rate at an intermediate velocity. These influences appear to be mainly ascribed to the influence of contact temperature of the two relative sliding parts. In most test conditions, the composite coating exhibits better wear resistance and a little higher friction coefficient. SiC reinforcement in composite coating plays a combined role. First of all, it might lead to energy dissipation for activation of fracture occurred on the interface of PEEK and the powders. Moreover, it can reduce coating ploughs and the adhesion between the two relative sliding parts.

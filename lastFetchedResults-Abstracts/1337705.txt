Controversial results on lipid utilization as an energy source during training in horses are found in the literature. The objective of this study was to assess blood lipid profile during different training programs in horses. Seventeen Standardbred horses (400 ± 50 kg) and 17 Thoroughbred horses (380 ± 15 kg) followed different training programs. Blood lipid profile, including triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), was analyzed, and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) concentration was calculated. Data were analyzed using Student t test, and linear regressions were done. Cholesterol and LDL decreased during training programs in Standardbred trotters (P = .0001 and P = .0053, respectively), and VLDL was found to be close to the significance level (P = .053). Blood lipid profile, including TGs (P = .0014), cholesterol (P = .0057), HDL (P = .0128), LDL (P = .0091), and VLDL (P = .0014), varied throughout the training program in Thoroughbred horses. Negative slope of blood lipids and positive slope of TG linear regression in Standardbred trotters were significant for all parameters (P ≤ .05), whereas cholesterol and LDL regression showed poor P and r2 values and HDL P value was slightly above the significance level (P = .069) in Thoroughbred horses. TGs and VLDL showed a positive linear trend in Thoroughbred horses (P = .002). Exercise and different training programs lead to significant variations of lipid profile and lipid utilization in horses. Lipid utilization as an energy source improved with training in Standardbred trotters, whereas this was not the case in Thoroughbred horses. Further studies on the effect of training programs using different conditions and horse breeds would be necessary to understand lipid utilization as an energy source in athletic horses.

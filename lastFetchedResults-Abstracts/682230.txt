A receptor model for predicting future PM10 concentrations has been developed within the framework of the UK Airborne Particles Expert Group and applied during the recently completed review of the UK National Air Quality Strategy. The model uses a combination of measured PM10, oxides of nitrogen and particulate sulphate concentrations to provide daily estimates of the contributions to total particle concentrations from primary combustion, secondary and other (generally coarse) particle sources. Projections of past and future concentrations of PM10 are estimated by applying appropriate reductions to the current concentrations of the three components based on an understanding of the likely impact of current policies on future levels. Projections have been derived from 1996, 1997 and 1998 monitoring data and compared with UK national air quality objectives and European Union limit values. One of the key uncertainties within the receptor modelling method is the assignment of the residual PM10, remaining after the assignment of primary combustion and secondary particle contributions, to the ‘other’ particle fraction. An examination of the difference between measured PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations confirms our assignment of the bulk of this residual to coarse particles. Projections based on 1996 monitoring data are the highest and those based on 1998 monitoring data are the lowest. Whilst there is considerable difference between these projections they are consistent with measured concentrations for previous years. All three projections suggest that with current agreed policies the EU annual mean limit value will be achieved. The 24-h mean limit value is projected to be achievable when projections are derived from 1997 and 1998 data, but not from 1996 data. All three projections suggest that with current agreed policies the central London site will not achieve the provisional 1997 UK National Air Quality Strategy objective.

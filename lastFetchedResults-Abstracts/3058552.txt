The paper describes a two-stage fuzzy navigation controller for a vision-based intelligent shopping service robot (ISSR). The navigation strategy of the robot merges two distinct situations. The global navigation strategy concludes the traveling path from the information such as the task styles assigned to the ISSR and the people distribution in the supermarket. The local navigation control consists of two stages. The obstacle avoidance stage is based on visual feedback and sonar sensory information to detect obstacles, in which, an integrated fuzzy controller is designed to offer a smoother navigation. The guiding control stage provides objective guidance to avoid that the robot travels adrift in the supermarket. The simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed navigation control system.

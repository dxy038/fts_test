Background/Objective: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are
one of the most common causes of occupational injuries. This
study was conducted with the objectives of determination of
prevalence rate of MSDs and ergonomics assessment of the risk
of MSDs among workers of a petrochemical company.
Methods: In this study, 261randomly selected workers in a
petrochemical company with at least one year of job tenure
participated. Office and operational personnel were studied
separately. In office jobs, data were collected using Nordic
musculoskeletal disorders questionnaire (NMQ) and ergonomics
checklist for assessment of work conditions. In operational jobs,
NMQ and QEC (Quick Exposure Check) methods were applied
to gather the required data. Data analysis was performed using
SPSS software.
Results: The most prevalent MSDs symptoms were reported
in the lower back (36.2%), upper back (31%), neck (31%) and
knees (30.3%). The results showed that the prevalence of MSDs
indifferent body regions of the office staff was higher than those
of operational workers. Also, in 40.9% of the observed cases,
total ergonomics index was in action category 1 (inappropriate
working conditions) and 59.9% of the subjects taken in action
category 2 (appropriate working conditions). The results of
assessment by QEC technique among operational workers
showed that in 82.8% of the workers studied, the level of exposure
to musculoskeletal risks was high or very high.
Conclusions: The prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in the
office staff was higher than that of operational subjects. To improve
the working conditions, taking risk factors of the lower back, upper
back, neck and knees into consideration seems to be essential.

    The objective of this study was to evaluate the best period of progesterone treatment and the time of eCG injection during estrous synchronization in nonbreeding season in Mahabadi does. During nonbreeding season, 103 Mahabadi does, weighing 57.5±0.45 Kg, 2-4 years old, were used in the trail. These does randomly assigned to 6 groups. The control group (n=10) exposed to Mahabadi bucks without any treatments. The group C9-e7of does (n=26) were synchronized using CIDR for a period of 9 days and injected 300 IU eCG at day 7. In groups C17-e15 (n=16) and C17-e17 (n=16), CIDR inserted for 17 days and eCG injected at days 15 and 17, respectively. The groups C19-e17 (n=17) and C19-e19 (n=18) synchronized by CIDR for 19 days and received 300 IU eCG at days 17 and 19, respectively. Estrus detected one day after CIDR removal, then, the does were mated with Mahabadi bucks. The reproductive parameters were analyzed by ProcGenmod using SAS 9.1. The highest mating, kidding and fecundity rates were obtained in group C17-e17 and the highest estrus detection rate and litter size were achieved in group C19-e17 that were significantly higher than control group (P < 0.01) but didn’t have significant differences with other groups (P > 0.05). In all reproductive parameters measured, there were not significantly differences (P > 0.05) between C9-e7 group and the other treatment groups of does. Furthermore, the short treatment period of progesterone insertion using in group C9-e7 compared with the other groups, will suggest that this group could be recommended for estrous synchronization program in nonbreeding season of Mahabadi does.

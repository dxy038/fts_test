This paper is a look back at the means and methods of power distribution for a plant in producing cement. This paper focuses on the medium and low voltage distribution in common usage 60 years ago and its progression to common design practices of today. Our objective is to note where we have improved and what we can learn from the past that will yield a better power distribution system in the future.

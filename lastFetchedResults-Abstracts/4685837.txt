Image compression is a key technology to realize on-line satellite image transmission economically and quickly. Among various image compression algorithms, the JPEG algorithm is the international standard for still color image compression. In this study, various kinds of satellite images were compressed with the JPEG algorithm. The relation between compression ratio and image quality were evaluated. As for the image quality evaluation, both subjective evaluation and objective evaluation were performed. It was determined that all the test satellite images could be compressed to at least 1/10 of the original data volume preserving high visual image quality. The degradation of spatial distribution quality of the compressed images were evaluated using power spectrum of original and compressed images

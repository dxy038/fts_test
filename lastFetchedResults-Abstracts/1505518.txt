With the increasing popularity of evaporative interfaces, detection using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometry in the mid-infrared region is becoming more important in size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). FTIR spectrometry is a powerful, and potentially very widely applicable, method for obtaining chemical functional group information for each molecular size fraction. Quantitative evaluation of polymer composition across the SEC chromatogram can provide more accurate characterization of heterogeneous polymer samples for problem solving and for material specification. The evaporative interface removes the SEC mobile phase at the exit of the column and deposits the eluting polymer as a continuous film stripe or as a series of discrete films on infrared transparent substrates. Initially this detection approach was used only for qualitative analysis. More recently, it is being used quantitatively. Previously we demonstrated that the quality of the film generated by the evaporative interface was critical to determining the suitability of the resulting FTIR spectra for quantitative analysis. In a continuation of this work, the objective of this paper is to develop a procedure for obtaining valid quantitative results for polymer blends with the interface. Experimental topics include improving the quality of polymer films by post-SEC treatments, off-line FTIR calibrating using other means to obtain high quality polymer films, and utilizing in-line SEC detectors in calibration. Interpretation aspects focus upon peak fitting of FTIR spectra, linear regression, partial least squares, and data pre-processing. PLS prediction with internal calibration using the second derivative of solvent-annealed film spectra was found to provide the best compromise between processing time, accuracy and precision.

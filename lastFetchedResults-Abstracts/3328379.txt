Quality of service (QoS) is a resource reservation control mechanism in Cloud Computing which guarantees a certain level of performance and availability of a service. Currently, the critical technical underpinnings of QoS includes resource virtualization, load balancing services, service level agreements (SLAs) standardization, minimization of power consumption over data centers and tremendous improvements in Internet computing software. However authorÂ´s objective in this paper is to improve the QoS of Cloud data centers in terms of optimizing the response time in a parallel environment through a fuzzy controlled load balancer (FCLB). The proposed FCLB uses different parameters like number of processors to be used and processor speed. The simulation results show that as we go on increasing the number of processors keeping the processor speed constant at a certain stage the response time remains constant without alternation. The performance of the proposed work is then verified for two different processing speeds.

Considering the traditional problems in reliability design, such as the large computational complexity and the difficulty to solve the reliability-cost model, the Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithm is applied in order to solve the traditional problems in the reliability-cost optimization. In this paper, a model based on the Differential Evolution for Multi-Objective Optimization (DEMO) is built to realize the reliability design of system redundancy. Under the restriction of the cost, volume and weight, the model can achieve an optimum design of the flight control system reliability. In the end, the reliability optimization model is verified by the examples and it is shown that the design results given by the system reliability optimized model are valuable for the design of the flight control system.

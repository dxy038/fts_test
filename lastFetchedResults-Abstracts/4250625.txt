A bidirectional adaptive detection method was proposed to prevent error propagation based on sequential Gaussian approximation algorithm for MIMO systems. Conventional sequential Gaussian approximation detection executes a tree search at the receiver, when the number of searching paths is large, error propagation is well prevented at the cost of high complexity, when few paths are searched, serious error propagation may occur. In the new method, transmitted symbols were estimated parallel both in sequential order and inverse order, and the number of searching paths was determined by comparing the results of bidirectional detection, which can effectively prevent error propagation at reduced complexity. The novel algorithm can be executed at low delay because of parallel computing, and shows good performance at low complexity.

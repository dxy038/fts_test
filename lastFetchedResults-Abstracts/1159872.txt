Objective: The purpose of this research is the effect of initial concentration of lead absorbed on the
equilibrium time by active carbon.
Materials and methods: The study of granular activated carbon (GAC) of the raw material is wood w.
For experimental, Absorption kinetics of initial concentration 1 to 500 mg L-1 was used and measuring
the remaining concentration absorbed by atomic absorption (Model 220 AA company varian
Australia) was performed.
Results: Process adsorption equilibrium reached at 45, 60, 75, 90, 75, 70 and 60 min for initial lead
concentration of 1, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 mg L-1. Study equilibrium time at varied
concentrations showed that decreased equilibrium time with decreasing initial lead concentration from
50 to 1 mg L-1. Efficiency adsorption increased while the initial lead concentration decreased from 500
to 1 mg L-1. The maximum percent adsorption of lead was found to be %99.7 at initial lead
concentration of 1 mg L-1. The experimental data were fitted using two adsorption kinetic models, the
Ho et al. (1996) and Lagergren (1893) models. Results showed that lead ions adsorption followed
adsorption model of Ho et al. (1996). Also, fitting Langmuir and Freunlich adsorption isotherm
models on experimental data showed that Freundlich model described experimental data in a better
way.

Objective:
To determine how accurately total daily energy expenditure can be estimated from measurement periods of less than 24 h in mechanically ventilated infants and children.
Design:
Prospective study to validate a method to determine energy expenditure.
Setting:
Pediatric intensive careunit of an university hospital.
Patients:
Nineteen ventilated patients (age 3 weeks — 13 years) with a FiO2 of less than 60% and tube leakage < 10% (the difference between inspiratory and expiratory tidal volume measured by the ventilator). Separately, in five patients with varying tube leakage (2–59%) the influence of tube leakage on measured energy expenditure was determined.
Measurements:
Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry. Total daily energy expenditure measurements for 24 h were compared with 2 h energy expenditure measurements. The influence of body temperature on measured energy expenditure was determined.
Results:
The mean coefficient of variation among 2 hour periods of measured energy expenditure was 6% (range 2–11%) compared with total daily energy expenditure measurements. The influence of body temperature revealed an increase of 6% of energy expenditure/°C. An increased tube leakage influenced the energy expenditure measurements significantly (P< 0.001).
Conclusion:
In a clinical situation in patients with a tube leakage < 10% total daily energy expenditure can be estimated from a 2 h measurement period.

Chicken bone extract powder (BEP) is an alternative inexpensive calcium source. It is rich in calcium (30 g/100 g) and contains a Ca : P ratio of 2 : 1, but the bioavailability of its calcium is not known. The objective of this study was to determine calcium bioavailability of BEP and BEP-fortified products using an in vitro equilibrium dialysis method. The effects of phytate and dietary fiber from food products on the calcium bioavailability of BEP were evaluated. The results showed that BEP exhibited excellent calcium bioavailability. It showed higher bioavailable calcium than milk and several calcium fortificants. Although phytate and dietary fiber had a negative effect on calcium bioavailability BEP showed the lowest effect among all calcium sources. The BEP-fortified bakery products were well accepted and not significantly different in appearance, taste and texture from non-fortified products.

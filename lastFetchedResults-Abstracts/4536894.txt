The ultimate goal is to develop an Executable Architecture for System Engineering, Modeling and Simulation across the Aerospace and Defense landscape using a consistent, open framework for the benefit of users, suppliers and ourselves. In this presentation, the author touches on the complexities that delivering large and complex systems bring to the Research &amp; Development group within EADS, where the objective is to marry the various stakeholders, all of whom are buried deep in operation projects, to a consistent vision of where EADS wishes to go with regards to a common framework for its solution design. The paper talks about the work done by EADS Innovation Works and the Defense &amp; Communication Systems business unit to create an "Executable Architecture," allowing a set of open enterprise frameworks to co-exist. This will enable suppliers and tool set developers to ensure that the maximum amount of interoperability can be provided within the development cycle, from Requirements Capture, Design, Development and Production, with a single simulation backbone giving verification and validation throughout the chain on a single data model.

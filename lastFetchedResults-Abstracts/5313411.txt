In this paper, a new multi-view coding (MVC) scheme is proposed and evaluated. The scheme offers improved low-delay view random access capability and at the same time comparable compression performance with respect to the reference multi-view coding scheme currently used. The proposed scheme uses the concept of multiple-resolution view coding, exploiting the trade-off between quantization distortion and downsampling distortion at changing bit-rates, which in turn provides improved coding efficiency. Bi-predictive (B) coded views, used in the conventional MVC method, are replaced with predictive coded downscaled views, reducing the view dependency in a multi-view set and hence reducing the random view access delay, but preserving the compression performance at the same time. Results show that the proposed method reduces the view random access delay in a MVC system significantly, but has a similar objective and subjective performance with the conventional MVC method.

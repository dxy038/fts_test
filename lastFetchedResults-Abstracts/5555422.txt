It is opinion that climate change on the planet is largely dependent on the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and that this effect is related largely to human activities that make CO<sub>2</sub>. Reducing the discharge of CO<sub>2</sub> has therefore become a common objective of the international community, including China. There are various actions that are proposed for the reduction of the gas: increased use of renewable sources, nuclear, energy saving, capture and storage in underground or in deep ocean etc. The paper, however, pays particular attention to the contribution that CO<sub>2</sub> is able to provide both in industrial processes and as a raw material employed in production processes, to obtain products and goods, and ultimately, to the way in which, from a waste product with a high environmental impact (like CO<sub>2</sub>) it is possible to create economic value.

With the objective to minimize the average long-term cost rate, the optimal maintenance model is established based on the theory of renewal process, the effects that the parameters of the model act on the maintenance policy are analyzed, including inspection interval, inspection time, preventative maintenance, and degradation failure threshold. On the basis of periodic inspection, various maintenance costs are taken into account, including inspection cost, cost of preventative maintenance, cost of corrective maintenance and downtime cost. By solving the model, the optimal maintenance strategy can be obtained. A numerical example is given to illustrate the proposed model.

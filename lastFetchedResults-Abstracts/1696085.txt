The objective of the present work is to develop an analytical homogenization method to derive higher-order material parameters of micropolar theory. With help of Airyâ€™s stress function, the constitutive equations for a homogenized micropolar medium are analytically established by considering a cylindrical representative volume element (RVE) subjected to quadratic and cubic boundary displacement conditions. Both porous and composite materials are considered, an analytical relation between the intrinsic length and the microstructural parameters is given.

The objective of the present work was to use a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code to simulate the electrohydrodynamic (EHD) atomization process. Although the physics of the atomization and cone formation has been discussed in numerous publications, a comprehensive theory has not been presented. Some of the previous approaches are discussed below. A CFD model can give a unique capability to describe and simulate the liquid cone formation and atomization. The approach in this work was to simultaneously solve the coupled (EHD) and electrostatic equations. The heat conduction equation, solved by the CFD solver, has been modified to solve the electrostatic field equations. From the electrostatic field, the electric body forces have been determined and included in the Navierâ€“Stokes equations. The model does not include any current. The key liquid property for the coupling is the permittivity. The predicted velocity fields for heptane and ethanol and the operating window of heptane were found to be consistent with published results. The model does not include a droplet break-up model. If the jet is cylindrical, the droplet size can be calculated from the jet diameter. The droplet size of ethanol was predicted and compared well with experiments.

In this paper we have investigated the efficacy of applying multi-objective optimisation to Cartesian genetic programming (CGP) when used for evolution of cell-array configurations. A cell-array is a proposed type of custom FPGA, where digital circuits can be formed from interconnected configurable cells; thus, the CGP nodes are more complex than in its standard implementation. We have described modifications to a previously described optimisation algorithm that has led to significant improvements in performance; circuits close to a hand designed equivalent have been found, in terms of the optimised objectives. Additionally we have investigated the effect of circuit decomposition techniques on evolutionary performance. We found that using a hybrid of input and output decomposition techniques substantial reductions in evolution time were observed. Further, while the number of circuit inputs is the key factor for functional evolution time, the number of circuit outputs is the key factor for optimisation time.

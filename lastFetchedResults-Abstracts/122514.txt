Introduction & Objective: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is most often asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals with  lifelong latency. However, infection with CMV is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immuno-compromised patients. Transfusion Transmitted HCMV (TT-CMV) can cause serious  morbidity and mortality in certain at-risk patients. In this cross- sectional study, for evaluating the risk of TT-CMV infection, a  seroprevalence survey by ELISA along with a comparison of the  results of ELISA with those of a nested-PCR test was carried out.
 Materials & Methods: In this comparative study during a period of  eight months, blood samples were collected from 364 healthy blood donors referring to the blood bank organization of Fars, Shiraz, Iran. IgG and IgM antibodies to HCMV were measured by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. Also, DNA was extracted from 104 buffy coat and 20 serum samples. A  nested-PCR was performed to detect HCMV- DNA, and the results were compared with those of ELISA test. The collected data were  analyzed by X2 test via SPSS software.
Results: Of 364 samples, IgG was detected in 360 sera (98.9%)  samples and only 16 samples (4.4%) were both IgG and IgM positive. 64 (64%) of buffy coat samples and 8 (40%) of seropositive samples were positive for HCMV- DNA by the nested PCR. None of 4 seronegative samples was detected positive by PCR method.
Conclusion: Although PCR assays have diagnostic value in the detection of HCMV infection, ELISA is still more useful for screening blood donors.

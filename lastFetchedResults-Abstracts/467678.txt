OBJECTIVE: We evaluated subtle endometrial morphologic changes in postmenopausal women assigned to placebo, raloxifene hydrochloride 200 or 600 mg/day, or conjugated estrogens (Premarin 0.625 mg/day) according to a new estrogenicity scoring system. Raloxifene, a new selective estrogen receptor modulator, was not expected to stimulate the endometrium. STUDY DESIGN: Baseline and end point endometrial biopsies were performed during this double-blind, placebo-controlled 8-week study. A scoring system that was based on standard glandular and stromal morphologic criteria was used to quantitate estrogen-induced effects. Baseline, end point, and baseline–to–end point changes were analyzed for treatment differences. RESULTS: Treatment groups were similar at baseline with most women showing no estrogenic effects. At end point, statistically significant moderate and marked estrogenic effects were noted in 77% of estrogen-treated women versus 15% of placebo-treated women versus 0% of raloxifene-treated women. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, estrogen treatment stimulated postmenopausal endometrium. In contrast, raloxifene did not induce histopathologic evidence of endometrial stimulation in healthy postmenopausal women.(Am J Obstet Gynecol 1997;177:64)

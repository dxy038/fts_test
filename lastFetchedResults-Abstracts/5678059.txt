This paper addresses the problem of guaranteed cost fault-tolerant output tracking control against actuator faults for a flexible air-breathing hypersonic vehicle. Firstly, using the parameters of the trim condition, a linearized model is established around the trim point for a nonlinear, dynamically coupled simulation model. Secondly, the control objective and models of actuator faults are presented. Thirdly, the performance analysis condition is proposed in the frame of convex optimization problems via Lyapunov functional approach. Then, the stand controller and fault-tolerant controller are designed such that the resulting closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and satisfies a prescribed performance cost respectively. Finally, the simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control method, which is verified by excellent reference altitude and velocity tracking performance.

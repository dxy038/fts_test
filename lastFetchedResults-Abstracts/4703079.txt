The issue of undergraduate retention is not a new one, it has been debated since the turn of the last century. Nevertheless, the issue has been receiving increased attention and has become more pressing. This work focuses on the academic aspects of attrition and retention, which could be divided loosely into those which are intrinsically within the domains of institutions and educators and those which should be acted upon by the students themselves. Here, the emphasis is on the actions of institutions and educators. Topics discussed include student recruitment approaches, curriculum structures, academic environment, accreditation requirements, perceived quality of education, and motivation as they influence attrition. The objective is to reflect on potential sources of problems and possible remedies to help enhance retention and increase the possibilities of success of all students without compromising quality of education

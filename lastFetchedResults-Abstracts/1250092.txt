We investigate a set of adaptive–stencil, finite-volume schemes used to capture sharp fronts and shocks in a wide range of fields. Our objective is to determine the most promising methods available from this set for solving sharp-front advective–dispersive transport problems. Schemes are evaluated for a range of initial conditions, and for Peclet and Courant numbers. Based upon results from this work, we identify the most promising schemes based on efficiency and robustness.

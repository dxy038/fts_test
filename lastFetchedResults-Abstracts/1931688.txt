The objective of the present study was to characterize ovarian follicular dynamics and hormone concentrations during follicular deviation in the first wave after ovulation in Nelore (Bos indicus) heifers. Ultrasonographic exams were performed and blood samples were collected every 12 h from the day of estrus until 120â€“144 h after ovulation in seven females. Deviation was defined as the point at which the growth rate of the dominant follicle became greater than the growth rate of the largest subordinate follicle. Deviation occurred approximately 65 h after ovulation. Growth rate of the dominant follicle increased (P &lt; 0.05) after deviation, while growth rate of the subordinate follicle decreased (P &lt; 0.05). Diameter of the dominant follicle did not differ from the subordinate follicle at deviation (approximately 5.4 mm). The dominant follicle (7.6 mm) was larger (P &lt; 0.05) than the subordinate follicle (5.3 mm) 96 h after ovulation or 24 h after deviation. Plasma FSH concentrations did not change significantly during the post-ovulatory period. The first significant increase in mean plasma progesterone concentration occurred on the day of follicular deviation. In conclusion, the interval from ovulation to follicular deviation (2.7 days) was similar to that previously reported in B. taurus females, but follicles were smaller. Diameters of the dominant follicle and subordinate follicle did not differ before deviation and deviation was characterized by an increase in dominant follicle and decrease in subordinate follicle growth rate. Variations in FSH concentrations within 12-h intervals were not involved in follicular deviation in Nelore heifers.

One of the most important subjects in designing the large scale logistics network in
crisis time is providing a timely quick reaction for treating injured people and rapid
distribution of medicines and medical equipment. In this paper, a multi-objective model
is presented that aims to determine the location of transfer points and hospitals to
provide timely quick reaction for treating injured people as well as to determine
unreliable and reliable depots for the distribution of medicines and medical equipment.
Because the dynamic nature of great crises, the parameters of the model are uncertain
and dynamic. To solve the model, a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed which
is composed of simulated annealing algorithm and CPLEX. By comparing the results,
the proposed meta-heuristic hybrid algorithm shows a good and efficient performance.

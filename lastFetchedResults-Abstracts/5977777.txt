From 1999 to 2009, the SeaWinds scatterometer has been used to detect and track large Antarctic icebergs on a daily basis. Here, we develop an automated estimation algorithm to supplement iceberg position reports with estimates of the icebergÂ´s major axis length, minor axis length, and angle of orientation. A maximum-likelihood objective function that relates measured backscatter to model-based simulated backscatter is developed. The utility of the estimation approach is analyzed in simulation and via a case study of iceberg A22a. Subsequent results agree with and supplement reports compiled by the United States National Ice Center.

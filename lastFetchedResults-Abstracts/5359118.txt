To meet the increasing demands of multiple QoS levels services, customer perception-based service quality evaluation should be the premise guarantee in end-to-end service optimizing process. However, in the practical application, due to the intrinsically subjective perception of customers and the objective condition of service quality, conventional customer evaluation approaches can hardly reflect the real service quality of operators. To represent the customer perception more objectively, this paper proposes a novel customer-service perception system. In this system, the subjective perception from customer and the objective information from mobile service are collected in terms of a " 5W model" (WHY, WHO, WHERE, WHEN, WHAT). And then, the " 5W model" is translated to the quantitative QoE feature by introducing the QoE index. Finally, the Bayes\Â´ rule is used to classify the QoE feature on customer perception. Experimental results show that the 5W model is informative to represent the customer perception on mobile service quality.

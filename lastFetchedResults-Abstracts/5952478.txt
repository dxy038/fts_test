The model was calibrated and confirmed using the quasi-simultaneous monitoring data over land runoffs and surface water of the bay in 2007. The simulations reproduced COD horizontal distributions under different input scenarios. The distribution was mainly influenced by Dagu River in Aug., where the isopleths decreased from the northwest to the bay mouth. The distribution was mostly affected by the external inputs from east in Nov., where the isopleths generally descended from the northeast. Relative standard deviation (RSD) and similarity index (SI) were applied to quantify the agreement between model and data distributions in term of magnitude and trend, respectively. Best fittings were achieved when the COD decay rate was 0.03 d<sup>-1</sup> (RSD&lt;;30%, SI&gt;;0.8). RSD and SI provided objective and quantitative comparison of spatial maps, which could be used in the assessment of other numerical models.

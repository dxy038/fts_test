Introduction & Objective: Cytokines produced by fetal and uterine mucus are responsible for regulating interactions between mother and fetus that improve uterus receptivity and leads to higher success rate of in vitro fertilization (IVF). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between levels of some cytokines (IL-1?, TNF-?, IP-10, and MCP) in endo-metrial secretions with success rate of IVF procedures. Materials & Methods: 50 consecutive women who were candidate for IVF due to infertility and referred to the clinics of Fatemieh Teaching Hospital in Hamadan were enrolled in a nested case-control study. Aspiration of endometrial secretion was performed in all women prior to embryo transfer using trans-cervical catheter insertion. The level of cytokines in aspirated fluid was determined by ELIZA assay and using especial standard kits. Results: Among 50 enrolled women, 5 samples were initially excluded because of contact bleeding during sampling and thus aspirated endometrial secretions of 45 women were ana-lyzed to assess level of the cytokines. Comparing levels of cytokines in aspirated endometrial secretions showed lower concentrations of TNF-?, IP-10, and MCP in the group who experi-enced successful clinical pregnancy (n = 9) than the group with failed pregnancy (n = 36), however ,no significant difference was revealed in level of IL-1? between the two groups. Conclusion: In IVF patients with implantation failure, an elevated level of TNF-?, IP-10, and MCP cytokines is observable. Low levels of these cytokines can be valuable predicting mark-ers for successful IVF pregnancy.(Sci J Hamadan Univ Med Sci 2015; 22 (2): 99-107)

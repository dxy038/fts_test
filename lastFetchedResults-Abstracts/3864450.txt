For industry, the need to access accurate and reliable objective video metrics has become more pressing with the advent of new video applications and services such as mobile broadcasting, Internet video, and Internet Protocol television (IPTV). Industry-class objective quality- measurement models have a wide range of uses, including equipment testing (e.g., codec evaluation), transmission- planning and network-dimensioning tasks, head-end quality assurance, in- service network monitoring, and client-based quality measurement. The Video Quality Experts Group (VQEG) is the primary forum for validation testing of objective perceptual quality models. The work of VQEG has resulted in International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standardization of objective quality models designed for standard- definition television and for multimedia applications. This article reviews VQEG´s work, paying particular attention to the group´s approach to validation testing.

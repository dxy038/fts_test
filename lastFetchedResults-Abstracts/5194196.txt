Port is an important component of the transportation system; analysis of port hinterland scale is essential prerequisite and special requirement to port project. How to make quantitative analysis on hinterland with scientific theory model and method and how to determine the reasonable hinterland is critical, it is directly related to the success of port project. In order to improve the scientific and rationality of the present hinterland segmentation, the definition of hinterland is described and main influencing factors of port hinterland segmentation are listed at first in this paper. We make comparison between the common methods of present port hinterland segmentation, on this basis the gravitational model is mainly applied in hinterland segmentation, moreover empirically make analysis according to the actual situation of the adjacent TianJin port and QinDao port. Base on the analysis and study, the gravitational model can reflect more the practical hinterland segmentation, and more objective and more scientific support to port project.

For systems analysis, uncertainty may exist in model parameters and input data. Those uncertainties can propagate through the analysis and generate uncertainties into systems analysis. Grey systems theory offers a method for incorporating uncertainties into systems analysis. According to grey systems theory and the characteristics of interval plan network, this paper presents a method of the multiobjective making critical path. Examples are provided at the end to verify the feasibility of this method which combines subjective factors with objective factors.

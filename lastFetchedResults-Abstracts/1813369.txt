Background and Aims
e number of studies have investigated the correlation between the interleukin (IL)-4 C-589T and C+33T polymorphisms and asthma susceptibility. However, the results are inconsistent. The objective of this study is to explore the association between the IL-4 C-589T and C+33T polymorphisms and asthma risk using meta-analysis.
s
l of 35 studies (31 concerning C-589T polymorphism and asthma risk with 4737 asthmatics and 6389 controls and 14 studies regarding C+33T polymorphism and asthma risk with 2544 asthmatics and 4049 controls) were included in this meta-analysis.
s
-4 C-589T polymorphism was associated with increased asthma risk in a dominant genetic model (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 1.284 [1.131–1.459] for TT + TC vs. CC). In the subgroup analyses by ethnicity, age and atopic status of asthmatics, significantly increased risks of asthma were found both in Asians (OR [95% CI] = 1.301 [1.003–1.689]) and Caucasians (OR [95% CI] = 1.314 [1.061–1.628]) and in both adults (OR [95% CI] = 1.299 [1.098–1.537]) and children (OR [95% CI] = 1.464 [1.044–2.052]). As for the C+33T polymorphism, the results showed that it was correlated with elevated asthma risk in a recessive genetic model (OR [95% CI] = 1.744 [1.215–2.504] for TT vs. CT + CC). After stratifying analyses by ethnicity, age and atopic status of asthmatics, significantly increased asthma risks were observed in Asians (OR [95% CI] = 1.223 [1.037–1.442]), Caucasians (OR [95% CI] = 3.036 [1.224–7.529]), and children (OR [95% CI] = 1.300 [1.075–1.573]) in a recessive genetic model.
sions
eta-analysis suggests that the IL-4 C-589T and C+33T polymorphisms may be risk factors for asthma.

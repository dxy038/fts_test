This study serves as a primary application of the integrated system dynamics and multiple-objective programming (ISDMOP) model for strategic planning of Beijing city, which is here divided into six subsystems as population, resources, energy, economy, environment and ecosystem, with the planning horizon spanning from 2003 to 2020. Comparison between the original system dynamics (ORSD) model based on the existing economic structure of Beijing and the optimized system dynamics (OPSD) model adjusted according to the solutions of the multiple-objective programming (MOP) are conducted. The developing trend of each subsystem is simulated and illuminated, based on which constructive suggestions are provided for urban strategic planning of Beijing. The ISDMOP model is proved effective for investigating urban dynamics and realizing the multiple-objective programming.

In the acupressure group, sea bands were placed on Nigan (p6) point on hands. While in the pyridoxine group 40 mg B6 tablet was administered daily.
Results: Nausea scores and frequency of vomiting decreased significantly (p<0.001) after treatment in both groups. Acupressure was more effective in reducing the frequency of vomiting (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the severity of vomiting between treatment groups.

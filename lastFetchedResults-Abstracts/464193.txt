OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to study the effects of isradipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, on mother and fetus in the treatment of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
STUDY DESIGN: The investigation was performed as a two-group, parallel, double-blind multicenter study of isradipine versus placebo. Fifty-four women were randomized to treatment with isradipine slow-release capsules given orally 5 mg twice a day and 57 to a placebo group.
RESULTS: Isradipine lowered the maternal mean arterial blood pressure effectively in women with nonproteinuric hypertension but did not do so in women with proteinuria at recruitment or appearing during treatment. Blood flow in the umbilical artery and maternal renal and liver function were not influenced by treatment. Isradipine had few side effets and was well tolerated.
CONCLUSION: Calcium channel blockade with isradipine is effective for treatment of nonproteinuric hypertension but not in preeclampsia.

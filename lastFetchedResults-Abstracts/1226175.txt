The objective of this study is to search for the possibility to transport or deliver small solid particles by a vortex ring. The numerical simulation for the motion of a vortex ring and glass particles is performed. At the launch of a vortex ring into quiescent air, spherical particles are arranged on the cross-section of the vortex ring. The cases of the Stokes number St of 0.01 and 1 are simulated by the vortex method. The simulation for St = 0.01 highlights that the vortex ring involves the particles at the launch and that it can transport the particles at a distance of 5.5 times longer than the initial diameter of the vortex ring. The simulation also clarifies the effect of St on the behavior of the vortex ring and the particle motion.

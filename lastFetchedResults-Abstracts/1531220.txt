Reduce the amount of soil infiltration depends on suspended material, the infiltration rate, soil physical characteristics and quality the floodwater spreading. Seems to be entering fine-grained sediment into the network during the flood, reduce the efficiency of these projects and in long time to actually lose their effectiveness. The main objective of this study is the effect of sediment deposited on the variation of infiltration rate by the floodwater spreading. In this study, using double rings with triangular surface soil infiltration rate and deposited in the field of measurement and relevant data were entered into the Excel soft ware. The analysis and comparison of the effects of the floodwater spreading on soil infiltration rate compare to control was indicated using the statistical method of factorial completely randomized design. To mean comparison of the main effects of floodwater spreading and the different between the floodwater playing was used Duncan method at 5% level. It is necessary, the control values in the first year are considered compared with all samples in different years. In general, analysis of variance showed that the difference the soil infiltration rate between the soil depths was significant at 1 % and 5% flood level. But the interaction of the depth and flood on infiltration rate was not significant at 1 % and 5% level.

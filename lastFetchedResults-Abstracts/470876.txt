Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of 2 different call schedules on post-call cognitive function and satisfaction.
Study design
This is a prospective observational pilot study of 20 third-year medical students. A computerized cognitive function test was administered to students with call every fourth night or a week of 12-hour “night float” shifts. Questionnaires were completed to assess satisfaction on different call schedules.
Results
There was no significant difference in cognitive functioning scores for students on either call schedule. Responses on questionnaires indicate that night float allows students to feel more alert for clinical duties (P = .03).
Conclusion
There is no significant impact of sleep deprivation on cognitive scores; however, night float allows students to feel subjectively more alert for clinical duties.

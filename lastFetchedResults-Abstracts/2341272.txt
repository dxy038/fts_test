The objective of this work was to investigate the transverse rupture strength behavior of tungsten carbide blended with 10wt% Co as a function of temperature. The samples were tested in three-point bending flexure in the temperature range 25–1000°C. Specimens were also indented at room temperature to measure the crack size and the corresponding values of hardness and toughness. The results showed that the WC-Co composite suffered a strength loss at temperatures above 600°C. The fracture analysis indicated the presence of oxidation and microstructural defects in the samples tested at the higher temperatures.

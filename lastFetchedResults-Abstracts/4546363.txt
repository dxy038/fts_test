This paper investigates bidirectional relaying with direct link, where two sources exchange data via a relay node using an amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. Two power allocation strategies are proposed under Rayleigh fading channels. One scheme aims to improve average sum-rate and the other is to decrease sum-symbol error rate (SER). Numerical results have indicated significant performance gain over the equal power allocation.

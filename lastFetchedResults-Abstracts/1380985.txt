Hydrogen enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) is a viable mechanism for hydrogen embrittlement supported by experimental observations. According to the HELP mechanism, hydrogen induced premature failures result from hydrogen induced plastic instability which leads to hydrogen assisted localized ductile processes. The objective of this work is to reveal the role of hydrogen in possibly localizing the macroscopic deformation into bands of intense shear using solid mechanics methodology. The hydrogen effect on material deformation is modeled through the hydrogen induced volume dilatation and the reduction in the local flow stress upon hydrogen dissolution into the lattice. Hydrogen in assumed to reside in both normal interstitial lattice sites (NILS) and reversible traps associated with the plastic deformation. The analysis of the plastic deformation and the conditions for plastic flow localization are carried out in plane strain uniaxial tension. For a given initial hydrogen concentration in the unstressed specimen, a critical macroscopic strain is identified at which shear localization commences.

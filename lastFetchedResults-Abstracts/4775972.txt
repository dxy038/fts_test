Compressed video bitstreams are very sensitive to transmission errors. If we lose packets or receive them with errors during transmission, not only the current frame will be corrupted, but also the error will propagate to succeeding frames due to the spatiotemporal predictive coding structure. Error detection and concealment is a good approach to reduce the bad influence on the reconstructed visual quality. To increase concealment efficiency, we need to get some more accurate error detection algorithm. In this paper, we present a new error detection scheme based on a fragile watermarking algorithm to increase the error detection ratio. We verified that the pro posed algorithm generates good performances in PSNR and objective visual quality through the computer simulation by H.324M mobile simulation set.

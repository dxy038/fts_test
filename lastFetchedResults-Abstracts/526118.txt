Methods: Wistar male rat (n=40) were allocated into three groups, control group (n=10) and ginger (G) group that received 100mg/kg-perday (oral), (n=10), and Diabetic group that received 55 mg/kg (IP) streptozotocin (STZ) (n=20) which was subdivided to two groups of 10; STZ group and treatment group. Treatment group received 55mg/kg (IP) STZ plus ginger 100mg/kg-perday (G), daily for, 4 weeks, respectively; however, the control group just received an equal volume of distilled water daily(IP). Diabetes was induced by a single (IP) injection of streptozotocin (55 mg/kg). Animals were kept in standard condition. In 28day after inducing diabetic 5cc blood were collected for TAC, MDA and sperm parameters and testis tissues of Rat in whole groups were removed then prepared for analyzes. 
Results:TAC, MDA and sperm parameters significantly decreased in diabetic group.treatment groub that has received Ginger 100 mg/kg (oral) show increasing in TAC and sperm parameters (p < 0.05) in comparison to experimental groups (p < 0.05). 
Conclusion: Since in our study 100 mg/kg (oral) ginger have significantly Preventive effect on sperm parameters, so it seems that using it can be effective for treatment in Diabetic Rat.

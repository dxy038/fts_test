A new tool for modeling systems called bidirectional Petri nets (BPNs) is presented. It increases the degree of abstraction drastically, and makes it possible to model complicated systems concisely. The method uses a two-level system modeling technique. The first level has the responsibility for all basic transmissions, and the second level models the higher-level structure of the whole system. The abstraction process is demonstrated by means of an example. The queue migration algorithm for mutual exclusion in computer networks is chosen as an example.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

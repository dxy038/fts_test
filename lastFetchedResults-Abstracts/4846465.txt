Summary form only given. Birefringent layered media play an important role in a number of applications. Such structures constitute a particular class of one dimensional photonic band gap (PBG) crystals. In the present work, we extend the theory into the regime where a finite number of optically anisotropic layers is considered with the objective of determining the spectral transmission properties and dispersion relations. In the case of isotropic layered media, the electromagnetic radiation can be divided into two independent (uncoupled) modes. These are TE modes and TM modes. Since they are uncoupled, the matrix method involves the manipulation of 2 /spl times/ 2 matrices only. In the case of birefringent layered media, the electromagnetic radiation consists of four partial waves. Mode coupling takes place at the interface where an incident plane wave produces waves with different polarization states due to anisotropy of the layers. As a result, 4 /spl times/ 4 matrices are needed in the matrix method. We have analyzed cases in which the layers of the elementary cell of the finite periodic structure are both anisotropic, finding different regimes depending on the alignment of the principal axis of the two media. Interesting results have been found when in the two layers of the elementary cell the optical axis is rotated by an angle.

HER-2/neu (HER2) has been shown to be a valuable biomarker for breast cancer. However, inter-observer variability has been reported in the evaluation of HER2 with immunohistochemistry. It has been suggested that automated computer-based evaluation can provide a consistent and objective measure of HER2 expression. In this manuscript, we present an automated method for the quantitative assessment of HER2 using digital microscopy. The method employs imaging algorithms on whole slide images of tissue specimens for the extraction of two features describing HER2 membrane staining, namely membrane staining completeness and membrane staining intensity. A classifier was trained to merge the extracted features into an overall slide assessment score. Preliminary results showed good agreement with the provided truth. The developed automated method has the potential to be used as a computer aid for the immunohistochemical evaluation of HER2 expression with the objective of increasing observer reproducibility.

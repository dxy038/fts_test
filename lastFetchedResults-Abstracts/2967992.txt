We propose a new bidirectional associative memory (BAM) named multiwinners self-organizing bidirectional associative memory (MWS-BAM) in this paper. The proposed MWS-BAM has two processes for pattern pair storage: storage process and recall process. For the storage process, the proposed MWS-BAM can represent one piece of pattern pair distributedly in the distributed representation layer and stores the relation using the upward weights. In addition, the MWS-BAM can store the relation of the distributed representation and the other piece of pattern pair in the downward weights. For the recall process, the MWS-BAM can recall information bidirectionally: one piece of the stored pattern pair by receiving the other piece in the input-output layer for any stored pattern pairs

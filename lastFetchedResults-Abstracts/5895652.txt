This paper proposes a new affine registration algorithm for 2D point matching. It is a two-step iterative registration algorithm by soft weight assignment based on bidirectional distance. At each iteration, the affine transformation is updated by two optimization steps, in which the model data and the test data are matched from each other respectively. By the optimization of registration at separate steps during each iteration, the proposed algorithm can provide a good estimate of the accurate affine transformation in condition of poor initialization and lack of geometric assumptions on point sets. Some experiments about comparison with the current state-of-the art approaches, demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our method.

The Teaching Company Scheme offers a great deal of opportunity and benefits to both the industrial and academic partners involved. This article pays particular reference to an ongoing programme that exists between ICI Engineering and the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In order to place the scope of the project into perspective, the authors describe briefly the technology involved. The original objective of this programme was to install and commission three successful neural network algorithms onto three separate chemical processes. As time has progressed, the original objective has been found to be extremely conservative in scope. Through exploiting current work and expertise at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the area of neural network theory and practice, many more applications have been possible.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Objective
jective of this study was to define recurrence patterns after nephro-ureterectomy (NU) for urothelial upper tract tumor (UUTT), and to suggest guidelines for follow-up.
s
fects of age, gender, UUTT grade, stage, size, location in the urinary system, and the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy on disease-free survival were assessed retrospectively.
s
three patients (mean age 62.7 years) underwent NU for UUTT and were followed with periodic cystoscopy, urinary cytology, and CT of the chest and abdomen. During a median follow-up period of 72 months, 26 patients (49%) developed tumor recurrence. Almost 95% of the recurrences occurred within the first 48 months following surgery. Two distinct patterns of recurrence were identified: vesical and extra-vesical recurrences. Vesical recurrence occurred in 19 patients (35.8%) and did not impair survival. The risk of vesical recurrence was independent of UUTT grade or stage. Patients who had Grades 1 or 2 UUTT developed only low-grade vesical recurrence, while patients with Grade 3 UUTT developed either high- or low-grade vesical recurrences. Extra-vesical recurrence occurred in 8 patients (15.1%); all had an initial Grade 3 UUTT, and were associated with short median survival.
sions
ts presenting with Grades 1 or 2 UUTT are at risk of developing low-grade bladder tumors. Therefore, cystoscopic surveillance is recommended. Patients presenting with Grade 3 UUTT are at risk of developing both high- and low-grade bladder tumors as well as extra-vesical recurrence. An aggressive multimodality program including cystoscopy, urinary cytology, and CT of the chest and abdomen is advisable.

The objective of the present research is to develop an integrated process planning and scheduling system of machine products, aiming at realizing a flexible production control in holonic manufacturing systems. Basic architecture of the target holonic manufacturing system is discussed from the viewpoint of the integration of the process planning and the scheduling systems. Procedures are proposed to select suitable machining sequences of machining features and suitable sequences of machining equipment, taking into consideration of future schedules of machining equipment. A combined method of GA (Genetic Algorithm) and DP (Dynamic Programming) is applied to selection of the machining sequence and the sequence of the machining equipment.

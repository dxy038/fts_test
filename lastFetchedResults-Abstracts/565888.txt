Background and Objective: Poor vitamin D status has been associated with impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of daily intakes of Iranian yogurt drink doogh fortified with vitamin D or vitamin D + calcium on anthropometric and glycemic status in type-2 diabetes patients. 
Materials and Methods: Ninety patients with type-2 diabetes were randomly allocated to one of three groups as follows: group1: plain doogh; group 2: vitamin D-fortified doogh (fortified with 500 IU vitamin D3 and 150 mg Ca/250 mL);  group 3: vitamin D + calcium–fortified doogh (fortified with 500 IU vitamin D3 and 250 mg Ca/250 mL). The subjects took their respective doughs twice per day for 12 weeks. Anthropometric markers (weight, body mass index, and waist circumference), fasting serum glucose (FSG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were measured before and after the intervention.
Results: In both groups 2 and group 3, the mean serum 25(OH)D3 level increased significantly (P > 0.001). As compared to group 1, in groups 2 and 3 the decreases in FSG [-12.9±33.7 mg/dL 
(P = 0.015) and -9.6±46.9 mg/dL (P = 0.035), respectively], Hb A1c [-0.4±1.2% (P < 0.001) and -0.4±1.9% (P , 0.001), respectively], HOMA-IR [-0.6±1.4 (P = 0.001) and -0.6±3.2 (P , 0.001), respectively], and waist circumference (WC; -3.6±2.7 and -2.9±3.3, respectively; P < 0.001 for both) were significantly higher. An inverse correlation was observed between changes in serum 25(OH)D3 and FSG (r = 20.208,
 P = 0.049) and HOMA-IR (r = 20.219, P = 0.005). 
Conclusion: Daily consumption of vitamin D–fortified doogh with or without added calcium, improves anthropometric and glycemic status in diabetic patients.

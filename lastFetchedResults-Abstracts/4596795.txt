Several routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks work efficiently only in bidirectional networks. Unidirectional links may exist in a real network due to variations in transmission power of different nodes, noise or other signal propagation phenomena, and heterogeneity in the transmission hardware of nodes in the network. We introduce a sub-layer called sub routing layer, SRL, between the network and the MAC layer to provide a bidirectional abstraction of the unidirectional network to the routing protocols. We present a scalable and efficient way to provide this abstraction by finding and maintaining multi-hop reverse routes to each unidirectional link. We simulate SRL and a modified version of AODV (ad hoc on demand distance vector) that uses SRL to route packets in a unidirectional network. We observed that with SRL, the packet delivery of AODV in unidirectional networks increases substantially. Further our simulations indicate that reverse routes are often only a few hops long and hence the overhead of using SRL is very low.

Mercury use in dry cells has been reduced in recent years. An overview of the history of mercury reduction in alkaline and carbon-zinc cells is used to introduce the several approaches that have been taken. A retrospective and prospective characterization study of both carbon-zinc and alkaline cell design at various mercury levels was begun. The objective of the program was to determine the effect of removal of mercury on performance. This study is characterizing the effect of mercury reduction on capacity at various temperatures, capacity maintenance at various storage temperatures and vibration and shock resistance. The initial data support the premise that the removal of mercury from the alkaline and carbon-zinc cells produced has no significant effect on cell performance

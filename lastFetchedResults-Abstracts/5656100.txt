Pair wise comparisons are commonly used to estimate values of preference among a finite set of decision alternatives with regards to intangible factors. Inconsistency within decision making judgments may occur. This work proposes an approach to reducing inconsistency using multi-objective optimization with the objectives of different inconsistency types and judgment modification measures. The approach allows the decision maker to choose both the inconsistency measure(s) and the modification measure(s) employed to suit their needs and attitudes. Utilizing multi-objective optimization allows for a range of possible tradeoff solutions to be presented to the decision maker for selection, aiding them in their pursuit of inconsistency reduction. It also enables better understanding of the characteristics of the decision problem and its inconsistency.

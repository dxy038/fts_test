The authors describe the implementation of a quadratic interior point method for optimal power flow. Optimal power flow involves the determination of the optimal of a given objective function subject to given constraints. The scheme developed solves the quadratic or linear optimization problem subject to linear constraints. The algorithm has been evaluated on a 14-bus system, and its accuracy and speed have been demonstrated

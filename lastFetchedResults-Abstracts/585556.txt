The power system stabilizer (PSS) has been
one the most active area of research in power systems.
The positive effect of PSS on Low Frequency
Oscillations (LFO) damping is obviously clear. Proper
designing of PSS can increase the positive effect. So, to
enhance of the effectiveness, this paper presents a novel
method to reduce LFO. Since the problem of PSS design
can be considered as a multi-objective optimization
problem, this paper proposes an improved Particle Swarm
Optimization (IPSO) algorithm, which is a novel heuristic
optimization algorithm, to improve the searching space
and convergence speed of the Conventional PSO (CPSO)
algorithm. A suitable and comprehensive fitness function
is also introduced to cover the wide operating conditions.
Thereby, this algorithm is employed to identify the
optimal parameters of PSS for Single Machine connected
to Infinite Bus (SMIB) system by minimizing the fitness
function. Simulation results indicate the superiority of the
proposed algorithm.

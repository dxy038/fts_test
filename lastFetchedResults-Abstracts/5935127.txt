A correction chain for the spectral and spatial distortions of multispectral airborne video data is developed in order to enable the use of the data in quantitative studies of forest and land use. The correction chain includes corrections for sensor and system induced effects, for bidirectional effects and for slope and aspect effect. The usefulness of the corrections was tested by a land use classification in the German Alps using uncorrected and corrected data. The classification accuracy was increased from 64.3% to 85.8% by the correction chain

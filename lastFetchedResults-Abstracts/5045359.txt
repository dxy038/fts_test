The objective of this work is to develop a handset adaptive antenna for operation at the frequency of 5.8 GHz. This antenna must be compact and have fast convergence. A phased array of switched beam elements is introduced to speed up initialization of CMA. Using dual-feed switched-beam patch antennas, the antenna system can be compact. An array element has dimension of 15.5times15.5 mm<sup>2</sup> and the array radius of 15.5 mm. Hence, the antenna dimension is 46.5times46.5 mm<sup>2</sup> which is sufficiently small to install on a handset

This paper investigates the issue of quality of service (QoS) in the reverse channel of a wireless CDMA system supporting integrated voice and data services. With the different QoS requirements of voice and data services, the objective of such wireless system is to guarantee the QoS of voice traffic while allowing data traffic to use the residual channel capacity. An analytical model is developed to quantify the interplay between the QoS of the two types of traffic. BCH codes have been incorporated into the model to study the joint effect of FEC coding and traffic control

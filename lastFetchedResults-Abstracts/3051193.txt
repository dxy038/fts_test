Optimal assignment of codes with multiple time slots is considered for multicarrier CDMA data networks. Our objective is to minimize the transmission time given the amount of each userÂ´s data to be transmitted. A user may experience different performance with different assigned codes in a fading channel. Therefore, with suitable time sharing of the codes among users, the transmission time can be minimized. For practical purpose, we also propose a suboptimal algorithm which can be readily implemented. Simulation results show that by applying the algorithm, the system performance can be very close to the optimal.

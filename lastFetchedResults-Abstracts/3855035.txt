A method of reacquiring a previous phase lock-point using the pulsed phase-locked loop (PPLL) ultrasonic system in situations where the measurement is interrupted such as by removing and recoupling the transducer is developed. Operation of the PPLL is mathematically analyzed in the time domain rather than in the conventional frequency domain, providing a method of characterizing multiple lock-points. The general lock-point reacquisition method that follows from the model relies on measurement over a frequency range that spans several lock-points and is demonstrated to work well for interrupted measurements on threaded fasteners. The method is analyzed for sensitivity to signal noise, and an equation is derived, expressing the number of lock-points over which to measure for successful lock-point reacquisition as a function of signal noise level. Experimental verification on a glass block shows that theoretical values obtained with this model are in good agreement with measurements. Automation of the method presented has been demonstrated, showing that it offers a practical, objective approach to making interrupted load measurements, thereby greatly widening the range of applications of the PPLL

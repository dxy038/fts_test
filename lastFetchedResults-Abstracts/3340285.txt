MRLDE is an enhanced version of Differential Evolutionary (DE) algorithm which adapts a modified approach for selecting individuals for mutation operation. MRLDE has been successfully tested on various benchmark problems and some real life applications. The objective of this paper is to solving constrained engineering optimization problems using MRLDE. The algorithm is validated using four engineering optimization problems, taken from literature. Pareto-ranking method is used to handle constrained with proposed variant. Results and comparison show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed MRLDE for solving such types of problems.

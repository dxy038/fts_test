This paper presents a new method called Multi-objective Optimization by Reinforcement Learning (MORL), to solve the optimal power system dispatch and voltage stability problem. In MORL, the search is undertaken on individual dimension in a high-dimensional space via a path selected by an estimated path value which represents the potential of finding a better solution. MORL is compared with multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) to solve the multi-objective optimal power flow problems in power systems. The simulation results have demonstrated that MORL is superior over MOEA/D, as MORL can find wider and more evenly distributed Pareto fronts, obtain more accurate Pareto optimal solutions, and require less computation time.

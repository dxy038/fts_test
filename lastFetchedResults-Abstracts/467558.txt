Objective: This study was undertaken to study the effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous terbutaline (SQT) in the home after recurrent preterm labor (RPTL). Study Design: Women with RPTL at less than 32 weeks' gestation were treated with continuous SQT administered in the home compared with matched control patients. Results: Fifteen SQT patients were compared with 45 women (3:1) treated with no tocolytic therapy after hospitalization. Gestational age at delivery more than 37 weeks (53% vs 4%), percentage delivered at less than 32 weeks (0% vs 47%), overall and pregnancy prolongation (49.8 ± 19.2 days vs 24.5 ± 12.8 days) were all significantly better in the study group (P< .001). The total number of maternal hospital days (9.8 ± 2.1 vs 15.9 ± 7.4, P< .0001), duration of NICU stay (1.9 ± 4.9 vs 19.8 ± 29.3 days, P< .001), and total cost for newborn care ($6,995 ± $14,822 vs $62,033 ± $89,978, P< .002) favored the study patients. For every dollar spent on SQT, there was a savings of $4.67 in newborn hospital costs for control patients. Conclusion: In this small study, the use of SQT significantly prolongs pregnancy, decreases serious neonatal complications, and reduces the duration of hospitalization for both mother and infant, as well as neonatal costs.

This paper presents a new flexible voltage control strategy. The optimal voltage control is considered a multi-objective problem. A set of feasible solutions saved as Pareto frontier is searched by the jumping gene EA. Based on the solution set, a multiple criteria decision making technique is used to select a suitable one which is applied as the finial on-line solution under different preferences. This strategy was tested on the New England 39 buses power system.

Background and objective: Compost is beneficial for conditioning the structure and nutrient content of soil. Toxic metals are the most important contaminants that can enter the food chain through the compost products and affect human health. The aim of this study was to assess the arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and lead levels in six brands of vermicompost produced from the organic solid wastes in Tehran and to compare the amounts with the international and national standard levels.

Materials and Methods: This was a descriptive - analytical study in which samples of six brands of vermicompost products were randomly selected from the distribution centers in Tehran, and from each brand four samples were prepared (24 samples). Then the samples were extracted using the TCLP (Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure) method and after filtration the metal concentrations were measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP). All data were analyzed using Excel software.

Results: The means and standard deviations of the toxic metals concentrations (arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and lead) in the collected samples of each brand were reported in terms of mg/kg. The maximum concentrations of these toxic metals were 7.45, 0.15, 0.19, and 79.95 mg/kg, respectively.

Conclusion: The results indicated that the levels of toxic metals in the vermicompost samples derived from the municipal solid waste in Tehran were lower than the permissible limits of the national and international standards.

A mobile distributed system for the monitoring and mapping of electromagnetic field exposure levels in urban environments is presented. The main objective of the system, in accordance with current regulations, is to use mapped values to highlight ´critical´ locations within the investigated area where the environmental electromagnetic field amplitude is higher, and that therefore need careful observation and monitoring or require proper countermeasures to limit alleged health risk. The system is characterized in terms of measurement uncertainty and a brief discussion about its effect on the confidence about the statement that warning limits have been overcome will also be presented. The proposed mobile system counts many advantages, the most immediate ones being an increase of the area investigated compared to that covered by a fixed measurement system employing the same number of device; the opportunity to collect data from different clients onto one server for analysis purposes and support to decision making procedures, and the integration with other informative layers such as population density to obtain an aggregate piece of information that returns, for example, how critical exposure to EM field is when compared to other area with a different population density.

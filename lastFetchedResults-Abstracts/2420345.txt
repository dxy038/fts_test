This paper presents multi-objective differential evolution to optimize cost of generation, emission and active power transmission loss of flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) device-equipped power systems. In the proposed approach, optimal power flow problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. FACTS devices considered include thyristor controlled series capacitor (TCSC) and thyristor controlled phase shifter (TCPS). The proposed approach has been examined and tested on the modified IEEE 30-bus and 57-bus test systems. The results obtained from the proposed approach have been compared with those obtained from nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, strength pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 and pareto differential evolution.

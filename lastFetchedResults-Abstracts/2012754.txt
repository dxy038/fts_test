The agronomic performance of plants is
influenced by their genetic potential and the interactions of
complex ecophysical factors, as well as by management
practices. A 3
-
year field experiment was set up in order to
examine the adaptability of four
Arachis
pintoi
varieties
(
CIAT 17434, CIAT 18744
, CIAT 22160 and AFT 495)
in two
different ecological sites (humid and subhumid zones) of
Benin in West Africa.
A.
pintoi
varieties
were planted at three
sowing densities
(
9, 18 and 36 plants/m
2
).
The objective of
the
trial was to identify t
he most interesting variety
and sowing
density which
could be used in agricultural system
in those
regions
.
Twelve treatments
(2 sites × 4 varieties ×
3 densities)
with four replicates per treatment
arranged in a split
-
block
desi
gn with randomised complete block where varieties were
main plot and sowing densities were subplots.
Data
Stolon
number (SN)
,
stolon density (SD),
dry matter production
(DM
)
, soil coverage
(SC)
and plant dry season survival
(SS)
were monitored for 3 years
after establishment and
were
analysed
with the General Linear Model procedure of SAS.
Data indicated that
plant
(SN)
and
(SD)
varied from 8 to
512 units/m
2
and from 3 to 110 m/m
2
, respectively. The
proportion of the plants that remained green after the 3
-
year
trial varied from 10 to 80%.
(DM
)
varied from 9 to 3153
kg/ha.
For (SN), (SD),
(DM
), (SC)
and (
SS), t
here was
a
significant d
i
fference between sites, varieties
, densities
an
d
years with a significant
site×variety
interaction (P < 0.0
1
). In
general, under humid conditions, varieties ranged in the
following order:
CIAT 17434 = CIAT 18744  >  CIAT 22160  > 
ATF 495. Under subhumid conditions the ranking was:
CIAT 22160  >  CIAT 18744  > 
CIAT 17434  >  ATF 495.
Sowing density of 36 plants/m
2
gave higher
(SC)
and
(DM)
.
Sowing density had no influence on
plant dry season survival

Recent advances in evaluating and measuring the perceived visual quality of three-dimensional (3-D) polygonal models are presented in this article, which analyzes the general process of objective quality assessment metrics and subjective user evaluation methods and presents a taxonomy of existing solutions. Simple geometric error computed directly on the 3-D models does not necessarily reflect the perceived visual quality; therefore, integrating perceptual issues for 3-D quality assessment is of great significance. This article discusses existing metrics, including perceptually based ones, computed either on 3-D data or on two-dimensional (2-D) projections, and evaluates their performance for their correlation with existing subjective studies.

BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions) plays a central role in realistic rendering. The non-linear specular reflection in a BRDF model is a time-consuming calculation, and therefore becomes the bottleneck for reaching real-time rate. To overcome this problem, a rendering technique based on texture mapping is proposed to accelerate the computation of BRDF. Its fundamental idea is to decompose a BRDF into several sub-functions which are precomputed and stored as conventional texture maps. The experimental results with performance analysis have validated our algorithm.

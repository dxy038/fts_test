Introduction & Objective: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) reduces cardiovascular mortality and improves cardiovascular and mental status of cardiac patients. Evaluation of the effects of CR in different groups according to sex, age and cause of disease would help the CR program to be special and individual and reduces the cost of treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of CR in patients referring to CR program with different reasons.
Materials & Methods: We studied 310 cardiac patients including 150 CABG, 44 PICA and 110 persons with any other cause like MI, angina, etc. without revascularization. All patients were subjected to a 24 sessions of CR including aerobic exercise, education & diet therapy. Exercise capacity, ejection fraction (EF), lipid profile and body mass index (BMI) were measured before & after the CR program. The data were analyzed using Chi-square, independent pair t-lest and ANOVA.Results: Results of this study showed that lipid profile, exercise capacity, EF and BMI were improved after CR in all groups. Changes of the variables were the same in all groups and the differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion: All the male and female patients attending CR program equally benefited from CR. We concluded that patients under medical treatment could improve their cardiovascular status before revascularization and sometimes postpone the intensive procedures.

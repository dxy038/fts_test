Digital cameras usually use color filter array (CFA) to sample red, green, and blue colors, only capturing a color sample at a pixel location. The full resolution image is obtained by interpolating or demosaicking the subsampled colors. In this paper, a new demosaicking algorithm is proposed using the directional weighting technique. Our algorithm can effectively suppress the common zipper-effect and false color artifacts. Experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other some state-of-the-art demosaicking algorithms in terms of both subjective and objective measures over the twelve Kodak testing images.

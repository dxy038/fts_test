The Forum of Patos Lagoon, a multi-partner entity, was established in 1996 to organize the fishery sector of the estuary of Patos Lagoon (Brazil). Through the Forum, a strong link between fishermen and researchers has been established. Some research projects are being developed according to the needs of the fishermen. To develop research projects related to community needs means to produce results in a short time even in the absence of accurate scientific data. The use of the precautionary approach is fundamental in these situations. Results of the research are presented to the fishermen, and the possible management alternatives and the consequences of each alternative appear after intensive discussions with the fishermen, backed by the scientific knowledge supported by the traditional knowledge. Research results constitute the framework under which the suggestions and opinions from fishermen and other fishery-related groups will help to build the most adequate management solution. Fishermen are involved in resources management from the beginning of the process, discussing the problems, the alternatives to solve the problems and the consequences of each alternative. Decision-making is a collective process and responsibilities are shared. Although not all the community needs will be satisfied as well as not all the science requirements will be attained, the objective is, in fact, to find a way to adjust community needs to science requirements, aiming ecological balance, social justice and economic return.

An algorithm for supervised classification using vector quantization and entropy coding is presented. The classification rule is formed from a set of training data {(X<sub>i</sub>, Y<sub>i</sub>)}<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup>, which are independent samples from a joint distribution P<sub>XY</sub>. Based on the principle of minimum description length (MDL), a statistical model that approximates the distribution P<sub>XY</sub> ought to enable efficient coding of X and Y. On the other hand, we expect a system that encodes (X, Y) efficiently to provide ample information on the distribution P<sub>XY</sub>. This information can then be used to classify X, i.e., to predict the corresponding Y based on X. To encode both X and Y, a two-stage vector quantizer is applied to X and a Huffman code is formed for Y conditioned on each quantized value of X. The optimization of the encoder is equivalent to the design of a vector quantizer with an objective function reflecting the joint penalty of quantization error and misclassification rate. This vector quantizer provides an estimation of the conditional distribution of Y given X, which in turn yields an approximation to the Bayes classification rule. This algorithm, namely discriminant vector quantization (DVQ), is compared with learning vector quantization (LVQ) and CART<sup>R</sup> on a number of data sets. DVQ outperforms the other two on several data sets. The relation between DVQ, density estimation, and regression is also discussed.

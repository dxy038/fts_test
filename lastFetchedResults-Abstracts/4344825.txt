This paper presents new transfer schemes for client-server traffic over ATM networks, with the objective of achieving a bounded transmission time of about one second for as many connection requests as possible. We evaluate via simulations the performance of these new schemes in terms of network utilization, cell loss ratio, and transmission time. The simulation results show that these schemes provide effective means of supporting client-server traffic with quasi-real time requirements

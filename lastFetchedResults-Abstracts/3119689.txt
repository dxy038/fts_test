The paper is concerned with the layout optimization of continuum structures using topology optimization. The objective of the optimization is a maximization of the magnitude of the fundamental simple and multiple eigenfrequencies of linearly elastic structures without damping. SIMP (solid isotropic material with penalization scheme) is used to indicate the dependence of material modulus upon the element densities. The topology optimization problem is treated via a max-min formulation based on a variable lower bound technique. The sequential linear programming method is employed as optimizer. Two numerical examples are presented to show the feasibility of the present approach.

Monte Carlo simulation is used to study electrostatic dipole-dipole interaction and its influence on dielectric polarization. In systems of disordered permanent dipoles the dipole-dipole interaction is shown to reduce the polarization. The influence of the interaction is stronger in dipole systems with three allowed axes than in systems with bidirectional dipoles with one axis only. Due to interaction in systems with bidirectional dipoles a hysteresis loop of P(E) is found. When dipoles are placed on cubic lattice sites, the interaction results in an increase of the polarization similar to the prediction according to the Lorentz field

Objective: To examine the efficiency of both the Zeta and density gradient centrifugation
(DGC) methods for the selection of normal chromatin sperm by TUNEL, sperm chromatin
dispersion (SCD), acridine orange and chromomycin A3 (CMA3 ).
Materials and Methods: The study was performed on 63 patients . Semen analysis was carried
out according to WHO criteria . Semen samples were divided into three equal portions.
One portion was used as the control, the second portion was used for the Zeta method and
the third portion underwent DGC method.
All portions were evaluated for sperm morphology (Diff Quick staining ), protamine deficiency
(CMA3) and DNA integrity (SCD, AO and TUNEL). Coefficients of correlation and students
t test were carried out using SPSS 11.5.
Results : The mean percentage of abnormal sperm, protamine deficiency and DNA fragmentation
in the Zeta and DGC methods were significantly decreased as compared to the control
group (p<O.005). In addition, the DGC method was higher in comparison to the Zeta method
in the selection of sperm with normal morphology (p<O.005). The Zeta method was higher in
comparison to the DGC method in the selection of sperm with intact DNA (p<O.005).
Conclusion: Both Zeta and DGC methods were effect ive in the selection of sperm with better
quality in terms of normal morphology, normal protamine content and DNA integrity. Therefore.
we suggested that the combined Zeta and DGC method should be used for selection
of normal sperm .

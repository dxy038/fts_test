Replica placement is an important technology in data grid to increase data availability and reduce access cost. Existing methods to resolve QoS-aware replica placement problem are only based on obtaining the minimal system cost. This paper further investigates the influence of economic benefit to QoS-aware replica placement problem and proposes a multi-objective optimization model. Also, an optimization algorithm based on genetic algorithm is presented. At last, a numerical experiment is given, and the result indicates that multi-objective optimization model presented in this paper can find better solution than the signal-objective optimization model.

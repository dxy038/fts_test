Objective
The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of pelvic floor surgery on Q-tip angle and point Aa of the pelvic organ prolapse quantification system.
Study design
A clinical database was used for this retrospective review of Q-tip and prolapse measurements before and after pelvic floor surgery. Subanalyses of isolated bladder neck and prolapse surgeries were also performed. Correlations between Q-tip and point Aa were assessed with Pearson and Spearman coefficients and the Z statistic.
Results
Correlations between Q-tip and point Aa for all 350 women were not significantly different before and after the operation (r = 0.45 vs 0.49; P = .50). Subanalysis of the bladder neckâ€“only group demonstrated similarly fair correlations (r = 0.26 vs 0.31; P = .71; n = 94). The prolapse-only group demonstrated better overall correlation without significant differences before and after the operation (r = 0.78 vs 0.51; P = .10; n = 26).
Conclusion
Point Aa does not reflect bladder neck mobility accurately as measured by the Q-tip angle after surgical restoration of the pelvic anatomy.

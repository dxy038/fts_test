This paper addresses the problem of overall quality measure for high-quality three-dimensional (3D) images employing a new criteria: reality, which is defined as a function of picture parameters relating to immersion, picture quality and 3D sensation. Based on this criterion, the subjective quality and the objective quality of 3D images displayed by different systems are measured. The regression analysis showed consistency between them by introducing a penalty factor for artificial contents. This measure will be useful for the evaluation of emerging high-quality 3D images

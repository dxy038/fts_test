A geometric program (GP) is a type of mathematical optimization problem characterized by objective and constraint functions, where all functions are of posynomial form. The importance of GP comes from two relatively recent developments: (i) new solution methods can solve even large-scale GP extremely efficiently and reliably; (ii) a number of practical problems have recently been found to be equivalent to or approximated by GP. This study proposes an effective linear approximation method for solving geometric programming problems.

Developing learners' lexical competence is one of the goals of language teaching. In this study, our objective was to contribute to this goal by using the Internet and see its effect on vocabulary learning. In this context, Internet-based vocabulary classes were held with French-learning students according to the time series model. The lessons lasted for 12 hours (12 weeks=1 hour/week). The first four weeks, the lessons were conducted in a traditional way (student book+whiteboard), the following four weeks with the Internet, and the last four weeks in a traditional way again. The results showed that the average scores obtained from the quizzes made after each class have risen when the Internet was used, and this increase was stable during the lessons conducted without the Internet. In conclusion, the Internet has indicated a positive effect on vocabulary development in foreign language teaching.

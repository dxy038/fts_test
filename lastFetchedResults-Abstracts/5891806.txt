This paper is a continuation of work originating from the simulation of Inguinal Hernia Repair. Whilst the majority of research in the medical simulation field is for minimally invasive techniques, the objective of our research is to develop a general framework for open surgery simulation. We focus here on the finer details of implementing such a simulator using advanced rendering techniques, collision detection and haptic feedback.

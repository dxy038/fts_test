Traffic engineering handles complex problems that include several objects, some of which are conflicting. Subjective and illogical behavior of traffic users still increase the vagueness of the transportation planning and study. Fuzzy logic and its capability to imitate human decision-making provide systematic approach to the multi-objective problem solving, which makes it competitive method also in traffic signal controlling. This paper discusses the fuzzy traffic signal control in general and presents some results of fuzzy signal control, which indicate good performance compared to traditional vehicle actuated signal control

In this paper, we propose a formulation of the spatial search problem, where a mobile searching agent seeks to locate a stationary target in a given search region or declare that the target is absent. The objective is to minimize the expected time until this search decision of targetÂ´s presence (and location) or absence is made. Bayesian update expressions for the integration of observations, including false-positive and false-negative detections, are derived to facilitate both theoretical and numerical analyses of various computationally efficient (semi-)adaptive search strategies. Closed-form expressions for the search decision evolution and analytic bounds on the expected time to decision are provided under assumptions on search environment and/or sensor characteristics. Simulation studies validate the probabilistic search formulation and comparatively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed search strategies.

Objective
The purpose of this study was to determine factors that are associated with recurrent prolapse.
Study design
Of 389 women who underwent vaginal prolapse and incontinence between June 1996 and May 1999, 176 women had 1-year follow-up evaluations. Recurrent prolapse was analyzed by both pelvic organ prolapse quantification stage and centimeter measurements that were relative to the hymen. Logistic regression was used to determine odds ratios and 95% CI for factors that were associated with recurrent prolapse.
Results
One year after surgery, 102 women (58%) had recurrent prolapse (≥stage II). Seventeen women (10%) had prolapse ≥1 cm beyond the hymen. Age <60 years (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6-6.4; P = .001) and preoperative pelvic organ prolapse quantification stage III or IV (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.3; P = .005) were associated with a greater likelihood of recurrent prolapse (≥stage II) at 1 year.
Conclusion
Younger women and women with more advanced prolapse are more likely to experience recurrent prolapse after vaginal repair.

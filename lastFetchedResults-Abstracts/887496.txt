Objective(s)Luminal epithelial basement membrane of endometrial has a major role in implantation. Studies have shown that the rate of successful implantation in stimulatory cycles is less than natural cycles due to detrimental effects of super ovulation drugs on endometrial tissue.The aim of this study is to determine the changes of basement membrane of human endometrial due to the effects of stimulatory drugs. 
Material & Methods: Endometrial tissue samples with natural cycle (N= 10, control group), and stimulation cycles (N= 10, test group) at the time of implantation (120 h after injection of HCG) were prepared. Ovulation was done by injection of agonists GnRH and HMG. The specimens were processed for electron microscopic study. Qualitative study of electron density, and quantitative study increased thickness of basement membrane) were performed on micrograph. The data was analyzed using test. 
Results: The qualitative study showed a significant increase of electron density basement membranes in e test group. The quantitative study indicated that some parameter of basement membrane such as overall thickness, dark and clear was significantly increased in test group compared to control group. This difference was statistically significant (P? 0.05). 
Conclusion: Considering the above findings, it can be concluded that super ovulation drugs may lead to low implantation rate by affecting the luminal epithelial basement membrane of the endometrium

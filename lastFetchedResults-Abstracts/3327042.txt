The cellular environment continuos being a very good support for the development of the new generation of mobile communication. Its main characteristic is the levels of interference as a result of intensive reuse of the spectrum. Intercell interference limits the capacity of wireless networks, so, it is important to know its statistic over the surface of the cell and to use new technologies with some levels of coordination to mitigate it. The objective of this study is to analyze the behavior of the interference over an active cell from the nearest one (first tire in this case) and to provide a comparison between a partially coordinated OFDM in front of a fully uncoordinated frequency hopping OFDM network. We present the results of the total throughput in both cases.

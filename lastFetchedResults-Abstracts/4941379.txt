The objective of this work is to model a switched Ethernet architecture in order to be able to evaluate the end to end delays. The major interest is to apply these results in an industrial or technical context, where the communications are strongly time-constrained. In this paper, we have chosen the network calculus theory, because it enables a good representation of the exchanges between the equipment which are connected to the network, and also to determine the maximum end to end delays. This paper describes several models of the switching function, in order to identify the better one, regarding some tests achieved by using a network simulation tool.

Since the satellites become more common for today´s communication area, the process and the improvements in the satellite networks are gaining importance. One of the challenges in satellite networks is the routing operation between two end nodes, because, these networks have dynamic changing satellite movements. During these movements, a satellite can give its coverage area service order to one of its neighboring satellites. Also some calls can be blocked when the call densities exceed the communication link´s capacities or the signals interfere with each other. All of these situations make the routing operation quite complicated. In this study, we design a new routing algorithm for low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems. We use dynamic satellite topologies containing different number of nodes. We apply the genetic algorithms during the optimization steps. We introduce a new objective function including the delay and the aging factor as the characteristic properties of the paths. Finally, we compare the paths with each other and select the optimal path having the best fitness value.

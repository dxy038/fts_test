In this paper, Dynamic Multi-Swarm Particle Swarm Optimizer (DMS-PSO) which was first designed for solving single objective optimizations problems is extended to solve Multi-objective optimization problems with constraints. Through analysis, novel pbest and lbest updating criteria which are more suitable for solving Multi-objective optimization problems are proposed. By combining the external archive and the novel updating criteria, excellent performance is achieved by DMS-MO-PSO on eight benchmark test functions.

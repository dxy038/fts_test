Guidance concerning recommended storage times for sediments to be used in toxicity tests generally has not been based upon systematically collected experimental data. The objective of this study was to better define the effects of storage time on toxicity of a series of freshwater sediments. Sixteen sediments with varying types of contaminants were collected, homogenized and stored at 4Â°C in 1 liter aliquots, which were periodically tested for toxicity to the amphipod Hyalella azteca and the midge Chironomus tentans after storage times of up to 101 weeks. The sediments ranged from non-toxic to extremely toxic (100% mortality) in 10-day assays, with several of the samples displaying an intermediate degree of toxicity (e.g. partial mortality, reduced growth). Biological responses in most of the samples did not vary with time relative to their statistical relationship to control values; samples identified initially as toxic (or non-toxic) tended to remain toxic (or non-toxic) regardless of when they were tested. The variations that were observed in biological responses over time generally were not systematic; that is, there were no apparent trends in samples becoming more (or less) toxic in the 10-day assays. This suggests that the source of at least some of the temporal changes in toxicity were due to inherent biological variability of the assays used to assess the sediments, rather than the effects of storage. In C. tentans tests with the least toxic sediments, among-replicate variability tended to be greater in initial assays than in tests with samples that had been stored for some period of time. This may have been due to the presence of indigenous competitive or predatory organisms that did not survive during prolonged storage.

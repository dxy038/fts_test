ntroduction & Objective: Heterotopic pregnancy refers to the simultaneous occurrence of pregnancy intrauterine and outside of uterine corpus. It is most often manifested in women who have undergone artificial reproductive technology (ART) but rarely occurs spontaneously. Heterotopic pregnancy still remains as a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to practitioners. In this situation physicians should have high suspicion for diagnosis and intrauterine pregnancy protection. This study reported a case of ruptured spontaneous heterotopic pregnancy.
Case: A 32 year-old woman with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and hypovolumic shock in 1386 referred to emergency department in Sanandaj hospital. She reported one previous cesarean section. On examination, the patient's abdomen was distended. She had generalized tenderness and rebound tenderness in abdomen. The ultrasonographic examination revealed large amount of fluid in pelvic and abdominal cavity with a large hematoma in right adnex but there was intrauterine pregnancy at 7 weeks with normal fetal heart activity. She underwent laparotomy for heterotopic pregnancy and ruptured tube with tubal pregnancy removed. Intrauterine pregnancy continued without problem and led to birth of a healthy female neonate.
Conclusion: Physicians should be quite cautious of heterotopic pregnancy in woman at reproductive age. Any abnormality on physical examination or ultrasonography of a patient with intrauterine pregnancy and abdominal pain should heighten the clinician's suspicion for heterotopic pregnancy.

The objective of the paper is to analyze team dynamics, behavior and its impact to the performance and movement of a team under different paradigms. This paper attempts to study and analyze the team behavior in software companies by using a soft computing technique - fuzzy logic. The argument discussed in this paper is that the success of a team is based on the collective behavior of its team members. The paper also supports the concept of virtual team leader whose sole purpose would be to incorporate the suggestions which are better for the team and its performance. The paper assists in getting substantial information about the growing nature of the team. Moreover there is a proposed simulation for the whole project using virtual team predicting the best and worst conditions.

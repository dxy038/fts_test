Objective: Our aim was to review our experience with renal biopsy in pregnancy. Study Design: We reviewed 18 renal biopsies performed during pregnancy or in the immediate postpartum period at the University of North Carolina. Indications, histopathologic findings, complications, and neonatal outcome were reviewed for each case. Results: Fifteen patients underwent biopsy during the antepartum period and 3 in the postpartum period. Only 5 patients had the classic histopathologic preeclamptic lesion glomeruloendotheliosis confirmed. There were 7 identifiable renal hematomas after biopsy; 2 patients required blood transfusion. There were 4 intrauterine fetal deaths in this series; it is presumed that none were a result of the biopsy. Conclusion: Renal biopsy in pregnancy is a morbid procedure and should be considered only if it offers the opportunity to make a diagnosis other than severe preeclampsia in a patient remote from term.

Mapping, monitoring and managing the environmental condition of riparian zones are major focus areas for local and state governments in Australia. New remotely sensed data techniques that can provide the required mapping accuracies, complete spatial coverage and processing and mapping transferability are currently being developed for use over large spatial extents. The research objective was to develop and apply an approach for mapping riparian condition indicators using object-based image analysis of airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. The indicators assessed were: streambed width; riparian zone width; plant projective cover (PPC); longitudinal continuity; coverage of large trees; vegetation overhang; and stream bank stability. LiDAR data were captured on 15 July 2007 for two 5 km stretches along Mimosa Creek in Central Queensland, Australia. Field measurements of riparian vegetation structural and landform parameters were obtained between 28 May and 5 June 2007. Object-based approaches were developed for mapping each riparian condition indicator from the LiDAR data. The validation and empirical modelling results showed that the object-based approach could be used to accurately map the riparian condition indicators (R2 = 0.99 for streambed width, R2 = 0.82 for riparian zone width, R2 = 0.89 for PPC, R2 = 0.40 for bank stability). These research findings will be used in a 26,000 km mapping project assessing riparian vegetation and physical form indicators from LiDAR data in Victoria, Australia.

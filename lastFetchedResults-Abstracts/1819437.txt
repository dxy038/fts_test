Objective
vation of structural and biochemical properties of the root dentin matrix is crucial to favor healing and regenerative periodontal processes. Aim of this study was to evaluate the biochemical characteristics of collagen and chondroitin sulphate of root dentin surfaces exposed by periodontal disease after acid conditioning by means of an immunohistochemical technique.

teeth scheduled for extraction due to periodontal reason were submitted to: (A) scaling and root planning; (B) ultrasonic instrumentation; (C) no instrumentation. Teeth were then exposed to: (1) 10% citric acid; (2) 17% EDTA; (3) no etching. A double immunolabeling technique was performed to identify type-I collagen and proteoglycans and analyzed under FEI-SEM.
s
 10% citric acid revealed intense labeling for collagen fibrils and proteoglycans; lower labeling was found after EDTA conditioning. Unetched specimens showed residual smear layer on the dentin surface resulting in no evident surface labeling.
sions
tudy supports the hypothesis that manual or ultrasonic instrumentation alone is not able to expose the sound dentin matrix, whereas a subsequent acidic conditioning exposes collagen fibrils and associated proteoglycans. The immunohistochemical technique revealed that despite their acidity, both citric acid and EDTA were able to preserve the structural and biochemical properties of the exposed dentin matrix.

This paper presents an experimental large-signal characterization procedure for power inductors in EV applications as well as method to obtain an inductance reference value for the power inductor in bidirectional dc-dc converters. It also discusses the importance of the inductor design project, by describing important constraints, such as core size and saturation. This paper shows that an appropriated large-signal inductance model increases the reliability of simulation studies of the system performance.

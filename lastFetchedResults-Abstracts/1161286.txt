Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica are the most common foodborne bacterial pathogens and are responsible for many outbreaks. Therefore, multiplex detection of these three using a single assay platform is highly desirable. The objective was to develop and optimize a fiber optic sensor for simultaneous detection of these three from food. The streptavidin coated optical waveguides were immobilized with biotinylated polyclonal antibodies and exposed to the bacterial suspensions or enriched food samples for 2 h. Pathogens were detected after reacting with Alexa-Fluor 647-labeled monoclonal antibodies. Ready-to-eat beef, chicken and turkey meats were inoculated with each pathogen (∼100 cfu/25 g), enriched in SEL (Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria), a multipathogen selective enrichment broth for 18 h and tested with the biosensor. The biosensor was able to detect each pathogen, individually or in a mixture with very little cross-reactivity. The limit of detection for the sensor was ∼103 cfu/ml for all three pathogens. Furthermore, the biosensor successfully detected each pathogen, grown in a mixture from enriched meat samples under 24 h. The pathogen presence was further verified by PCR and immunofluorescence assay. The multiplex fiber optic sensor shows promise for detection of the three pathogens if present in the same sample eliminating the use of multiple single pathogen detection platforms.

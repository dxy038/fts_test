The super mechano system (SMS) is a system that can autonomously organise its elements by changing the structures and functions to attain higher performance for a given objective. The key idea of the SMS is to design not only the autonomously objective-configured mechanisms but also the most appropriate controller simultaneously. This concept is completely different from the conventional mechanical control systems, where the controller was designed for the given mechanical system. In SMS, not only the structures of controllers but also that of systems may be variable, these structure variable or redundant systems can be treated as systems under variable constraints. The aim of this project is to seek the fusion of mechanism design and control design to attain higher performance of systems as a whole. Besides the development of SMSs, another aim is to establish the foundation of SMS theory

Objective(s):To investigate the effect of Eucheuma cottonii on alveolar macrophages (AM) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) in particulate matter 10 (PM10) coal dust-exposed rats.
Materials and Methods: Ten groups, including a non exposed group and groups exposed to coal dust at doses of 6.25 (CD6.25), 12.5 (CD12.5), or 25 mg/m3 (CD25) an hour daily for 6 months with or without supplementation of ethanolic extract of E. cottonii at doses of 150 (EC150) or 300 mg/kg BW (EC300). The number of macrophages was determined using a light microscope. MDA levels were measured by TBARS assay.
Results: EC150 insignificantly (P > 0.05) reduces the AM in CD groups compared to non treatment groups. EC150 and EC300 significantly (P < 0.05) decreased MDA levels in CD12.5 and CD25 groups relative to non treatment groups.
Conclusion: E. cottonii attenuated oxidative stress in chronic exposure of PM10 coal dust.

The purpose of this paper is to propose some ways of reading two
wordless picture storybooks which have recently been published, by Suzy Lee and
Bernardo Carvalho respectively. The objective is to analyse the ways in which the
visual discourse can create an effective narrative using a variety of pictorial strategies.
These works were not idly chosen, however. Both are concerned with
ecoliteracy, having narratives that tell a story about a specific relationship between
humans and the sea. Depicting maritime scenarios, the two picture books promote a
special and symbolic approach to the natural environment. The narratives help to
configure the environment as more than merely an undifferentiated space inhabited
by living beings, this being the most elementary concept of ‘‘environment’’; rather,
it is seen as an ecological arena involving the interaction between the landscape and
the living beings it harbours. As such, the books assume the role of promoting not
only habits of proto-literacy, but of ecoliteracy too.

We refer to social autonomy in a collaborative relationship among agents based on delegation and help. We address the problem of adjustable autonomy. We stress in particular the role played in autonomy by: 1) the degree of &#8220;openness&#8221; of delegation; 2) the allowed initiative in (re)starting negotiation; 3) the degree and kind of control; and 4) the strength of delegation with respect to interaction. We show how the adjustability of delegation and autonomy is actually &#8220;bilateral&#8221;. Adjustment is also &#8220;bidirectional&#8221; and multidimensional. Finally, we analyze some reasons for modifying the assigned autonomy and show how the adjustment of autonomy depends: on the delegator´s side; on a &#8220;crisis of trust&#8221; and vice versa; the delegee´s adjustment of its own autonomy depends on some disagreement about the trust received from the delegator, and, in particular, either a higher or lower confidence in itself or in external circumstances. Some preliminary hints about necessary protocols for adjusting the interaction with agents are provided. This work is aimed at providing a theoretical framework, i.e., the conceptual instruments necessary for analyzing and understanding interaction with autonomous entities

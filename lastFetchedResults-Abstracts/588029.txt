This paper introduces an effective parameter for optimum design of integrated cryogenic NGL recovery plants. The process fluid pressure is an important factor which can affect the plant characteristics. A cryogenic liquid recovery plant was selected as a case study. 
The influence of different values of pressure drop in various equipments on the quality and quantity of the process outputs were analyzed. The results show that the product specification, quantity and operating costs of the plant are important parameters which a balance between them will determine the optimum pressure distribution in the process. The plant wide net profit can be used 
as an objective for obtaining the optimum pressure distribution. The productsâ€™ price and operating costs change due to economical and political situations. So the optimum pressure distribution 
in a process can be changed based on the plant wide net profit in various situations.

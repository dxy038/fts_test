The objective of this paper is to investigate blood lipid level and the prevalence and types of hyperlipidemia in male aircrew members of civil aviation and analyzing the possible reasons. We examined 336 cases of male aircrew members. The indices include total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in serum. Individual information were also collected. The serum TG level in different age groups of male aircrew members were all higher than 1.70 mmoL/L.The prevalence rate of hyperlipidemia is 50.9%. The predominant type is high TG with prevalence rate 42.6%. Flying years and accumulated flying hours in group of hyperlipidemia are higher than normal(P&lt;0.05).There were linear relationship between serum TG and annual flying hours, accumulated flying hours. There were no significant difference in TC, TG HDL-C, LDL-C between smoking and no smoking, and between drinking and no drinking. Multi-factors binary logistic regression analysis shown the hyperlipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia risk factors were only BMI, but the BMI positively correlated significantly with accumulation flight hours and annual flight hours. The prevalence rate of hyperlipidemia in aircrew members of civil aviation is markedly higher than that of general population. The predominant type is hypertriglyceridemia. The hyperlipidemia of aircrew probably is partly due to their special working circumstance, especially, the cosmic radiation.

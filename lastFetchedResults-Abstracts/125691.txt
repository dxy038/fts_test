Introduction & Objective: The objective of this study was to determine proven rate of complete aneurysm occlusion and determine new findings such as new aneurysm or vessels occlusion and suggests that postoperative angiography should continue to be used routinely.
Materials & Methods: During a 5 year period, a series of 120 patients (141 aneurysms, 125 of which were surgically clipped) 35 patients who underwent postoperative angiography were studied retrospectively. All of patient has ruptured aneurysms.
Results: A neck remanent was discovered in 17.14%. Complete aneurysm closure was achieved in 82.85%. We had 5 new aneurysm (14.28%) in control angiography and 2 patients with major vessel occlusion (5.71%) and 4 patients with vasospasm (11.42%). We had (48.57%) positive findings in post operative angiography.
Conclusions: Our retrospective analysis revealed that routine post operative angiography has surprising positive findings such as incomplete clipping, new aneurysm, vessel occlusion and vasospasm. Control angiography is recommended even in highly experienced surgeons. This surprising findings can be observed despite the good condition of the patient.

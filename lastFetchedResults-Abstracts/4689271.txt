A fuzzy clustering-based genetic algorithm (FC-GA) is presented to build a genetic algorithm-based fuzzy pulse-pump controller (GA-FPPC) for achieving a fuzzy control-based phase/frequency-locked servomechanism (FC-PFLS). A weighted integral absolute error (WIAE) is presented as the objective function of FC-GA for optimizing the locking behavior of the genetic algorithm-based FC-PFLS (GFC-PFLS). A mixed elitist and fuzzy clustering selection strategy is proposed to achieve high diversity of the FC-GA. A tuning strategy by FC-GA can minimize the overshoot and speed-up the locking performance of the GFC-PFLS. A design example of two-dimensional X-Y mode GFC-PFLS is realized. Simulation and experiment are conducted to assess the system performance, which is close to the theoretical prediction

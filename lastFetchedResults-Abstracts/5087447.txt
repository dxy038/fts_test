High speed slotted bus networks are attractive candidates for MANs, backbone networks for LANs, high speed access networks, and feeder networks for high speed ATM networks. In all of these approaches, there are tradeoffs between utilization, fairness, access delay, overhead, and complexity. Our objective here is to understand the relationship between utilization, fairness, and access queueing delay. The paper extends the FUFA protocol (Chiu and Gallager) to the FUFAet protocol

Objective: The purpose of this study was determining the optimal surgical approach and preoperative examination for a hemangioma of the nasal cavity. We performed to summarize the indications of endoscopic surgery and its postoperative course. Methods: Eight patients with a history of epistaxis found to have an intranasal hemangioma were studied. Radiological study, postoperative course examination after the endoscopic surgery, and histological study were performed on these cases. Results: Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan and MR image together with postoperative histological studies demonstrated characteristic figures of epithelioid hemangioma. Radiological studies were necessary to examine the extension of the tumor. The capillary type usually arose from the nasal septum while the cavernous type was seen in the lateral nasal wall. The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful, and no recurrence was found after endoscopic surgery in all cases. Conclusion: Radiological study was proven effective for the pre-surgical diagnosis. The hemangioma strictly pertaining to the nasal cavity can be completely treated by the endoscopic transnasal surgery. We suggest that the method inflict least stress on the patient and thus considered optimal.

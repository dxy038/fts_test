The goal of this paper is to study the team formation of multiple UAVs and UGVs for collaborative surveillance and crowd control under uncertain scenarios (e.g. crowd splitting). A comprehensive and coherent dynamic data driven adaptive multi-scale simulation (DDDAMS) framework is adopted, with the focus on simulation-based planning and control strategies related to the surveillance problem considered in this paper. To enable the team formation of multiple UAVs and UGVs, a two stage approach involving 1) crowd clustering and 2) UAV/UGV team assignment is proposed during the system operations by considering the geometry of the crowd clusters and solving a multi-objective optimization problem. For the experiment, an integrated testbed has been developed based on agent-based hardware-in-the-loop simulation involving seamless communications among simulated and real vehicles. Preliminary results indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach for the team formation of multiple UAVs and UGVs.

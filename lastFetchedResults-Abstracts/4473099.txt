Precision agriculture is an informational agriculture, and is the developing direction of modern agriculture. How to acquire information is the key problem of precision agriculture. The objective of this research is to design a system to obtain information from field. This system consists of two parts. One is a portable instrument based on MSC-51, which can be used to measure multiple information of field. It includes longitude and latitude of the measurement position, moisture, pH value and electric conductivity (EC) of soil, temperature and humidity of atmosphere and intensity of illumination. The other part is a piece of software based on Visual Basic, which can be used to communicate with the portable instrument and process data. The validation results showed that this system could rapidly and accurately acquire information of filed

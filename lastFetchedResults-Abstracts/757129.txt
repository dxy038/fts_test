The optimal anticoagulation following Fontan operation and its modifications remain controversial and it is even less well defined as regards patients with inherited thrombophilia. We present a case of a child with bidirectional Glenn anastomosis for double inlet left ventricle that suffered a stroke despite aspirin prophylaxis; the patient was combined homozygous for prothrombin G20210A mutation and for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T  mutation as well. The family history was positive for fetal loss and premature cardiovascular disease. Large-scale studies are needed to evaluate whether carriers of thrombophilia mutations need more intense thromboprophylaxis.

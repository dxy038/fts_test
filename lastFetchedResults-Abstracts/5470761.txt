The isin-DANTE method is an hybrid meta-heuristic. In combines the evolutionary ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms with a limited depth search. This depth search is based in the pheromone trails used by the ACO, which allows it to be oriented to the more promising areas of the search space. Some results are presented for the multiple objective k-degree spanning trees problem, proving the effectiveness of the method when compared with other already tested evolutionary methods.

This paper is concerned with the optimization of an active vibration micro-isolator. The process is applied to the whole system including the passive structure, the piezoelectric transducers, the electrical interfaces and the controller. An efficient optimization algorithm based on an interval computation method is used. The authorsÂ´ general objective is to include and develop an early optimization step in the systemic design process of a smart structure. For this purpose, an analytic mathematical model is built, which describes the analytic equations of motion of the main controlled natural mode shape of the micro-isolator. Basically, the method is applicable to a large scale of systems if an analytic description is developed. As case study, the controller and the passive structure are simultaneously optimized so as to obtain a compromise between transmissibility, control energy level and beam strength. The first results obtained are relevant.

This paper discusses the importance of assessing teamwork professional skills, in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. There is a difficulty in assessing teamwork skills in an educational setting. The main objective of this research is to propose an assessment framework and rubric for facilitating the assessment of teamwork skills. In this paper, learning outcome areas for teamwork skills and knowledge are first definedand then assessment tools for the identified learning outcome areas are introduced. In addition, an assessment rubric is proposed based on the framework of the Model of Domain Learning (MDL) and to apply aspects of the literature found in accordance with the learning outcome areas of teamwork. The assessment rubric will be tested in different course levels in the STEM disciplines at different colleges.

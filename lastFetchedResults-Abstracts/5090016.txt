The objective of this study is to compare the performance between a model-based predictive control technique and the established direct transfer function (DTF) approach for matrix converters. Both methods are analyzed in simulations and based on experimental results, reaching to conclusions in terms of the benefits and disadvantages of each control strategy. The predictive method achieves a better performance in terms of input- and load-current THD, PF control and is less affected by a polluted AC grid. The DTF approach, on the other hand, presents benefits during overmodulation, diminished in the implemented practical validation by its greater sensitivity to distorted mains.

Abstract

Objective

Reduction of pain of invasive procedures in neonates can prevent pain side effects. The purpose of present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single low dose of intravenous fentanyl in reducing of lumbar puncture (LP) pain in neonates.

Materials & Methods

In this randomized clinical trial, registered with code number of 2014022616761N150, admitted neonates to Shahid Sadoughi Hospital, Yazd, Iran from August-April 2012 (45 cases) were randomly assigned into two groups to receive 2 ?g/kg of intravenous fentanyl or 0.2 milliliter of normal saline, two min before LP. Primary outcome was success rate in reducing of pain during needle insertion to skin (pain score of less than three). Secondary outcomes were clinical side effects and serious adverse events.

Results

Forty-five neonates including 23 girls and 22 boys were evaluated. Pain reduction was obtained in 39.1% (9 of 23 neonates) of fentanyl group and in 4.5% (one of 22 neonates) of control group. Means of pulse rate (136.41± 9.16 vs. 148.9± 8.99) and pain score during needle insertion (3.41±1.31 vs. 5.8±1.12) were lower in fentanyl group. No severe adverse effects were seen in both groups. Side effects such as vomiting [9% (N=2) in control and 4.3% (N=1) in fentanyle group] and mild transient decrease in oxygen saturation in 8.7% (N=2) of fentanyle group were seen. Safety in two groups was not statistically different.

Conclusion

Intravenous fentanyl might be considered as a safe and effective analgesic drug in LP in neonates.

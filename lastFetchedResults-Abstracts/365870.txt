Etidronate and medronate have been labelled with technetium-99m (99mTc-HEDP, 99mTc-MDP) for bone scanning and, with rhenium-188 (188Re-HEDP) to palliate the pain resulting from bone metastases. The objective of this study was to label alendronate, ABP, a new bisphosphonate, with SnF2-reduced-188Re. The reagents for the 5 mg ABP kit were SnF2, KReO4  and gentisic acid at acid pH. The chemical, spectroscopic and microscopic characteristics, quality control, rat bone uptake of [188Re]Re-ABP and similarities with 99mTc-ABP are presented. We conclude that this is a promising new radiopharmaceutical for bone metastases pain palliation.

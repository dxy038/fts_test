Mobile devices that are equipped with multiple interfaces should choose the best path for each application. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for path selection on multihomed end-hosts. The algorithm operates in two steps. The first step consists of using a MADM algorithm to allocate score to paths. These scores are then used by a bi-objective tasks assignment function which proposes a global flow to interfaces mapping, which garantee a fair load distribution.

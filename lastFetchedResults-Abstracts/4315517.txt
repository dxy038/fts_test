This paper is based on a current research project and describes the implementation of a simulation model, a monitoring and diagnosis system for a pump application in the burner industry. The objective is to improve the reliability and the efficiency of the pump system especially using the pump itself as a sensor. An important part of the project is a simulation environment which provides a basis for the monitoring and diagnosis system.

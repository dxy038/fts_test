Most tourists exploring a destination either join a guided tour or walk on their own using maps. Neither are their individual preferences nor the actual situation considered. These tours are strongly inflexible. The ideal is an intelligent guide taking care of the whole tour organisation and execution in time. This is the main objective of the dynamic tour guide (DTG). The DTG is a mobile agent that selects attractions, plans an individual tour, provides navigational guidance and offers location based interpretation. This kind of ambient intelligence is based on the analysis of all available context information to support the tourist in any possible way with the help of a mobile device.

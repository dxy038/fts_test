The phenomena engaged in liquid media subjected to high power ultrasonic waves are complex because of the presence of the cavitation phenomenon that allows the transformation of the media. The objective of this study is to detect changes in physical properties of a medium by observing the load impedance of the ultrasonic transducer. In this paper, we try to identify the parameters that are susceptible to disturb that measurement.

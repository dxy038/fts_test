This paper focuses on the resource management procedures for a geostationary (GEO) satellite system. The objective of these procedures is the efficient exploitation of the link resources, while assuring the agreed Quality of Service to the traffic entering the satellite network. The main novelties are (i) the integration between Connection Admission Control and Downlink Congestion Control procedures, and (ii) the original adaptation of Kalman filtering theory to cope with these procedures. The proposed solution is validated by simulations.

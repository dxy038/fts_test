The use of web services in the field of e-learning has increased, however, in view of the significant number of these services; proper selection is needed to improve their effectiveness and contribution. We propose in this paper a system of personalized web service recommendation during online training. The objective is to assist learners in their learning activities (individual exercises, group problem solving, etc.) by recommending them the most appropriate web services, both, in relation to their profiles and needs. The proposed system is based on a semantic approach using multiple ontologies. The paper presents the overall approach of recommendation and a semantic representation of the different used ontologies. To illustrate our work, a prototype of our system is presented.

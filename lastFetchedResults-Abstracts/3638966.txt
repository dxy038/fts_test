<i>Multiple</i> <i>description</i> <i>coding</i> (MDC) is an effective <i>error</i> <i>resilience</i> (ER) technique for video coding. In case of frame loss, <i>error</i> <i>concealment</i> (EC) techniques can be used in MDC to reconstruct the lost frame, with error, from which subsequent frames can be decoded directly. With such direct decoding, the subsequent decoded frames will gradually recover from the frame loss, though slowly. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm using <i>multihypothesis</i> <i>error</i> <i>concealment</i> (MHC) to improve the error recovery rate of any EC in the temporal subsampling MDC. In MHC, the simultaneous temporal-interpolated frame is used as an additional hypothesis to improve the reconstructed video quality after the lost frame. Both subjective and objective results show that MHC can achieve significantly better video quality than direct decoding.

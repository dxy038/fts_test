Summary form only given. We consider steady-state scheduling techniques for heterogeneous systems, such as clusters and grids. We advocate the use of steady-state scheduling to solve a variety of important problems, which would be too difficult to tackle with the objective of makespan minimization. We give a few successful examples before discussing the main limitations of the approach.

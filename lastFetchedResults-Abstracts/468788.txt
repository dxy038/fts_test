Objective
This study was undertaken to determine prognostic factors in pregnancies with a subchorionic echolucency.
Study design
One hundred twenty-nine pregnancies with a subchorionic echolucency detected by ultrasound in our unit were identified. Ultrasound reports were reviewed for subchorionic echolucency location, size, gestational age, amniotic fluid volume, and fetal abnormalities. Adverse outcomes evaluated were pregnancy loss before 24 or 37 weeks (PTD) and intrauterine growth restriction. Medical records were reviewed for antenatal complications and neonatal outcomes.
Results
There were 7 (5.4%) pregnancy losses before 24 weeks and 24 (18.6%) pregnancies complicated by PTD. Of the 122 pregnancies reaching viability, those complicated by antepartum bleeding were more likely to deliver prematurely than those without bleeding, (26.6% vs 7.0%, P = .009). Maximum area of subchorionic echolucency, gestational age at subchorionic echolucency detection, amniocentesis, maternal age, and parity were not associated with PTD.
Conclusion
Patients with subchorionic echolucency appear to have a high incidence of PTD. Bleeding appears to be a reliable prognostic indicator.

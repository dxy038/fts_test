Application software development for Web-oriented, virtual product disassembly and identification using 3D VR (virtual reality) requires robust analytical methods, object oriented (OO) modeling and engineering multimedia for knowledge management and communication. The objective of this research is to develop the methodologies, algorithms and technologies to create a Web-based virtual electronic product disassembly system. With this computer-based tool, teams of engineers and technicians can virtually assess and visualize the scope of the disassembly problem, identify critical parts of the product, and then create a disassembly process plan. The novel aspect of this concept is that teams can share disassembly and product identification solutions, quickly identify hazardous components and proprietary components, information and data. The user can then evaluate various disassembly process sequences to maximize value of recovered materials with minimum effort and expense

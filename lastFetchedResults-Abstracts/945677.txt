The objective of this study was to determine different brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in sewage sludge produced in 17 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) located in the Northeast of Spain. A total of eight polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners, from tri- to deca-BDEs, were analyzed. The emerging BFR compounds, hexabromobenzene (HBB), pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB) and decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE) were also analyzed. The instrumental methodology for the analysis was based on gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with negative chemical ionization (GC-NICI-MS). Moreover, liquid cromathography-quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-QqLIT-MS/MS) was applied for the determination of hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and their related compounds, bisphenol A (BPA), monobromobisphenol A (MonoBBPA), dibromobisphenol A (DiBBPA) and tribromobisphenol A (TriBBPA).

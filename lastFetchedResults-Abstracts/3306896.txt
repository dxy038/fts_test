The objective of this work is to increase the reliability of wind turbine blades through the development of new design. In this design, blades are designed carefully to enable absorbing energy with its greatest efficiency. In this work, Solid Edge and ANSYS software have been used to design blades efficiently. This work also gives a hint on the manufacturing processes in the development of the wind turbine system.

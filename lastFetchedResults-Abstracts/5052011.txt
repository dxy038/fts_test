Enterprise innovation system (EIS) comprises technology innovation, strategy innovation, culture innovation, organization innovation, marketing innovation, management innovation and the others. At present EIS shows the characteristics of openness and multi-agents based on innovation stakeholder. The effective and accurate evaluation of EIS depends on rational selection of the target, the model, index system and the method of the evaluation. This article constructs evaluation model of EIS from the view of enterprise innovation actions process, whose evaluation target is innovation capability, designs corresponding evaluation index system, selects close value method as the specific evaluation method. Close value method is an optimum seeking method for multi-objective decision-making, which can integrate multi-targets into a single target to measure overall, and then sort for the evaluation. When the close value is smaller, corresponding innovation capability of the enterprise is stronger. The evaluation model reflects that innovation stakeholders have important effect on EIS, and emphasizes relatively on innovation actions adaptability to external environment.

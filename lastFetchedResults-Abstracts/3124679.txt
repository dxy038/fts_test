This paper proposes a methodology to identify new opportunities for distributed generation (DG) installations, based on consumer process characteristics and utility network needs. The main objective is to postpone investments in reinforcements using distributed generation in places where it is possible to use cogeneration with surplus capacity. The main costs and benefits are investigated and considered in order to compare the available alternatives.

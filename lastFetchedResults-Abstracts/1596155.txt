This paper presents an optimal capacitor allocation method which uses fuzzy reasoning and genetic algorithms for primary distribution systems. In the method, capacitor allocation is applied to correct voltage deviation and reduce power loss for a given load pattern. The problem of capacitor allocation includes determining the location, type (fixed or switched), and size of capacitor. Fuzzy reasoning finds the sensitive buses which are used as the candidate locations for capacitors placement. Genetic algorithms determine the size and type of capacitors to be placed in the system. It is a combinatorial optimization problem which has the objective composed of power losses and capacitor installation costs subject to bus voltage constraints. Three membership functions relating to voltage deviation, real power loss, and reactive power loss are defined for fuzzy application. The proposed approach is demonstrated using two example systems. Computational results show that the proposed method can quickly achieve an optimal or near-optimal solution.

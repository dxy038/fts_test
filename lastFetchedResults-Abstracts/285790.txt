image The relationships between irritants, allergens, and occupations are difficult to keep in mind because of their sheer numbers.

image The objective of this study was to facilitate relating of irritants and allergens to specific occupations.

image A table of common irritants versus occupations and a table of common allergens versus occupations were prepared.

image The two tables facilitate relating common irritants and allergens with occupations.

image Arranging irritants and allergens in columns and occupations in rows within tables permits a rapid two-way approach to relating irritants and allergens and occupations.

Considerable effort has been expanded in attempts to combine the power found in algorithmic languages with the power found in program libraries. However, most of these attempts to construct problem-solving systems for a particular class of users have failed to achieve their objective of providing the user with the potential benefits inherent in such systems. This paper attempts to define and place problem-solving systems in a general context, and thereby shows when the potential for failure or success is high.

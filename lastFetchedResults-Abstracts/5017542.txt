This paper presents applications using the model developed in Part I of the joint paper. Three solution methods are introduced for finding a Nash equilibrium: the use of an MCP solver, the sequential maximization of each individual profit, and the single objective optimization model with a dummy objective subject to the Kuhn-Tucker necessary conditions for a properly efficient solution. Case studies are shown using the three different methods and the results are compared. The conclusion is that the use of an MCP solver is often more efficient in computation than others.

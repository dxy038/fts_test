This paper investigates an energy-efficient transmission scheme in cognitive radio networks, where primary users (PUs) may reoccupy the spectrum when secondary users (SUs) is transmitting data. We aim to maximize the energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the transmission power, the fusion rule threshold and the sensing/transmission durations. Firstly, it is derived that for a given fusion rule threshold, the objective function is unimodal while only one optimization parameter varies. Furthermore, we provide the corresponding closed-form expressions of the optimal data transmission duration and transmission power. Finally, the globally unimodal property is proven, and hence, the globally optimal point can be easily found with the proposed algorithm based on the alternating direction method (ADM). Numerical simulation results show that our proposed scheme is much better than the existing ones.

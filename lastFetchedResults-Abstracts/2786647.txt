In this paper, we study the containment control problem of networked uncertain Lagrangian systems with intermittent communication in the presence of communication delays and possible information loss. Specifically, we present an adaptive distributed control algorithm such that a team of followers asymptotically converge to the convex hull spanned by multiple non-stationary leaders. The interconnection between the systems is represented by a directed graph. Sufficient conditions are presented such that the control objective is reached while communication between agents is allowed only at some discrete instants of time in the presence of irregular communication delays and packet dropout. Simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

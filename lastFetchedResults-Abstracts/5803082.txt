A propulsion method to improve a mobility on the plane without hampering walking ability and increasing its mass too much is proposed. That is the method to attach the passive wheels to their feet and uses the difference of reaction force, toward the axial direction and rotational direction. Propulsion method utilized the anisotropic friction property of wheels which are attached to the legs of the waking robot is proposed. Moreover, these robots can move only flat ground still now because the frictional characteristics of the wheels are more difficult to analyze on uneven terrains than flat ground. The appropriate locomotion trajectories for moving on uneven terrain with gliding locomotion are not found. The objective of this research is to apply the gliding locomotion to uneven terrain by Twin-Frame structure robot. Methods to generate trajectory path and motion path are proposed and validity is confirmed by experimental results.

Dynamic Web service selection with global QoS optimization in Web service composition is a critical issue in Web service composition. In order to solve the problem, based on intelligent optimal theory of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, we propose a strategy PSO-GODSS (global optimization of dynamic Web service selection based on PSO) algorithm to implement Web service selection with QoS global optimization. The basic idea of the algorithm is to transform the original Web service selection problem into a multi-objective services composition optimization problem with global QoS constraints, which is further transformed into a single-objective problem by using the method of ideal point. Then, the theory of intelligent optimization of PSO is applied to produce a set of optimal services composition process with QoS constraints. Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate the feasibility and efficiency of this algorithm, and the execution efficiency and convergence rate of PSO-GODSS are much better than that of multi-objective genetic algorithm used in prior work.

Objective
Retrospective evaluation and comparison of performances of a multivariate method for seizure detection and prediction on simultaneous long-term EEG recordings from scalp and intracranial electrodes.
Methods
Two multivariate techniques based on simulated leaky integrate-and-fire neurons were investigated in order to detect and predict seizures. Both methods were applied and assessed on 423 h of EEG and 26 seizures in total, recorded simultaneously from the scalp and intracranially continuously over several days from six patients with pharmacorefractory epilepsy.
Results
Features generated from simultaneous scalp and intracranial EEG data showed a similar dynamical behavior. Significant performances with sensitivities of up to 73%/62% for scalp/invasive EEG recordings given an upper limit of 0.15 false detections per hour were obtained. Up to 59%/50% of all seizures could be predicted from scalp/invasive EEG, given a maximum number of 0.15 false predictions per hour. A tendency to better performances for scalp EEG was obtained for the detection algorithm.
Conclusions
The investigated methods originally developed for non-invasive EEG were successfully applied to intracranial EEG. Especially, concerning seizure detection the method shows a promising performance which is appropriate for practical applications in EEG monitoring. Concerning seizure prediction a significant prediction performance is indicated and a modification of the method is suggested.
Significance
This study evaluates simultaneously recorded non-invasive and intracranial continuous long-term EEG data with respect to seizure detection and seizure prediction for the first time.

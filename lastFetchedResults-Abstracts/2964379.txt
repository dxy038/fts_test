Few remote sensing missions have been devoted to the aerosol observation, due to measurement difficulties. GOME is a spectrometer in the visible and UV aboard ERS-2 designed to observe ozone and a variety of trace gases, which has the potential of observing aerosols in the troposphere. Though the ERS mission is now in the maturity stage, the European Space Agency Programs has undertook a study to explore the feasibility of observing aerosol from space with existing and planned sensors with the objective of supporting and/or improving other remote sensing activities

In this paper, a key assumption is introduced by virtue of a parametric gap function. Then, by using the key assumption, sufficient conditions of the continuity and Hausdorff continuity of a solution set map for a parametric weak vector variational inequality are obtained in Banach spaces with the objective space being finite-dimensional.

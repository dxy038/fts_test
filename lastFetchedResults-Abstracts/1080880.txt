The MEDAWARE project (which is funded by the Europe Aid program of EU) aims at addressing the significant issue of sustainable urban wastewater treatment and reuse in the agricultural production through the promotion of effective technologies and safe practices. The general objective of this project is to facilitate the change of the current situation in the Mediterranean countries in respect to wastewater treatment and reuse in the agricultural production and the enhancement of the professional capacity building in the wastewater treatment and reuse sector. The methodology implemented and the strategies followed in order to cope with the various issues involved in the field of urban wastewater treatment and reuse are presented and analysed in this paper. A lot of effort has been put to collect information on the best practices and success stories on combined treatment and reuse schemes, to compile guidelines on wastewater treatment and reuse, to safety issues etc. Among others, innovative systems serving remote areas, small communities and mountainous areas have been analysed. An example is provided in this paper of a system serving a mountainous village in Cyprus with 500 inhabitants. The whole system comprises an innovative compact biological wastewater treatment system. A detailed description of this plant is given.

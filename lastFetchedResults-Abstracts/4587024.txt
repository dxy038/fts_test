The objective of this paper is to propose some patch antenna structures for local hyperthermia aiming homogeneous heating for different depths of penetration. The proposed antennas have two different patch geometries and the possibility of using them at lower frequencies allows more deep energy deposition. For a larger coverage area, arrays of patches are proposed and their corresponding obtained results are also presented. The simulations were done using FDTD - finite difference time domain method. The results are very interesting because they show how patch antennas can be used at different frequencies and with different geometries for hyperthermia

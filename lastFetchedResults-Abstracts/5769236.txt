According to the structure features of gear system in co-rotating twin screw extruder, the model of the gear system is built, and multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm based on the Pareto-rank is proposed to optimize the parameters of the gear system. The advanced optimal design method for the gear unit in co-rotating twin screw extruder is studied. A typical gear system in co-rotating twin screw extruder is designed, and the results show that the gear system meets the requirements in all aspects. This design method of the gear system is synthetic optimization for the gear system in co-rotating twin screw extruder.

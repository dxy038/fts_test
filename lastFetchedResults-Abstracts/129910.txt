Background: The effect of lower limb alignment on running is very important. However, relationship between excessive anteversion and physical performance is not completely understood.
Objective: To compare the lower extremity alignments in competitive runners with normal values.
Methods: We studied 153 school-aged runners with a mean age of 15.2 ±3.2 years. Hip internal rotation, hip external rotation and thigh-foot angles were determined and were compared with normal values.
Findings: Thigh-foot angle was significantly (p= 0.02) lower in runners when compared with normal values (12.2 ±16.8 versus 14.5 ±14.5, respectively).
Conclusion: This finding suggests that low thigh-foot angle may correlate with higher running ability.

Objective: The purpose of this ‎research was to study the ‎cognitive functions in patients ‎with methamphetamine-induced ‎psychosis (MIP) in comparison ‎with schizophrenia patients and ‎normal subjects. ‎
Method: This was a cross-‎sectional study, 30 patients with ‎MIP, 30 patients with ‎schizophrenia and 30 normal ‎individuals were selected via ‎convenient sampling and were ‎matched on age, sex and ‎education. Wisconsin Cards ‎Sorting, Stroop, Visual Search ‎and Attention and Wechsler ‎Memory Tests were used to ‎assess the subjects. ‎
Results: The study showed that ‎patients with MIP and ‎schizophrenia have more deficits ‎in executive functions, selective ‎attention, sustained attention and ‎memory than normal subjects. ‎There were no significant ‎differences in cognitive functions ‎between patients with MIP and ‎schizophrenia except for visual ‎search and attention that showed ‎more impairment in patients with ‎schizophrenia. ‎
Conclusion: Although, cognitive ‎dysfunctions of patients with MIP ‎are mostly similar to patients with ‎schizophrenia, some differences ‎seem to exist, especially in those ‎functions that are not primarily ‎dependent on frontal lobe‏.‏

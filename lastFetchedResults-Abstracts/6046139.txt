This paper presents a new method for the reduction of an existing speech database in order to be used for domain independent embedded unit selection text-to-speech synthesis. The method relies on statistical data produced by the unit selection process on a large text corpus. It utilizes the selection frequency, as well as the actual score of each unit. Both objective and subjective evaluation of the method is performed in comparison with existing similar techniques.

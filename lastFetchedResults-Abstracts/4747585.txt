This paper concerns the design of a sliding control law for maximizing the power harvested from the wind by a variable speed induction generator based wind power system. The parameters of this law are tunable for limiting the mechanical stress. An appropriate sliding surface has been found in the speed-power plane, which allows the operation more or less close to the optimal regimes characteristic, thus implementing an energy-reliability optimization. The doubly-fed induction generator used here is torque controlled. The proposed control law is validated by both off-line and on-line, real time simulation, the latter on a dedicated experimental rig, showing that the control objective is fully accomplished

The main objective of this study is to design and implement a suitable algorithm and its simulation for vehicle detection to control road traffic. The system developed is able to detect moving metal objects (vehicles) and then to calculate the appropriate duration for the traffic signals at an intersection to operate. By employing mathematical functions to calculate the appropriate timing for the green signal to illuminate, the system can help to solve the problem of traffic congestion. The sensing element used to detect vehicles was a Magneto-Resistive sensor. The simulation of the algorithm of the traffic signal system was done using software. First stage of the hardware simulation tests were successfully performed on the algorithm implemented into a controller. Using the Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed, the operation of the traffic lights according to the new, calculated time can be observed. The new timing scheme that was implemented promises an improvement in the current traffic light system in terms of time save and track utilization and this system is feasible, affordable and more than that it is ready to be implemented with minimum changes to the current traffic system in Sri Lanka.

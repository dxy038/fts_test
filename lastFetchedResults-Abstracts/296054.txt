Introduction
Understanding the etiology of severe burns injuries and identifying high risk groups are essential for allotting resources for prevention and treatment. The objective of this study was to develop a profile of severe childhood burns in Israel.
Methods
A retrospective study of children (ages 0–14) hospitalized with a burn, between 1998 and 2004. Data from all five burn units in Israel was retrieved from the National Trauma Registry.
Results
Two thousand seven hundred and five children were hospitalized with burns (51% of all burn admissions). Infants (ages 0–1) had the highest prevalence (45%). Scalds caused 68% of burns. Burn extent in 83% of the patients was less than 20% TBSA, 3% suffered 40%TBSA burns. Surgical intervention increased from 6% in 1998 to 21% in 2002. Non-Jewish children sustained proportionally more burn injuries (48%). Among Jewish children an increase in burn injuries was noted on Thursdays and Fridays.
Conclusion
Infants, boys and non-Jewish children were found to be at greatest risk for a burn injury, while older children were at higher risk for severe burns. Prevention programs should target these high risk groups, with an emphasis on the unique characteristics of each group. Policy makers should reassess the benefits of a pediatric burn unit in Israel. The increase in rates of surgical intervention should be further investigated.

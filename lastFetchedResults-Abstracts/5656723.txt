This paper discusses the comparison of two winding topologies in a contactless energy transfer system from the stationary to the rotating part of a device. A rotating transformer, based on a pot core geometry, is proposed as a replacement for wires and slip rings. An electromagnetic and a thermal model of the rotating transformer are derived. The models are combined and used in a multi-objective optimization. A Pareto front, in terms of minimal volume and power losses, is derived to compare both winding topologies. Finally, the optimization algorithm is used to design a prototype transformer for each winding topology, which are manufactured using a commercially available pot core.

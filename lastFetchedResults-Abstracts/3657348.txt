The problem of controller design for constrained robots with the consideration of computational efficiency is addressed. An efficient adaptive variable structure control algorithm based on a reduced dynamics formulation, is presented for trajectory tracking of an end-effector on a constrained surface with specified constraint forces. It is shown that the objective can be achieved without exact knowledge of robot dynamics and on-line calculation of nonlinear dynamic functions. The control algorithm is constructed with at most three control parameters to be adjusted adaptively, and that number is determined independently of the number of degrees of freedom of the robotic manipulators. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the developed method

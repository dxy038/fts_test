In this work we show that the anti-wind-up-bumpless-transfer controller emerges from the structure of model predictive control (MPC) with quadratic objective and input constrains. The key to establish that relationship is the application of optimality conditions to the equivalent optimal control problem. The proposed framework employs a model of physical constraints as part of the controller architecture to ensure that the commands sent to the actuator do not exceed their specific limits and the internal states of the controller are well updated. Numerical examples are presented for illustrating the proposed control design methodology.

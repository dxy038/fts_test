Objective
Although the autonomic nervous system plays a key role in mediating cardiovascular changes during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity during sleep apnea has not yet been sufficiently investigated. This study is to discuss the relationship between PNS activity and OSA.
Methods
Polysomnography recording was carried out in 76 patients (71 male and 5 female) with OSA. Cumulative PNS activity during sleep for each patient was derived from time series data of electrocardiogram (ECG) and analyzed by coarse graining spectral analysis of heart rate variability. The correlation between cumulative PNS activity and apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) was then discussed.
Results
Cumulative PNS activity and PNS peaks during sleep were lowly but significantly correlated with OSA severity (r = −0.344, p < 0.005; and r = −0.266, p < 0.05 respectively), and a linear regression equation could be established. Furthermore, significant correlation was also observed in the adult groups and in the moderate and severe groups, but not in the juvenile and the elderly and mild groups.
Conclusion
These findings indicated that PNS function was obviously influenced by OSA during sleep. Cumulative PNS activity level might also serve as a useful parameter for the evaluation of OSA.

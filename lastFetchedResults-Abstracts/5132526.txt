A novel type of machine, the Permanent Magnet Induction Machine, is currently in the process of development. The objective of this paper is to analyze the influence of different materials on the performance of the PMIM. At the same time it provides a meaningful comparison between this type of machine and the classical Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) with surface mounted PMs, which represents its major alternative in terms of high efficiency and high torque density. The comparison consists of the effects the magnet material (ferrite or rare earth magnets) has on both machines, as well as the influence of the rotor bar material (Aluminum or Copper) for the PMIM, considering an identical stator frame and winding configuration. This article will demonstrate that the PMIM can substantially improve machine torque density and efficiency in comparison to the PMSM.

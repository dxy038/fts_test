The main objective of this study is to develop a new design methodology that controls damage to
Reinforced Concrete Moment Resisting Frames (RCMRFs). For this purpose, first, a static damage criterion
is developed and, then, the new design procedure is presented. The proposed method is applied to
the design of two reinforced concrete frames subjected to seven earthquake acceleration records. To
confirm the accuracy of the proposed method, inelastic damage analysis is performed on the frames. It is
demonstrated that the proposed methodology can be very effective and practical for the design of RCMRFs
with damage control.

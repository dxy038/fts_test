In order to make the movement of mobile robot more smoothly, this paper designs a Auto-tuning PID module for mobile robot motion system. Based on the systematic mathematical model, this paper presents a least-square real-time parameter estimation algorithm with forgetting factor and incremental PID controller algorithm, and provides PID parameters optimization algorithm for the minimization of objective function. The digital signal controller Microchip dsPIC30F4011 is chosen as the core of master control system to accomplish the design of system software and hardware. The results of spot test in mobile robotÂ´s platform indicates that self-tuning PID control system can real-time estimate the controlled object parameter, real-time set adjust the controller parameters, then adapt to controlled object variance. So the auto-tuning PID control module is robust with good performance and anti-disturbance capability.

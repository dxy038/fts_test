The main objective of investigation was to study the effect of pulsating electrospray of high viscous and non-Newtonian sodium alginate on mono-dispersity of droplets. In the jet mode, employing the pulsating DC electric field at a critical frequency led to narrow size distribution of beads, produced from the droplets. Above the critical frequency, the size of beads was distributed over a wider range. The relationship between the dimensionless group representing diameter and the groups including: Weber, Reynolds, Electric Field and Frequency numbers was modeled according to genetic algorithm. The experimental results were found in good agreement with the model.

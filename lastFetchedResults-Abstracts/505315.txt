It would seem to be a reasonable objective that results produced by a given laboratory for each assay are consistent over time and that results produced by different laboratories from the same samples are comparable. It seems that using diagnostic kits with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and precision at international levels, is necessary to achieve the objective. The objective of this study was to compare the performance of the diagnostic kits from Elitech and Pars Azmoon companies. Glucose, cholesterol, creatinine and total protein concentrations at normal and pathological levels were measured. The results of the present study showed that there was a high significant difference (p < 0.001) between the studied kits at normal range but no significant difference was observed at pathologic range. Regarding cholesterol no significant difference (p > 0.05) was seen at normal concentrations between the kits but at pathological concentrations the difference was highly significant (p < 0.0001).
The kits had significant difference at all studied ranges (P < 0.001) and regarding total protein no significant difference was observed at the levels of True Lab P and normal range but the difference was significant at Level 3 range (p < 0.05). The results of the present study could help the laboratories to choose the diagnostic kits with high precision and accuracy at reasonable prices.

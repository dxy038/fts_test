Background & Objective: In addition to teaching pre-designed courses, physicians are usually expected to participate directly in designing curriculum during their professional life. Today, traditional education systems are not sufficient for developing the expected competencies in physicians. One of the applications of new advancements by cognitive sciences in curriculum design is the development of strategies for improving the quality of the undergraduate medical education curriculum. Educational strategies are “fundamental-oriented decisions in teaching which are aimed to achieve educational goals.”

  Methods: This was a narrative review that introduced and explained the most important educational strategies in undergraduate medical curriculum, through surveying valid electronic and library resources.

  Results: Now, the most important educational strategies in undergraduate medical curriculum are: a series of student-centered, problem-based learning, integrated or inter-professional teaching, community-based, elective-driven and systematic strategies (SPICES), and also a set of strategies that are product-focused, relevant, inter-professional, short courses, multisite locations and symbiotic (PRISMS); and a group of realistic, integrated, feedback, learning and evaluation strategies (RIFLE), as well.

  Conclusion: Each strategy is represented as a spectrum. In each spectrum, the educational planner must define the position of every component of the curriculum. In order to apply these strategies, the curriculum must be intervened according to the selected strategy; so that the results of the evaluations and evidence of interventions ensure the planners that the quality of the curriculum is improved.

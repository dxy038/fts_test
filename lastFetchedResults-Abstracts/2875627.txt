In this paper we describe a PhD research plan which focuses on the problem of insular thinking in distributed software development projects and its implications. The objective is to break up insular thinking in distributed agile software development through the targeted application of different media. The result of this work will be a model for distributed agile release planning. We intend to improve agile distributed release planning through the application of this model. Selected parts of the model will be evaluated through a software prototype which uses data of the Ice Breaker System project.

In the municipality of Tecpatan, Chiapas, in southeastern Mexico, it is highly feasible to convert traditional agrosilvopastoral systems of dairy production to the organic production model. The objective of this study was to characterize silvopastoral systems and evaluate the feasibility of converting traditional agrosilvopastoral systems to the organic model. We studied 75 cattle farms belonging to three Rural Production Societies (RPS; rural cooperatives): (i) RPS Grijalva (RPS-G: n = 35), (ii) RPS Pomarroza (RPS-P: n = 22), and (iii) RPS Malpaso (RPS-M: n = 18). For this, we used as a guide the multi-criteria methodology of the Organic Livestock Proximity Index (OLPI) proposed by Mena et al. (2011), adapting it to suit our purposes. In the current study, we designed a new OLPI with 35 variables which integrate 10 indicators. Information was obtained through direct observation and a questionnaire applied to producers. Statistical analysis of the results of 10 indicators used did not show significant differences among rural production societies. The same was true for the organic conversion index (p &gt; 0.05: RPS-G = 62.5%; RPS-M = 63.4%, and RPS-P = 64.6%). The data suggest that all cattle farms need to substantially improve veterinary care, safety of milking, quality of milk and dairy products, ecological management, and sustainable grassland management. In general, producers of the three rural production societies should be trained in a variety of organic cattle production and management techniques so that cattle farms may achieve a closer approximation to the organic model of production and thus may be certified.

The authors present the analysis and design of a nonlinearly controlled Cuk converter with magnetic coupling between inductors under conditions of order reduction that is suitable for large-signal applications. The bidirectional converter is described by a continuous bilinear model of state variable average values. The nonlinear control law linearizes the differential equation corresponding to the magnetizing current averaged value, guaranteeing the system stability around the operating point. The obtained results show the feasibility of a large-signal control of pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) complex converters

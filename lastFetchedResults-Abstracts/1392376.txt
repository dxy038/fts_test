We propose an optimal design for supplementing flexible structures with a set of absorbers and piezoelectric devices for vibration confinement and energy harvesting. We assume that the original structure is sensitive to vibrations and that the absorbers are the elements where the vibration energy is confined and then harvested by means of piezoelectric devices. The design of the additional mechanical and electrical components is formulated as a dynamic optimization problem in which the objective function is the total energy of the uncontrolled structure. The locations, masses, stiffnesses, and damping coefficients of these absorbers and capacitances, load resistances, and electromechanical coupling coefficients are optimized to minimize the total energy of the structure. We use the Galerkin procedure to discretize the equations of motion that describe the coupled dynamics of the flexible structure and the added absorbers and harvesting devices. We develop a numerical code that determines the unknown parameters of a pre-specified set of absorbers and harvesting components. We input a set of initial values for these parameters, and the code updates them while minimizing the total energy in the uncontrolled structure. To illustrate the proposed design, we consider a simply supported beam with harmonic external excitations. Here, we consider two possible configurations for each of the additional piezoelectric devices, either embedded between the structure and the absorbers or between the ground and absorbers. We present simulations of the harvested power and associated voltage for each pair of collocated absorber and piezoelectric device. The simulated responses of the beam show that its energy is confined and harvested simultaneously.

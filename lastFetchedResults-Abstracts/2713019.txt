Synchronous machines are the most widely used form of generators in electrical power systems. Identifying the parameters of these generators in a non-invasive way is very challenging because of the inherent non-linearity of power station performance. This study proposes a parameter identification method using a stochastic optimisation algorithm that is capable of identifying generator, exciter and turbine parameters using actual network data. An eighth order generator/turbine model is used in conjunction with the measured data to develop the objective function for optimisation. The effectiveness of the proposed method for the identification of turbo-generator parameters is demonstrated using data from a recorded network transient on a 178 MVA steam turbine generator connected to the UKÂ´s national grid.

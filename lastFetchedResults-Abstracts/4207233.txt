This paper describes a managed workflow concept that will be realized with the development of the common network planning software (CNPS). Managed workflow refers to a planning process that provides the orderly occurrence of definition, analysis, scheduling, and implementation of required super high frequency (SHF) satellite communications services. Thus the CNPS managed workflow capability integrates all of the activities associated with SHF communications satellite resource planning. This capability is necessitated by the requirement for a more efficient planning process for SHF satellite access request processing than is possible with current SHF planning tools and processes. It addresses two of the primary goals of the objective defense satellite communications system operations center operational requirements document: (1) reducing staffing requirements by 50% and (2) decreasing satellite access request processing by 75%

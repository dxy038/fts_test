Initiatives for library digitization in Kenya are scattered all over with the university libraries, showing greatest progression. Despite the Government supporting the implementation of ICT related changes in universities, the pace in digitization of libraries still remains slow and pervasive. One of the reasons for the slow pace is attributed to challenges faced in managing the implementation of digital library projects. The objective of this paper is to explore the extent to which digital library projects are being undertaken in universities and to investigate the challenges faced in management of digitization projects. The study concludes that many university libraries are embracing Information Communication Technologies and digitizing their collections, and that implementation of the digital library projects are faced with managerial and technical challenges. This paper concludes that the planning and motivation of the digital projects can be integrated into the strategic goals of the university. Long range planning and phased implementation of such library projects is needed in order to cope with: the enormity of the automation projects; the high costs involved; and. the need for capacity building of key staff to effectively manage these digitization projects.

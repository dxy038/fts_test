Objective: Our purpose was to examine the risk of fetal death associated with augmented fetal growth. Study Design: All live births recorded in Virginia between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1993, were examined. Mortality rates were examined for infants born at or beyond 24 weeksâ€™ gestational age with weights between the 75th and 90th percentiles, from the 90th to the 95th percentile, and >95th percentile. Results: Mortality rates were found to rise only slightly with birth weights >90th percentile. A recorded diagnosis of maternal diabetes, however, was associated with a significant risk in the presence of augmented fetal growth. Augmented fetal growth without maternal glucose intolerance showed no increase in mortality. Conclusion: Augmented fetal growth in the absence of maternal glucose intolerance appeared not to be associated with a significant increase in the risk of death among these births. Increased risk was found when augmented fetal growth was associated with maternal diabetes. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2000;183:316-23.)

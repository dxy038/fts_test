Background and Objective: Retinopathy of permaturity (ROP), a lesion in the retina of premature infants with low birth weights, can result in blindness and it is a major cause of blindness in children of developing countries. We were ought to determine prevalence and intensity of retinopathy of permaturity and investigate some related risk factors in NICU of Taleghani hospital.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, from march 2004 to December 2005, the result of clinical examinations and laboratory of 89 premature infants with gestational ages of less than 34week old were recorded in a questional form. These infants, were examined by a retinologist, at the time of discharge and if necessary every 4 weeks, until retinal vascularization completed. The results of examination were recorded.
Results: Retinopathy of permaturity was detected in 5 neonates; all of them in stage 1 and the most percent of prevalence in neonates with birthweights between 1001 to 1250 grams and gestational ages less than 29-week old. All cases were oxygenated and prevalence was more in the group who got oxygen via CPAP.
Conclusion: Based upon this study, the most important risk factors for retinopathy of permaturity were lower birthweight and less gestational age. Moreover, it was one more time emphasized on the effect of oxygenation in developing retinopathy of permaturity.

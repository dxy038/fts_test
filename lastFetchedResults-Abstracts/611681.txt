    Bacteria have developed multiple mechanisms in order to obtain iron from the host. Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida produces catechol type siderophore under iron-starvation conditions. In a previous study, the siderophore biosynthesis genes were identified. The objective of this study was the characterization of an outermembrane siderophore receptor named FstA. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the expression of this gene regulated by iron concentration. In order to characterize the nature of this gene, in frame deleted fstA gene mutant strain was constructed and the growth of mutant strain was compared with parental strain in iron-restricted conditions. In frame deleted fstA gene mutant strain was unable to grow under iron-limiting conditions in comparison with parental strain. fstA gene encoding siderophore receptor, expresses only in iron-limited conditions and this gene is necessary to iron transport mediated siderophore in this bacterial pathogens

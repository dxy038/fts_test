Recently, opportunistic routing (OR) has been widely used to compensate for the low packet delivery ratio of multi-hop wireless networks. Previous works either provide heuristic solutions without optimality analysis, or assume that unlimited retransmission is available for delivering a data packet. In this paper, we apply OR to a utility-based routing where the successful delivery of a data packet generates benefit. The objective is to maximize utility, defined as a function of benefit and cost of transmission. As the link reliability of each relay determines eventual packet delivery and hence utility, OR offers the ability to increase reliability through opportunistic relays. We explore the optimality of utility-based routing through OR without allowing retransmission, and observe that the optimal scheme requires exhaustive searching of all paths from source to destination. We then propose a heuristic solution to select relays and determine priorities among them. Finally, we provide distributed implementations for both schemes. Simulations on NS-2 and our customized simulator are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the heuristic compared with the optimal.

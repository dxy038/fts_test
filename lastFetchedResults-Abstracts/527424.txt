Introduction As the population grows older and more obese, hypertension eventually develops in more people during their life span. The prevalence of kidney stone disease is estimated at 1% to 15%, varying in degree according to age, gender, race, and geographic location. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of nephrolithiasis in hypertensive patients.
Materials Using simple non probability sampling, a total of 200 patients and who referred to Aria and Bahman 22nd Hospitals entered this
Methods study. The exclusion criteria were determined as: those subjects that had used carbonic anhydrase or thiazide; those who had a history of surgery on their urinary system; those who had been diagnosed with HTN before affected by nephrolithiasis. The main group was divided into 2 groups: Group 1 who had normal blood pressure (control group) and group 2, hypertensive patients (case group). All the patients were examined using both ultrasound and supine abdominal X ray (KUB) for stone scanning. Then, statistical analyses were conducted using t-test, chi-square test and Fisher's Exact Test. All the subjects signed a testimonial before the test,
Results The comparison of sex and age distribution between the case and the control groups showed no significant differences. Also, the results of Ultra sonograms showed echogenic density of the urinary system prevailing in 4.2% of the patients in the control group and in 25% of those in the hypertensive (case) group (P<0.05). Moreover, KUB revealed significantly lower frequency of stone density in kidneys in the control group (4.2%), as compared to the hypertensive group (21%). As a whole, nephrolithiasis was observed in 4% of the patients in the control group and 21% in those subjects in the hypertensive group. Such a difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P <0.001).
Conclusion We believe that urinary stone is significantly more frequent in hypertensive subjects than normal subjects.

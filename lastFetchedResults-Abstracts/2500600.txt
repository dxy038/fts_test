Introduction: Foot anthropometric dimensions could be useful in designing comfortable
footwear. The objective of this study was the measurement of foot anthropometric
dimensions in a group of students.
Methods: This was a descriptive study in which 21 dimensions of foot for 580 males and
females were measured manually. To measure the foot dimensions, a digital caliper and a
tape were used. The measured dimensions included the important lengths, widths, heights
and girths of foot. Descriptive statistics such as percentiles, mean and standard deviation
were calculated for the collected data. To test and survey of the mean of foot dimensions
between males and females, statistics such as independent t-test and effect size (Cohenâ€™s
d) were used.
Results: The values of mean, standard deviation, the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles were
calculate and tabulated for the total studied population and for gender. In all measured foot
dimensions, males had bigger dimensions than females. Gender had different impacts on
the measured foot dimensions. The mean of all foot dimensions was significantly different
between males and females (P value = 0.001). Digital pattering of I and II were observed in
%78 and %22 of the studied population, respectively.
Conclusions: In the present study, important anthropometric data of foot were collected
for a group of students. The presented percentiles could be used in design of male and
female shoes. Conducting similar studies in children with different age categories could
help completion of the anthropometric database.

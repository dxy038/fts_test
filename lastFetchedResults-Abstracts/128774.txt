Background and Objectives: A high intensity of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has been observed in the deep veins of lower limb. The objective of this study was to locate the site of deep vein involvement, its intensity, and the resulting complications in order to provide needed contribution for their management
Materials and Methods: This study was done on 206 patients referred for angiography in the Department of Radiology, Imam Khomeini Hospital with the preliminary diagnosis of deep vein involvement, particularly their occlusion. Phlebography was performed for the diagnosis. After surveying patient's history for cardiopulmonary diseases and preceding preparation, according to the age of the patient a needle of 20-23 gauge was introduced in one of the superficial veins of the dorsum of the foot. Tourniquet was applied above the ankle with the 30-mmHg pressure. Contrast material, up to 20 to 30 ml was injected from the leg and several radiographies were taken. Overall volume of the contrast medium corresponding to 80-IOOml was used to study the femoral and pelvic veins.
Results: The occlusion of the deep veins and their degree of the occlusion was revealed and formed varices were observed.
Conclusion*. DVT is mostly located in deep veins of leg and its sites, and less found in pelvic veins. It is observed that the highest intensity of DVT also occurs in deep veins of leg. The main resulting complications involve pain and disability of lower limb. This study elucidated the causative factors of this disorder and the necessary recommendations are presented for the patients in order to prevent the recurrence.

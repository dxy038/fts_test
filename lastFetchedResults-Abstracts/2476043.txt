In this paper we propose a framework for evaluating and selecting human machine interface (HMI) packages in integrating a process automation system. HMIs are among main subsystems of many integrated process automation systems. The main objective of this paper is to propose a selection process so that the integrated system could better satisfy strategic goals of the system users. In this paper we assume that strategic goals are expressed in terms of concepts like production flexibility, production reliability, product quality, operation cost, production time and the like.

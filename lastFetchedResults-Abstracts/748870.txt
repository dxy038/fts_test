In this research, the theory of probabilistic causation is investigated. The main idea of this theory is that the cause changes the probability of happening effect. The causation in this theory is introduced as an objective relation and it is based on inherent properties. The causal relation is attended in type level. Otherwise human cognition of natural phenomena is not definite and determined; the process of cognition is approximated to the truth. In another words, with the acceptance of fault of human cognition, man suggests a probable frame for explanation of his findings. Probabilistic causation uses the probability theory as a tool for explaining the relationship between cause and effect. Probabilistic causation is proposed in two levels: type level (General causal) and token levels (Singular causal). In this research, like Eellsâ€™s approach, probability causation relationship in type level and it is considered in General causal meaning. Causal relation is considered as typical factor or Property. There are two different interpretations: objective interpretation and subjective interpretation. What is explored in this research is objective interpretation in the frame of frequency-propensity interpretation. The main question in this research is consideration in the sense of probabilistic causation theory and pondering the capability and merits of this concept in against with ontological and epistemological challenges.

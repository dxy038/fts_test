Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex disease having both genetic and environmental components and candidate genes on obesity and insulin metabolism have been hypothesized to be involved in its etiology. Objective: We examined the possible association of adiponectin and insulin receptor gene polymorphisms with PCOS. Materials and Methods: A total of 186 women with PCOS using NIH criteria and 156 healthy women were recruited. Their samples were genotyped for the polymorphism in exon 17 and 8 of the insulin receptor gene or exon and intron 2 of the adiponectin gene. Results: The distributions of genotypes and alleles of both polymorphisms were not different in women with PCOS and controls. There was no significant differences on the anthropometric and hormonal profiles of various adiponectin and insulin receptor genes polymorphisms among both groups. Conclusion: Adiponectin and insulin receptor gene polymorphisms are not associated with PCOS in a sample of Iranian population.

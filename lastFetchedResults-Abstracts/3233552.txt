The correlation of MR diffusion weighted imaging with background body signal suppression (MR-DWIBS) features and different pathological types in lung carcinoma were studied. Forty-two cases with lung carcinoma and ten cases with pulmonary tuberculosis proved pathologically and examined with MR-DWIBS. The ADC values of lung cancer with the different pathological types were analyzed. The ADC of squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma and alveolar cell carcinoma were (1.82&#177;0.15) &#215;10-3mm2/s (1.17&#177;0.32) &#215;10-3mm2/s (2.24&#177;0.65) &#215;10-3mm2/s and (0.93&#177;0.08)&#215;10-3mm2/s, respectively. The ADC of pulmonary tuberculosis was (0.46&#177;0.36) &#215;10-3mm2/s. The ADC of small cell carcinoma was higher than other those of pathological types. There were highly differences of ADC between squamous carcinoma and other pathological types (P&lt;;0.05). And there were differences of ADC among small cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and alveolar cell carcinoma. No significance was found among adenocarcinoma and alveolar cell carcinoma. The ADC of pulmonary tuberculosis was significantly lower than all lung cancer pathological types. The ADC of lung carcinoma and pulmonary tuberculosis reflect the pathological type in some extent, and has important clinical value in diagnosis and treatment of lung carcinoma.

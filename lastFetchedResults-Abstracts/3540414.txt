A new robust transmission strategy for scalable image and video is proposed. To protect the coded bit-stream according to the channel conditions, the proposed scheme exploits the ´progressive by resolution´ structure of the scalable code-stream and takes into account the unequal importance as well as the effect of channel errors at different resolution levels towards reconstructing the source. A salient feature of the algorithm is its compatibility for multimedia applications requiring multi-resolution transmission to single or multiple clients. Results show that the proposed algorithm enables considerable gains in terms of subjective and objective image qualities over existing approaches

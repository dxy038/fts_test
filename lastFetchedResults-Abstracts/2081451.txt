Objective
m of this study was to investigate the effect of different luting agents on the bond strength of zirconium oxide posts in root canals after artificial ageing.
al and methods
 single-rooted extracted teeth were collected. Post spaces were prepared. Custom milled zirconium oxide posts (Cercon, Degudent) were fabricated. Specimens were divided into 3 groups (n = 10), according to the luting agents used: group RA, conventional resin luting agent (RelyX ARC); group RU, self-adhesive resin luting agent (RelyX Unicem); and group Z, zinc phosphate luting agent (DeTrey). Specimens were subjected to thermocycling and water storage at 37 °C. Specimens were horizontally sectioned into three sections and subjected to a push-out test with 0.5 mm/min crosshead speed. The failure mode was assessed by scanning electron microscopy. Data were analysed by using 2-way ANOVA.
s
llowing bond strength values were obtained: group RA – 8.89 MPa, group RU – 10.30 MPa and group Z – 9.31 MPa. There was no significant difference in bond strength among the groups (P = 0.500). Adhesive failure mode at the cement/post bonded interface was seen in 100%, 66.67% and 83.3% of examined sections in groups RA, RU and Z, respectively. There was no significant difference in bond strength among different root regions (P = 0.367).
sion
pe of luting agent had no significant effect on the push-out bond strength of zirconium oxide posts after artificial ageing.
al significance
tional luting agents, such as zinc phosphate cement, seem to provide comparable retention to resin luting agents for cementing custom milled zirconium oxide posts.

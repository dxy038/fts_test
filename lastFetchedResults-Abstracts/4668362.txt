The cost of system signaling is the most important indicators to evaluate the mobile satellite system location management strategy. The principle of location area design is to make the least signaling cost in location management. The objective of this research is to minimize the combined cost generated by the two wholly. On account of the characteristic of GEO (Geostationary Earth Orbit) mobile satellite system structure and satellite communication transmission, we adopt the steady-state location area design. Based on Gauss-Markov model, compare the cost of location management using different types of location area design. In this system, because of the majority of low-speed terminals and the minority of high-speed terminals, we confirm the scheme that a beam coverage area is a location area.

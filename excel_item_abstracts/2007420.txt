Broccoli is grown around the world at a wide range of photoperiods and temperatures, which may influence both sensory quality and phytochemical contents. Florets produced in phytotron and at two semi-field sites (70°N and 58°N) were examined for effects of contrasting temperatures and photoperiods on sensory quality and contents of glucosinolates, flavonols and vitamin C. Growth conditions associated with high northern latitudes of low temperature and long photoperiods, produced bigger floral buds, and florets with sweeter taste and less colour hue than more southern conditions. The contents of vitamin C did not vary, while the response of individual glucosinolates varied with temperature and day length, and contents of quercetin and kaempferol were lower in phytotron than under semi-field conditions. Thus, our results show that contrasting temperatures and photoperiods influence the sensory quality of broccoli florets, while contents of different bioactive phytochemicals are not influenced in a unidirectional pattern.

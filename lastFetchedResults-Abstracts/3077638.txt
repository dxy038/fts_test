In this paper, we present the first multi-objective microarchitectural floorplanning algorithm for designing high-performance, high-reliability processors in the early design phase. Our floorplanner takes a microarchitectural netlist and determines the placement of the functional modules while simultaneously optimizing for performance and thermal reliability. The traditional design objectives such as area and wirelength are also considered. Our multi-objective hybrid floorplanning approach combining linear programming and simulated annealing is shown to be fast and effective in obtaining high-quality solutions. We evaluate the trade-off of performance, temperature, area, and wirelength and provide comprehensive experimental results

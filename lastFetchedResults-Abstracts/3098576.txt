In UNLPpsilas network, like in most of the present networks, a great percentage of the traffic network demand is that of HTTP protocol. At the moment it is around 60%. To be more precise, we would have to claim that most of the traffic is transported by TCP port 80. Although port 80 TCP is used by default by protocol HTTP, any other application can use it, taking advantage of the fact that usually this port is not filtered and that it is even assigned a greater priority over the others. This work proposes a way to classify traffic at the top level of the application. The objective consists of applying effective techniques of QoS, that distinguish HTTP from other protocols as well as different uses which the users generally give,like being navigation, streaming and downloading.

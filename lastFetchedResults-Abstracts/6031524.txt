This paper presents our research work on the design and implementation of a new single-motor driven arm manipulator with multiple independent degrees of freedom. The result of this research work is an arm manipulator consisting of several modular units, each of which has two degrees of freedom: one for twisting rotation and one for pivoting rotation. And, all the degrees of freedom take mechanical energy from the output of a single motor mounted at the base. Compared to the previous prototype developed at the Nanyang Technological University, the work described here has solved the problem of realizing bidirectional motion output at each degree of freedom. In addition to the design work, we will also show some simulation results with the designed arm manipulator.

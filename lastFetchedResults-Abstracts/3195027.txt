LTE (3GPP Release8) and Mobile WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e) are discussed extensively as choices for the next generation of mobile broadband technologies. In this paper, LTE and Mobile WiMAX are analyzed comprehensively from a physical layer performance point of view for different antenna diversity modes in downlink and uplink transmissions. The objective of this study is to fill the current gaps in published literature for comparative in-depth analysis of the performance of LTE and Mobile WiMAX. Our study considers maximum channel bandwidth and the least control information overhead for both protocols. Performance comparison results for different scenarios of TDD (Time Division Duplex) operation in similar configurations suggest that LTE in general outperforms Mobile WiMAX. The throughput comparison of FDD (Frequency Division Duplex) and TDD operations is also presented in this paper to provide a complete discussion of physical layer maximum throughput in LTE.

The article concerns the parallelization methodology of a widely used semi implicit chemically reactive Euler equations solver. The reactive Euler equations are characterized by two tightly coupled physical phenomena: the convection and the chemical source term. To compute the convection term, upwind TVD (Total Variation Diminishing) scheme is chosen, and for calculation of chemical source term, a full complex chemical reaction mechanism is used. By considering the elapsed time for solving the problem by serial code, the numerical treatment of the convection and chemical source term takes about 90% of the total execution time. The main objective of the research is to reduce the relative cost of the the convection term calculation and chemical term computation and also to optimize the global cost of the numerical simulation by parallel implementation. The calculation speed of the parallel version of this code was more than 10 times faster by using 16 PEs for time accurate simulations of a RAM accelerator

This paper presents software designed to deal statistically with the common lightning and switching testing results. The objective of the &#8220;Testing Method and Statistical Analysis&#8221; software is to make possible the fast analysis of the results of an impulse testing sequence, usually considering an amount of impulses per series much larger than the common practice. This software was designed to allow the automatic generation of reports, which makes the analysis of the results easy. It has the option of printing a complete report, recording of each test sequence results, setting up a complete historical data of the experiment with all the possible and available information, allowing the modification of any data to any moment, avoiding errors. By computing the critical flashover voltage, standard deviation paths and also the likelihood surface form, some analyses regarding the test execution can be performed

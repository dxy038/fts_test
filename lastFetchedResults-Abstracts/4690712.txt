The randomness of photovoltaic (PV) and wind as renewable energy resources (RER) are best modeled as stochastic variable resources with given status and probability density function (pdf). The objectiveÂ´s multiple criteria consist of cost and reliability. These are interlinked by the impact of RER and networks consisting of voltages, flows and available generation resources. To account for the variability and randomness, heuristic technique is developed so as to handle the resources in the implication of the optimal power flow. This will account for the stochastic nature of the problem. The scheme proposed is a framework towards building or designing a stochastic optimal power flow for handling variability of the load randomness. Case studies are proposed under different power output of PV and wind contributions are tested for both the performance load flow and optimization.

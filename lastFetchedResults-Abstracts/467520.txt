Objective: This study was undertaken to compare the occurrence of placenta previa at delivery between singleton and multiple gestations. Study Design: A historical cohort study was performed of placenta previa cases at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center, Phoenix, Ariz, from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2000. Results: During the study, 29,268 deliveries (28,372 singleton and 896 multiple gestations) occurred at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center. Placenta previa complicated 51 (0.18%) singleton gestations and 4 (0.46%) multiple gestations (P = .09). Singleton and multiple gestations with placenta previa were similar with respect to maternal demographic variables, prior uterine surgery (excluding cesarean section), and gestational age at delivery. Multiple gestations with placenta previa were more likely to have had a prior cesarean section (P< .001). There were no differences between the singleton and multiple gestations with placenta previa and need for cesarean hysterectomy and blood transfusion. Conclusion: The occurrence and complications of placenta previa do not differ between singleton and multiple gestations. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;188:1226-7.)

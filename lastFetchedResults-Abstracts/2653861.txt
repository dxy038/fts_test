 Context Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is well-known to be transmitted by
                            the fecal-oral route. In addition, several studies in Europe and Asia
                            had reported potential HEV transmission associated with blood
                            transfusion, but this route is still uncertain. Objective The aim of
                            this study was to estimate the anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence among blood
                            donors around the world using the Bayesian-based methods. Evidence
                            Acquisition A systematic review was performed using the PubMed/Medline,
                            Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases using the terms
                            “prevalence”, “hepatitis E” and “blood donors”. Studies with a timeframe
                            from inception to March 2016, in Roman characters, that had outcomes of
                            interest such as prevalence of IgG antibodies were included. The
                            estimation of anti-HEV IgG (presented as the event rate and 95%
                            confidence intervals, CI) was performed using a Bayesian-based random
                            effect model using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, version 2.
                            Pairwise meta-analyses and chi-square tests were used to assess
                            significant differences between different sexes and ages. Results and
                            Conclusions Of the retrieved studies, 71 met the inclusion criteria,
                            comprising a total of 113 316 blood donors. The prevalence rate was
                            statistically significant in males and over 40 years old donors (P
                            &lt; 0.05). The overall estimation of the anti-HEV IgG prevalence
                            was 0.058 (CI 95%: 0.049 - 0.068). Subgrouping by region, the estimates
                            were higher for Asia and the Middle East, respectively: 0.113 (CI 95%:
                            0.040 - 0.278) and 0.112 (CI 95%: 0.081 - 0.152). Europe, Africa,
                            Oceania and America had an estimated prevalence between 0.014and 0.088.
                            A relevant prevalence of anti-HEV IgG among blood donors was found
                            worldwide, especially in Asia and the Middle East and in males and
                            donors over 40 years. This review reinforces the view that HEV
                            parenteral route infection needs to be further investigated and possibly
                            screened for in transfused blood.

Amount and distribution of iron and manganese and their concretionsreflect a lot of processes involved in soil genesis. Fe-Mnconcretionsshow different characteristics ofsoil matrix and occur in different environmental conditions and are important in both soil genesis,classification, and environmental aspects. The objective of the present study was to investigate abundance and distribution of Fe and Mn chemical forms andthe factors affecting them and to comparecharacteristics ofFe and Mnconcretionswith their adjacent soil matrix. To this end, seven profiles affected by redox conditions and five horizons were studied. Four forms of iron, including total iron (Fet), free iron oxides (Fed), amorphous (Feo) and DTPA extractable iron, and two forms of Mn, including total Mn (Mnt) and DTPA extractable Mn, were measured. Also, to studythe concretions and theirmineralogical properties,Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used. Results showed that organic matter and clay content werethe most important factors influencing different forms of Fe and Mn in the studied soils. Distinct contradictory conditions of micro-zones of the Fe and Mnconcretionswith their adjacent environment caused higher concentrations of Fed, Fet, Feo, MntandFeo/Fed ratio in Fe-Mnconcretionscompared to the adjacent soil matrix.

Any activity in a computer-supported cooperative working environment produces a set of traces. In a collaborative working context, such traces may be very voluminous and heterogeneous. They reflect all the interactive actions among the actors themselves and between the actors and the system. This paper examines what is required to study traces in the context of a collaborative working environment (CWE). The objective is to propose a definition of the different kinds of traces and to build a model for classifying and analyzing the interactions with respect to both individual needs and group needs. In a CWE the different types of traces can be divided into two categories: Collaborative Traces and Private Traces. As a basis of our model, the Collaborative Trace represents the shared personal experiences in a group and can be filtered to improve the collaborative and personal work. For practical applications, we validate our model using the E-MEMORAe2.0 platform.

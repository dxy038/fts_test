In this paper, the concept of optimal tolerance design for components of the actuator of vacuum circuit breaker is presented. the cost function related with nominal component parameters and its tolerances is chosen as the objective function, and the acceptable region of the tolerances is formed by some constraints. The optimum tolerances of the components of the actuator are given by solving the nonlinear programming problem, and the optimization results are discussed.

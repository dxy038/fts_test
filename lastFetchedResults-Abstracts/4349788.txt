The results of the first phase of a multi-year project undertaken by Canadian nuclear power plant designers and utilities to improve CANDU annunciation are described. The overall objective of the project is to develop, evaluate and recommend an architecture for CANDU annunciation that better meets the information needs of plant staff under all plant operating regions. The first phase of the project has established an initial definition of the functional role for CANDU annunciation. Subsequent project phases will define options for solutions to the problem of specific alarm functions of the present CANDU annunciation systems not fully meeting the needs of operations staff. The background of the project is discussed, the place of annunciation in relation to other plant operator support and plant information functions is described, the process by which the functional role was defined is indicated, and the direction of further work is outlined.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

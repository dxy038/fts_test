Objective
Considering the recurrence of febrile seizure and costs for families, many studies
have attempted to identify its risk factors. Some recent studies have reported that
anemia is more common in children with febrile convulsion, whereas others
have reported that iron deficiency raises the seizure threshold. This study was
done to compare iron-deficiency anemia in children with first FS with children
having febrile illness alone and with healthy children.
Materials & Methods
This case-control study evaluated 300 children in three groups (first FS, febrile
without convulsion, and healthy) in Khoramabad Madani Hospital from
September 2009 to September 2010. Body temperature on admission was
measured using the tympanic method. CBC diff, MCV, MCH, MCHC, serum
iron, plasma ferritin and TIBC tests were performed for all participants. Data
were analyzed by frequency, mean, standard deviation, ANOVA, and chi-square
statistical tests. Odds ratios were estimated by logistic regression at a confidence
level of 95%.
Results
Forty percent of the cases with FS had iron-deficiency anemia, compared to 26%
of children with febrile illness without seizure and 12% of healthy children. The
Odds ratio for iron-deficiency anemia in the patients with FS was 1.89 (95% CI,
1.04-5.17) compared to the febrile children without convulsion and 2.21 (95%
CI, 1.54-3.46) compared to the healthy group.
Conclusion
Children with FS are more likely to be iron-deficient than those with febrile
illness alone and healthy children. Thus, iron-deficiency anemia could be a risk
factor for FS.

This paper proposes a soft switching technique for dc/ac inverters, by using duty cycle and frequency modulation. Zero voltage switching (ZVS) is achieved through controlling the inductor current bidirectional in every switching cycle. This technique requires no additional resonant components and can be employed for various low power applications on conventional full-bridge and half-bridge inverter topologies. Three different current mode control schemes are derived from the basic theory of the proposed technique. They are referred to as boundary current mode (BCM), variable hysteresis current mode (VHCM), and constant hysteresis current mode (CHCM) in this paper and their advantages and disadvantages are compared. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the feasibilities of the proposed soft-switching technique and its control schemes.

Introduction and objective: Giardia duodenalis is a ubiquitous protozoan parasite in several animal species and humans. The objective of the present survey was to investigate the prevalence of G. duodenalis in the fecal samples of companion dogs in Ahvaz area, south-western Iran. 
Materials and methods: A total of 150 companion dogs of different ages were examined for antigenic detection of G. duodenalis in fecal samples by a commercial Giardia Antigen Test Kit. Fecal centrifugation-flotation technique was also used for identification of cyst by microscopic examination. The studied dogs were selected from those referring to Veterinary Hospital of Chamran University Ahvaz from June 2007 to January 2010. They were divided into two groups clinically (diarrheic and non-diarrheic) and based on age into three groups ( < 6 months, 6 months-3 years and  > 3 years). 
Results: Six out of 150 fecal samples (4%) were positive for antigen of G. duodenalis by immunochromatography assay. Prevalence was significantly higher in young dogs less than 6 months (11.6%) compared with adult dogs 6 months-3 years (1.6%) (P=0.041). The infection was more common in diarrheic dogs (18.5%) compared with non-diarrheic dogs (0.8%) and the difference was significant (P=0.001). Microscopic examination on fecal samples showed that 2.7% (4 out of 150) of the studied dogs were positive.
Conclusion: The infection rate of giardiasis in companion dogs' particularly in diarrheic dogs is considered to be critical from the viewpoint of public health. Our results indicate that this parasite is a zoonotic infection in Ahvaz district

With the increase of digital technology in video production, several types of complex video special effects editing have begun to appear in video clips. In this paper a novel algorithm is proposed for fade-in, fade-out, dissolve and wipe video special effects editing in compressed video without full frame decompression and motion estimation. DCT coefficients are estimated and use these coefficients together with the existing motion vectors for these special effects editing in compressed domain. Results show that both objective and subjective quality of the edited video in compressed domain closely follows the quality of the edited video in uncompressed video at the same bit rate

Background: The name “badrashbu” has been applied to some species of Dracocephalum (Labiatae) in Iran. Dracocephalum kotschyi is an indigenous herbaceous plant, used in folk medicine as a flavor in Iran. D. subcapitatum grows in both Iran and Turkmenistan. D. arguense is another species of Badrashbu found in Japan.
Objective: In this study we aimed to examine the phylogenetic relationship between some Dracocephalum species.
Method: Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis (RAPD), a molecular biological method, and analysis of volatile extracts (GC) were used.
Results: Genetic distances were calculated to construct phylogenetic dendrograms of closely related samples. Based on the results the genetic distance between two samples of D. kotschyi was fonud to be short and their RAPD banding patterns were quite similar, also there was a close relationship between two samples of D. arguense. Gas chromatography analysis supported the taxonomic classification. Iranian samples of D. subcapitatum and D. kotschyi contained of limonene- 10- al which could not be detected in Japanese samples of D. arguense.
Conclusion: D. subcapitatum show very close relationship to D. kotschyi rather than D. arguense in both phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic aspects.

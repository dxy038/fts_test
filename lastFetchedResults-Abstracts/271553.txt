Our objective is the construction of a phenomenological model of ferroelectricity for general electro!
mechanical loading histories\ which is simple enough to be implemented in an FE!code with realistic e}ort[
In this paper we motivate and verify the one!dimensional formulation of such a model[ It relies upon
introducing the remanent polarization and the remanent strain as internal variables besides stress\ strain\
electric _eld and polarization[ The internal variables are governed by ordinary di}erential equations[ Each
of these evolution equations is subjected to two loading conditions of di}erent nature[ The _rst one indicates
the onset of changes of the remanent quantities by domain switching\ while the second one characterizes the
saturation value of a remanent quantity corresponding to a totally switched domain structure[ Polarization
induced anisotropy is taken into account as far as it seemed necessary[ For simplicity\ no rate e}ects are
included[
The model response to uniaxial electro!mechanical loading histories will be discussed in comparison to
known experimental results[ By means of a bilinear approximation the following characteristic phenomena
of macroscopic ferroelectricity are represented ] dielectric hysteresis\ polarization induced piezoelectricity\
butter~y hysteresis\ ferroelastic hysteresis\ mechanical depolarization[   0887 Elsevier Science Ltd[ All

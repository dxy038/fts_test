This paper proposes a budget-based management infrastructure, BBQ, for All-IP networks to offer end-to-end QoS assurance to their services. In this scheme, the quality bound of each component network is controlled based on a calculated budget plan. End-to-end QoS is assured by a global QoS management agent. The management issues include software architectures in different layers, class based admission and resource reservation policies, as well as resource management infrastructure, policies, and mechanisms. The objective of this infrastructure is to facilitate network operators to tune their networks with a great flexibility and scalability to achieve their own operational objectives

Objective To study the potential differences in patient characteristics between two referral
methods to a fall clinic, specifically: case-finding of patients admitted to an emergency department because
of a fall, compared to direct referral to the fall clinic via the general practitioner. Design: Cross-sectional
study. Setting: Fall clinics in two university teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Participants: Three
hundred community-dwelling older people aged 65 years or over currently attending the fall clinics in
Nijmegen (Group 1, n=154) and in Amsterdam (Group 2, n=146). Measurements: Patients were referred by
a general practitioner (Group 1) or were selected using the Carefall Triage Instrument (CTI) after visiting
the emergency department (Group 2). In all patients, modifiable risk factors for recurrent falls were
assessed. Results: Group 1 had less modifiable risk factors for falling (a mean of 4 (SD 1.6) vs. a mean of 5
(SD 1.5) in Group 2, p<0.001). Compared to Group 2, Group 1 had more prevalent ‘recurrent falling (≥2
falls)’ (p=0.001) and ‘assisted living in homes for the aged’ (p=0.037). ‘Fear of falling’, 'mobility and
balance problems’, ‘home hazards’ and ‘osteoporosis’ were significantly less prevalent in Group 1.
Conclusion: This study suggests that patients referred to a multidisciplinary fall prevention clinic by their
general practitioner have a different risk profile than those selected by case finding using the CTI. These
differences have consequences for the reach of secondary care for fall-preventive interventions and will
probably influence the effectiveness and efficiency of a fall prevention program

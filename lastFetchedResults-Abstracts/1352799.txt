The previous work by our group showed experimental evidence that supports the idea that a diffusion barrier is formed around Gd2O3 agglomerates due to the formation of gadolinium-rich (U,Gd)O2 phases with low diffusivity. This would be the reason for the bad sintering behavior of the UO2â€“Gd2O3 fuel. The objective of this investigation was to confirm that hypothesis by direct experimental evidence. Analysis of the results showed that the diffusion barrier hypothesis is not applicable.

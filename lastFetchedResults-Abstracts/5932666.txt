Sorting algorithms and the sorting itself is an important concept in computational field. In this research study, we are proposing a unique sorting algorithm, based on assuming the first value as smallest and comparing it with the rest of the list and assuming the last value as biggest and comparing it with the rest of the list. Running cost analysis and its results obtained after implementation are provided in graphical form with an objective to compare the efficiency of the proposed technique with some existing well known techniques of sorting.

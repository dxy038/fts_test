This paper deals with monitoring condition of electrical failures in variable speed of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives by stator current signature analysis. The objective of this study is to develop a detection method for the open phase fault in PMSM drives. The main idea consists in minimizing the number of sensors allowing the open stator phase fault of the system to study. The harmonics produced by current spectral analysis fault-related components are studied. The current waveform patterns for various modes of open phase winding are investigated. Simulation and experimental results are presented using a 1.1 kW, 6 poles three-phase PMSM. Comparison of simulation and experimental results show that the method is able to detect the open-phase fault in PMSM drive.

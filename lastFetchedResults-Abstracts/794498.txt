The problem is to minimize a finite collection of objective functions over admissible sets depending on the so-called price vector. The minima in question and the price vector are linked together by a subdifferential governing law. The problem stated as a system of variational–hemivariational inequalities, defined on a nonconvex feasible set, is reduced to one variational–hemivariational inequality involving nonmonotone multivalued mapping. The existence of solutions is examined under the assumption that the constrained functions are positive homogeneous of degree one. The study has been inspired by economic issues and leads to new results concerning the existence of competitive equilibria.

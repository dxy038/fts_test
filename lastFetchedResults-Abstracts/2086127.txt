An instrumental realization of the idea for the electron emission spectromicroscope based on the newly developed imaging energy filter called α–SDA (Spherical Deflector Analyzer) is reported. Its compact design enables the realization of the flange-on spectromicroscope concept. It is equipped with two independent energy selective imaging channels: one for real and another for reciprocal space visualization. These images can be acquired quasi-simultaneousely by means of the software based on the switching on and off potentials of the energy filter. An electron gun located inside the immersion objective lens allows a new kind of sample illumination by high energy primary electrons and thus, opens a new application field for electron spectromicroscopy under laboratory conditions.

Objective: the current study was done to determine the effectiveness of an audiovisual training program on changing the ability of divided and selective attention and their reaction time on a group of drivers with a car crash. Method: In this quasi-experimental study, 64 drivers with more than one car crash with the fault were randomly divided into two experimental and control groups. All of drivers had more than 2 years of driving experiences. Then, concentrated and diffuse attentions were measured with selective and divided attention and stroop tests. The functions of attention in the experimental group following three weeks and five training sessions were re-strengthened. One and two weeks after training, both groups, were re-assessed. Data were analyzed using covariance and repeated measures. Results: Analysis of data showed that experimental group had Significant differences in the rate of correct responses congruent and incongruent stroop test (P ? 0.001) and the correct answer in the concentrated and dispersed (P ? 0.001) and also consistent in the amount of reaction time (P ? 0.001) and inconsistent (P ? 0.02) and focused attention of P ? 0.04) and dispersed (P ? 0.01) where compared with control regarding.Conclusion: according to findings it could be concluded the program, improved the ability of divided and selective attention and their reaction time. However, re-strengthened of attention is not a background reason for improving the driving ability and reducing risk of car crash.  This study need to be confirmed by long-term studies with follow-up

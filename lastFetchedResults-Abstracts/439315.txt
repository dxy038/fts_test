Lung volume reduction (LVR) produces significant clinical and objective improvement in selected patients with diffuse emphysema. Unilateral and bilateral approaches have been successfully employed. A median sternotomy approach is the standard for bilateral LVR, whereas video-assisted thoracoscopy has been used to perform unilateral LVR. Encouraging video-assisted thoracoscopic results with sequential, staged, bilateral LVR have been shown. This report describes an alternate technique of single-stage, bilateral LVR for end-stage emphysema.

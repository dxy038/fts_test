In this paper, the RF breakdown power threshold in arbitrary complex components based on rectangular waveguide technology is investigated. In particular, multipactor (in vacuum) and corona discharge (close to the Paschen curve minimum) are analyzed. The objective has been to predict the RF breakdown threshold for space applications. The simulation results have been validated with many experimental tests also performed within the frame of this work. The good agreement achieved shows the validity of the approach followed

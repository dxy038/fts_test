Location analysis decisions are interrelated and should be made within a single decision-making framework. A framework within which a number of location strategies can be placed is presented. Location-allocation models are improved in two ways: 1) the allocation rule is developed to more accurately reflect customer choice processes; and 2) the objective function is developed to incorporate future changes. Computational support for this framework is described.

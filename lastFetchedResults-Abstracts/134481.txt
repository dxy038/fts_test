One of the major concerns of critical philosophy of history is the extent to which historians can properly claim the status of objective truth for the conclusions they characteristically reach as the scholars of experimental sciences do, and whether they can recover the past as it actually was.
The main reason of the relativists for refuting the objectivity of the findings of the historians is proof through selection. The objectivists claim that the reason that the historians are selective in their research is not specifically a characteristic of historical research, rather a characteristic of all the studies.

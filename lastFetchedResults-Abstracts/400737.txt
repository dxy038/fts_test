Background
Since 1990, several nosocomial outbreaks of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis have occurred, none of which have involved Mycobacterium bovis. We describe an epidemic of nosocomial and primary MDR M bovis tuberculosis from December, 1993, to February, 1995, among HIV-1-infected patients in a district of Madrid.
Methods

We undertook genetic characterisation of the M bovis strain and investigated its presence in a tuberculosis epidemic in a Madrid hospital in a casecontrolled study. We assessed 19 cases diagnosed with MDR tuberculosis due to M bovis during the study period. For the control group, we randomly selected 33 patients with HIV-1 infection and isolation of a strain of M tuberculosis susceptible to isoniazid, rifampicin, or both, who were treated in Ramón y Cajal Hospital. Infectioncontrol policies and practices were implemented.
Findings

We detected 19 cases in HIV-1-infected patients of primary MDR tuberculosis produced by M bovis resitant to 11 antituberculosis drugs. We found phenotypic and genotypic similarities in the strains of M bovis. In the case group, the index case and two other cases had had previous contact with another hospital that had had an MDR tuberculosis outbreak. All patients died after a mean of 44 days (range 2–116), despite multidrug treatment with first-line and second-line antituberculosis drugs. The cases with M bovis MDR tuberculosis were significantly more likely than controls to have been admitted to a hospital ward at the same time as patients already infected with MDR tuberculosis during the 10 months before their diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio 94·6 [95% CI 9·4–956·3], p<0·0001). Advanced HIV-1 immunosuppression was associated with the development of MDR tuberculosis. Implementation of control measures stopped the epidemic.
Interpretation

An M bovis primary MDR tuberculosis epidemic that cannot be treated effectively and with high mortality has emerged in Europe and has been transmitted between hospitals.

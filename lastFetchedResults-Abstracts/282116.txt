Research has shown that the Jesness Inventory is an objective personality instrument capable of distinguishing delinquents from non-delinquents. However, only limited studies have used the Jesness to study female offenders. Results of the present study suggest that the Jesness Inventory differentiates between violent and nonviolent female adolescent offenders, but scales which differentiate between the groups are not in the predicted direction. This suggests that nonviolent females are actually more delinquent in orientation than violent females. Based on socialization theory, the authors speculate that nonviolent offenders may be provoked by emotionally charged conflict rather than by a delinquent orientation. Nonviolent offenders, on the other hand, may have greater levels of depressive symptomatology which serves to inhibit the expression of violence and assaultive behaviors. In light of the unexpected results, directions for future research are discussed.

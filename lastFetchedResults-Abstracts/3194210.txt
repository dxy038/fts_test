In this paper the analysis of bidirectional switch based on two MOSFETs operating as switching element in zero-current switching half wave quasi-resonant buck converter is carried out. The influence of MOSFETs output parasitic capacitance together with resonant tank inductor on conduction power loss in switching element is found due to the proposed analytical model. The condition to provide minimal conduction losses in switching MOSFET is obtained. All theoretical results are proved experimentally.

Image fusion refers to the techniques that integrate complementary information from multiple image sensor data such that the new images are more suitable for the purpose of human visual perception and the compute processing tasks. In this paper, a new image fusion algorithm based on wavelet packet transform to fuse multisensor images is presented. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) can offer a more precise way for image analysis, than other multi-resolution analysis. It decomposes an image into low frequency band and high frequency band in different level, and it can also be reconstructed gradually in different level. But this method only decomposes low frequency band in a higher scale, so that it omits some useful details of the images. In this paper, we present a new image fusion algorithm. In the algorithm, we use discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) to decompose and reconstruct the images. When images are merged in wavelet packet space, different frequency ranges are processed differently. It can merge information from original images adequately and improve abilities of information analysis and feature extraction. This image fusion is performed at the pixel level. In this fusion algorithm, a feature-based fusion rule is used to combine original subimages and to form a pyramid for the fused image. Through merging remote sensing images from multi-sensor to a same object by applying method of wavelet packet analysis, we have obtained a fused picture. In this paper, mutual information is employed as a means of objective assessing image fusion performance. The experiment results show that this fusion algorithm, based on wavelet packet transform, is an effective approach in image fusion area.

Intensive usage of farm inputs has resulted in environment pressure. The pressure is mainly due to the widely use of chemical inputs and the overdraft of groundwater resources. So, there is a conflict between environmental objectives in the form of lowering resources use and farmers' objectives in form of maximizing production by using more inputs. In this study, environmental and farmers' objectives are considered by using multi objective programming. Environmental objectives include the reduction of water, chemical fertilizer, and pistons consumption and farmer' objectives consist of increasing gross return and decreasing risk. The data required to this study are collected from Marvdashst agricultural crops farmers in Fars province.
Based on the results, there are trade offs among objectives and a desired combination of objectives. The findings show that the crops of cucumber, canola and barley are consistent with both environmental policy makers and farmers' considerations. Onion and wheat crops are important from the farmers' point of view rather than environmental policy makers. Rice, maize and hay maize crops have no priority to cultivate.

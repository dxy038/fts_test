This paper presents hybrid cultural algorithm to solve multiobjective real and reactive power optimization problem. The main aim of this paper to minimize the real power loss, while, the cost of real power is also taken as an objective to make the model of P-Q multiobjective optimization problem on optimal power flow. Here sequential operation of real power optimization and reactive power optimization is done to reduce the cost of production followed by real power loss. By P-optimization problem generation cost is first minimized. Then by optimized generator real power outputs, bus voltages, tap settings of transformer and shunt compensation devices, the combined objective function is satisfied subject to some equality and inequality constraints by Q-optimization. IEEE 30 bus system is applied here to prove the efficacy of the proposed method. A comparative study shows that this proposed algorithm yields an optimum result.

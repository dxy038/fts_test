This paper sets out the key underpinnings of the KSB mapping and UI-REF Framework approaches that are integrated within the ELLIOT project to support the evaluation of the co-evolution experiences, outcomes, and, the potential impact of the IoT innovations. It is concluded that more objective assessments of the likely experiential effects, side-effects, and the concomitant co-creativity and societal (dis) benefits resulting from the co-creation and adoption of IoT systems requires living lab based point-of-experience, and, post-experience analysis of the user-perceived and societal effects and their consequential affects, as well as the tracking of the emergent changes in co-creativity, co-generative knowledge and the social psychology of ICT-mediated patterns of user-society-system usability relationships as deployed in UI-REF and within the ELLIOT project.

In this plethora of increased competitiveness and globalization the effective management of the warehouse system is a challenging task. Realizing that proper scheduling of the warehouses is necessary to outperform the competitors on cost, lead time, and customer service basis (Koster, 1998); the proposed research focuses on optimization of warehouse scheduling problems. This research aims to minimize the total tardiness so that the overall time involved in managing the inventory inside the warehouse could be effectively reduced. This research also deals with the vehicle routing issues in the warehousing scenario and considers various constraints, and decision variables, directly influencing the undertaken objective so as to make the model more realistic to the real world environment. The authors have also proposed a hybrid tabu sample-sort simulated annealing (TSSA) algorithm to reduce the tardiness as well as to enhance the performance of the warehousing system. The proposed TSSA algorithm inherits the merits of the tabu search and sample-sort annealing algorithm. The comparative analysis of the results of the TSSA algorithm with other algorithms such as simulated annealing (SA), tabu search (TS), and hybrid tabu search algorithms indicates its superiority over others, both in terms of computational time as well as total tardiness reduction.

The relay positioning problem is addressed for low signal-to-noise ratio Gaussian multicast relay networks where the objective is to maximize the multicast flow. A network coding based decode-and-forward (DF) strategy is presented that achieves strictly larger rates than a previously-studied routing based DF strategy. Properties of the multicast flow function are analyzed and efficient solutions are presented.

The objective of this paper is to report measured results of electric fields investigated inside the automobile. This investigation is important to the electronic design engineer before he starts the design of the different electronic systems needed to operate the automobile. By knowing the electromagnetic environment inside the automobile, the electronic engineer is given the opportunity to estimate and predict the various effects of electromagnetic disturbances on the automotive electronic systems. In our experiments, the work performed to study the electromagnetic environmental conditions was carried out on a typical midsize automobile with a high-power frequency-modulation (FM) transmitter installed inside the vehicle. Different antenna locations were used to radiate the electromagnetic waves that were studied. Data obtained from the experimental results are presented and discussed.

This paper presents an enhancement of a carrier based modulation technique designed for generating the switching signals of the three-level neutral-point-clamped quasi-Z source inverter. The main objective of the paper is to design and test by simulation the variation that should be done in the basic carrier based modulation technique in order to balance the voltage between the two capacitors connected by the neutral point of the DC bus.

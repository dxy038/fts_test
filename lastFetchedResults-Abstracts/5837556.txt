Because of the oil chamber of the traditional hydrostatic guideway only has one oil outlet, which is easy to concentrate the pressure of the oil chamber at the outlet, leading to non-uniform pressure distribution. Hence, the objective of this study is to design a uniform pressure distribution of hydrostatic guideway. In the design process, the configuration results of the guideway obtained by the analysis of pressure distribution for single chamber and chamber combination. The optimum parameters of each chamber have been determined by using HTGA/Gray approach. This approach will be more robust, stability, and quickly convergent than Taguchi and GA approaches. Furthermore, this study discusses dynamic behavior of the designed guideway and the referenced guideway under external load. Finally, the optimization results clearly indicate that the optimized guideway has better performance than the referenced guideway. And the experimental results are used to verify the feasibility and the practicality of this study.

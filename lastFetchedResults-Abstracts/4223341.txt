This paper introduces a fuzzy logic approach to classifying the physical activity levels of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. Obesity is one of the risk factors of OSA, and the strong link between physical activity levels and obesity suggests that a method of assessing the physical activity levels of OSA patients is critical. We studied various objective and subjective instruments, and decided to base our fuzzy logic model on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The IPAQ model uses the duration, frequency, and intensity of various activities as inputs to classify the physical activity level of an individual. Our model will be used in a clinical setting at the Respiratory Clinic at Thompson Rivers University (TRU) to assess the physical activity level of new patients as well as patients undergoing continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment.

An interactive color graphical simulation and analysis package for a power plant´s electrical auxiliary system is presented. This package is modeling Wisconsin Electric Power Company´s Oak Creek Power Plant electrical auxiliary system. The software is written in C and is designed for PC use. The objective of this package is twofold: to help engineers to do ´non-real-time´ and ´what if´ types of analyses in a portable and highly user-friendly environment, and to minimize the growth of the company´s mainframe computer and decrease computer turn around time for the auxiliary system studies. A description of the package, a detailed demonstration of user interface capabilities, and hardware requirements are provided.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

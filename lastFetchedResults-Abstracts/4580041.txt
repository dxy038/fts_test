Summary form only given. Since mid-IR (3-5 /spl mu/m) lasers tend to be bulky, inefficient, and complex at present, compact, reliable semiconductor sources will find wide use once their levels of performance become adequate. However, our modeling projects that this objective should be achievable using novel type-II quantum well lasers (T2QWLs) and type-II interband cascade lasers (T2ICLs). Here we report simulation results, along with promising preliminary experimental data.

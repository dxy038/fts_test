Objective
estigate the effects of two different fluoride concentrations on the expression of enamel proteins, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), cytokines and interleukins by an ameloblast-derived cell line.
s
 ameloblast-derived cells (LS-8), mouse odontogenic epithelia, were exposed to 1 or 5 ppm sodium fluoride (NaF) (0.46 and 2.25 ppm F, respectively) for 1, 3 and 7 days. The effect of NaF on the mRNA expression of enamel proteins was quantified; the secretion of cytokines, and interleukins, and the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, into the cell culture medium was measured and compared to untreated controls. The effect on cell growth after 1- and 3-days in culture was measured using BrdU incorporation.
s
de at 2.25 ppm reduced mRNA expression of the structural enamel matrix proteins amelogenin (amel), ameloblastin (ambn), enamelin (enam), and the enamel protease matrix metallopeptidase-20 (MMP-20). Similarly several vascularisation factors (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), monocyte chemoattractant proteins (MCP-1) and interferon inducible protein 10 (IP-10), was also reduced by 2.25 ppm fluoride. ALP activity and proliferation were stimulated by 0.46 ppm fluoride but inhibited by 2.25 ppm fluoride.
sions
results indicate that fluoride may impact on the expression of structural enamel proteins and the protease responsible for processing these proteins during the secretory stage of amelogenesis and go some way to explaining the mineralization defect that characterises fluorotic enamel.

This paper discusses the work done to develop a group-interaction methodology that uses the systems approach to identify the critical variables required for coastal profiling. The work was done as a part of the larger Integrated Coastal and Marine Area Management (ICMAM) project of the Government of India. The broad objective of the project was to formulate a framework for developing integrated coastal-zone management (ICZM) plans for the sensitive coastal zones in India. Identifying the critical variables in each of these zones and developing the coastal profile was the initial step towards formulating the framework.

y little documentation was available on the key factors affecting the areas, this information had to be elicited and prioritized based on group/stakeholder interaction. Available methodologies and tools for carrying out the tasks were reviewed. It was found that the sequence of identification of the coastal profile variables did not complement the intuitive approach of the group. The group adapted the existing methods with additional terminology and methodological steps to meet their requirements. This paper discusses the terminology and methodology of the approach developed by the group and presents a software tool developed to assist the team in applying the methodology.

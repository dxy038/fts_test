Objective: Test the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the
Perception of Psychiatry Survey questionnaire , which is being used in a
large multi-site international study, of which we were part. This instrument
was designed to measure the attitudes of medical educators to
psychiatry.
Methods: We used World Health Organization guideline as the
methodological model for Persian translation. The Persian version of
Perception of Psychiatry Survey questionnaire was administered to a
convenience sample of 100 medical teachers at Tehran University of
Medical Sciences and Azad University. The content validity, internal
consistency, and test-retest reliability of the instrument were assessed.
Results: No item changed completely during the process of translation
and cultural adaptation. The content validity of translation and back
translation was 0.74 and 0.86 according to Feliss Kappa Statistic. The
Cronbachâ€™s ? coefficient was 0.76 for the Persian version and for its
subdivisions ranged from 0.59 to 0.81. The inter class correlation (ICC)
coefficient for test-retest reliability of the whole instrument was 0.89.
Conclusion: The Persian version of Perception of Psychiatry Survey
questionnaire could be considered as a good cross-cultural equivalent for
original English version. The instrument is a reliable instrument in terms of
internal consistency and test-retest reliability.

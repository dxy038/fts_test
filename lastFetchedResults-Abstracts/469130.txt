Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of Burch colposuspension for stress urinary incontinence on concomitant coital incontinence.
Study design
The urogynecology database was searched for sexually active women, who experienced coital incontinence on vaginal penetration, orgasm, or both and who had subsequently undergone Burch colposuspension for urodynamic stress incontinence. The women were interviewed or sent a questionnaire on postoperative bladder and sexual function after a minimum follow-up time of 6 months.
Results
Thirty of 43 women answered the questionnaire. Preoperatively, 22 women (73%) experienced urinary leakage during penetration, 3 (10%) during orgasm and 5 (17%) at both. Stress incontinence symptoms were successfully treated in 23 (77%). Coital incontinence was cured in 21 of 30 (70%) and improved in 2.
Conclusion
The results of this small series suggest that coital incontinence is likely to be cured or improved when stress incontinence has been successfully treated by Burch colposuspension

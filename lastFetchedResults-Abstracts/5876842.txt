A new two steps commutation strategy for matrix converters is proposed. Based on the measurement of the commutation voltage, switching patterns are presented which guarantee a safe control of bidirectional switches where separated internal conduction paths for the two current directions exist. No additional components are required. The commutation strategy was verified by simulation and experimental results

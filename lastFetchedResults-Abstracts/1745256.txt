Background and Objective: Ulcerative colitis is a group of chronic inflammatory disorders of unknown etiology that affects the digestive system. Aloe vera is used in many situations such as wound healing. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of aqueous extract of this plant on the gastric acid secretion and colonic histopathology in acute ulcerative colitis model induced by acetic acid in rats.
Materials and Methods: This experimental study was performed on 32 Wistar rats weighing 200-250g. Animals were randomly divided into four groups including intact, acetic acid-induced colitis group, the groups treated with Aloe Vera (8 days) and treated with sulfasalazine. The animals were anesthetized with ether, and then colitis was induced with acetic acid. After treatment, biopsies of 10 cm distal parts of the colon were removed for histopathological studies. To compare the histopathologic quantitative features, the grading system (Bita 2012) was used. The gastric acid concentration was measured by titration method. The results were expressed as MeanÂ±SEM and P < 0.05 was regarded as significant. 
Results: Treatment with aqueous extract of Aloe Vera did not reduce the gastric acid. Histopathological results indicated an inflammatory response in the ulcerative colitis group. Aloe Vera reduced the severity of symptoms of ulcerative colitis histopathology, although its efficiency was less than sulfasalazine.
Conclusion: Regarding the improving effect of Aloe vera, it seems to be useful for the treatment of colonic disorders. However, for determination of the effective dose of this plant in decreasing gastric acid secretions, further research is recommended.

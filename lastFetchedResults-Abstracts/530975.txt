Background: Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) is a Zinc metalloproteinase,converts Ang-I to Ang- II, a pro-inflammatory agent which may contribute to pathophysiology of some diseases like type 2 diabetes. Objective: To investigate the relationship between ACE I/D polymorphism and type 2 diabetes in 261 Iranian casecontrol pairs. Methods: 170 patients (85 type 2 diabetics with nephropathy and 85 type 2 diabetics without nephropathy) and 91 healthy control subjects were enrolled in our study. I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) utilizing specific primers. Results: The frequency of DD genotype in the DN group was higher than that of the type 2 diabetic patients (30.6% vs. 20%, P=0.157) and the control group (30.6% vs. 14.3%, P=0.006). The frequency of D allele in nephropathic patients was 58.2% as compared to type 2 diabetic patients without nephropathy 50.5% (P=0.19) and control subjects 37.3% (P =0.001). Therefore, the frequency of DD genotype and D allele significantly increased in DN patients in comparison to healthy controls. Conclusion: It is concluded that the DD genotype and/or D allele of ACE gene may increase the risk for type 2 diabetes but not diabetic nephropathy

A vertical bipolar bidirectional switch (BipAC) is proposed for specific AC mains applications 230 V - 50 Hz. The BipAC exhibits an ON-state voltage drop lower than 1 V and allows an ON-state and OFF-state control with respect to a single electrode which is at the reference potential. It can be realized either on an N substrate (type PNP) or on a P substrate (type NPN). Its low voltage drop and its ON/OFF control with respect to a single reference electrode make it interesting for applications with low load current (&lt;; 1 A rms). This study is based on 2D physical simulations carried-out using Sentaurus&#8482; software.

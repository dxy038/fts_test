Background: The Main reason for using productivity and efficiency analysis in all areas of management, in particular hospitals, is the resources constraint.
Objective: The aim of this study was to measure the productivity in general hospitals of Ardebil province. 
Methods: This was a descriptive analytical retrospective study, carried out in 10 general hospitals within the Province of Ardebil in 2008. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique and the Malmquist Total Factor Productivity Index were employed to measure the productivity and variables such as the number of GPs, number of active beds, number of admissions, and the days of hospitalizations were taken into account. Collection of data within the last 7 years was accomplished using the Standard Forms designed by the Ministry of Health and Medical Educationâ€™s Statistical Department. Data analysis was performed using the Deap2 software. 
Findings: Based on our data, the Total Factor Productivity mean was 1.033 indicating a decrease of 3.3% in productivity within this period. The technical efficiency change and also the technological change as component of productivity were 1.044 and 1.029, respectively. The trend of productivity over the study period failed to follow any particular trend. In the first three years, the productivity was reduced while within the next two years it was increased. Nevertheless, the productivity again faced a decrease within the next year. 
Conclusion: The total factors productivity during the study period showed a decreased productivity. The productivity losses were largely due to technological changes. Numerous studies carried out in other countries, particularly in low income countries, produced similar results in which the major cause of lower productivity was attributed to technological changes.

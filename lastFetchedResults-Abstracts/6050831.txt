The authors consider the use of a nonstandard interpretation to analyze parametrized circuit descriptions, in particular for array based architectures. Various metrics are employed to characterize the performance tradeoffs for generic designs. The objective is to facilitate the comparison of feasible design alternatives at an early stage of development. The research centers on techniques for extracting various performance attributes, such as critical path and latency, from a single generic design representation. The features of this approach include-uniformity, modularity, reusability, flexibility, and computerized support

The creation of efficient and secure framework is becoming important with the rapid development of internet and World Wide Web (WWW). The objective of this paper is to examine the web based framework to retain the information of any organization. Thus, we propose a new scaffold on the basis of JSP Access Model and Model-View-Controller (MVC), which will assist in providing information regarding users and some indispensable services to several organizations. This framework also provides better security then other frameworks. In turn it supports faster retrieval and processing of data. For the implementation of this framework different approaches of software engineering are being used. In this paper work we discuss this framework with Java programming language, because Java is more popular and secure programming language for web application.

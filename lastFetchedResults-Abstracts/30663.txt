The objective of this paper is to show that time reversal invariance can be exploited in acoustics to create a variety of useful instruments as well as elegant experiments in pure physics. Section I is devoted to the description of time reversal cavities and mirrors together with a comparison between time reversal and phase conjugation. To illustrate these concepts, several experiments conducted in multiply scattering media, waveguides and chaotic cavities are presented in section 2. Applications of time reversal mirrors (TRMs) in hydrodynamics are then presented in section 3. Section 4 is devoted to the application of TRMs in pulse echo detection. A complete theory of the iterative time reversal mode is presented. It will be explained how this technique allows for focusing on different targets in a multi-target medium. Another application of pulse echo TRMs is presented in this section: how to achieve resonance in an elastic target? Section 5 explores the medical applications of TRMs in ultrasonic imaging, lithotripsy and hyperthermia and section 6 shows the promising applications of TRMs in nondestructive testing of solid samples.

Background and Objective: Air pollution is one of the current concerns. Human health has been faced with serious risks due to air pollution as a consequence of urbanization. Continuous monitoring of air quality to determine pollutants and identify their emissions sources are considered as the key strategies for air pollution control. The main objective of this study was evaluation of Mashhad air quality and determination of responsible pollutants in 2015.

Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the instantaneous concentrations of air pollutants including O3, CO, SO2, NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 were measured at the three stations of Mashhad during 2015-2016. Based on Air Quality Index (AQI), Mashhad air quality was classified in groups of good, moderate, unhealthy for the sensitive people, unhealthy, very unhealthy and dangerous.
Results: The results of the air quality index indicated that the air quality in 46 days was exceeded the standard limit in Mashhad in 2015-2016. The air quality category included 12.5% days unhealthy for sensitive groups, 74.5% days health.
Conclusion: In this study, PM2.5 was determined as the main responsible pollutant in non-standard conditions of Mashhad air. Optimizing public transportation, considering environmental standards at the urban transportation management and Launch intelligent traffic control are the most appropriate strategies proposed to control Mashhad air pollution.

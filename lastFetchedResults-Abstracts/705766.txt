American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) has a wide geographical distribution, including all the states of Brazil. Parasitological and immunological tests are the most commonly used methods for the laboratorial diagnosis of ACL. The objective of this study was to find a specific and sensitive antigen to the diagnosis of ACL. To this end, promastigotes of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis were submitted to gel-filtration chromatography (Sephadex G100) and to ionic-change chromatography (DEAE-Sepharose Fast-Flow), and the antigen reactivity was evaluated by enzyme immunoassay (EIA-IgG). The results showed that the peak II of fraction 8 distinguished ACL patient sera from those of healthy individuals and individuals with other diseases (P < 0.0001), presenting 85.41% sensitivity and 91.22% specificity. False-positive results were found for sera from Chagas disease patients (16.67%) and healthy individuals (10.42%). False-positive results were not detected for sera from patients with toxoplasmosis or paracoccidioidomycosis. The fraction obtained shows good sensitivity and specificity for ACL diagnosis and opens up new possibilities for the use of serology in laboratorial diagnosis, seroepidemiological studies and in the follow up of ACL treatment.

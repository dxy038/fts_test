This paper investigates the combined optimization of bi-material structural layout and actuation voltage distribution of structures with embedded in-plane piezoelectric actuators. The maximization of the nodal displacement at a selected output port is considered as the design objective. A two-phase material model with power-law penalization is employed in the topology optimization of the actuator elements and the coupled surrounding structure. In order to incorporate the actuation voltage directly into the design for achieving the best overall actuation performance, element-wise voltage design variables are also included in the optimization. For the purpose of easy implementation of the electric system, the allowable voltage levels at an individual element are confined to three discrete values, namely zero and two prescribed values with opposite signs. To this end, a special interpolation scheme between the tri-level voltage values and the design variables is used in the optimization model. Based on the design sensitivity analysis of the objective function, the combined optimization problem is solved with the MMA algorithm. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed optimization model and numerical techniques. The optimal solutions also confirmed that larger output displacement can be achieved by introducing voltage design variables into the design problem.

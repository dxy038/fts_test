Multicast is a well-known protocol that has been tested to be a highly effective method to deliver real time applications over the network. In this paper, two Virtual Private Network (VPN) based technologies are considered in delivering real-time based applications namely Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The performance comparison of video multicast of the two technologies is described. Both platforms were modeled and simulations executed with multicast protocol enabled. For real time traffic, selected parameters were carefully defined and configured such as delay, throughput and packet loss. The objective of this study is to compare performance of MPLS and ATM based on these selected parameters, particularly in the case of delivering video traffic in the presence of congestion. The study showed that with VPN enabled on both technologies, MPLS had performed better than ATM in terms of throughput and packet drop.

We present a design methodology for the globally optimal synthesis of multiple loop feedback operational transconductance amplifier-capacitor (OTA-C) filters. Transmission zero realization via input distribution of OTA network is adopted. A generic topology of OTA-C filter is optimized using a two-stage mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), with circuit complexity and circuit sensitivity as the objective functions. A numerical example shows the efficacy of the proposed approach.

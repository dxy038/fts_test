With the advance of Web services and applications, quality of service (QoS) has becoming a key issue in Web service selection. Current discovery model and standards such as UDDI, WSDL do not give much support to QoS description and evaluation. Meanwhile, many researches only focus on QoS model and computation, without taking user individual preference into consideration. How to dynamically evaluate candidate Web services based on user preference is an important problem to be solved. This paper proposes a QoS and user preference based evaluation model called Q-WSEM(QoS-based Web service evaluation model) that extends the existing model by adding Web service evaluation center, and establishes a three-layer framework to achieve Web service evaluation based on QoS and user preference. In the third layer, information entropy method of multiple-attribute decision making theory is adopted to facilitate QoS assessment, and preference model is also introduced to provide interface for user to modify preference-based objective weight. Moreover, we have developed and implemented a Q-WSEM prototype, and measured the validity under different preferences. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.

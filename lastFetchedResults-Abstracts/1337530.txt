The objective of this case study was to investigate whether semen centrifugation and low-dose insemination techniques would improve fertility of an aged subfertile Quarter Horse stallion with low sperm concentration, motility, and morphology in ejaculates. Forty-five mares were bred by one of five treatments (n = 9 per group) using the entire ejaculate as follows: (1) Group Body: body insemination with ejaculate diluted 1:1 in TAMU extender; (2) Group Body-Cent: body insemination after centrifugation and re-suspension of sperm pellet to 1 mL in TAMU extender; (3) Group Horn-Cent: deep horn insemination after centrifugation and re-suspension of sperm pellet to 1 mL in TAMU extender; (4) Group Cent-Hys: hysteroscopic insemination onto the uterotubal papilla after centrifugation and re-suspension of sperm pellet to 200 μL in Kenney-Modified Tyrode’s extender; and (5) Group Dens-Hys: hysteroscopic insemination onto the uterotubal papilla after discontinuous density gradient centrifugation and re-suspension of the sperm pellet in 200-μL Kenney-Modified Tyrode’s extender. Pregnancy rates did not differ among treatment groups (P = .77). Semen centrifugation for low dose insemination did not appear to improve fertility of this subfertile stallion, despite use of entire ejaculates for each individual insemination dose.

A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar can improve system performance with waveform and spatial diversities. Mathematically, the multiple independent waveforms increase the dimension of signal space, so optimal transmission power allocation deserves investigation. The majority of the literature prefers to omit the effect of propagation attenuation, and considers the receiving gain vectors to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) in power allocation. In this paper, we integrate the propagation losses into MIMO radar signal model, and investigate the power allocation problems under three popular criteria: maximizing the mutual information, minimizing the minimum mean square errors, and maximizing the echo energy. As their objective functions are either convex or concave, the optimal strategies are theoretically guaranteed.

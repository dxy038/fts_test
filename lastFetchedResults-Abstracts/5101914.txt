We propose textural features, which are invariant to illumination spectrum and extremely robust to illumination direction. They require only a single training image per texture and no knowledge of illumination direction or spectrum. Hence, these features are suitable for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) of realistic scenes with colour textured objects and variable illumination. The illumination invariants are derived from Markov random field based texture representations. Our illumination invariant features are favourably compared with frequented features in this area - the local binary patterns, steerable pyramid and Gabor textural features, respectively. The superiority of our new invariant features is demonstrated in the illumination invariant recognition of the most advanced representation for realistic real-world materials - bidirectional texture function (BTF) textures.

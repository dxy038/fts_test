Because of the age of the European building stock and because of the new energy performance regulations, safe and efficient concepts have to be developed for the refurbishment of exterior walls. The objective of this paper is to explain the method that was developed in the European SUSREF project for the analysis of refurbishment concepts, and describe how the method was effectively implemented during the project. Both generic refurbishment concepts and company specific solutions were developed for the refurbishment of building external walls. All concepts were systematically assessed with help of the method. The method includes a list of performance criteria and detailed guidelines for the assessment. Important aspects include not only the aspects of technical and functional performance but also process related aspects and life cycle aspects. The process related aspects should not be limited to technical feasibility but also consider the impacts caused to neighbouring buildings and their users. Life cycle aspects should cover both environmental as well as financial aspects. The approach was tested during the project and it was found suitable both for the development of new innovative solutions as well as for the improvement of more conventional solutions. The approach is also recommended to be made use of in the development of design codes for refurbishment concepts of exterior walls. A systematic method should also be used in the dissemination of information about recommended refurbishment concepts for designers.

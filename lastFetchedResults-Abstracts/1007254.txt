The objective of this experimental investigation is to obtain a detailed understanding of damage accumulation in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) woven glass-fiber-reinforced composite panels under repeated transverse drop-weight impact loading conditions. Measurements were obtained for impact force and energy dissipation. The radial spread of damage was smallest for the 2D laminates and largest for the 3D woven composites. The 3D composites had the greatest resistance to penetration and dissipated more total energy than the laminate system. This damage tolerance is due to unique energy absorption mechanisms, which involve the crimped portion of z-tows in the 3D composites. This is significant, since 3D architectures can provide both an inherent capability to dissipate energy over a large radial area and a greater perforation strength than comparable 2D laminate systems.

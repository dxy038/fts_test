Laser submillimeter (SMM) interferometers are widely used to diagnose high-temperature plasma in thermonuclear installations. The results of a study of a ring SMM laser with bidirectional optical pumping in the formic acid molecule (HCOOH) acting by the oscillation line with the wavelength 393.6 &#956;m and heterodyne interferometer are given. The problem of stabilization of radiation sources in this interferometer is simplified substantially to increase reliability and reduce the cost of the interferometer

Tuberculous aortitis generally develops at the distal aortic arch and the descending aorta that are close to specific groups of mediastinal lymph nodes, but exceptionally it develops in the ascending aorta. We report a case of rupture of the ascending aorta after tuberculous aortitis in a 53-year-old man without a history of tuberculosis or evidence of a primary foci who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation due to severe hemoptysis with subsequent cardiac arrest. The tuberculous aortitis associated with rupture of the ascending aorta was treated with surgical resection and in situ graft placement.

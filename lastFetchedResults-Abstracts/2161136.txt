The objective of the study was to analyze the effect of serum from freshwater (FW) exposed tilapia or from 25 ppt seawater (SW) exposed tilapia on the ability to mediate the phagocytic activity of tilapia phagocytes. To analyze the phagocytic activity, head kidney (HK) and spleen leukocytes were tested in 300 or 500 mOsm medium using three different treatment groups (a) control, (b) addition of 25% serum from freshwater (FW) exposed tilapia, and (c) addition of 25% of serum from 25 ppt seawater (SW) exposed tilapia. HK leukocytes cultured in 300 and 500 mOsm media for 4 h showed an increase of phagocytic ability in the control group as compared to the addition of serum from either FW or SW exposed tilapia. HK leukocytes exposed to 500 mOsm medium showed a higher phagocytic ability than those leukocytes exposed to 300 mOsm medium in each corresponding group. Concurrently, spleen leukocytes in the control group showed a higher phagocytic ability than those leukocytes with the addition of serum from FW or SW exposed tilapia. As compared to spleen leukocytes cultured in 300 mOsm medium, leukocytes cultured in 500 mOsm medium showed an increase of phagocytic ability within their respective group. To further investigate the observed phenomenon, 2D-gel electrophoresis was performed for analyzing the differentially expressed proteins in serum that was thought to influence the phagocytic ability. Up-regulated serum proteins in SW exposed tilapia contained complement C3 protein, NADH dehydrogenase (Ubiquinone) Fe–S protein 3, Mg2+-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase, Semaphorins, and Caspase 3. Taken together these results suggest that addition of serum decreased the phagocytic activity in HK and spleen leukocytes in vitro, furthermore, induced proteins semaphorin, complement C3, Mg2+-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase, and Caspase 3 are up-regulated in the serum, which might have decreased the phagocytic activity upon exposure to hyperosmotic solutions.

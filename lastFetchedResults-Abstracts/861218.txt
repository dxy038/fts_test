The main objective of this paper is to propose a generalized form of the performability measure, which has been initially defined for the purpose of studying the performance and reliability analysis of fault tolerant systems. This generalized form takes into account more detailed rewards and can be used in general for maintenance cost analysis as well as in the modeling of the website users behavior. We give different formulations by means of a homogeneous Markov chain and a cyclic nonhomogeneous Markov chain and their asymptotic expression.

In this paper we study a scheduling model that simultaneously considers production scheduling, material supply, and product delivery. One vehicle with limited loading capacity transports unprocessed jobs from the supplierâ€™s warehouse to the factory in a fixed travelling time. Another capacitated vehicle travels between the factory and the customer to deliver finished jobs to the customer. The objective is to minimize the arrival time of the last delivered job to the customer. We show that the problem is NP-hard in the strong sense, and propose an O(n) time heuristic with a tight performance bound of 2. We identify some polynomially solvable cases of the problem, and develop heuristics with better performance bounds for some special cases of the problem. Computational results show that all the heuristics are effective in producing optimal or near-optimal solutions quickly.


Objective: This research was conducted to study the effectiveness of self-regulation training
among female students’ academic achievement motivation in Birjand City, Iran.
Methods: In this interventional comparative study (pretest-posttest design with control group),
84 eighth grade students (from public intermediate schools) in Birjand were selected through
multi-stage cluster sampling. They were placed in two groups: experiment and control with
randomization. The academic achievement motivation test and science test were administered
as pre- and post-tests, respectively. The experimental group was taught self-regulation skills in
8 sessions. Data were analyzed using the mixed-design factorial analysis of variance model.
Results: The results showed significant differences in the experiment group’s achievement
motivation test (p<0.05), but no signs of change in the science test.
Conclusion: We can provide students with effective and useful tips to improve their academic
achievement and performance by teaching them self-regulation skills.

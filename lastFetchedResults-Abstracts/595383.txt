Objective: To asses the effect of education and experience on the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of dentists regarding various aspects of tooth- preparation of maxillary second premolar to receive a metal-ceramic full-coverage retainer of a fixed dental prosthesis. Material and Methods: During the period of May 2005 to April 2006 and using a structured questionnaire, data was recorded from dental practitioners working in two cities. The participant dentists as well as their KAP data relating to tooth preparation for the test retainer on maxillary second premolar were collected. Practitioners filled questionnaires by selecting from the given statements. Data from 120 practitioners divided into 4-groups, on the basis of their educational background and clinical experience were collected. Results: Practitioners KAP was considered acceptable relating to tooth preparation parameters set for the occlusal surface (81%) and depth (73%), surface-topography (78%), taper (72%), and palatal reduction depth (60%). Poor responses for the statements for the finish-line location (52%), shoulder-form (36%), labial reduction depth (51%), use of retraction-cords (39%) and metal-framework trial (45%) were recorded. In general, the KAP of fresh-graduates was found better. Conclusion: While most practitioners possessed acceptable level of KAP regarding the tooth preparation design and trial of metal-coping, there were still some areas in which they lacked desirable knowledge.

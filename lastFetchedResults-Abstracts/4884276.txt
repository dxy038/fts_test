High speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) was introduced in WCDMA as an enhance technology. The objective of the major component fast packet scheduling is to ensure the fairness between users according to their instantaneous channel state. We proposed in this paper a novel packet scheduling algorithm for HSDPA which is based on QoS assurances. This algorithm is called classified wireless fair queuing which classifies flows into different class according to their average data rate. Each class is given different bandwidth guarantee and packets are scheduled in different slot, within each class it uses wireless fair queueing method to schedule each user. Simulation results and comparisons show that this algorithm could effectively reduce the average end-to-end packet delay especially for high data rate traffic and provide good fairness to each user.

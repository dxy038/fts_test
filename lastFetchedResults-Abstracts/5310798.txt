The symmetrical motorised momentum exchange tether, is intended to be excited by a continuous torque, so that, it can be applied as an orbital transfer system. The motor drive accelerates the tether, and increases the relative velocity of payloads fitted to each end. In order to access better tether performance, a higher efficiency index needs to be achieved. Meanwhile, the stress in each tether sub-span should stay within the stress limitations. The multi-objective optimisation methods of Genetic Algorithms can be applied for tether performance enhancement. The tetherÂ´s efficiency index and stress are used as multi-objectives, and the analysis of the resulting Pareto front suggests a set of solutions for the parameters of the motorised momentum exchange tether when used for payload transfer, in order to achieve relative high transfer performance, and safe tether strength.

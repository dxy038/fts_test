Objective: To report on the surgical technique of laparoscopic radical cystoprostatectomy with ileal conduit urinary diversion. Methods: A 79 years old man with histologically proven transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder stageT 2b NxMx underwent a laparoscopic radical cystoprostatectomy with ileal conduit urinary diversion. The cystoprostatectomy was performed with laparoscopic technique. Creation of the ileal conduit and the stoma were performed through a mini-laparotomy. Specific technical aspects are described. Results: The procedure was completed laparoscopically. The creation of the ileal conduit and stoma were performed through a mini-laparotomy. The surgical margins were free of disease. There were no intra or postoperative complications. The operative time was 290 min. Estimated blood loss was 380 mL. Hospital stay was 6 days. At 3 months there is no evidence of disease. The patient resumed his normal activity. Conclusion: Laparoscopic radical cystoprostatectomy with ileal conduit urinary diversion is a feasible option for organ-confined carcinoma of the bladder. The procedure is technically demanding and should be performed in centers with large experience in laparoscopic surgery.

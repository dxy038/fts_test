Underwater imaging is quite a challenging in the area of photography especially for low resolution and ordinary digital camera. There are a few problems occur in underwater images such as limited range visibility, low contrast, non uniform lighting, blurring, bright artefacts, color diminished and noise. This paper concentrates on color diminished. Significant application of standard computer vision techniques to underwater imaging is required in dealing with the said problems. Both manual and auto level techniques are used to record the mean values of the stretched histogram. The objective of the paper is to identify which technique is more significant in terms of color correction. It is hoped that the finding will benefit to non divers to visualize the underwater as the real underwater world.

Necessary conditions for Pareto optimality in multiobjective programming with
subdifferentiable set functions are established in Theorem 12 of H. C. Lai and L. J.
Lin J. Math. Anal. Appl. 132, 1988, 558]571.. In this paper, we establish some
sufficient conditions under which a feasible solution of such a problem will be
Pareto optimal provided that a weaker convexity requirement is satisfied; for
instance I, r, u.-convexity is assumed for both objective and constraint set
functions. Some duality models are also discussed. Wolfe-type and Mond]Weir-type
duality theorems are proved

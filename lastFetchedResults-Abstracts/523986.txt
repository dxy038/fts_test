Objective: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are obtained from a variety of sources, mainly
the bone marrow. These cells have a great potential for clinical research, however they cannot
stay alive for long periods in culture. The aim of this study is to determine whether vitrification
can be a useful freezing method for the storage of MSCs.
Materials and Methods: Mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from rat bone marrow based
on their capacity to adhere to plastic culture surfaces. MSCs were cryopreserved using both
the vitrification method and open-pulled straw (OPS) vitrification and stored in liquid nitrogen
with ethylene glycol ficoll (EFS) as a cryoprotectant for two months. The morphology and
viability of thawed MSCs were evaluated by trypan blue staining. Furthermore, pre and post
cryopreserved MSCs were induced to osteocyte and adipocyte with corresponding osteogenic
and adipogenic medium.
Results: After thawing, the viability rates were 81.33% ± 6.83 for the vitrification method and
80.83% ± 6.4 for OPS vitrification, while the values in the pre-vitrification control group were
88.16% ± 6.3 (Mean ± SD, n = 6). Post-cryopreserved cells from both the vitrification method
and OPS vitrification also had a similar cellular morphology and colony-formation that was
indistinguishable from non-vitrified fresh MSCs. In addition, the resuscitated cells cultured in
induction medium showed osteogenesis. Mineral production and deposition was detectable
by alizarine red S staining. Moreover, by applying an adipogenic differentiation condition,
both pre and post cryopreserved cells differentiated into adipocyte and lipid vacuole accumulation
that was stained by oil red O.
Conclusion: Vitrification is a reliable and effective method for the cryopreservation of MSCs.

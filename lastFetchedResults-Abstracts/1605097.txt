The problem of solving multi-objective linear-programming problems, by assuming that the decision maker has fuzzy goals for each of the objective functions, is addressed. Several methods have been proposed in the literature in order to obtain fuzzy-efficient solutions to fuzzy multi-objective programming problems. In this paper we show that, in the case that one of our goals is fully achieved, a fuzzy-efficient solution may not be Pareto-optimal and therefore we propose a general procedure to obtain a non-dominated solution, which is also fuzzy-efficient. Two numerical examples illustrate our procedure.

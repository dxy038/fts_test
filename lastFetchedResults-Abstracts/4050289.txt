Optimization of electromechanical aerospace actuators requires a multi-objective and comparative analysis in order to account for performance and manufacturing cost terms. This paper introduces a particular optimization methodology presenting stable convergence characteristics which has been applied to optimize the geometry of both Fractional Slot Concentrated Winding (FSCW) and Full Pitch Concentrated Winding (FPCW) permanent magnet motor configurations. The proposed algorithm combines technical and physical advantages of the FSCWs and FPCWs into an optimally shaped stator-winding configuration. The resultant motor design has been validated through a prototype and experimental results illustrated its suitability for aerospace actuation applications.

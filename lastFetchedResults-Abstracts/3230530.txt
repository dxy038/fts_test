Transmission network expansion planning (TNEP) is one of the important aspects of power system planning. It will find out where, when and how many new transmission lines should be added to the network. In order to meet the load growth and generation patterns to maintain the system reliability, stability, and economic constraints, transmission network expansion planning problem is highly complex in nature. Further, as network size increases system analysis becomes difficult. The objective of TNEP was to minimize the transmission network investment cost required to meet the growing load and the added constraints... Based on direct current (DC) power flow model, this paper presents application of a population search based algorithm named, Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization algorithm is used to solve the Static TNEP problem, to minimize the transmission investment cost. The capability of the proposed method is tested with GarverÂ´s six-bus network, IEEE 24-bus test system, and IEEE 25-bus test system and results obtained are compared with the previous published literature.

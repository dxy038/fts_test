This paper involves a simulation modeling of cassava harvesting and selling practice. Cassava farmers mostly make selling decisions based on experience. These decisions include harvesting cycles, which vary from eight months to 18 months; and selling practices, which are selling based on weight and selling based on percentage of starch. Making both decisions that leads to a maximal profit is difficult when several factors, such as cassava market price, cassava yield (amount and percent starch), and market conditions, that impact the decision outcome contain variability. Simulation modeling is an effective tool for decision analysis under such uncertainties. The objective of this study is to develop a simulation model that can provide guideline for making these decisions. A model verification is conducted and the results show that the model logics are correctly constructed and that the model can be used to evaluate different harvesting cycles and selling practices for further analysis.

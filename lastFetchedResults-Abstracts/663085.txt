It is well known that the limited aqueous solubilities of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) often reduce their bioavailability to bacterial populations. The objective of this study was to test the impact of a solubility-enhancement reagent, hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD), on the bioavailability and biodegradation of pyrene. No measurable loss of pyrene occurred for the control vials throughout the first 22 weeks of the experiment, indicating the absence of mass loss via abiotic transformation and volatilization. The vials containing pyrene and the degrader isolate (Burkholderia CRE 7), but no HPCD, also exhibited no measurable loss of pyrene throughout the experiment. Conversely, biodegradation of pyrene appears to have been initiated after approximately 15 weeks for the vials containing 104 mg l−1 HPCD. By the end of the experiment, approximately 14% (w/w) of the pyrene was biodegraded in the presence of HPCD. These results indicate that HPCD may be useful for enhancing the bioavailability and biodegradation of pyrene and other PAHs.

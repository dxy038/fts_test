Objective: The aim of this study was the comparison of the functional stability of dominant and nondominant shoulder in female volleyball players with and without anterior shoulder instability, using YBTUQ. Materials and methods: In this descriptive study, 28 female university volleyball players (age=20 to 25 years) were categorized into healthy (n=14) and anterior shoulder instability (n=14) group. Upper quarter y balance test (YBTUQ) was used for measuring functional stability of both dominant and nondominant shoulder. After checking the normal distribution of the results with 1s KolmogorovSmirnov, paired sle ttest and independent sle ttest were used for comparing the dominant and nondominant shoulderrsquo s functional stability and for comparing the results between groups, respectively. Results: Higher YBTUQ composite score was observed in nondominant shoulder and dominant shoulder of the healthy group and the nondominant shoulder and dominant (injured) shoulder of shoulder instability group, respectively. No significant difference was observed between functional stability of both shoulders of the healthy group (p=0.144), while the functional stability of the nondominant shoulders of the instability group was significantly higher than the dominant unstable shoulders (p=0.001). The results of functional stability of the unstable shoulders of the injured group were significantly lower than the results of the dominant shoulders of the healthy group, while in nondominant side, all directions but the Superolateral direction showed significant difference. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, functional stability of the unstable shoulder of female university volleyball players is lower than the functional stability of their nondominant side or the functional stability of the healthy subjects therefore, we suggest that the upper extremity stabilization exercises, specially the closed kinetic chain exercises should be added to the shoulder rehabilitation programs.

This paper presents the RF coverage analysis of TT&amp;C antenna for MARS Orbiter Mission at S-band to predict the antenna performance during both transfer orbit phase as well as in-orbit phase (i.e. stowed and deployed configurations) taking into account the effect of the spacecraft structure and appendices like the solar array, deployable antenna and propellant tank. The main objective behind this analysis is for the decision making during the critical mission operations for commanding the satellite. This analysis is carried out by using the WIPL-D and MATLAB software. The predicted results of downlink TT&amp;C antenna are compared with in-orbit measured data and found to have a good match.

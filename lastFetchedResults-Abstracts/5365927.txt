This paper is dedicated to the problem of observer design for Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) nonlinear systems with unmeasurable premise variables (TSUPV) and application to autonomous bicycle system. The main idea is based on the use of differential mean value theorem combined to the sector nonlinearity transformation. The objective of this approach is to make the state estimation error dynamic on a T-S form which allows to apply the classical Lyapunov analysis to derive convergence conditions. The design algorithm is proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMI). To illustrate the proposed methodology, a nonlinear bicycle model is considered.

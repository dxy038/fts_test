Mutation of vitamin D receptors (vdr) results in resistance to the vitamin's normal effects which may compromise dentin formation. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of vdr deficiency on post-natal dentin maturation in mice. The dentin in mandibular incisors of 70.5-day-old vdr wild-type and vdr knockout mice was compared at different levels along the long axis. Expression of biglycan and decorin was detected by immunolocalisation. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the ultrastructure of the dentin, and micro-computerised tomography was used to determine the degree of dentin mineralisation density. In the vdr knockout mice, the pulp chamber was larger and the dentin wall was thinner compared with the wild-type mice. In addition, the pre-dentin layer was thickened with an irregular front line and diffuse expression of biglycan and decorin. Fewer tubules, lower mineralisation density and pore-like defects were observed in the dentin at the eruptive region and level with the first molar. In conclusion, vdr deficiency compromises dentin maturation.

The objective of the analysis presented is to outline and validate a methodology for the optimization of MV distribution network operation. Loss minimization, taking into account the protective scheme applied, reliability and voltage quality aspects, are attained. Loss minimization is achieved by the installation of shunt capacitors and reconfiguration of the network. Two different reconfiguration methods are applied and compared. Special attention is given to the impact of network reconfiguration on the protective scheme applied, as well as on network voltage quality and reliability. Loads are assumed to be time variable, following typical daily curves. A general optimization method, suitable for overhead and underground networks, is outlined and validated through applications

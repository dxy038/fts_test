Within a project whose objective is to develop a small-size 3D sensor combining a video camera with a 3D laser-based &#8220;camera&#8221;, this paper describes the current status of the laser camera. The prototype of the laser camera is operational and is able to produce 3D &#8220;images&#8221; with good definition at high speed. Because of size constraints, some of the control electronics are implemented in an FPGA. The video camera that will be included in the system also needs integrated data processing. Consequently, the paper also describes an ongoing research about how to optimize the implementation in an FPGA of an algorithm class which is relevant both for control electronics and video data processing

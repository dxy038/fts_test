The paper describes a new approach to ZIP code recognition using a word recognition algorithm, where a numeral string is recognized as a word. The paper also describes an end to end ZIP code recognition system consisting of tilt/slant correction, line segmentation, word segmentation, ZIP code location, as well as the ZIP code recognition. Evaluation tests are performed using address block image samples collected from United States mail pieces. The results of isolated numeral recognition, manually extracted ZIP code recognition, and end to end ZIP code recognition are presented to show and discuss the advantage of the word recognition based numeral string recognition

PID controller has been widely applied in engineering area. In this paper, multi-objective differential evolution (MODE) is used to design a multi-objective robust PID controller for two MIMO systems known as distillation column plant and longitudinal control system of the super maneuverable F18/HARV fighter aircraft. Multi-objective robust PID controller problem is formulated by minimizing integral squared error (ISE) and balanced robust performance criteria. The performance of the optimum PID controllers that obtain by MODE is compared with performance reported in literature by other methods in terms of the sum of ISE and balanced robust performance criteria. The results show that the PID controllers obtained by MODE can outperform various optimal PID controllers reported in literature.

In this paper different configurations of the MIMO systems have been used to analyze the performance in terms of BER of the system with and without co-channel interference cancellation techniques under various channel conditions using spatial channel model. All the simulations for different systems have been implemented in Matlab to carry out the comparative analysis of Bell labs layered space time (BLAST) MIMO systems. Simulation results are implemented along-with the result analysis giving the advantage of antenna diversity achieved at receiving end by increasing the number of antennas. Basically two models with different number of antennas at receiving end are implemented and the main objective of this paper is extensive use of realistic Spatial Channel model offering three propagation scenarios such as suburban macro-cell, urban macro-cell and urban micro-cell. Urban micro-cellular environment is further differentiated into line of sight (LOS) and non line of sight (NLOS) propagation. The ultimate aim of implementation is to increase the throughput by exploiting diversity at receiving end and same is achieved by LST systems where data rate is improved with more number of antenna elements at receiving end but BER performance is not improved. It is even observed from the simulations that overall LST systems using successive interference cancellation technique that cancels the effect of co-channel interference because of transmit antennas have better BER performance than systems where interference cancellation is not carried out. For the purpose of interference cancellation the ranking of received signal is required to be done that is based on the value of SNR. A signal with highest SNR is at highest priority as compared to other having lower SNR. This ranking of signal based on highest SNR is carried out by implementation of novel successive interference cancellation algorithm.

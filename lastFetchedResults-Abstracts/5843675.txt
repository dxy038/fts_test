A new state-space modeling of a three-phase AC/AC matrix converter is presented. The main objective of this paper is the design of a sliding mode controller for both controlling the output voltage and input current. The sliding mode strategy is based on the determination of the sliding surfaces and switching laws allowing to choose an appropriate space vector pattern. Robustness regarding line voltage and load parameters variations of this control technique has been recorded by using simulation results on matlab.

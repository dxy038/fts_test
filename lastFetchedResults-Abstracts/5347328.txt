In this paper, high voltage Bipolar Junction Transistors are presented and compared in order to suggest a bidirectional switch for household appliances with fully turn-on, turn-off control. A comparative theoretical study, using 2D simulations, shows that concepts like &#8220;superjunctions&#8221; and &#8220;floating islands&#8221; improve the static current gain without unwanted behavior like parasitic diodes.

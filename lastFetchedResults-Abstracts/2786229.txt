A decentralized event-triggered control scheme for leader-follower consensus is developed. The approach aims to reduce inter-agent communication while ensuring asymptotic leader-follower consensus. The objective is achieved by designing a control algorithm that uses the estimates of neighborsÂ´ states for feedback and only updates the estimates through communication when events are triggered. The update events are determined by a decentralized trigger condition, designed from the stability analysis, such that the control ensures asymptotic leader-follower consensus with only intermittent communication. The effectiveness of reducing inter-agent communication is shown by developing a positive constant lower bound of the minimum inter-event interval. Since switched dynamics are considered, Zeno execution is proven to be avoided, and Lyapunov-based convergence analysis is provided to ensure the asymptotic leader-follower consensus. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed control strategy.

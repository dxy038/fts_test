At present, supply chain management has become not only a hot academic research, but also an important respect of the enterprise strategic management. A multi-product, multi-stage integrated supply chain management model was established by multiple-objective programming, which could describe the capability and profit of supply chain members and the coordination operation of supply chain. Then an example was given for testing the effectiveness and feasibility of the model, and the simulation result was compared with that of decentralization supply chain management model. The example shows that multiple objective programming can solve the problem of integrated supply chain management.

This research addresses the mixed-model assembly line (MMAL) by considering
various constraints. In MMALs, several types of products which their similarity is so
high are made on an assembly line. As a consequence, it is possible to assemble and
make several types of products simultaneously without spending any additional time.
The proposed multi-objective model considers the balancing and sequencing problems,
simultaneously. Based on the assembly problem, the various tasks of models are
assigned to the workstations, while in the sequencing problem, a sequence of models for
production is determined. The two meta-heuristic algorithms, namely MOPSO and
NSGA-II are used to solve the developed model and different comparison metrics are
applied to compare these two proposed meta-heuristics. Several test problems based on
empirical data is used to illustrate the performance of our proposed model. The results
show that NSGA-II outperforms the MOPSO algorithm in most metrics used in this
paper. Moreover, the results indicate that our proposed model is more effective and
efficient to assignment of tasks and sequencing models than manual strategy. Finally,
conclusion remarks and future research are provided.

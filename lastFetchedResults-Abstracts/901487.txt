Fall related injuries are the leading cause of injury death and disabilities among older adults and its health care cost is high. So the aim of this study was to survey the fall frequency at home and its related factors among the elderly in Babol city, Iran.

There was a significant correlation between program for fall prevention and fall incidence (p=0.000). Most falls occurred on the stairs (24.9%). In this study, there was a significant correlation between fall incidence and age over 75 (OR=2.51, CI95%:1.26Â±5.06), history of disease (OR=4.55, CI95%: 2.14- 9.71), balance disorders (OR=2.37, CI95%:1.12-5) and consumption of hypnotic drugs (OR= 6.48, CI95%: 3.48-12.06).

The objective of this study was to determine of chemical composition, true digestibility of amino acid (TDAA) and true metabolizable energy corrected to zero nitrogen balance (TMEn) of three poultry by-product meals (PBM). Three PBM were obtained from Tabriz, Mahabad and Urmia commercial slaughter plants. TMEn and TDAA of PBM samples were determined in 16 adult cecectomized broiler roosters with completely randomized design. Four roosters were assigned to each treatment and four roosters were deprived of feed throughout the experimental period to measure endogenous excretion of energy, N, and AA. The mean levels of nutrients (percentage) in the meals for CP, EE and ash were 56.84±0.42, 21.57±0.48 and 7.62±0.17, respectively. TMEn and TDAA were significant differences among meals (P <  0.05) and mean of TMEn for all samples were 3528 (kcal/kg). TMEn for Tabriz sample was greatest and for Urmia sample was lowest (P <  0.05). Mean of TDAA for Tabriz sample (81.56%) was higher than Mahabad (67.71%) and Urmia (66.9%) samples (P <  0.05). However, digestible amino acid was greatest for Tabriz sample among the PBM. The results of this study indicated that the nutritive value of Tabriz PBM was higher than that of Urmia and Mahabad meals.

Introduction: Although logbook is a useful tool in learning and assessment
of the student, its use in the education of undergraduate dentistry students
is not well-established. The present study was conducted to assess the effect
of logbook as a study guide and an effective method for assessment of the
students in the fixed prosthesis course.
Methods: This quasi-experimental study was performed in Shiraz Dental
School. The subjects of this study consisted of 60 students categorized into two
experimental and control groups. In the control group, the students underwent
the current format of Fixed Prosthesis curriculum. In the experimental group,
the intervention was carried out using the Logbook. Pre and post tests were
done using MCQ. The instructors and students had to evaluate the studentsâ€™
daily activities. The data were analyzed using SPSS software. T-test, Paired
T-test and Mann Whitney test were used for statistical analysis.
Results: The logbooks were effective in cognitive and psychomotor domain
(knowledge and practice) of dental education and the mean difference between
the two groups was significant (P < 0.01). The use of logbook provided a more
objective evaluation and led to further student satisfaction.
Conclusion: Logbook is a useful tool for teaching and learning as an interactive
study guide and assessment tool. Using logbook in dentistry education
necessitates more studies to be conducted in this regard and also the revision
of dental curricula.

The objective of this paper is to determine the future for Knowledge Management (KM) applications that focus on healthcare processes. This is achieved by tracing the evolution of KM by examining how different sectors have formulated industry-specific KM applications, then discussing the key constraints that these sectors have faced whilst formulating industry specific KM applications. It then details how these constraints can impede the coming of age of KM applications for healthcare. The results of several case studies on the future of healthcare KM applications are presented. This paper thus attempts to contribute to the adoption of KM in healthcare by looking at how practitioners can overcome stumbling blocks in KM healthcare applications.

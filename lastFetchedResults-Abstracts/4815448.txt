This paper proposes an optimization method for determining the optimal tuning parameters of PID controller, for level control of three tank system. The main objective is to obtain a fast and stable system by tuning the PID controller using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The simulation is done using MATLAB software. The response of PSO based PID controller is compared with Z-N tuned PID controller in terms of time domain specifications. The simulation results shows that tuning the PID controller using PSO provides fast and stable system with low overshoot.

This paper looks at the current state of the electrical energy sector in the People´s Republic of China in the face of a massive rate of economic growth. More than 120 GW of generating capacity is under construction including the 18.2 GW Three Gorges hydroelectric project, which is due for eventual expansion to 22.4 GW. However, even with this rate of growth within the electrical energy sector, new generating capacity is unlikely to meet demand in most areas for at least another 12 months. Despite efforts to reform the electricity sector, strengthening the country´s power grid networks remains a key objective. Fortunately, the pace of technological development in the power transmission sector is also gathering momentum. Awaiting approval is a project to construct the world´s first ultra high voltage direct current (UHVDC) transmission system. This is part of the effort to upgrade and reinforce the existing nine west-to-east links which import bulk power.

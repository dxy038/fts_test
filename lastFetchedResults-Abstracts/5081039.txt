A CPW-fed compact printed monopole antenna with quad-band notched characteristics is presented in this paper. The antenna design adopts a square patch with matching step. By etching a slot and a split ring resonantor (S-SRR) on the patch, employing a rectangular complementary split ring resonantor (CSRR) in each side of the ground plane, embedding a pair of open-circuit slots neighbouring the CSRR, quad-band filtering properties in the WiMAX, WLAN and 8GHz for X-band satellite communication systems are achieved. The results show that the designed antenna, with compact size of 31 &#215; 31 mm<sup>2</sup>, has an impedance bandwidth of 2.8-11.4 GHz for VSWR less than 2, except four frequency stop-bands of 3.3-3.6, 5.0-5.4, 5.7-6.0 and 7.6-8.6 GHz. Moreover, the antenna has good omnidirectional radiation patterns in the H-plane, and the radiation patterns in the E-plane are like a small dipole leading to bidirectional patterns.

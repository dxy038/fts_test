This paper presents the analysis, fabrication, and experimental results of wirelessly actuated chip-scale rotary motors. Two designs are described. Design M is actuated by a <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="\\phi 8" src="/images/tex/22662.gif"/> </formula>-mm magnetoelastic stator lithographically micromachined from Metglas 2826MB-bulk-foil with 25 <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="\\mu\\hbox {m}" src="/images/tex/527.gif"/> </formula> thickness. It operates at a resonant frequency of 11.35 kHz while 3-Oe dc and 2-Oe amplitude ac magnetic fields are applied. The measured rotation speed, start torque, calculated driving step size, and payload are 44 r/min, 2 <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="\\hbox {nN} \\cdot \\hbox {m}" src="/images/tex/22663.gif"/> </formula>, <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="\\approx " src="/images/tex/15034.gif"/> </formula>23 mdeg, and 9 mg, respectively. Design S uses a stator that is a sandwich of Si (<formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="\\phi 8" src="/images/tex/22662.gif"/> </formula> mm diameter and 65 <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="\\mu\\hbox {m}" src="/images/tex/527.gif"/> </formula> thickness) and magnetoelastic foil (<formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="\\phi 8" src="/images/tex/22662.gif"/> </formula> mm diameter and 25 <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="\\mu\\hbox {m}" src="/images/tex/527.gif"/> </formula> thickness) to tailor the stiffness. The typical resonant frequencies of clockwise (CW) mode and counterclockwise (CCW) mode are 6.1 and 7.9 kHz, respectively. The CCW mode provides a rotation rate of about 100 r/min, start torque of 30 <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt=" \\hbox {nN} \\cdot \\hbox {m}" src="/images/tex/22664.gif"/> </formula>, and driving step size of 74 mdeg while 8-Oe dc and 6-Oe amplitude ac magnetic fields are applied. Bidirectional rotation is realized by switching the applied frequency, thereby exciting the stator in a slightly different mode shape. Design S shows at least 43-mg payload capability. <formula formulatype="inline"> <img alt="\\hfill " src="/images/tex/16791.gif"/> </formula>[2012-0207]

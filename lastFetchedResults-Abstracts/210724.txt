OBJECTIVE: To assess urinary flow rate/uroflowmetry in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), during three postoperative months.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted at Department of Urological Surgery and Transplantation, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) Karachi-Pakistan, between March 2002 and March 2005. Fifty consecutive clinically diagnosed cases of BPH who never went in retention of urine and underwent TURP were included in this study. Preoperative urinary flow rate was measured. Uroflowmetry was postoperatively carried out after every month for three months period and observations were analysed.
RESULTS: Mean±SD age of the subjects was 63.62±6.75 years. Preoperatively mean±SD values were maximum flow rate 7.60±2.41 ml/sec, average flow rate 4.44±1.28 ml/sec and voided volume 165.54±49.60 ml. Post-TURP mean±SD values after three months were maximum flow rate 27.24±5.11 ml/sec, average flow rate 13.48±2.08 ml/sec and voided volume 240.32±49.91 ml. The variation in means of uroflowmetry parameters from first to third post-TURP month found statistically significant (P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: We conclude that the effects of post-transurethral resection of prostate, all the obstructive uroflowmetry parameters return towards normal levels. It indicates that there is excellent improvement relief in both obstructive and irritative symptoms.

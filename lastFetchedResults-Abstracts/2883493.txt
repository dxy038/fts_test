A crystal-less FSK wireless transceiver is proposed for next-generation intelligent intensive care unit (ICU) healthcare systems. The transceiver delivers bidirectional data of the bio-signal collected from a patient and control signal from a centralized station. It features crystal-less design and direct frequency-shift-keying (FSK) modulation and demodulation at 1.4 GHz for low power consumption. As such, it transmits digital data without a local oscillator (LO) for frequency mixing. The system architecture is first verified using a hybrid system of commercial integrated circuits. The proposed transceiver is also designed in 0.18-&#956;m CMOS technology.

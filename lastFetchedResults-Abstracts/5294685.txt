The main objective of the paper is to present new browser-based, interactive software tools for modeling of various power electronics circuits. The static and dynamic operation, including the continuous and discrete time linearization of widely applied DC-DC converter cells are discussed in the first part of the paper. The second part focuses on the basics of the pulse-width-modulation and its application in one-phase sinusoidal inverters. The interactive tools provide numerous excellent opportunities for industrial and academic education. Another application field of numerous embedded interactive software components is their utilization as fast, real-time model-building tools

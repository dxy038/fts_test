Crises management for smart-infrastructure - infused with sensors, actuators, and intelligent agent technologies for monitoring, access control, and crisis response - requires objective and quantitative evaluation to learn for future. The concept of criticality - characterizing the effect of crises on the inhabitants of smart-infrastructure - is used in this regard. This paper establishes a criticality response modeling (CRM) framework to perform quantitative evaluation of criticality response. The framework can further be incorporated in any criticality-aware middleware for smart-infrastructure. An established stochastic model for criticality response is used from our previous work. The effectiveness of criticality response is measured in terms of the Manageability metric, characterized by the Q-value or qualifiedness of the response actions. The CRM is applied to fire emergencies in an envisioned smart oil &amp; gas production platforms (OGPP). A simulation based evaluation, using CRM over OGPP, show that high manageability is achieved with - i) fast criticality detection, ii) fast response actuation, and iii) non-obliviousness to any subsequent criticality during response actuation - verifying the applicability of Q-value as the manageability metric.

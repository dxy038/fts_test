This paper deals with a shunt active filter which
will be installed by an electric utility, putting much emphasis
on the control strategy and the best point of installation of
the shunt active filter on a feeder in a power distribution system.
The objective of the shunt active filter is to damp harmonic
propagation, which results from harmonic resonance
between many capacitors for power factor improvement and
line inductors in the feeder, rather than to minimize voltage
distortion throughout the feeder. Harmonic mitigation
is a welcome “by-prod~ct’o~f the shunt active filter, which
comes from damping of harmonic propagation.
This paper concludes that the shunt active filter based on
detection of voltage at the point of installation is superior in
stability to others, and that the best site selection is not the
beginning terminal but the end terminal of the primary line
in the feeder. Computer simulation is performed to verify
the validity and effectiveness of the shunt active filter by
means of an analog circuit simulator, which is characterized
by installing it on a feeder of a radial distribution system in
a residential area.

 The objective of this study was to assess the difference in voice quality as defined by acoustical analysis using sustained vowel in laryngectomized patients in comparison with normal volunteers. This was designed as a retrospective single center cohort study. An adult tertiary referral unit formed the setting of this study. Fifty patients (40 males) who underwent total laryngectomy and 31 normal volunteers (18 male) participated. Group comparisons with the first three formant frequencies (F1, F2, and F3) using linear predictive coding (LPC) (Laryngograph Ltd, London, UK) was performed. The existence of any significant difference of F1, F2, and F3 between the two groups using the sustained vowel /i/ and the effects of other factors namely, tumor stage (T), chemoradiotherapy, pharyngectomy, cricothyroid myotomy, closure of pharyngoesophageal segment, and postoperative complication were analyzed. Formant frequencies F1, F2, and F3 were significantly different in male laryngectomees compared to controls: F1 (Pآ <آ 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test), F2 (Pآ <آ 0.001, Student's t test), and F3 (Pآ =آ 0.008, Student's t test). There was no significant difference between females in both groups for all three formant frequencies. Chemoradiotherapy and postoperative complications (pharyngocutaneous fistula) caused a significantly lower formant F1 in men, but showed little effect in F2 and F3. Laryngectomized males produced significantly higher formant frequencies, F1, F2, and F3, compared to normal volunteers, and this is consistent with literature. Chemoradiotherapy and postoperative complications significantly influenced the formant scores in the laryngectomee population. This study shows that robust and reliable data could be obtained using electroglottography and LPC in normal volunteers and laryngectomees using a sustained vowel.

This study reports that a weigh feeder is controlled using a performance-adaptive control method in which controller parameters are recalculated only when parameter estimation deteriorates. In this method, a PI control law is based on generalized minimum variance control (GMVC). Hence, a design parameter in GMVC is adjusted such that given control specifications are satisfied, and then, PI parameters are based on a redesigned GMVC law. The objective of this study is to reduce the variance of the variation in the control input. To this end, a conventional performance-adaptive control method is modified, and its effectiveness is shown by applying to a weigh feeder.

The objective of this study was to investigate the contribution of the CD28 costimulatory molecules to allergen-induced primary and chronic inflammatory responses. To this end, we have developed and characterized a short ragweed allergen-induced asthma model involving sensitization of HLA-DQ transgenic mice followed by intranasal challenge with allergen. Forty-eight hours after primary challenge, sensitized DQ8 mice developed pulmonary eosinophilic inflammation, airway hyperreactivity, Th2 cytokines, and IgE/IgG1 Ab. This allergic inflammatory response was absent in H-2Aβ0 and DQ8/CD280 mice. Secondary rechallenge with allergen 4 weeks later induced even greater inflammatory changes in the airways of DQ8 mice with eosinophils being the predominant inflammatory cells while only pulmonary lymphocytosis was observed in DQ8/CD280 mice. No inflammation was detected in H-2Aβ0 mice. Proliferation and cytokine profile studies demonstrated that CD28 regulates T-cell activation and effector function. Therefore, CD28 is essential for the extrinsic asthma and can be a target for immunotherapy.

The Brazilian system of alternative penalties presents an increasing demand of processes. Exceptions, as criminal backsliding, increases even more the demand. The organizational structure to assist judgments, designation of services program/institution and penal executions attendance involve different units and their respective judges. The process of efficient decision making requests a perfect synchronism among the judges of the units. This work presents a methodology for supporting the computerised decision, described through a general decision-making process and of specific treatments for exceptions, aided in case-based reasoning (CBR) techniques. Therefore, the objective is to facilitate decision making and to increase productivity guaranteeing interoperability of the alternative penalties units. The basic CBR cycle has been adapted in order to be compatible with the general decision-making process. We present a prototype built with the framework JColibri.

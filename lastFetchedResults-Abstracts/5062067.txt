Water environmental capacity(WEC) of Jiaozuo section of Manghe River(JSMR) were calculated by using one-dimensional water quality model. And the projects of total content control of pollutants were determined. The results showed that WEC of CODcr and NH<sub>3</sub>-N are 3403.93 tons/yr and 88.70 tons/yr respectively, and are much smaller than the amount of CODcr and NH<sub>3</sub>-N discharged into the river, which are 18396.36 tons/yr and 1189.99 tons/yr respectively. In order to attain the water environmental quality objective of JSMR, the total control and reduced quantity of CODcr should be 396.60 tons/yr and 17999.76 tons/yr respectively, and NH<sub>3</sub>-N 17.75 tons/yr and1172.24 tons/yr. This study can provide basic materials and scientific basis for the protection and management of JSMR.

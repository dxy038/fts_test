A novel circuit dedicating to system within storage battery as standby power supply and operating as bidirectional current source is proposed in this paper. Functions of both discharging process with large current from battery to the relative lower voltage load end and charging process with constant current to the reverse direction are realized by the presented circuit. Meanwhile, a strategy of digital control, which implements the control of constant current for the bidirectional circuit and furthermore realization of power management for battery is achieved, is proposed as well. Protection of under-voltage and floating charge process for the battery are realized as well. In addition, operation of constant current, constant voltage and constant power can be easily realized just by software modification and that excellent practicability of the very circuit is verified. An opening loop control scheme base on F2407A DSP chip is adopted when inductor current is in an intermittent condition. Characteristic of excellent current source for the very digital control circuit is verified in the experiment, and this scheme can be used as standby power supply in power system and communication system

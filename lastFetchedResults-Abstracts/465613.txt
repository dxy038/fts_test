Objective: We sought to determine the possible association among vaginitis, cervicitis, and cervical length in pregnancy. Study Design: Primigravid volunteers, between 20 and 36 weeksâ€™ gestation (n = 210), were examined. Vaginitis was diagnosed by pH determination and wet mount smear, cervicitis was diagnosed by cervicography, and cervical length was diagnosed by vaginal ultrasonographic measurement. Patients with both vaginitis and cervicitis (n = 70) were compared with those without any trace of infection (n = 23). The remainder (n = 117) had variable degrees of infection and were excluded. Results: The mean gestational age was 28.3 weeks. No significant association was found among vaginitis, cervicitis, and cervical length. In the infection group (n = 70), however, a significant association between an elevated vaginal pH (>5) and a shortened cervical length (r = 0.29) was noted. Conclusion: No significant association exists among vaginitis, cervicitis, and cervical length, but in patients with clinical signs of infection, an elevated pH appears to be associated with a decreased cervical length.

Workplace planning is a key problem in migrating workflow system. Different from general resource allocation or task schedule problems, workplace planning is a multi-constrained combinatorial optimization problem, the main objective of which is to minimize the migrating path length. This paper firstly proposes the model of workplace planning problem, and then provides a greedy discrete particle swarm optimization (GDPSO) algorithm for the problem solving. The simulation experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

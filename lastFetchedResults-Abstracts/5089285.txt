Methods of testability demonstration in electronic equipments are: inherent testability analysis, experimental demonstration and simulated demonstration. Each of these methods yield different aspects of the level of equipmentÂ´s testability, but the result is isolated and there are no connections with each method. In order to overcome this weakness, this paper combines many aspects of testability to achieve a full-scale and objective result to increase confidence.

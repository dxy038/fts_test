objective: The main aim of this research was to set up Persian stimuli for diagnostic experimental analysis of speech in order to measure Nasality and Motor Speech Profile by two Speech Lab Systems: SNORS + & VISIPITCH III in native speakers of Persian.
Materials & Methods: The linguistic stimuli of the two lab systems were standardized in accordance with the structural properties of Persian. Two groups of subjects (n=46) with an age range of 19 to 37 years were selected to test the reliability of the experimental analysis of the Persian stimuli.
Results: Based on the results the present linguistic stimuli can be used to measure nasality in SNORS + with standard deviation of %5 and MSP in VISIPITCH III with p=0 and STD = 33.06 and mean of 38.165. Conclusion: Based on the statistical analysis of the present Persian
sstimuli the data in both lab systems can be used to measure Nasality and Motor Speech Profile in the native speakers of Persian.

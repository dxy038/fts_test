Bus systems are unstable without considering any control. Thus, we are able to consider some control strategies to alleviate this problem. A holding control strategy is one commonly used real-time control strategy that can improve service quality. This paper develops a mathematical model for a holding control strategy. The objective of this model is to minimize the total cost related to passengers at any stop. To solve the model, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed. The results of the numerical examples show that the additional total cost caused by service irregularity is reduced by 25% by applying the presented holding model to the given problem.

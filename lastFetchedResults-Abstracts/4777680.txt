In this paper, we propose an efficient method to widen the radiation bandwidth of the microstrip leaky-wave antenna. In order to achieve this objective, a broad band feeding structure and a tapered microstrip line are proposed. The tapered microstrip line is employed to make the different radiation bands distribute in different areas of the microstrip line. The simulation results and the experimental data show the proposed method is feasible.

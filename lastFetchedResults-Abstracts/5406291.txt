Evaluation of custom value is the core of customer relationship management of power grid enterprises. Traditional evaluation index is too complex and difficult to be used when the amount of power customer is great. Therefore, it is necessary to construct a power customer value evaluation system to solve the problem. This paper firstly studied the design principles and implementation method of an information system of power customer value evaluation, and proposed an evaluation model based on the current marketing data of the power grid enterprises. Then the data structure of the system was designed and the evaluation algorithm was analyzed. Finally, the implementation and application of the system was introduced. It is proved that the result of power customer value evaluated by this system would be objective, dynamic and flexible.

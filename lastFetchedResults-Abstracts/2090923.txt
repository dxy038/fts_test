This study proposes a self-adaptive GA-aided multi-objective ecological reservoir operation model (SMEROM) and applies it to water quality management in the Xiangxi River near to the Three Gorges Reservoir, China. The SMEROM integrates statistical water quality models, multi-objective reservoir operations, and a self-adaptive GA within a general framework. Among them, the statistical water quality models of the Xiangxi River are formulated to deal with the relationships between reservoir operation and water quality, which are embedded in constraints of the SMEROM. The multiple objective functions, including maximizing hydropower generation, minimizing loss of flood control, minimizing rate of flood risk, maximizing the average remaining capacity of flood control and maximizing the benefit of shipping, are considered simultaneously to obtain comprehensive benefit among the environment, society and economy. The weighting method is employed to convert the multiple objectives to a single objective. To solve the complex SMEROM, an improved self-adaptive GA is employed through incorporating simulated binary crossover and self-adaptive mutation. To demonstrate the advantage of the developed SMEROM model, the solutions through ecological reservoir operation are compared with those through the traditional reservoir operation and the practical operation in 2011, in terms of water quality, reservoir operation and objective function values. The results show that most of benefit in the ecological operation is better than that in the traditional or practical operations except for the hydropower benefit and loss benefit of flood control. This is because flood control and environmental protection are reasonably considered in the ecological operation.

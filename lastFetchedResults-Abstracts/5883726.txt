The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the validity of the use of sensibility parameters as a low computational cost tool to implement service restoration in medium voltage distribution networks. A linearization of the relationship between accumulated powers - active and reactive - in a node and the voltages of all nodes can be carried out by means of sensitivity parameters, in order to determine the influence in voltages, caused by variations in powers in the network nodes as intending supply restoration of loads. The validity of this analysis tool is made comparing it with the restoration/reconfiguration classical methods that uses either a constructive process or an opening process of mesh. It was observed that the service restoration by the use of sensitivity parameters normally presents a very small number of complete calculations of load flow when compared with the classical methods, in addition to a significant reduction in the switching operations, with obvious advantages in the time of restoration, and in the rates of network reliability.

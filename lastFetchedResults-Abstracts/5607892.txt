While many organisations are interested in adopting agile methods suitable to their local circumstances, there is little guidance available on how to do so. To address this important issue, we have developed an agile software process lifecycle management framework (APLM). The APLM framework is intended for use by agile coaches, managers and consultants to facilitate the integration of agile practices into both software project development environments. This paper presents the outcomes of an empirical evaluation of the APLM framework that has been conducted by involving a practitioners´ group composed of fourteen experienced agile experts from industry. The main objective of this empirical study is to determine to what extent each component of the agile process lifecycle management (APLM) framework is relevant, valuable and sufficient to achieve its purpose from an industry practitioner´s perspective.

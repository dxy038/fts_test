High throughput is required in many tasks, especially real-time applications. A logical structure of a parallel computing system for such applications is a pipeline of multiprocessor modules to be referred to as PMM. In this paper, a linear array based realization of PMM, referred to as PMMLA (PMM based on Linear Array) is proposed. The main design objective is to achieve uncompromised performance by a compact and flexible hardware structure. This paper describes the organization and operation of a PMMLA, analyzes its performance in detail, and compares it to other possible implementations theoretically and via emulation on nCUBE/2

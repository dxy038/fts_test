The optimization on traffic count location is the primary technique of traffic information collection system (TICS). At present, almost all the traffic count location models just consider single objective that is either the number of counts or number of ODs. But in the real world, there are more than one objective that we should concern, such as quality and quantity. In this paper, on the basis of MPRE, we deduced OD covering rule and minimum path number rule. After that, we established two-stage multi-objective model. At the first stage, we optimize the number of counts and number of ODs simultaneously, and at the second stage, we try to find the equilibrium solution between maximum volume and minimum path number. We developed one count location software (demo) based on multi-objective model and multi-objective GA algorithm and the real road network of Lujiazui CBD in Shanghai as example was given at last.

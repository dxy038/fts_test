Instrumentation on Space Station Freedom will require an accurate, isolated, and low-powered method of measuring high-DC currents. The magnetic current sensor presented here was created under the guidance of the NASA Lewis Research Center and is dependable, stable over time and temperature, and lightweight. Flexible topology allows the design of a pin-programmable hybrid package that contains analog and digital circuitry necessary for both bidirectional and unidirectional current sensing

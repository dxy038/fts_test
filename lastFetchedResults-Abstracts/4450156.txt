An approach to automatic display testing called the display test system (DTS) is described. Spatial, spectral, and luminescent properties of displays can be tested automatically and under computer control. The DTS uses test program sets to accommodate a wide variety of displays for military, medical, computer, and consumer applications. The system incorporates a charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor to combine the functions of photomasking and intensity measurement. The CCD sensor also provides a very-high-resolution capability and is rugged and reliable due to its solid-state construction. The overall system design provides accurate and objective testing for current avionics displays. It supports future technology insertion in the areas of video generation and CCD sensing and will support in situ testing of military displays at the operational level

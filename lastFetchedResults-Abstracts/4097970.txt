The main objective of this study is to test in vivo a small-size dual-band implantable antenna operating in Medical Implant Communications Service (MICS) (402405 MHz) and Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) (2.42.48 GHz) bands and to investigate the effects of live tissue on the antenna performance. To do so, we have designed and fabricated three identical antennas that were surgically implanted into rats at Mississippi State UniversityÂ´s (MSU) College of Veterinary Medicine. X-ray images are also taken to ensure the proper placement of the antenna within the body. Results regarding return loss measurements and the performance change of the antenna are presented. We have also investigated possible candidate materials that can be used for encasing of the antenna for biocompatibility.

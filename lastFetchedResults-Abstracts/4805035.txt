In this paper we present results obtained from more than two years continuous very low frequency (VLF) measurements between a network of VLF transmitters and receivers. The focus is on VLF amplitude and phase variations in the Earth lithosphere-ionosphere cavity with the scientific objective to characterise long term trends possibly related to planetary waves and climatological factors. After considering the nominal diurnal and seasonal behaviour of the individual paths in the VLF waveguide, we distinguish between natural and artifical disturbances on different temporal and spatial scales. We conclude that it is too early to speak of a clear trend, but VLF investigations together with complementary measurements can be a useful tool in long term environmental and climatological studies on medium spatial scales.

A utility-type, 20-kHz, AC power distribution system for the space station employing resonant power-conversion techniques is presented. The system converts raw DC voltage from photovoltaic cells or three-phase, low-frequency AC voltage from a solar dynamic generator into a regulated, 20-G kHz AC voltage for distribution among various loads. Operations of the components of the system such as driver inverter, DC receiver, bidirectional receiver, and three-phase AC receiver are discussed. EASY5 computer modeling and simulations were performed to study the local and global performance of the system. Simulation results show that the system has fast response and good transient behavior. The AC bus voltage is effectively regulated using the phase-control scheme, which is demonstrated with both line and load variations. The feasibility of paralleling the outputs of driver modules is illustrated with the driver modules synchronized and sharing a common feedback loop. A high-frequency, sinusoidal AC voltage is generated in the three-phase, AC input case, when the driver modules are phased 120&#176; away from one another and their outputs are connected in series

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Access to the intravascular system for administration of fluids, medications, blood products and hemodynamic monitoring is the most common invasive method. These therapies are not without defect and have numerous side effects that most common side effect is phlebitis; the goal of this study was the comparison of 2% Nitroglycerin ointment and 2% Chlorhexidine solution effect in preventing catheter-related phlebitis.
METHODS: This study is a randomized controlled trial. One hundred patients selected from the cardiology department and CCU. The subjects were divided randomly into two groups (50 in each group). Location of the catheter was disinfected by Chlorhexidine solution and in another group by alcohol and Nitroglycerin ointment. Then two groups were assessed for signs of phlebitis every 12 hours up to 72 hours. In the distal portion of the catheter in alcohol and 2% Nitroglycerin ointment group after disinfecting, 1.5 cm of ointment was applied. The dressing was replaced and the catheter site every 12 hours was assessed. (IRCT: 201304077494N5)
FINDINGS: There was no significant difference between the incidence of phlebitis in 2% Chlorhexidine and 2% Nitroglycerin group in 72 hours, but there was a significant difference between the incidence of phlebitis in two groups in 48 hours (p=0.014). Twenty two percent in the Nitroglycerin group had phlebitis. The grade percentage of phlebitis among patients was 18% (9 patients) grade 2, and 4% (2 patients) grade 3. Thirty two percent in the chlorhexidine group (16 patients) had phlebitis and the grade percentage of phlebitis among patients was 2% (1 case) one grade, 14% (7 cases) 2 grade, 16% (8 patients) 3 grade.  
CONCLUSION: Based on these results, the use of topical 2% nitroglycerin ointment and 2% chlorhexidine solution to reduce venous catheter-related phlebitis is recommended. However using 2% nitroglycerin ointment is more effective.

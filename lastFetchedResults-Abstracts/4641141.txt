This paper highlights the simulation using cyclic codes in order to identify the effect of two types of noise which are additive white Gaussian noise and multipath Rayleigh fading to a communication system. The main objective is to know which communication channel is better, a communication channel with AWGN or a communication channel with multipath Rayleigh fading. Modulation technique used in this simulation is quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK). Noise reduction and information message recovery are the important aspect in designing a communication system instead of speed and accuracy in transmitting the information. Matlab Version 7.1 is used to simulate the system. The model consists of transmitter, transmission channel and receiver. The messages are encoded and decoded using cyclic codes. The system also provides error detection and correction using forward error correction (FEC)

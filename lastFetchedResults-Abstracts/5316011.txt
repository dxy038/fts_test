Control parameter settings influence the convergence probability and convergence speed of evolutionary algorithms but it is often not obvious how to choose them. In this work an adaptive approach for setting the control parameters of a multi-objective differential evolution algorithm is presented. The adaptive approach is based on methods from design of experiments, so it is able to detect significant performance differences of individual parameters as well as interaction effects between parameters. It is evaluated based on 13 test functions and several performance measures.

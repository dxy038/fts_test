In this paper we present a strategic approach for energy management of distributed electric resources in low-voltage networks with special consideration of services for the distribution system operator (DSO). A system comprising Bidirectional Energy Management Interfaces (BEMIs) developed and tested at ISET, carrying out decentralized decisions and grid supervision is introduced. The paper presents operational states and possible applications of the proposed system in the distribution grid as well as a simulation designed for researching the system´s behaviour. Finally first results are given on the simulation-based development of an algorithm implementing a new approach for incentive-based voltage control, which is one of the system´s advanced applications.

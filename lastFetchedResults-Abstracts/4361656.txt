The paper describes an experimental architecture for &#8220;ECE 300:Intermediate design,&#8221; a required junior- and senior-level course for all branches of engineering within the college of engineering and applied sciences, at ASU. ECE 300 is designated a &#8220;L1&#8221; course whose central objective is to induce critical inquiry. The course has been found to be highly successful, the evidence being the exceptional quality of the final projects, most of which are potentially patentable, unique and innovative answers to real-world design challenges in midterm and final exams, and the undeniably strong feelings of accomplishment reported by the students through anonymous feedback

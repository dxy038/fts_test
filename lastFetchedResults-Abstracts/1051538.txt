The objective of the present experimental work was to investigate the influence of substrate surface roughness and coating thickness on the friction and wear behaviour of AISI 440C steel-coated with MoST under pure sliding with oil lubrication. An AISI 52100 bearing steel ball was slid at 0.5 m/s against the coated steel disc using an applied normal load of 50 N. This gave a mean Hertzian pressure of 0.75 GPa. Friction and wear maps were constructed from the experimental data. Wear resistance was greatest when a coating thickness of 1 μm was used and when the substrate surface roughness (Ra) was 0.1 μm or below.

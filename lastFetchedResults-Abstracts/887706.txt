The objective of this study was used a model to predict the growth process and derive growth parameters in green gram. For this aim, three models of growth include beta, gompertz and Richards was use. These models were suitable to indicate for the sigmoid pattern of determinate growth. Gompertz and beta models have three parameters, while Richards function has additional parameter to describe growth kinetics. The Richards function is flexible in describing asymmetrical sigmoid patterns and because of this, it use to predict dry matter in plant. Against the Richards function, parameters of beta and gompertz equations are numerically stable in statistical estimation. In base of results of this study, revealed that Richardâ€™s growth model fitted the dry matter and age data of green gram very well with coefficient of determination estimates that were 99.93%, that this value indicated the correct fitness of the model. However, each of the models (Richards, beta, Gompertz) provided exact estimating of growth process in green gram. Also average growth rate was arrived at 0.058 gr. Moreover value of dry matter and age at inflection stage (equal high crop growth rate) were 58 day after planting and 285.8 g/m2, respectively. By Characterizing the growth process in a valuable strategy could be used to selectively breed program.

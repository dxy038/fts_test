The objective of this work is to design and test a digital multi-electrode acquisition system for use in geophysical investigations utilizing direct current electrical (geoelectric) methods. The system is a 64-electrode modular system, which utilizes field electrodes with individual wires that lead back to a digital switch box and then to a data acquisition instrument (Iris Syscal R2). The electronic design allows for different arrays or geometrical switching configurations of the field electrodes in order to allow for rapid data reading and yield essentially real-time results. Additionally, the electronic switch box has the capability to be connected in series to similar switch boxes and, therefore, has the ability to switch between an unlimited number of electrodes. The acquisition control software, developed as an interface for the hardware, controls operation of both the digital switch box and the resistivity acquisition instrument

In this paper we study the effect of human blockage on a new cellular architecture that incorporates millimeter wave technology for the access link. Assumptions, methodology, and simulation results are discussed to analyze the effect of human blockage on this type of deployment. A statistical model for human blockage and self blockage of the millimeter wave (mmW) signal is presented and analyzed. Our simulations show that even with a simple modulation scheme, an average network throughput of 400 Gbps/km2 is achieved. The objective is to propose and demonstrate that such an architecture is capable of providing high throughput services to outdoor users even in heavily crowded areas.

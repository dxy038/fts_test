Abstract
Objective
The Freeman-Sheldon syndrome is a rare congenital myopathy and dysplasia,
in which fibrotic contractures of the facial muscles result in the characteristic
“whistling face”. Difficulties with intubation may be attributed in part to
microstomia and micrognathia. In addition to other deformities, limb myopathy
results in ulnar flexion contractures of the hand and equinovarus/valgus
deformities of the feet. Intravenous access may be difficult because of limb
deformities and thickened subcutaneous tissues. Limbs may be encased in
plaster casts or splints limiting the available sites for venepuncture. The authors
report with a review of literature the case of an infant with Freeman-Sheldon
syndrome, which his characteristics was mentioned above.

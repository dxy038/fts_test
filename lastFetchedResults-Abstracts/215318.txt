The role of gas turbine power plants in electrical energy production has been considerably increased
in the last two to three decades. Various methods have been proposed to improve the performance of gas turbine
cycles. In this research, two methods, a reheat cycle and a cycle with a reheat and a recuperator, were investigated and
compared with a simple cycle. The main objective of this paper is to study the performance of an simple cycle and
reheat cycle under actual conditions. In this regard, all processes are treated as actual, and in particular a relatively
simple and reliable approach is used to predict the amount of cooling air. The results obtained on the basis of a model
developed for this research show that reheating in the context of a realistic study may lead to an improvement both in
efficiency and in specific net work using recuperator cause to decrease NOx emission

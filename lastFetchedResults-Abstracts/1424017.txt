Metabolic pathway analysis aims at discovering and analyzing meaningful routes and their interactions in metabolic networks. A major difficulty in applying this technique lies in the decomposition of metabolic flux distributions into elementary mode or extreme pathway activity patterns, which in general is not unique. We propose a network reduction approach based on the decomposition of a set of flux vectors representing adaptive microbial metabolic behavior in bioreactors into a minimal set of shared pathways. Several optimality criteria from the literature were compared in order to select the most appropriate objective function. We further analyze photoautotrophic metabolism of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii growing in a photobioreactor under maximal growth rate conditions. Key pathways involved in its adaptive metabolic response to changes in light influx are identified and discussed using an energetic approach.

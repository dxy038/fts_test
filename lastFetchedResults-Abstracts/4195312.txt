Grid networks take advantage of the resources available by many computers connected within the network to solve large-scale computational problems. To achieve a scalable and reliable Grid network system, the workload needs to be efficiently distributed among the computing resources accessible on the network. Therefore, a distributed and scalable load-balancing scheme for Grid Networks is proposed in this paper. Another objective of this paper is to develop a latency reduction workload distribution protocol for Grid networks. Here, we demonstrate that introducing a latency reduction factor in the random sampling can reduce the effects of communication latency in the Grid network environment. Simulation results show that the resulted network system provides an effective, scalable, and reliable load-balancing scheme for the distributed resources available on Grid networks.

Background
Burn patients are at risk for acquiring infection because of their destroyed skin barrier and suppressed immune system, compounded by prolonged hospitalization and invasive therapeutic and diagnostic procedures. Most studies on infection in burn patients focus on burn wound infection, whereas other nosocomial infections in this patient group are not described well.
Objective

This study attempts to assess the incidence of nosocomial infection in the Ghotbeddin burn center of Shiraz.
Methods

The study was conducted prospectively during a period of 11 months from December 2000 to November 2001. All patients presenting with no signs and symptoms of infection within the first 48 hours of admission were included and examined for detecting 4 types of nosocomial infection: burn infection, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and bloodstream infection. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system criteria were applied.
Results

One hundred six female patients met the inclusion criteria. Ninety-one (85.8%) acquired at least 1 infection (44.7 per 1000 patient-days), including 91 with burn infection, 28 with urinary tract infection, 56 with pneumonia, and 30 with bloodstream infection, which gives 446.7, 137.5, and 275, and 147.3 infections per 1000 patient-days, respectively.
Conclusions

Considering the high incidence of nosocomial infections in our center, implementation of improved infection control practices and policies is required, and a comprehensive education campaign for all health care workers is urgently needed.

Virtual view synthesis is the key technology of the current Three-dimensional Video applications and future Free Viewpoint Television. And virtual viewpoint synthesis based on depth image by using two adjacent reference two-dimensional viewpoint color images and corresponding depth images to render the intermediate view is the most potential algorithm for virtual view rendering. First, a modified algorithm proposed which is based on DIBR aimed at solving visibility and resampling problems occurred after the process of three-dimensional warping in DIBR. Second, based on this algorithm, a symmetric bidirectional expansion algorithm was developed which could effectively remove the artifacts of the virtual view image and the presented visual perception was in good performance. Last, the corresponding image fusion algorithm was put forward to improve the PSNR performance. Theoretical analysis and a series of experiments show that the proposed method can generate eventual virtual viewpoint image with high subjective and objective quality.

This paper presents an improved power quality bidirectional voltage source converter (VSC) fed permanent magnet brushless DC motor (PMBLDCM) drive. The single-phase bidirectional VSC is a pulse width-modulated (PWM) rectifier. It ensures unity power factor operation at supply terminals under wide speed variations of PMBLDCM with minimum total harmonic distortion (THD) of AC supply current. A three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI) is used as an electronic commutator for a three-phase small rating PMBLDCM. The PMBLDCM is controlled in the current controlled mode to achieve desired performance. The proposed improved power quality PMBLDCM drive is designed, modeled and simulated. The performance of PMBLDCM drive with improved power quality converter is demonstrated under speed and load perturbations.

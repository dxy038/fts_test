Abstract

Objective

We aimed to find the prognostic factors to detect the patients who fail the treatment of epilepsy, in the early stages of the disease.

Materials & Methods

This study was done on the epileptic patients attending the Neurology Clinic of Mofid Children’s Hospital, Tehran, Iran from September 2013 to October 2014. After defining the criteria for exclusion and inclusion, the patients were divided to two groups based on responding to the medical treatment for their epilepsy and indices were recorded for all the patients to be used in the statistical analyses.

Results

The patients’ age ranged from 1 to 15 yr. There was 188 patients with refractory seizure in group 1 (experimental group) and 178 patient with well controlled seizure in group 2(control group).There was a significant different between serum drug level in both groups and patients with refractory seizure group had a lower serum drug level than control group. In both groups tonic-clonic was the most common type of seizure. Also the prevalence of brain imaging Abnormalityand other neurologic disorders was significantly higher in patients with refractory seizure in compare with control group.

Conclusion

Children with seizure who suffer from refractory epilepsy need more attention and exact observation by the medical staff.

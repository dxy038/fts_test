Objective: To determine if propofol-MCT/LCTpremixed with lignocaine as well as given alone is effective in reducing pain on injection. Material and Methods: Three hundred American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II patients listed for different elective procedures were randomized to three groups of 100 patients each. Group A received Diprivan® a long-chain triglyceride preparation (LCT-propofol) premixed with lignocaine (i.e., 2 ml of 1% lignocaine in 20 ml of propofol). Group B receivedPropofol-Lipuro® (MCT/LCT-propofol) premixed with 2 ml normal saline, and group C received Propofol-Lipuro® (MCT/LCT-propofol) premixed with lignocaine (2 ml of 1% lignocaine in 20 ml of propofol). Anaesthesia was standardized in all the three groups. Undiluted Diprivan® (LCT-propofol) and Propofol-Lipuro® (MCT/LCT-propofol) were used for induction of anaesthesia and subjects were questioned about discomfort until contact was lost. Discomfort was recorded as none, mild, moderate or severe. Results: Frequency of pain was 26 % in group A (16% mild, 06% moderate and 04% severe pain). In group B frequency of pain was 28 %( 22% mild, 06% moderate and none severe pain), and in group C only 05 % patients felt mild pain. None of them had moderate or severe pain. The p-\alue was 0.000007 in Group C Vs A, 0.000027 in Group C Vs Band 0.436782 in Group B Vs A Conclusion: The addition of lignocaine to MCT/LCT propofol significantly reduced the incidence of pain on injection compared to LCT-propofol with lignocaine p-value 0.000027 and MCT/LCT-propofol alone. Propofol MCT/LCT alone does not provide any advantage to reduce pain on injection in comparison to propofol MCT/LCT premixed with lignocaine.

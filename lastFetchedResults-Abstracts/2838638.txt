One of the main challenges in cloud computing is to increase the availability of computational resources, while minimizing system power consumption and operational expenses. This article introduces a power efficient resource allocation algorithm for tasks in cloud computing data centers. The developed approach is based on genetic algorithms which ensure performance and scalability to millions of tasks. Resource allocation is performed taking into account computational and networking requirements of tasks and optimizes task completion time and data center power consumption. The evaluation results, obtained using a dedicated open source genetic multi-objective framework called jMetal show that the developed approach is able to perform the static allocation of a large number of independent tasks on homogeneous single-core servers within the same data center with a quadratic time complexity.

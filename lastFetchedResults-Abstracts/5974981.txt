Genetic algorithm (GA) is an important method of multi-objective optimization. The method is introduced that using GA optimizes PPF parameters in this thesis. Distributed generation (DG) is a hot spot nowadays, but the harmonic pollution isnÂ´t ignored when DG is connected with the power grid through power converters. First discuss several harmonic suppression methods have been adopted in practice, such as increasing the pulse number of converter, using pulse width modulation (PWM) converter, passive power filter (PPF) equipment, active power filter (APF) equipment and so on, among these hybrid type combining PPF and APF is the most economical and effective method, so hybrid type equipment is applied to suppress harmonics that are brought by grid- connected DG. From three respects of the cost, the DG penetration power and the total harmonic distortion (THD), using GA optimizes the PPF parameters, namely R, L, C, optimization results make the PPF cost is the most economical, the DG penetration power is the largest and the THD is the smallest, simulation shows this method is effective.

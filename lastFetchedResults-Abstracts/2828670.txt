This paper presents an integrated modulation scheme based on the chaos theory, which is implemented on the bidirectional power interface for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems. The energy is frequently exchanged between the electric vehicle (EV) and the power grid in V2G systems, where the conventional power electronic conversion technique is evitable to increase the complexity of the electromagnetic environment. As a result, the performance of electronic devices equipped inside EVs is deteriorated or even impaired. Meanwhile, the conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) issue is significantly harmful to the power quality in the medium-voltage grid. Then, the presented scheme is implemented on the bidirectional power interface by utilizing the random-like-but-bounded chaotic sequence, which is aiming to reduce the conducted EMI, thereby improving the electromagnetic working environment inside EVs as well as the power supply quality of the grid. The computational simulation is conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed chaotic modulation scheme.

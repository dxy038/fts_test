The paper investigates temperature stability of different overvoltage protection components used in low voltage applications: transient suppresser diodes (TSD), metal-oxide varistors (MOV), gas filled surge arresters (GFSA) and polycarbon capacitors. The objective of presented research is to identify the effectiveness of the overvoltage protection as a function of temperature. Experimental results proved that GFSA have very stable operational characteristics in wide temperature range (-90/spl deg/C to +21/spl deg/C). MOV show certain improvement of their protective characteristics at elevated temperatures. Experimental results are supported by theoretical explanations.

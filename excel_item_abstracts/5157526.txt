Here we present a system for digital control of rate-integrating or rate gyroscopes using commercial signal processing hardware. The proposed system, with minimal analog interface hardware and the software and firmware, can seamlessly switch between rate and rate-integrating modes of a rate-integrating capable gyroscope, or operate closed or open loop rate modes for a non-RIG. The control system implements effective amplitude, quadrature and steering control of rate-integrating gyroscopes with a delay of 7ms, and provides a platform for introducing new compensation methods for rate-integrating gyroscopes.

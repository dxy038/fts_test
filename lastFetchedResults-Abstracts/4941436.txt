An imaging system at 600 GHz has been constructed with the objective of providing a platform for exploration across a range of THz imaging applications. These applications include imaging concealed structures through plastic and paper based packaging, imaging of water content in leaves, and non-destructive testing. The active system uses a commercially available source and superconducting detectors developed by the authors. The detectors and results obtained by the system will be presented.

In this paper, we consider Quality-of-Information (QoI) aware transmission policies for a dynamic environment. In particular, we focus on the time-varying nature of the observation quality of the environment in practical networks which leads to uncertainty in satisfying QoI requirements specified by end users. The goal of this paper is to meet QoI requests from end users with minimum resources. Specifically, power is allocated dynamically depending on observation accuracies and QoI requirements. We formulate a dynamic scheme for scheduling with the objective of minimizing the energy consumption at the network while satisfying constraints on outage probability for QoI. Lyapunov stability arguments are used to define a policy based on the instantaneous observation qualities and QoI requirement satisfaction levels. Numerical results demonstrate that significant improvements in delivered QoI are realized with identical power expenditure using our QoI-aware resource allocation algorithm compared with traditional maximum-rate schedulers.

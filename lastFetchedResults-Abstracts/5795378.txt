Summary form only given. LOGISCOPE performs a fast and consistent source code analysis in a wide variety of languages to produce graphic aids and complexity metrics which can drastically reduce both time and error in gaining an understanding of unfamiliar source code. Although it does not presume to define `good´ or `bad´ in an environment, LOGISCOPE does provide the objective primitive information which allows one to do so. Once a definition is arrived at, LOGISCOPE provides the means of rapidly and consistently evaluating compliance with one´s own definitions. It also provides test path coverage analysis as a means of reducing testing effort while improving its effectiveness

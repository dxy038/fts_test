One finger zen push is one of the massage manipulation skill. In this paper, through the study of the characteristic rule of one finger zen push massage experts´ pressure distribution data, the one finger zen push massage evaluation scheme based on the data is presented. That is when the expert is conducting one finger zen push massage method, the real-time acquisition of the massager´s force information on the basis of time such as intensity of pressure, action area and distribution data is being done. Then by analyzing the massager´s action frequency, uniformity degree and pressure degree reflected by the pressure distribution data, the massager´s skill is assessed and also can be corrected. The experiment results showed that there was significant difference between the teachers and the students, and the mechanical features of one finger zen push manipulation were summarized and the objective quantitative indexes and scientific expressions for it was provided.

In this paper, we design grid-based routing (GBR) protocols for wireless multi-hop networks. The objective is to effectively reduce the protocol overhead for network management with the assistance of position information. GBR divides networks into equally spaced grids. To perform a routing operation, GBR requires as few grids as possible to participate while preserving network connectivity. We design different protocols for different environments and deduce analytical results to observe the high performance of the designed protocols.

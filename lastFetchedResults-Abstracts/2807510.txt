This paper presents a study developed about variable speed wind turbine system based on doubly fed twin stator induction machine (DFTSIG). In this paper we discuss the different architectures of the cascaded DFTSIG, in the case of direct coupling and indirect coupling. The wind generators modeling and control are presented; we have chosen a model with direct oriented vector control to ordering the power exchange between the machine stator controlled via a bidirectional converter. This control is developed and tested by synthesizing proportional integrator regulator.

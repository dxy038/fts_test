BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Increase of blood pressure is from prevalent disorders that can increase maternal and fetal-neonatal morbidity and mortality. The aim of the study was to survey the effect of prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) on the development of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia.

METHODS: This case-control study was performed on 200 pregnant women referred to maternity of Qaem Hospital related to Mashhad University in 2007. According to body mass index, the patients were divided into four groups (50 in each group) including gestational hypertension group, mild preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia and control group. Blood pressure, height and weight of pregnant women were measured carefully and BMI was calculated and then compared with prepregnancy BMI.

FINDINGS In control group mean BMI before pregnancy was 24±3 kg/m2 and in gestational hypertension group was 26.1±5.4 and in mild preeclampsia group was 26±1 kg/m2 and in severe preeclampsia group was 26±4.1 kg/m2. There was a significant difference between prepregnancy BMI and three other groups. (p<0.05). CONCLUSION According to the relationship between prepregnancy BMI and gestational hypertension and severe preeclampsia, we can suggest the women who have intended to be pregnant and have high weight that with the decrease of the prepregnancy weight can reduce mortality and morbidity in pregnancy.

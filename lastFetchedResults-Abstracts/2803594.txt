Online mentoring is nowadays become popular because it can be used in various applications. Particularly in education area, the mentoring generally means the interactions between the teachers as the mentors and the students as the mentees. In order to work together successfully, this paper believes that not only some common attributes between the mentor and the mentee are required but also some compatible different attributes. This paper thus proposes the attributes for online monitoring model named compatible different attributes. There are 2 sets of compatible different attributes including mentee and mentor attributes. Both sets are represented in different size of matrix elements. The objective of this paper is thus to study to which extent the proposed compatible different attributes can be used for online mentoring model. The empirical study is conducted with 74 lectures and 588 students from Faculty of Information and Technology, Rajabhat Maha Sarakham University. They are asked to complete the survey questionnaire to obtain the satisfaction value. Consequently, the satisfaction results show that the proposed attributes can reasonably be used for online monitoring model.

many attempts have been made by the researchers to find new compounds as a substitute for non-effective antibiotics. Compounds and extracts of the plants could be part of these substitutes.
Objective: In vitro investigation of antibacterial properties of aques-and alcoholic extracts of lavandula stoechas on clinical and standard strains of staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli.
Methods: The compounds of the plant were extracted by distillation method. The antibacterial property of the extracts were investigated by tube dilution method in broth media. By using different concentrations of the extracts, MIC and MBC were determined. In disc diffusion method, the mean diameter of growth inhibition zones on agar media were determined by preparing discs from defined concentrations.
Findings: Certain concentrations of the extracts showed significant antibacterial effect on the strains. Extracts with 20 mg concentration showed defined growth inhibitory effect and 30 mg concentration showed both inhibitory and bacteriocidal effects on all of the given bacteria. Conclusion: Since some of concentrations of the extracts showed significant antibacterial activity on given bacteria, more studies on the plant in future, provides more information regarding probable substitution of that for current antibiotics.

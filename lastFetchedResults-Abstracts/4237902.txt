The present work analyses a layered depth-image-based-rendering algorithm based on possible errors occurring with perspective 3D warping. The outcome is improvements to the algorithm that treats depth reliably for scenes containing several levels of foreground objects. The filling of holes of different kinds is addressed so that results have better visual quality. The analysis compares the results of the algorithm with a reference algorithm for the potential error types, and visual examples exhibit the consequences of the improvements. Different objective metrics give ambiguous results, which may be explained by the reduction of structure caused by the reference algorithm.

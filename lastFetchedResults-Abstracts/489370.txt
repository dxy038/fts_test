Introduction: Menarcheal age is an important event in human life and is influenced by various genetic, demographic, socio-economic and inviromental factors. Limited current data shows controversy regarding the effect of antropometric and biochemical variables on age of menarche and the related factors among Iranian girls. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect of antropometric,demographic and serum lipoproteins on the age of menarche. Materials & Methods: in the present descriptive study, we enrolled 370 girls aged 10-16 year, from the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS), whose menstruation had begun 6 months prior to the study. Results:The mean age of menarche, weight, height, waist circumference and body mass index were 12.6±1.1 years, 53.7 ±10.5kg, 157.3±5.5cm, 72.5 +9.8cm and 21.7 ±3.9 kg/m2, respectively. Although there were statistically significant relationships between age of menarche and body mass index, height, waist circumference and level of mother's education, there was no significat correlation between menarcheal age and weight or serum lipoprotiens. Conclusion: Serum lipoprotiens were not found to have any influence on the menarcheal age in girls.

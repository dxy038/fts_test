The objective of this paper is to investigate a methodology, which can extract approximate results for the free space radiation pattern from non-anechoic measurements. Using an impulse response both in the time and angular domains of the non-anechoic measurement environment, the free space pattern of the device under test is estimated. Simulated data has been used to illustrate the applicability of this new methodology and its improved performance over the conventional FFT-based methods.

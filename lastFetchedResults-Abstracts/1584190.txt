The multitasking performance of a distributed server system is considered where the workload is variable. Time varying distributions are proposed for job arrival, job parallelism, and task service demand. A simulation model is used to address performance issues associated with task scheduling. The objective is to identify conditions that produce good overall system performance, while maintaining fairness of individual job execution times. Simulated results show that all task scheduling methods have merit. In all cases, the best policy depends on performance goals. Furthermore, although the paper studies distributed multiprocessor system performance, it also addresses the performance issues of other systems where multitasking and scheduling is used, since no restrictions are imposed on the server/job/task characteristics.

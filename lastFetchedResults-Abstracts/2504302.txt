Background: Recently different studies suggested that discontinuation of
gonadotrophin releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) at beginning of ovarian
stimulation (improvement of ovarian response to gonadotrophins) may have some
benefit to poor responder patients in invitro fertilization (IVF) cycles.
Objective:The efficacy of GnRHa stop protocol in poor responder patients in IVF
cycles was assessed.
Materials and Methods: This study was a prospective, randomized controlled trial that
40 poor responder patients (less than three mature follicles in a previous cycle) with
normal basal follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) were randomly allocated into two
protocols: 1) Non-stop protocol: long GnRHa suppression, and start gonadotrophins
from day 3 of mense. 2) Stop-protocol: GnRHa is stopped with the onset of menses,
and gonadotrophin doses remained similar to group 1.
Results: A significantly higher number of follicles, oocytes, embryos and fertilization
rate also shorter stimulation days and lower human menopausal gonadotropins (HMG)
ampoules were recorded in the stop protocol compared to the control group. Both
protocols resulted in a similar cancellation rate, pregnancy rate, estradiol level and LH
level.
Conclusion: Early follicular cessation of GnRHa permitted the retrieval of a
significantly higher number of follicles, oocytes and embryos, and can reduce the
number of HMG and stimulation days.

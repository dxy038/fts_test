This paper proposes a new error concealment method in which an improved bidirectional motion copy method is developed to conceal entire frames lost in video transmission. Also an overlapped block motion compensation technique is employed to reduce blocking artifacts in the concealed frames. The simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve a PSNR of 2.21dB higher than the conventional motion copy method and of up to 2.56dB higher than conventional motion vector extrapolation methods.

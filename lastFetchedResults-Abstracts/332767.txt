Objective
A systematic review of clinical trials has been performed to evaluate the reproducibility of manual (MP) and electronic probes (EP) in the measurement of clinical periodontal attachment level (AL) in untreated periodontitis subjects.
Methods

Systematic electronic (PubMed Medline and Latin American and Caribbean Health Science—LILACS literature databases) and hand searches (English, Spanish and Portuguese languages; search terms “periodontitis diagnosis”, “clinical attachment level measurements”, “clinical attachment level detection”, “clinical diagnosis of periodontitis”, “manual probe”, “electronic probe”, “periodontitis or periodontal disease or attachment level or clinical attachment level”) were performed to identify clinical trials involving CAL measurements, MP and EP in untreated periodontitis subjects. Quality and external validity were determined for selected studies.
Results

The initial search identified 37 articles. Ten studies met the initial eligibility, but eight were excluded after thorough analysis. The results from those two selected studies showed that the average variance and the absolute mean difference of CAL measurements for both types of probes cannot be considered different.
Conclusion

“Based on this systematic review, MP and EP probes showed a tendency to have similar reliability in the measurement of CAL in untreated periodontitis subjects when used by a calibrated examiner. However, this finding is not supported by strong evidence.

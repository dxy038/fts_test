The aim of process control has been to control heating of steel tubes in front of roll-mill. Equal temperatures along 17m length steel tubes have been required. The temperature of charge direct to measure was not possible in reheating furnace from objective reasons. The temperature of combustion products in reheating furnace has been direct measured. Simulation model of reheating furnaces was used for development of control system. First simulations shown that is necessary to change construction of furnaces and the localization of burners. The proposal of creating burnerÂ´s zone was done by simulation likewise. This way is well-know as a cooperation of design construction conditions by automation equipments. The control system consists of two levels. First stabilization level is based on algorithm bang-bang control. Second level adapts required values for first level on principle direct measured temperatures of charge outside furnace. The idea of control system was verified by simulation.

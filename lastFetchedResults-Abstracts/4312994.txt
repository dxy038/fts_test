Network Neutrality is a concept that while not clearly defined, has generated great debate in many different venues such as economics, academia, law, the Internet industry and Congress, with both sides of the debate diametrically opposed. Currently, there is no neutral source that attempts to present the arguments of both sides without forming a definitive opinion. The objective of this paper is to explain these arguments from a truly neutral standpoint by collecting and analyzing both previous and current research, as well as governmental proceedings on the topic. The authors of this paper intend to take a neutral stand on the issue and properly explain the concepts that are encompassed in Network Neutrality, its pros and cons, and what others in the industry, the government and academia feel about the implications of network neutrality.

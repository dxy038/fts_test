The main objective of this study was to determine the influence of vermicompost and biostimulant on the growth and biomass in the coriander plant height, wet weight of plant ,dry weight of plant and biomass yield. The experiment was carried out as factorial experiment in the base of randomized complete blocks design with eight treatments and three replications at research field of Agriculture Company of Ran in Firouzkuh of iran in 2012 . The factors were Vermicompost in four levels (0, 3, 6 and 9 ton/ha) and biostimulant, mixture of Azotobacter chroococcum and Azospirillum lipoferum in two levels (non-inoculated and inoculated seeds). The present results have shown that the highest fresh weight of plant ,dry weight of plant and biomass yield were obtained after applying 9 ton/ha vermicompost. Biostimulant also showed significant effects on biomass yield. The maximum biomass yield were obtained by using the biostimulant  (inoculated seeds). The results also showed that the interaction of vermicompost and biostimulant were significant on fresh weight and dry weight of plant.

Objectives: To develop improved methods for objective assessment of daytime vigilance. This is important in the diagnosis and therapy control of sleep disorders associated with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS).
Methods: Twenty-one patients with EDS due to obstructive sleep apnea were recorded during a daytime 90 min reaction time (RT) test in a monotonous situation. Two EEG, two EOG and a submental EMG channel were recorded simultaneously. The recordings were divided into short, stationary segments of variable length (0.5–2 s) and classified into 7 stages using our previously described system, which includes additional stages for drowsiness.
Results: The duration of RT was linearly correlated to the vigilance state (P<0.05). The appearance of slow eye movements (SEM) was more consistently related to performance impairment than EEG changes.
Conclusions: Our system can provide a better tracking of vigilance changes than the standardized sleep stage scoring. A 1–2 h test is useful in the assessment of the performance of a subject suffering from EDS. We found that SEMs indicate more sensitive and consistent EDS-related performance impairment than changes in EEG activity.

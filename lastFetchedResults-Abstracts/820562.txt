The objective of the present study was to evaluate several chemical extractants to estimate available phosphorus (P) for bean growing in calcareous soils from Chaharmahal-Va-Bakhtiari province. The amount of available P was measured by Olsen, Colwell, ammonium bicarbonate-DTPA, 0.01 M calcium chloride, Bray?, ??, Mehlich ? and ?? extractants. In addition, soil organic P and total P were determined. A pot experiment consisting of a completely randomized design with three replications was conducted to evaluate the plant performance in association with chemical extractants. After the harvest, dry weight, P concentration and P uptake were determined. The results showed that the amount of extractable P decreased in the following order: Colwell >  Mehlich ?? >  Bray ?? >  Olsen >  Ammonium bicarbonate -DTPA >  Mehlich ? >  Bray ? >  0.01M Chloride calcium. Organic and total P and phosphorus extracted by Colwell, Olsen and Mehlich ?? methods correlated significantly with plant indices. In addition, the results of stepwise regression analysis showed that the organic P, Colwell and Olsen extractants could explain more variation in the indices of bean plant. The results of this research showed that Colwell, Olsen and Mehlich?? extractants could be used to estimate plant-available P in the studied calcareous soils.

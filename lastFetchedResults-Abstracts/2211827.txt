Knowing the behavior of thick-walled cylinders, due to their numerous applications is important. There are numerous relationships for cylinders and spheres containing explosives which have been found, based mainly on other experimental models. Hence, developing an analytical model of the behavior of structures under internal and high-rate loading, like explosion in the cylinders, is of great importance. The main objective of this paper is to derive a mathematical model of isotropic thick-walled aluminum cylinder containing TNT in which JWL equation of state is considered for behavior of explosive expansion. The present analysis is based on the Cowper-Symonds material model, in which strain rate at each moment is used for calculation of dynamic strength. Therefore, given the instantaneous explosive pressure boundary conditions as well as instantaneous strain rate and its impact on the dynamic strength of the material, is of significant technique in this paper. By employing equations of equilibrium in thick-walled cylinders, the equations of radial and circumferential stresses and radial velocities were derived. The instantaneous geometric and boundary conditions and corrected dynamic stress of material with respect to the strain rate used to calculate radial velocity through solving the differential equation of motion. After extraction of radial velocity, other stress equations will be evaluated. Furthermore, by considering the assumptions and in order to assess the overall results of the analytical modeling, computer simulation was done using Autodyn software, which shows good

The objective of this paper is to investigate performance of proportional-integral (PI) and fuzzy controllers for Shunt Active Power Filter (SAPF). Instantaneous reactive power theory (IRP) and synchronous reference frame theory (SRF) are used to generate reference current signals of SAPF. DC capacitor voltage is maintained constant using PI, Mamdani fuzzy and Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy controllers. Performance is analyzed using simulation of SAPF with IRP and SRF reference current generation methods with PI and fuzzy controllers. Fuzzy controller has better results compare to PI controller. TS fuzzy controller is required less number of fuzzy sets, rules and computational time compare to Mamdani fuzzy controller.

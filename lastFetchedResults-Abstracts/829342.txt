This paper is about the context for achieving “True happiness” in terms of controlling “Egocentrism” as one of the causes of individual and social problems and lack of proper attention to this important issue in urban planning, in general. Most of the urban environments which have been used to improve ethics in various forms, in terms of objective and subjective, are human-made and are experiencing the same problem that we are trying to solve. In order to find a region-free solution that is free of human influence, establishing meaningful relationships with natural phenomena of the cities have been proposed. Therefore, by correcting attitudes towards the natural environment and extending this to the community and personal world, we can take a step towards solving the problem. In this approach, the assumption is that, the negative consequences of "egocentrism" which is a vital and essential principle can be monitored and corrected by mutual arousals arising from „disinterested view” to these phenomena. Establishing these relationships, in the first place, are focused in terms of working and entertainment there are followed by other urban potentials in the next stage such as parks and excess places of living complexes, administrative and sport gyms. In terms of participation of art and science in the process of development of city?s shape and its components, analyzing the psychological, philosophical, and moralson ethical influences from the nature is the basis of this work as well as our recommendations on its implementation.

Evaluating the performance of the knowledge-based companies settled in science and technology
parks is one of the criteria for determining the success rate of these STPs. Promoting the necessary
skills of STP managers through the implementation of real and operational performance assessment
systems is the best way to fulfill this goal. The STPs mission could be achieved through an integrated
chain from research to production. Removing the gap between scientific/research ideas and
products and services, supervising the knowledge-based companies, meeting the actual needs and providing
value-added services to the commercialization stage are among the major missions of technology
parks. The existence of a model for analyzing the role and the status of effective factors through
assessment process is considered as one of the important measures for developing science and technology
which has been paid less attention in Iran today. Therefore, there are different items used in
assessment procedure including gaining some statistics on technology level, the relationship between
the components of science and technology system, the status of intellectual property, cooperation
methods between higher education and research centers with industries and organizations, diversity of
financial resources and the rate of incomes, attracted investments, the scope of providing services and
products, the number of customers and many other factors which are considered in knowledge-based
companies as key factors. The present paper intends to investigate and offer the best assessment and
effectiveness evaluation model together with the performance of k-based companies obtained from the
tacit knowledge through ISTT experiences. The objective is to localize executive processes in accordance
with the cultural and social structures in Iran.

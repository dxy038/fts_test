Two pregnant patients at term, suffering from major burn wounds, were treated in our burn unit during the year 1995, both were delivered immediately after admission by caesarean section. One of them had smoke inhalation injury which needed mechanical ventilation, both mothers and newborns survived. In spite of low maternal carboxyhaemoglobin the fetal cord blood carboxyhaemaglobin was high, supporting an objective physiological basis for the previous empirical conclusion of early delivery in pregnant patients at term with extensive burn injury (50 per cent TBSA and more). This obvious favourable outcome highlights the importance of urgent delivery in term pregnant women suffering a major burn injury.

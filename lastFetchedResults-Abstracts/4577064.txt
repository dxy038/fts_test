The paper presents model predictive control solutions for a servosystem consisting of an electromagnetic actuator. Two solutions are proposed in this paper on the basis of one-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead quadratic objective functions. The simulation results support the development of solutions and offer conclusions concerning the advantages of the solutions.

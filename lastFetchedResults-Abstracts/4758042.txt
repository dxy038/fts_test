This paper proposes a new strategy and platform for computer network-assisted corrective actions against voltage instability in the power distribution systems. The objective of the proposed strategy is to save the distribution system from imminent voltage collapse due to contingencies occurring in the power systems by executing corrective operations. The operations include coordinated local / distributed generating, capacitor switching, load tap changing, load shedding, etc. This paper shows the use of state-of-the-art digital signal processing technology for determination of correct stability controls, and the application of modern computer networking technology for monitoring of power-grid operating states and transmitting of data and stability control commands. This paper presents the design of algorithms for corrective actions against voltage instability in the power distribution systems, and hardware realization and real-time execution of corrective actions using a new two-layer architecture for network monitoring, data transmitting, and control delivering.

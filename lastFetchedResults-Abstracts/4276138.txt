Ontology has been emerged has rapidly growing technology for representing knowledge in a meaningful way. To store ontologies for web-applications XML is natural representation but it is unable to store huge knowledge in a saleable way. Under the primary objective of our paper, we present ERMOS: An Efficient Relational Mapping for Ontology Storage, by extending Schema Aware Mapping for storing ontologies in RDBMS in order to enable easy and prompt retrieval of knowledge from ontologies for semantically affluent queries based on OWL 2.0 semantics in accompany with REMT: Restriction Mapping Technique for storing OWL 2.0 restrictions. Intended for this intention we introduce a set of rules, which describes our mapping technique for developing an Entity Relation (ER) Model with the endeavor of eventually facilitating towards a Relational Database Design. ERMOS offers main memory free in-system reasoning over A-Box data.

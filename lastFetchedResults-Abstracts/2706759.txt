This paper presents the performance of a self-excited induction generator (SEIG) with a voltage and frequency controller (VFC) in a standalone microhydro power generating system. The VFC consists of a distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) and a direct torque controlled variable frequency induction motor drive (VFIMD) operating as an electronic load controller (ELC). The DSTATCOM is an insulated-gate bipolar transistor-based three-leg voltage source inverter with a self-sustaining dc bus. The main objective of DSTATCOM is to regulate the system voltage through reactive power compensation. In addition to voltage regulation, the DSTATCOM compensates the harmonics generated by nonlinear loads as well as ELC. The ELC controls the system frequency through the active power balance. The VFIMD of the ELC drives a pump and it consumes the power in excess of consumer load power to maintain constant power generation at the SEIG terminals, which in turn regulates the system frequency. A prototype-proposed VFC is developed and tested with a variety of loads. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed VFC can effectively control the system voltage and frequency.

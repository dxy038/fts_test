Background and Objective: Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of morbidity, mortality and disability in the world and Iranian population. Inflammation and oxidative processes are major risk factors ofatherosclerosis. Some evidence demonstrated antinflammatory effect of conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) and omega-3 fatty acids (?-3 fatty acids). So the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CLA and ?-3 fatty acids supplementation on inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in atherosclerotic patients.
Materials and Methods: In this study 90 volunteers who referred to Emam Reza Heart Clinic of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences were selected if they fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Participants were classified into 3 groups receiving 3g/d CLA, 1920mg/d ?3 or placebo for 2 months. C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin -6(IL-6), malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were measured before and after supplementation. CRP measurement was done by a high sensitive Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay and IL-6 assay was performed by Radioimmunoassay methods. GPx enzyme activity and MDA was measured byspectrophotometery. Data processing and statistical analysis were done using SPSS19 software and a p-value of  < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Results: hs-CRP level decreased significantly in both the ?3 and CLA group during the study(4.43±4.13 vs 1.6±1.41 and 7.48±5.64 vs 5.95±5.87 )(p = 0.01). IL-6 reduced significantly in ?3 groupralative to control(18.59±11.12 vs 13.37 ± 9.44)(p=0.04) but in CLA group reduction in IL-6 levels was not significant(16.13±10.21 vs 12.95±8.1)(p=0.06). GPx increased in CLA and ?3 groups(144.57±56.89 vs 174.61±62.8 and 125±46.06 vs 171.4±68.90) (p=0.001). MDA level decreased significantly in both the ?3 and CLA group(3.98±1.50 vs 2.87±1.55 and 3.7±1.77 vs 2.4±0.8) (p = 0.001).
Conclusion: Supplementation of diet with CLA and ?3 can have a beneficial effect on some indices of inflammatory and oxidative stress.

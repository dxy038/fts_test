Paraplegia complicating thoracotomy is rare but catastrophic. This report comprises 40 cases: 5 of our cases and 35 reported cases. Our cases comprised a stab wound of the left chest (1), decortication (1), lobectomy for bronchogenic carcinoma (2), and segmental resection for tuberculosis (1). The reported cases included 25 cases following thoracotomy for thoracic pathology (bronchogenic carcinoma, 12; pulmonary tuberculosis, 7; thoracic trauma, 2; bronchiectasis, 1; peptic esophagitis, 1; neurogenic tumors, 2; and benign lung lesion, 1 and 10 cases following operation for malignant hypertension. The surgical procedures performed on the 25 patients with thoracic pathology were lobectomy (8), bilobectomy (1), pneumonectomy (7), decortication (1), thoracoplasty (1), excision of neurogenic tumors (2), drainage of tuberculous cavity (1), and Nissen procedure (1). The intraoperative factors contributing to the neurologic deficit were bleeding at the costovertebral angle (9), migration of oxidized cellulose into spinal canal (9), thrombosis of anterior spinal artery (4), epidural hematoma (2), epidural narcotic (2), metastatic carcinoma (1), and hypotension (1). This serious complication can be prevented by meticulous operation and careful hemostasis. The immediate use of tomographic scanning or magnetic resonance imaging followed by surgical decompression might avert this serious complication.

A Topology optimization technique is used for complete layout optimization of the radiating element of a planar monopole antenna. The design objective is to find a conductivity distribution that maximizes the energy received by the planar monopole over the frequency band 1-10 GHz. The finite difference time domain method (FDTD) is used for the numerical calculations, and an adjoint problem is derived to calculate the corresponding sensitivities. Numerical results show a promising use of topology optimization techniques for the systematic design of ultrawideband monopoles.

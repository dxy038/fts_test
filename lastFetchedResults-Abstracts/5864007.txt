In this we paper presents an approach for CPU scheduling when considering the multiple criteria with the help on Multi-objective optimization. Scheduling in operating systems plays a significant role on performance of System, But this performance may be degraded if we some special condition. In this paper, we use the Multi objective genetic algorithm to provide better solution. We have considered the two factors as over objectives first is optimal waiting time and second is the execution of jobs based on their priorities. We will evaluate the performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm using simulation results.

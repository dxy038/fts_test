Objective
The purpose of this study was to characterize the spinal distribution of afferent and efferent pathways that innervate the levator ani (LA) muscle in the female squirrel monkey.
Study design
Cholera toxin B (CTB) was injected unilaterally into the LA muscle of 5 monkeys to identify primary sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and motor neurons in the spinal cord that contribute fibers to the LA nerve. Fluoro-Gold (FG) was injected into the external anal sphincter of 2 of these animals to label pudendal motor neurons (1 of these animals underwent unilateral LA neurectomy before CTB injection). Spinal cord and DRG were processed for immunofluorescence 3 to 7 days after injections.
Results
Retrograde transport of CTB from the LA muscle labeled primary afferent neurons in the ipsilateral DRG, their central projections, and motor neurons in the medial portion of the ipsilateral ventral horn of the spinal cord (L7-S2 segments). Injection of FG into the external anal sphincter labeled cells in Onuf's nucleus, primarily in L7. Importantly, CTB-labeled LA motor neurons were virtually absent in Onuf's nucleus, where all pudendal motor neurons are located. CTB-labeled processes were observed within Onuf's nucleus, adjacent to FG-labeled pudendal motor neurons, and appeared to derive from dendrites of LA motor neurons that project into Onuf's nucleus.
Conclusion
The LA muscle has a distinct innervation with very little or no contribution from the pudendal nerve. The intriguing labeling of LA neural elements within a nucleus that innervates the external urethral and anal sphincters (involved in pelvic visceral control) may represent a neuroanatomic substrate for physiologic integration of spinal and supraspinal inputs for the coordination of pelvic floor and visceral activity.

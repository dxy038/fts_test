A method is described for deriving, from digitized images, objective measures that correlate strongly with simple perceptual judgements on the same images. Each measure is the normalized variance of an image obtained by convolving the original image with a specific local operator. This operator is designed to optimize the correlation between the particular percept and the objective measure, subject to certain specified constraints

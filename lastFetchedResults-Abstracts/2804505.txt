Non-isolated single-inductor three-port converters (SI-TPCs) are the cost-effective way to connect the renewable source, energy-stored component and load for those stand-alone applications without isolation requirements. However, the dynamic features of SI-TPCs are complicated due to the multiport, bidirectional energy flowing and a variety of energy management modes. To facilitate the control-loop design, this paper deduces the general average equations for the SI-TPCs, and then proposes the available small-signal models for different energy management modes. According to the analysis results, the smoothing switching among different energy management modes is also presented. The experimental results are also given to verify the validity of the analysis.

This paper presents a mathematical analysis of a channel reservation technique referred to as CFP for medium access control protocol in high bit-rate wireless communication systems with two groups of users, i.e. normal and misbehaved users. Two different misbehaving scenarios are investigated, namely cascade fixed prop + 2 group (CFP+2G) and cascade fixed prop + 2 group + multi-token (CFP+2G+MT). The objective is to evaluate the effect of some misbehaved users on the overall system performance. Numerical results show that the probability of success in reservation clearly degrades if some users do not follow the agreed rule.

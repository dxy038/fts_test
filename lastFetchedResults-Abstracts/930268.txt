To gain more insight in the possible process of setting a food safety objective (FSO), a concept developed by Codex Alimentarius for microbial hazards, in national food safety policy, a study was executed in the Netherlands. This Dutch study consisted of a case study regarding the process of setting a FSO for a chemical and for a microbiological hazard as well as of a theoretical study concerning the possible development of new decision-making tools. The study resulted in a model for a decision-making process that integrates life sciences, socio-economical studies and technology assessment. It also features close interaction between policymakers and researchers. As a result of the study, it is advised to install an independent advisory committee that helps government in deciding on appropriate levels of protection of the population and setting FSOs

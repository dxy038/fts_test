Objective: To determine if the timing of the administration of prophylactic oxytocin influences the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage caused by uterine atony, retained placenta, and third-stage duration. Study Design: Parturients who presented for vaginal delivery were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to receive oxytocin, 20 units in a 500-mL crystalloid intravenous bolus, beginning upon delivery of either the fetal anterior shoulder or placenta. For all patients, the third stage of labor was managed with controlled cord traction until placental expulsion, followed by at least 15 seconds of fundal massage. Patients were excluded if they had a previous cesarean section, multiple gestation, antepartum hemorrhage, or bleeding disorder. Results: A total of 1486 patients were enrolled: 745 in the before-placenta group and 741 in the afterplacenta group. The groups were similar with respect to gestational age, fetal weight, labor duration, maternal age, parity, and ethnicity. The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage did not differ significantly between the two groups (5.4% vs 5.8%; crude OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.43). There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to incidence of retained placenta (2.4% vs 1.6%; OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.72 to 3.08), or third-stage duration (7.7 minutes vs 8.1 minutes; P = .23). Conclusions: The administration of prophylactic oxytocin before placental delivery does not reduce the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage or third-stage duration, when compared with giving oxytocin after placental delivery. Early administration, however, does not increase the incidence of retained placenta. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2001;185: 873â€“7.)

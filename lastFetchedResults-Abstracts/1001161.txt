The objective of this study was to create a thin film optode for fast pH measurements that meets the requirements for imaging pH-responses from cells as well as for a future hybrid design for detection of multiple analytes simultaneously. The sensor is based on the covalent attachment of 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (HPTS) to a film forming cellulose acetate material through a sulfonamide linkage. The synthesis routes of the cellulose material and regio-specific covalent attachment of the dye are described in detail. The sensor was sterilized in two different ways and showed excellent biocompatibility with Chinese hamster ovary cells. Imprints from cells and μm thin cell extensions were visualized when altering pH of the surrounding solution. The sensor was tested together with time-dependent sigmoidal calibrations giving pH determinations with an exceptional precision and accuracy during measurement within pH 6–8. The precision of the optode, calculated as pooled S.D. (n = 8) according to IUPAC recommendations between pH 6.641 and 7.742 was 0.0029. The accuracy was significantly better than the electrode used as reference during the measurements. The response time (0–95%) was 100 s between pH 6.641 and 7.742 and the reverse response (95–0%) was 80 s. The sensor shows great potential for extra-cellular pH determination over time during cell growth and pharmacological exposure.

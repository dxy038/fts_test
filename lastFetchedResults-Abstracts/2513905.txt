<p><strong>Background and objective:</strong> MMP enzymes are a family of membrane proteins that are capable of digesting extracellular matrix compounds (ECM) and basement membrane. Matrilysin enzyme is the smallest member of MMP family that is encoded by MMP-7 gene (matrilysin). According to the reports, G allele of -181 A/G single nucleotide polymorphism of MMP-7 gene causes an increase in the expression of this enzyme. This study aims to investigate the effect of promoter single nucleotide polymorphism of this gene on the colorectal cancer and compare the accuracy of tetra-primer ARMS PCR and RFLP-PCR techniques.<br /><strong>Materials and Methods:</strong> In this study, genomic DNA was extracted from total blood of 61 patients with colorectal cancer and 77 healthy subjects as controls and, then, was genotyped by tetra-primer ARMS PCR technique. A number of randomly selected samples were later genotyped by RFLP-PCR.<br /><strong>Findings:</strong> As expected, the results of RFLP-PCR technique confirmed the results of tetra-primer ARMS technique. Results of this study showed no statistical association between this polymorphism and risk of onset and metastasis of the colorectal cancer in the population of Isfahan.<br /><strong>Discussion and conclusion</strong>: Tetra-primer ARMS technique can be used as an efficient clinical technique.</p>

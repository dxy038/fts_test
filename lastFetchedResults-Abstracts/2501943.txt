Background and Objective: The use of supplements, herbal extracts, and exercise training for the treatment of diseases and metabolic disorders has increased among people. Thus, the aim of this study was the study of combined aerobic exercise training and consumption of green tea extract on serum levels of tumor necrosis factor ? (TNF-?) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in obese women with type 2 diabetes.

Materials and Methods: In this research study, 46 obese diabetic women (BMI  >  30, blood fasting sugar more than 150-250 mg/dL, 45-60 years old) were selected and randomly assigned into four groups, green tea (n=12), aerobic exercise training + green tea (n=12), aerobic exercise training (n=12) and control (n=10). Participants in supplementary groups received 1500 mg green tea extract daily for 10 weeks. Aerobic training program included 10 weeks of training, 3 sessions per week and each session was 60 minutes at 55% maximum heart rate during the first week and gradually increased with the progress of the training program to 75 percent of maximum heart rate. Each session consists of warm up (10 minutes), the main part of the training involves performing aerobic exercises in a standing position (40 minutes) and recovery in sitting (10 minutes).

Results: The data showed that no significant difference was observed in serum TNF-? level (p > 0.05). But, in training + Green Tea group, a significant difference was observed in the serum IL-6 (p=0.009). The results of analysis of variance showed that a significant difference between the effects of different interventions do not exist for TNF-? (F=2.33, P=0.089). However, for the impact of various interventions, there was a significant difference in the amount of IL-6 (F=8.01, P=0.000). Post-hoc test for IL-6 showed that significant differences exist between the control group and exercise + green tea (P=0.021), between green tea and exercise group (P=0.021) and training + green tea group (P=0.021). In addition, after different interventions, serum insulin levels in the exercise group had a significant increase (P=0.013).

Conclusion: According to obtained results, it appears that aerobic training plus green tea extract consumption have better effect on serum inflammatory factors in obsess women with diabetes type 2.

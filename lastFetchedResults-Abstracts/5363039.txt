Human capital (HC) - the main value of a modern society and a major factor of economic growth of the country or region. Basic components HC: the capital of health, the capital of education and the capital of culture. Integrated parameter HC human development index. This parameter is recommended for an estimation of end results of activity of administration of any level. The capital of health is a basis of the human capital. The overall objective of the present work consists in answering two questions: what social and economic losses of a society from lack of financing of public health services and what optimum strategy of reduction of these losses. For the answer to these questions the mathematical model describing functional connections between losses of man-hours of an active life and losses of a total internal product is offered. It is offered to use a parameter of total losses of man-hours of an active life in one year from premature and infantile death rate, low birth rate, a high level of deceases, physical inability, abortions, low life expectancy and accumulation of "a cargo of illnesses". The method allows to estimate direct damage of a society from losses of man-hours of an active life for the listed reasons. The damage is estimated by losses of a total internal product (TIP). The method is used for the comparative analysis of losses HC in Russia, in Novosibirsk and Novosibirsk area.

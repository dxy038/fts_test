Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) causes an increased risk of metabolic cardiovascular syndrome. Also, cystatin C serum levels are associated with the risk of cardiovascular events in metabolic syndrome patients. Objective: To investigate the relationship between cystatin C in PCOS patients. Materials and Methods: 35 women with PCOS were compared to 35 women with healthy matched age and body mass index. They all underwent tests to determine plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), cystatin C, lipid profile and apo-lipoprotein. Blood pressure and demographic variables of each subject were obtained. Results: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were higher in PCOS patients compared to control group. Triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were higher in PCOS; contrariwise, high-density lipoprotein was lower from that of healthy volunteers. Cystatin and CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with PCOS in comparison with healthy subjects (p < 0.0001). Among measured determinants, only PCOS status was independently associated with cystatin C. Conclusion: Cystatin C was positively correlated with PCOS status concentrations but not with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, or any of the lipid profile variables or demographic characteristics. Indeed, no correlation was found between cystatin C and CRP levels. Therefore, cystatin C might be related to PCOS beyond its use as a marker of the renal function.

Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) and poly(methacrylic acid) multilayer capsules based on hydrogen bonding have been prepared by the layer-by-layer approach and used to encapsulate and release rifampicin, an anti-tuberculosis drug. Removal of silica core using a buffer of ammonium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid at about pH 3 was found to produce better capsules than hydrofluoric acid alone. An eight-layered capsule had a wall thickness of 20 nm. Maximum encapsulation was found to be about 86 μg at 40 °C with 1 ± 0.2 × 106 capsules. Release studies showed a burst kind of release and maximum release was obtained above pH 7 where the capsules disintegrate rapidly thereby releasing the drug in a short period. Interactions studies with Mycobacterium smegmatis showed that the capsules were cytocompatible and the released drug functioned with the same efficacy as the free drug.

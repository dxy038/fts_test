Abstract
Background and objective: Production of Extended Spectrum B-lactamases (ESBLs) is the most common resistance mechanism against B-Lactam antibiotics in Acinetobacter bumannii . PER-1 is one of the most frequent ESBLs in A.baumannii. This study was done to find out the prevalence rate of PER-1 type ESBL in A.baumannii isolates using phenotypic and genotypic methods.

Materials and methods: In this study, a total of 100 A.baumannii isolates were collected from hospitalized patients in Imam Reza hospital of Tabriz. The identification of A. baumannii isolates carried out using microbiological methods and then confirmed by PCR OXA-51 screening by PCR method. All A.baumannii isolates were investigated for production of  ESBL with screening test and confirmatory tests including Double Disk Synergy Test (DDST), Combined Disk Test (CDT) and PCR method. All Data analyzed using SPSS sotware.

Results: All isolates had OXA-51 gene and confirmed as A.baumannii. A total of 100 A. baumannii isolates were ESBL positive by using screening test. Using DDST (53%)  CDT (64%)  and by both of tests, 70% of samples were ESBLs producer  and of these isolates, 72.8% had PER-1 gene. We could detected 96% and 64.7% of PER-1 gene producing isolates by using CDT and DDST, respectively.

Conclusion: This study showed that PER-1 gene is the most prevalent ESBL gene in A. baumannii isolates in this area and this result revealed that CD method more reliable than DDST for detection of PER-1 gene producing A. bumannii isolates.

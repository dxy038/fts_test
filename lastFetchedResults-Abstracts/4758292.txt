Buffer management and packet scheduling are the main features of resource management and the key mechanisms for QoS (quality of service) provision. We propose a novel model for the integration of buffer management and packet scheduling. The model makes the packet dropping and scheduling decisions in one step through a synthetic objective function considering loss rate, delay and bandwidth simultaneously. The simulation study shows this model provides not only loss and delay proportional differentiation, decoupling of delay and bandwidth, but also the best synthetic performance fairness.

In order to study the gripping principle of heavy forging manipulators, and to analyze the features and structural parameters, this paper presents the similarity design method of the forging gripping mechanisms. Firstly, by using similarity theory, the similar criterion and similar indicators of the clamping system are established, and the relationship between the geometry similarity ratio and other parametersÂ´ similarity ratio is defined. Secondly, based on the design requirement of the gripper, the non-dimensional objective function is presented. By using multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm, the optimization model of the short leverage gripper, long leverage gripper and push-bar gripper are defined, and the parameters value of the push-bar gripper are calculated. Lastly, based on the simulation and the relationship of parameters of the gripping systems, the similarity of the experimental models is analyzed, demonstrating the feasibility of the similarity design method for heavy forging grippers.

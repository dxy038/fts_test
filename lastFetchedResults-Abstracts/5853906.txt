The objective of this paper is to survey major Web service standards (WSS) in order to develop a road map that assists adapting organization in identifying the interrelationships among these standards, and relevancy of these standards to a particular WS implementation approach. Since multiple standards exist, a generic road map is constructed that shows basic functions supported by different standards. Standards are mapped into these basic functions. This jungle view of WS should assist organizations first to develop a macro view of standards associated with WS before embarking of major WS project.

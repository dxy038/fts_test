During construction of roads, entire hillsides can be cut away, dramatically disturbing the ecosystem. Microbial communities play important, but poorly understood roles in revegetating roadcuts because of the many functions they perform in nutrient cycling, plant symbioses, decomposition, and other ecosystem processes. Our objective was to determine relationships among microbial community composition, soil chemistry, and disturbance on a serpentine soil disturbed by a roadcut and then partially revegetated. We hypothesized that the adjacent undisturbed serpentine soil would have a different microbial community composition from barren and revegetated sections of the roadcut and that undisturbed soils would have the greatest microbial biomass and diversity. We measured phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) and soil nutrient concentrations on barren and revegetated sections of the roadcut and on adjacent undisturbed serpentine and nonserpentine soils. Most roadcut samples had soil chemistry similar to the serpentine reference soil. The microbial biomass and diversity of barren sites was lower than that of revegetated or the serpentine reference site. The nonserpentine reference site had significantly (P≤0.05) greater microbial biomass than serpentine or disturbed sites but significantly lower relative proportions of actinomycetes, and slow growth biomarkers. The Barren site had the lowest microbial biomass and a significantly (P≤0.05) greater proportion of that biomass was fungi. Barren, revegetated, and serpentine sites all had dissimilar microbial community composition. The composition of the revegetated communities, however, was intermediate between the serpentine reference and barren soils, suggesting that community composition of revegetated soils is approaching that of an undisturbed site with similar soil chemistry.

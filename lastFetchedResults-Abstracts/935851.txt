Female genital tuberculosis (TB) remains as a major cause of tubal obstruction leading
to infertility, especially in developing countries. The global prevalence of genital
tuberculosis has increased during the past two decades due to increasing acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Genital TB is commonly asymptomatic, and
it is diagnosed during infertility investigations. Despite of recent advances in imaging
tools, such as computerized tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and ultrasongraphy, hysterosalpingography is still the standard screening
test for evaluation of tubal infertility and a valuable tool for diagnosis of female
genital tuberculosis. Tuberculosis gives rise to various appearances on hysterosalpingography
(HSG) from non-specific changes to specific findings. The present pictorial
review illustrates and describes specific and non-specific radiographic features of female
genital tuberculosis in two parts. Part I presents specific findings of tuberculosis related
to tubes such as "beaded tube", "golf club tube", "pipestem tube", "cobble stone tube"
and "leopard skin tube". Part II describes adverse effects of tuberculosis on structure of
endometrium and radiological specific findings such as "dwarfed" uterus with lymphatic
intravasation and occluded tubes, "T-shaped" tuberculosis uterus, "pseudounicornuate"
uterus and "Collar-stud abscess", which have not been encountered in the majority of
non-tuberculosis cases.

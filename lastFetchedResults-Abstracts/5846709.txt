In this paper, assuming a bidirectional network, the performance of two-way half-duplex (HD) relaying systems based on physical-layer network coding is compared with one-way full-duplex (FD) relaying schemes. Specifically, the outage probability and system throughput of the considered schemes are investigated. Our results show that unidirectional FD relaying can outperform bidirectional HD relaying, even in the presence of self-interference at the FD relay.

This paper presents an integrated control strategy of speed, excitation and load sharing for parallel operating diesel generator sets. The objective is to overcome the difficulties in the coordination of static performance and dynamic performance and in the coordination of parallel operation stability and load sharing. On the basis of the multi-variable linear equivalent machine system model, the synthesis of the integrated optimal controller is achieved by minimizing a quadratic performance index. System behaviour under transient conditions is obtained from the digital simulation and field test. Results reveal that this integrated control arrangement can provide satisfactory static and dynamic performance and load sharing performance

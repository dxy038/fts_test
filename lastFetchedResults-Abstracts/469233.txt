Objective
The purpose of this study was to estimate the outcomes of uterine embolization and hysterectomy for uterine leiomyomas.
Study design
This was a multicenter prospective study of patients who were treated with embolization (n = 102 patients) and hysterectomy (n = 50 patients) for leiomyomas. Changes in symptoms, complications, and quality of life were measured. The data analysis included linear and logistic regression, the Student t and paired t test, Fisher's exact test, and chi-squared test.
Results
For patients who underwent embolization, there were marked reductions in blood loss scores (P< .001) and menorrhagia questionnaire scores (P< .001) compared with baseline. At 12 months, a larger proportion of the patients who had undergone hysterectomy experienced improved pelvic pain (P = .021). Both groups had marked improvement in other symptoms and quality of life scores, with no difference between groups. Complications were more frequent in patients who underwent hysterectomy (50% vs 27.5%; P = .01).
Conclusion
Both procedures substantially improved symptoms for most patients, with an advantage for hysterectomy at 12 months for pelvic pain. Serious complications were infrequent in both groups.

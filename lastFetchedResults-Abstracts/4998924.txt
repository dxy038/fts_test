Character Modeling is becoming more and more difficult in animation industry today. Lots of designers are usually involved to cooperatively accomplish a character by computer networks or the Internet. This paper presents a Multi-Objective evaluation based Cooperative Character Modeling System(MOCMS), which can evolve various character models to generate creative ones based on multi-objective evaluations. The objectives are designed to embody different personalities, including qualitative and quantitative aspects. The former are given by different cooperative designers while the latter are calculated automatically by computers. This can incorporate qualitative and quantitative evaluation in a formal manner. Case study demonstrates that the proposed method can evolve character models according to the designersÂ´ intentions and shorten design time.

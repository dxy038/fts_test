Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess a cohort of patients who underwent a colpocleisis procedure more than 1 year post operation to determine: 1) the proportion of patients who regretted having the procedure, 2) patient satisfaction with the procedure, and 3) changes in symptom severity after surgery.
Study design
Using the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Genitourinary Disorders Center database, a prospective analysis was performed on 54 patients who underwent colpocleisis between August 1996 and April 2003. From August to October of 2004, participants were contacted by an investigator not involved with the surgery and were asked 1) “do you regret having your surgery, and, if so, why?,” 2) “how satisfied are you with your progress (completely, somewhat, or not)?,” and 3) to repeat the short form Incontinence Impact Questionnaire/Urogenital Distress Inventory (IIQ-7/UDI-6).
Results
Fifty-nine percent (32/54) of potential candidates participated in the study. Nine percent (3/32) of patients regretted having colpocleisis performed. Fifty-seven percent (16/28) were completely satisfied, 29% (8/28) somewhat satisfied, and 14% (4/28) not satisfied. Mean IIQ score improved significantly from 40.9 (±31.7) at baseline to 14.1 (±26.7) at last interview (P = .003). Mean UDI score improved significantly from 63.1 (±24.3) at baseline to 24.2 (±26.7) at last interview (P = .001). There was a negative correlation between change in UDI scores with time since procedure (r = −.397, P = .055) and age (r = −.435, P = .034).
Conclusion
Few patients reported regret after partial colpocleisis. There was a high rate of patient satisfaction and significant symptom improvement more than a year post surgery. Stable but smaller improvements were reported with longer time from surgery and increasing age.

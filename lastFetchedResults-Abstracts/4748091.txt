Topic maps offer unprecedented power when it comes to searching, like for full-text searching, for complex queries, and also provide an excellent basis for natural language querying. The objective of this paper is to crawl portions of domain specific Web, extracting surface content based on the requirements of a particular search. Further, we aim to organize the extracted data by developing Topic Maps using pattern matching, so as to make search navigation directed, easier and less complex. It returns the best match for the search, together with additional information.

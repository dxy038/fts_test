This paper considers the problem of guiding a mobile sensor network in a distributed parameter system. The ice thickness distribution of sea ice is an example of such a system. The objective is to improve the convergence of the state estimation error, compared to a nominal sensor network, by employing a gradient-based guidance scheme. The ice thickness is modeled as a continuity equation and the sensor dynamics as fully actuated 2-input-2-output mass-spring-damper systems. The approach builds on Lyapunov functions to construct the guidance law that achieves, under certain assumptions, a uniformly globally asymptotically stable system. A numerical example illustrates the approach.

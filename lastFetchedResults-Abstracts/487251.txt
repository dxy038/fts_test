Objective: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) and its relationship with reproductive variables in married women in urban areas of Kohgilouyeh-Boyerahmad Province.
Methods: This cross-sectional study covered urban areas of Kohgilouyeh-Boyerahmad Province. Using a quota sampling method, an ad hoc questionnaire containing items on demographic and reproductive variables, was administered to women attending primary health care delivery centers. Sexual dysfunctions were defined by the DSM-IV criteria. Data were analyzed using binary' logistic regression.
Results: A total of 1540 married women residing in urban areas were studied. The mean age of the respondents was 33.2 (SD=9.4) years and most were housewives (%84.5). The self-reported frequencies of different FSDs were as follows: loss of desire (%35.1), dyspareunia (%34.9), anorgasmia (%34.5) and loss of arousal (%31.6). Binary logistic regression analysis showed the following risk factors for various FSDs: loss of desire: "age" [46>y: C)R=3.07( 1.58-5.99)]. "pelvic surgery" [Cesarean Section: OR=1.57(l.13-2.18)]. loss of arousal: "age" [36-45y: C)R=2.20( 1.27-3.79)], "contraceptive method" [depo- provera/norplant/withdrawal: OR= 1.81(1.15-2.85)]
anorgasmia: "age at marriage" [7-l5y: OR=2.93(1.33-6.42)], "contraceptive method" [depo- provera/norplant/withdrawal: OR=l .62(1.06-2.49)]
dyspareunia: "age" [31-35y: C)R=0.48(0.29-0.77)], "education" [high school: OR= 1.84(1.10-3.07)], "contraceptive method" [condom: OR = 1.80 (1.02-3.18)].
Conclusion: The findings indicate that FSD is prevalent in the study population. The effects of demographic and reproductive variables should be considered in management of these disorders.

Objective: The human auditory P50 may consist of overlapping potentials. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated interstimulus intervals (ISIs) and between-block rests, and recorded the P50, P50m, N100 and the N100m simultaneously.
Methods: Subjects were 12 right-handed healthy adults. Four conditions included: (1) 1.5 s/rest, (2) 1.5 s/successive, (3) 0.5 s/rest, and (4) 0.5 s/successive. Auditory stimuli were presented a total of 880 times for each condition. Auditory evoked potentials and magnetic fields were recorded. We examined the P50, N100, P50m, N100m and dipoles of the P50m and the N100m.
Results: There was no significant effect of the ISI on the P50 amplitudes, but the P50m amplitudes in the 0.5 s ISI conditions were significantly smaller than those in the 1.5 s ISI conditions. The N100 and the N100m amplitudes in the 0.5 s ISI conditions were significantly smaller than those in the 1.5 s ISI conditions. The N100 and the N100m amplitudes in the resting conditions were significantly larger than those in the successive conditions. The P50m dipoles were slightly deeper and more anterior than those of the N100m in primary auditory cortex.
Conclusions: Central structures other than supratemporal cortex contribute to the P50 and that the P50 in humans represents overlapping potentials

For successful implementation of knowledge management projects, identifying factors affecting the success of these projects is essential because these factors can help organization in the design, readiness assessment, planning and implementation of knowledge management. However, these factors do not have the same priority. In fact, they are not independent. Universities as a knowledge-based organization need to implement knowledge management. Hence, the objective of this paper is to identify casual relations and rank the factors affecting successful implementation of knowledge management by Fuzzy Multiple Criteria Decision Making (FMCDM) Approach in which the factors are dependence. For this purpose, the integration of DEMATEL and ANP was used. In the first part of this paper, the success factor is extracted by reviewing literature and exploring universities environment. In the second part, the inter relations among factors are calculated by using DEMATEL method. In the third part, the criteria weights were obtained by using ANP method. Because of the complexity of the ANP, this study proposes a new methodology to simplify the process. Identifying casual relations and critical factors in implementation knowledge management projects in universities is the main result of this paper.

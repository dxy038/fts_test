EXE Extranet Education is an R&amp;D project of a consortium of ten European partners built around the partnership of three local administrations (Bologna, London Islington and Barcelona) with a longstanding commitment to new technologies and citizen access. The project is co-financed by the European Commission after the Joint Call for Projects in the field of Educational Multimedia (December 1996). The objective of the project is to develop a multimedia toolkit to help teachers from across the educational spectrum to introduce new technologies in their daily didactic activities. EXE will provide the teachers with an Extranet which brings them in contact with colleagues in their city and in other parts of Europe. On the Extranet, teachers will find easy-to-use tools to develop their own course material: Educational Wizards for the design of lessons and didactic modules and a syllabus definition method for course development

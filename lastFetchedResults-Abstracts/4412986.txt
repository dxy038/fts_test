The objective of this paper is to identify, based on data from Tripadvisor, tourist behavior in how users rate a tourist place. Firstly, we propose different correspondence analyses (CA) on data from Tripadvisor to discover pairwise dependences between data properties (e.g. rating vs. place type, age vs. country). Secondly, we merge and map all our CA results as a cognitive map, both to bring out and understand influences between the studied concepts and to make easier human visualization.

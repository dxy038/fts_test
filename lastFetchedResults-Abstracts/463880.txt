OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess the value of ultrasonographically guided transvaginal aspiration of tuboovarian abscesses and pyosalpinges presenting with the clinical picture of acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
STUDY DESIGN: Fifteen patients seen for acute pelvic inflammatory disease were treated by ultrasonographically guided transvaginal aspiration of pus from tuboovarian abscesses and pyosalpinges, followed by local and sytemic administration of antimicrobial therapy.
RESULTS: Improvement of symptoms followed aspiration in all patients. Temperature dropped to normal within 24 to 72 hours, and pain completely disappeared within 3 days. All patients were symptom free during a follow-up period of 6 months after aspiration.
CONCLUSION: Ultrasonographically guided trasnvaginal aspiration of pyosalpinges and tuboovarian abscesses is an effective, simple, and safe treatment. It avoided the need for laparoscopy or laparotomy

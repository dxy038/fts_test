As the ubiquitous era took off, the interactions between ubiquitous services and users have come to take an important position. So it is necessary to develop new evaluation method that evaluates interactivity with a user-centered perspective. The main objective of this study is the development of user-centered interactivity evaluation metrics of ubiquitous service attributes. Detailed goals of this study are as follows. First, existing ubiquitous service evaluation methodologies are reviewed to define the evaluation attributes for ubiquitous service evaluation. Second, user oriented interactive metrics that can overcome the limitations of those service evaluation methodologies, such as personal service evaluation techniques, usability evaluation techniques and psychometrics based evaluation techniques, are developed. As a validation study, suggested evaluation metrics is utilized to evaluate the u-home service, and priority of each metrics is derived. The suggested evaluation metrics can be used to evaluate the interactivity level of ubiquitous service and identify the potential users and their requirements at the stage of service development.

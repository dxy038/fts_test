The ESA Proba-1 platform has now been in orbit since October 2001. Since that time significant value has been obtained from the CHRIS hyperspectral imager, with over 10,000 acquired images. To day CHRIS still offers the highest spatial resolution of any spaceborne hyperspectral instrument. The original intent of the CHRIS/Proba-1 programme was to acquire images of land areas particular to measure the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) properties of selected targets using multi-angle observations. A secondary objective was to monitor aerosol properties of the atmosphere. This latter aspect has only recently been revisited and results are likely to be available later this year. This paper describes the instrument and provides an update of the associated hyperspectral mission.

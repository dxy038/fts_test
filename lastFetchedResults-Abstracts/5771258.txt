Researchers have applied genetic algorithm (GA) to RoboCupSoccer players/teams and evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm in evolving good players and teams, but further investigations are required to know more about the ability of the algorithm. This paper reports our experience and findings on the application of multi-objective GA to the evolution of Robocup soccer teams: how well teams with various performances (e.g., offensive, defensive, balanced) can be automatically obtained by means of multi-objective GA.

Quality assessment is of major importance when designing and testing an image/video coding technique. Compression performances are usually evaluated by means of rate-distortion curves. However, the PSNR is commonly employed as the distortion measure. We hereby present a full quality assessment benchmark for the LAR (locally adaptive resolution) coder. We conducted a subjective experiment, where nineteen observers were asked to assess the perceptual quality of LAR coded images under normalized viewing conditions. Furthermore, five objective quality assessment metrics were used in order to determine the most suitable metric for the LAR coder. Finally, both JPEG and JPEG200 images were generated and assessed during the subjective experiment in order to define the optimal quality metric which should be used when comparing the codecsÂ´ output images quality.

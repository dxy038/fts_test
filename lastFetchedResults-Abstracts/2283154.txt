In this research, we address the application of uncertainty
programming to design a multi-site, multi-product, multi-period,
closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network. In order to make the
results of this article more realistic, a CLSC for a case study in
the iron and steel industry has been explored. The presented
supply chain covers three objective functions: maximization of
profit, minimization of new products' delivery time, collection
time and disposal time of used products, and maximizing
flexibility. To solve the proposed model, an interactive hybrid
solution methodology is adopted through combining a hybrid
fuzzy-stochastic programming method and a fuzzy multi-objective
approach. Finally, the numerical experiments are given to
demonstrate the significance of the proposed model and the
solution approach.

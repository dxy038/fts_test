Changes and challenges are inevitable features of market. On one hand it manages
pressure of growth profitability and ever increasing competition and on other hand
pressure of maintaining ethical values, customer relationship and customer
satisfaction have also become inevitable for sustainable success. Balancing of both
these factors have become the need of the moment for any business involved in
marketing in the light of current market condition. With boom in information
technology, the customer has become more demanding towards their recognition and
needs. Ever growing expectations of customers and intense competition in market
have grown to more precise levels and pushed the marketers in defensive mode
where they can’t afford to lose a single customer. This has further lead the business
to that plate- form where every business activity is focused to customer satisfaction
and retention. The customer satisfaction is quite complex term where a number of
factors contribute against certain formed expectations at some specific point of time.
These expectations in turn lead to as “value” to the customers in their minds
expected from that product or service. Creation of such value for the customer is the
ultimate objective of any business but it is a relative term which depends upon the
perceptual aspects of individual customer. As every customer is different in various
references and his behavior towards buying depends upon various complex factors
which are quite different and unpredictable, so , their expectations and perceptions
also differ. We cannot manage the ever changing behavior of customer towards
buying correctly in our favour in the light of his better informed status and
complexity of behavioral influences, but we can definitely manage his perceptions in
better ways to enable him to form his expectations accordingly in favor of our
product and in turn the value for his money and time.

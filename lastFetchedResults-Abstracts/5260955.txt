This paper presents in-flight route replanning method for high altitude endurance (HAE) reconnaissance UAV when new targets are detected. Firstly mathematics model for replanning is built, which is a multi-objective optimization under multi-constraint. Secondly, after image quality is forecasted by general image quality equation, multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is adopted to find the Pareto non-dominant route set, aiming at maximizing image quality of each target and minimizing route length under constraints. At last, fuzzy selection is applied to select the optimal route from the Pareto non-dominant route set refer to weights of image quality, route length and risk given by expert system. The simulated result showed the rationality of the method.

New parameter relationships for public lighting design (i.e. average illuminance, luminaire spacing, and mounting height) were calculated from a large sample of data sets optimized with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Optimization criteria included maximum energy efficiency and overall uniformity. The relations thus derived are a simple and elegant method for designing any type of public lighting installation without the need to use complex, expensive and/or unavailable software. It would therefore be desirable that manufacturers include such parameters in the product datasheet in order to make the calculation easier.

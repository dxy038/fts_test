In order to improve the performance of multi-objective genetic algorithms, an improved multi-objective genetic algorithm based on granular ranking and distant reproduction (IMOGA) is proposed. In this algorithm, the concept granularity is introduced into multi-objective ranking, and a selection method based on granular ranking is used. Meanwhile, the consanguinity feature is fused into individuals, and a crossover method based on distant reproduction is used. Experiments were taken on multi-objective functions with constraints, the validity of IMOGA was proved. Compared with several multi-objective optimization algorithms such as NSGAII, MOQCGA and MOPSO, the solutions of IMOGA are more excellent, and its robustness is better.

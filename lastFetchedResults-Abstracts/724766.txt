A small library of 20 trisubstituted pyrimidines were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antimalarial and antitubercular activities. Out of the total screened compounds, 16 compounds have shown in vitro antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum in the range of 0.25–2 μg/mL and 8 compounds have shown antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra, at a concentration of 12.5 μg/mL.

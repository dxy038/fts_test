Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a low dose of conjugated equine estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate plus calcium supplementation on bone density, metabolism, body weight, and symptoms in young postmenopausal women. Study Design: Sixty postmenopausal women, aged 45 to 56 years, were randomized in an open-label, 2-year trial that compared treatment with low-dose continuous combined hormone replacement therapy that contained 0.3 mg of conjugated equine estrogens and 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate plus 1000 mg of calcium per day or treatment with 1000 mg of calcium per day alone. Menopausal symptoms were evaluated for the first 12 weeks of the study; bleeding profiles, bone mineral density, bone turnover, and body weight were assessed for 24 months. Results: After 24 months, we evaluated 15 subjects in the control group (with a 50% drop-out rate) and 23 patients (with a 23% drop-out rate) in the low-dose continuous combined hormone replacement therapy group. Low-dose continuous combined hormone replacement therapy was effective in reducing menopausal clinical symptoms and provided a favorable bleeding profile and minimal side effects. In comparison with basal values, bone mineral density significantly (P< .05) increased by 2.72% ± 0.3% in the low-dose continuous combined hormone replacement therapy group and decreased by 7.9% ± 0.8% (P< .05) in the control group after 24 months, with parallel changes in bone metabolism marker action. In the control group, body mass index significantly (P< .05) increased from baseline value with a weight gain of 3%; in the low-dose continuous combined hormone replacement therapy group, the body mass index did not change after 24 months of treatment, and the 1.3% gain in body weight was not significant. Conclusion: Low-dose continuous combined hormone replacement therapy can alleviate subjective symptoms and minimize body transformations that are associated with early menopause and provide an effective protection against the activation of bone turnover and osteoporosis.

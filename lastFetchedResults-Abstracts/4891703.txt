In this paper we introduce a technique that permits to extend the local observability of a BLDC motor state-space model down to zero speed. A speed-independent position information source based on the stator iron B-H local hysteresis is added to the classical observable parameters used in BLDC motor state-space models. The final objective is to extend the working range of BLDC motors down to zero speed using a Kalman filter. PC simulations show the effectiveness of the introduced approach.

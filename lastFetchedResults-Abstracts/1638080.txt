The objective of this study was to evaluate different pervious concrete test specimen preparation techniques in an effort to produce specimens having properties similar to in-place pervious concrete pavement. Cylinders and slabs were cast using pervious concrete from three different paving projects using different procedures. The comparisons of cast specimens to pavement cores were based on infiltration rate, density, and porosity. Of the cylinder consolidation procedures tested, the standard Proctor hammer provided the least variability of results and yielded properties similar to the in-place pavement. However, 600 mm square slabs were even more consistent with the in-place pavement density and porosity.

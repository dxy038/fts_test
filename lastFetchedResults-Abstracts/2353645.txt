The Okiep Copper District in South Africa has produced more than 110 million tons at a grade of 1.71% Cu from several small mafic ore bodies. The ore was smelted on site and generated ∼5 mt of slag. During the life of mine attempts to recover copper from the slag by flotation had limited success. After mine closure the challenge of environmental rehabilitation and the possible disposal of the slag, triggered a reinvestigation into the viability of slag as a copper resource. Characterisation of the slag as a contribution to the potential copper recovery is the objective of this study.

ags are hard, vitreous with a matrix of Si–Fe–Al–Mg–Ca glass and laths of Mg–Fe–olivine, Fe–Mg–orthopyroxene and minor Cr-spinel. Copper grade varies between 0.11% and 0.42% with minor nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc and tungsten. All economic elements are hosted by disseminated spheroidal prills which consist mainly of the copper sulphides bornite, chalcocite, covellite and chalcopyrite with exsolved sulphide phases of the minor base metals as well as rhenium and silver. Prills consisting of metallic copper and alloys are minor constituents. Prill diameter is highly variable with most in the 40–60 μm range and the historically poor copper recovery is attributed to the small prill size. Crushing of slag to −45 μm as opposed to the previous −75 μm should significantly increase sulphide liberation and recovery of copper and minor base metal sulphides by conventional flotation.

ed the operation is economically viable, redistribution of the processed slag to environmentally acceptable sites will resolve the present pollution and rehabilitation challenge related to the dumps in the Okiep Copper District. The operation will also have a positive socio-economic impact on this poverty-stricken part of South Africa.

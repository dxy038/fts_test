This paper presents a timeout-driven DPM technique which relies on the theory of Markovian processes. The objective is to determine the energy-optimal timeout values for a system with multiple power saving states while satisfying a set of user defined performance constraints. More precisely, a controllable Markovian process is exploited to model the power management behavior of a system under the control of a timeout policy. Starting with this model, a perturbation analysis technique is applied to develop an offline gradient-based approach to determine the optimal timeout values. Online implementation of this technique for a system with dynamically-varying system parameters is also described. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach

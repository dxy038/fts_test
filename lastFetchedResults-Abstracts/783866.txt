Objective Assertive community treatment programmes
are increasingly common worldwide but without much
knowledge of their long-term effect. We investigated
whether the implementation of such a programme would
improve symptomatic and functional outcome 5 years
later.
Methods Naturalistic cohort study between 1995 and
2000 of all first-episode psychosis patients (n = 144) in
Uppsala County, Sweden. We compared a 3-year period
before (non-mACT) and after the introduction of a modified
assertive community treatment (mACT) programme in
1998. Five-year outcome was assessed for symptoms and
functioning and the two co-primary outcome measures
were positive and negative symptoms. Regression models
were adjusted for a propensity score based on multiple
baseline variables and use of antipsychotics at 5-year follow-
up.
Results Contrary to our hypothesis, patients in the mACT
group, compared to those in the non-mACT group, had
a borderline significant increased risk of having a poor
5-year outcome regarding positive psychotic symptoms
[adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.21, 95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.97–10.63]. There was no difference at the 5-year
follow-up between the mACT and non-mACT group
regarding negative symptoms (adjusted OR 1.65, 95% CI
0.48–5.66), or any of the secondary outcome measures:
global assessment of functioning, hazardous alcohol use,
use of illicit drugs, working or being in education, independent
living, subjective satisfaction with life or suicide.
Results were similar in subgroup analyses.
Conclusions The implementation of a modified assertive
community treatment was not followed by subsequent
improvements of 5-year outcome on a group level for
patients with first-episode psychosis.

Many real-world optimization problems are dynamic (time dependent) and require an algorithm that is able to continuously track a changing optimum over time. In this paper, we investigate a recently proposed algorithm for dynamic continuous optimization, called MLSDO (Multiple Local Search algorithm for Dynamic Optimization). MLSDO is based on several coordinated local search agents and on the archiving of the optima found over time. This archive is used when a change occurs in the objective function. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on the set of benchmark functions provided for the IEEE WCCI-2012 Competition on Evolutionary Computation for Dynamic Optimization Problems.

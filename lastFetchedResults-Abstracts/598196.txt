The purpose of this study is to investigate the manager training needs assessment techniques adopted by Pakistan corporate sector, especially in Islamabad and Rawalpindi region, and its impact on training outcomes. The finding related to TNA comprehensiveness was disparate because majority of the organization are using only one level or personal level analysis for their managers training needs assessment. So, it has negative impact on the outcomes of training. The study revealed that training in Pakistan is mostly subjective based. Objectivity of the training is less emphasized during their training session. These desperate results are basically due to lack of comprehensive managerial TNA approach used by corporate sectors in Pakistan before conducting training program. The objective of our study is to mention the drawback which corporate sector is facing regarding TNA and training outcomes and also relate the TNA comprehensiveness to effective outcome of training.

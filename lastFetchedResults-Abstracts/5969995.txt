The goal of this paper is a presentation of the possibilities of the application of syntactic methods to the recognition of the local stenoses of the lumen of coronary arteries, and to the detection of pathological signs in upper parts of ureter ducts and renal calyxes. An analysis of the correct morphology of these structures is possible thanks to the application of sequence and tree methods from the group of syntactic methods of pattern recognition. In the case of the analysis of coronary artery images, the main objective is a computer-aided early diagnosis of the different forms of cardiac ischemic diseases. In the analysis of kidney radiograms the main goal is the recognition of local irregularities in ureter lumens, and an examination of the morphology of renal pelvis and calyxes

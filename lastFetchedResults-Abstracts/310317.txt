Objective
The aim of this study was to find a pre-interventional marker with the capacity to predict in-stent restenosis (ISR). Considering the anti-atherosclerotic role of adiponectin (APO), an adipocytokine with anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, anti-oxidative and anti-thrombotic properties, low plasma levels of APO might be correlated with the risk of ISR. We investigated the correlations between the plasma levels of APO and two markers of inflammation: lipoprotein associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) and myeloperoxidase (MPO).
Design and methods
80 patients with angiographically significant stenosis underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stent. Plasma APO concentration and plasma Lp-PLA2 and MPO activities were evaluated immediately before and after PCI, then followed-up at 24, 48, 72 h, and at 1, 3, 6 months, respectively. ISR was evaluated at 6 months after stenting by follow-up coronary angiograms, and it was defined as > 50% stenosis of the target lesion.
Results
ISR was present in 33.75% of patients. Baseline APO plasma concentration, measured before PCI, was lower in ISR patients than those without ISR [3.97 (± 1.05) vs 6.65 (± 2.95) μg/mL respectively, p < 0.001]. The patients with APO values less than 4.9 μg/mL at discharge were more susceptible to develop ISR (odd ratio, 4.27; 95% CI, 1.56–11.72, p < 0.001). ISR rate was independent of inflammation markers Lp-PLA2 and MPO baseline values, measured before PCI.
Conclusions
The persistence of a low APO plasma level at discharge and 6 months afterwards may be used as a clinically useful marker for ISR prediction in patients undergoing PCI.

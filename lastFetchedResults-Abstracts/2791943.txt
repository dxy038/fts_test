A link layer protocol that supports multi-rate on OCDMA network is proposed based on multi-coding techniques to improve the performance of the network Our objective is to allow users of different data rates to access the network simultaneously without affecting or reducing the networks performance. Signature sequences are achieved using OCFHC/OOC 2D codes. System throughput and average packet delay are derived for two receiver models, namely, the correlation and chip-level receivers. In our analysis, we only take the effect of multiple access interference (MAI) into account and neglect the effect of receiver noise, as it is relatively minor. The network users are classified into two classes with two different transmission rates. Furthermore, the number of classes is generalized and we are able to show that the overall performance of the network is even better.

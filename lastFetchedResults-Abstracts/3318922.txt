A signal forwarding strategy with constraints on interference and noise leakage to multiple neighboring nodes and quality of services (QoS) to multiple destination nodes is proposed. The objective is to relay signals from multiple sources to multiple destinations using a set of relay nodes with minimum possible transmission power while achieving desired QoS for destination nodes and minimum possible interference and noise power leaked to other active nodes in the wireless systems. We solve the problem using a convex optimization framework by invoking semidefinite relaxation. The proposed approach has the ability to regulate interference temperature at various terminals in the wireless network while forwarding signals from multiple sources to destinations as demonstrated in the Monte Carlo based simulation results.

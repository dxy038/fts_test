The objective of the paper is to describe the genetic fuzzy-based method of designing the gain scheduling control system, which is the effective and wide used adaptive technique based on varying controller parameters according to the exogenous variables. The problem is addressed in the paper to find the minimum set of linear controllers scheduled by fuzzy interpolation scheme. The proposed method is based on the pole placement approach and interval mathematic used to define the desired region of poles around the operating point at which the controller is designed. The genetic algorithm is used to explore of searching space by competition between the fuzzy gain scheduling systems differing in number of fuzzy partitions distributed within the intervals of scheduling variables, and fine tuning the membership functions. The proposed approach is addressed in the paper to the anti-sway crane control problem.

Design
Case Report
Setting
University Medical Center
Participants
Premenarchal subject
Interventions
vaginogram, vaginal septum resection
Results
Vaginal septum resection with resolution of vaginal discharge.
Conclusions
This case demonstrates some of the typical features of uterus didelphys bicollis with incomplete obstructing hemivagina, but had a unique presentation with premenarchal, recurrent vaginal discharge. Typically, patients with an obstructing mullerian anomaly present after menarche with pelvic pain and a mass. The vaginogram assists in the preoperative definition of abnormal anatomy which allows the surgeon to develop the most appropriate surgical approach. Resection of this incompletely obstructing vaginal septum resulted in resolution of the recurrent vaginal discharge

Wireless Sensor Network, composed of tiny sensor devices and wireless network, is mainly responsible for any kind of ambience surveillance. Due to the peripheral atmosphere in which it is deployed, tiny sensors or the network might be too much fault prone. It is beneficial if and only if sensed values are fault free and it can traverse through fault free path. Thus it is necessary to monitor the network and the sensor nodes in regular interval to generate required result for application specific decision making. Network lifetime play the crucial role in order to monitor network health. It is critical as a certain percentage of the total number of sensor nodes along with its connectivity should remain alive for smooth operation of the network. The objective of this paper is to propose an energy aware fault tolerant framework in wireless sensor network. Fault detection algorithm and maximization of network lifetime in wireless sensor network is also proposed together with the calculated energy consumption of the sensor nodes for performing various tasks, including self fault checking, in the network. Simulation result for the proposed algorithm is also presented in this paper.

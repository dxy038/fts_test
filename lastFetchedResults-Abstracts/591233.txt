Proliferation of different plants is need for micropropogation and its in vitro studies. Optimizing and maximizing shoot proliferation is a basic objective of micropropagation and much attention has been focused on components that used in the culture medium and type of medium. Gami Almasi is a dwarf rootstock of apple (Malus domestica Borkh) that grow on North West of Iran and suitable for different cultivars of apple. In this study two different basal medium containing N6 and MS salts with different biochemical components involve Phloroglucinol(PG), active charcoal(AC) and Gibberellic acid (GA), was tested  on proliferation and shoot elongation. In vitro growing shoots were used for these experiments. In results MS medium was better than N6 in apple proliferation case. Active charcoal hasn't any effect on in vitro proliferation. Phloroglucinol as a phloridzin derivative have significant effect on proliferation. Phloroglucinol induced the transient proliferation in first month after culture and GA induced stable proliferation of shoots. The combine Phloroglucinol at 80 mg/l and GA at 2 mg/l have the best results in proliferation of apple shoots. Results from in vitro experiments indicated enhanced proliferation of apple shoots and also the occurrence of hyperhydric shoots was lower in the Phloroglucinol medium. Active charcoal has not significant effect on proliferation of apple.

OBJECTIVES

Our objective was to define the outcomes of patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) due to severe mitral regurgitation (MR) complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

BACKGROUND

Methods for early identification and optimal treatment of such patients have not been defined.

METHODS

The SHOCK Trial Registry enrolled 1,190 patients with CS complicating AMI. We compared 1) the cohort with severe mitral regurgitation (MR, n = 98) to the cohort with predominant left ventricular failure (LVF, n = 879), and 2) the MR patients who underwent valve surgery (n = 43) to those who did not (n = 51).

RESULTS

Shock developed early after MI in both the MR (median 12.8 h) and LVF (median 6.2 h) cohorts. The MR patients were more often female (52% vs. 37%, p = 0.004) and less likely to have ST elevation at shock diagnosis (41% vs. 63%, p < 0.001). The MR index MI was more frequently inferior (55% vs. 44%, p = 0.039) or posterior (32% vs. 17%, p = 0.002) than that of LVF and much less frequently anterior (34% vs. 59%, p < 0.001). Despite having higher mean LVEF (0.37 vs. 0.30, p = 0.001) the MR cohort had similar in-hospital mortality (55% vs. 61%, p = 0.277). The majority of MR patients did not undergo mitral valve surgery. Those undergoing surgery exhibited higher mean LVEF than those not undergoing surgery; nevertheless, 39% died in hospital.

CONCLUSIONS

The data highlight opportunities for early identification and intervention to potentially decrease the devastating mortality and morbidity of severe post-myocardial infarction MR.

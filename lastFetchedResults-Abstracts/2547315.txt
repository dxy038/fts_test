The main objective of this study was to describe the proper technological process of hot smoking of common carp as well as to determine the yield of the final product and also proximate and fatty acid composition of hot-smoked common carp meat. The average yield of smoked common carp was 82.19% based on weight of eviscerated and descaled fish or 47% based on weight of live fish. The smoking process reduced moisture content by 19% and increased protein by 35% and lipid by 28%. Increase of cholesterol level from 50 to 51.93% during the smoking process was not statistically significant. Unsaturated fatty acid content was found to be higher in smoked than in raw common carp, mainly due to the increase in the contents of both monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids. These values were higher compared to those of saturated fatty acids which were almost the same in raw (25.38%) and in smoked (25.5%) carp. Furthermore, n-3 content was not affected by the smoking process and the n-3/n-6 ratio. The results of the present research indicate that hot smoking process affects the chemical and fatty acid composition of traditionally hot smoked common carp.

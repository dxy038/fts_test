One of the most fundamental components of healthcar
e systems is the blood supply 
chain  management. This  chain  has  two  significant  co
mponents  including  collecting 
donor’ bloods and supplying blood’s products. The m
ain purpose of this paper is to 
concentrate  on  supplying  blood  products  and  present
  a  novel  constrained  bi-
objective   mathematical   model   for   a   two-echelon   bloo
d   supply   chain   network 
(BSCN).  The  aims  of  the  proposed  model  are:  1)  mini
mize  products’  waste  and 
shortage costs in  hospitals and 2) to minimize the 
maximum  unsatisfied demand of 
different  products  among  hospital  demands  supplied 
by  blood  transfusion  centers. 
Some  techniques  are  used  to  linearize  the  model’s  n
onlinear  terms  and  decrease 
presented model’s complexity. A multi-choice goal p
rogramming (MCGP) technique 
is used to convert bi-objective model into a single
 objective one. The model is solved 
by  mathematical  software  under  3  different  scenario
s  and  18  time  periods  in  real-
world  BSCN.  Computational  results  showed  that  hospi
tals  are  tended  in  accepting 
products’ holding and waste costs to satisfy demand
s of patients who are highly need 
for receiving blood products.

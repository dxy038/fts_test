The objective of this paper is to introduce a reverse modeling method based on sectional feature, and mainly represent the extraction method of sectional feature. Extraction of parametric sectional feature is the key issue of feature-based reverse modeling, which is the mainly approach for capturing design intent and rapidly innovative design. Therefore, this paper presented a method by obtaining sectional data from scanned data, fitting curves from sectional data, and then obtaining sectional feature with parametric sketch, finally achieving the feature-based reverse modeling. In this paper, a hubcap was used as a case study to illustrate the process we presented. It was proved an efficient way for reconstruction parametric model based on sectional feature.

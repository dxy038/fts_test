This paper presents a battery supplying a bidirectional Z-Source Inverter (ZSI) feeding a three phase induction motor. The indirect field-oriented control (IFOC) method is used to control the induction motor speed during motoring and regenerative braking operations. The IFOC is implemented based on PWM voltage modulation with voltage decoupling compensation. A dual loop controller is designed, based on a small signal model, to control the bidirectional ZSI capacitor voltage using the bode diagram. In addition, this paper presents the gird interface mode with its control to charge or discharge the battery from the grid. MATLAB simulation results verified the validity of the proposed control strategies during motoring, regenerative braking and grid interface operations. Experimental setup of the bidirectional ZSI is under progress.

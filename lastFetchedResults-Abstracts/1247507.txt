Mobile rose systems are designed to increase labour efficiency. However, many questions remain on best design and settings of operational parameters for best performance. The ultimate goal of this research is an assessment of re-designed horticultural crop production systems and work scenarios on labour and machine performance before implementation. To attain this goal, a queueing network model, GWorkS-rose, is presented for simulation of labour processes in a greenhouse with a mobile rose cultivation system. The objective for modelling is to quantify effects of production system changes by means of a flexible and generic model approach. A state-of-the-art mobile rose production system was used to validate and test the GWorkS-rose model. Data from the labour registration system and from video recordings were used for validation. System performance was simulated and compared to the performance measured in the real situation. Results of a single day validation show that the model estimates harvest labour time with an accuracy of 94%. For a one month validation an accuracy of 92% and RRMSE of 18% resulted. The value of RRMSE was caused by missing data on the number of workers at the loop and on the actual gutter speed level. The model can determine best system settings as is illustrated for operator and mobile gutter speed settings at given rose yield levels. It is concluded that the model can be used for studies on design and management of this kind of production systems.

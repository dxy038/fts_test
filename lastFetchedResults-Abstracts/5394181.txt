Directed diffusion is a prominent example of data-centric routing in sensor networks, since it is based on application layer data and purely local interactions. However, its functioning relies heavily on expensive operations, like network-wide flooding, that may decrease the protocol performance in densely deployed networks. In this paper, we take a first step towards understanding the performance of directed diffusion in dense sensor networks. Our objective is to precisely identify the protocolÂ´s weaknesses in such application scenarios, in order to allow adequate optimizations for better performance.

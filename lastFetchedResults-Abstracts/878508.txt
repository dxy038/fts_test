general compartmental model of the spread of an infectious disease with mass action incidence is given. The global
stability of this system is completely determined using Lyapunov functions. The general system exhibits the traditional threshold
behaviour. The dimension of the system is arbitrary, allowing, in particular, for detailed modelling of the distribution of latency
times for tuberculosis.

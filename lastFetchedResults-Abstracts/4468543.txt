In this paper, the author first gave a thoughtful analysis of the necessity of why there is an urgent need for China to quickly train the internationally qualified software talents and then reviewed the current situation of China software talent market and software industry. By categorizing the software professionals on the sector, a definition of high-level software talents with global suitability (or global reach capability, or adaptivity) is described and the characteristic of such talents is discussed. The objective and subjective conditions for such talents to grow out are pointed out. Finally the systematic way of how to effectively train such talents is suggested. Hopefully, the suggestions made in this paper will be of general interest to the policy makers of the government, IT entities and educational (training) institutions.

The optimization of software cybernetics in complex environment is of great significance and extreme difficulty. This paper proposes a novel generalized particle dynamics model (GPDM) for software cybernetics in the context of optimal allocation of software resources and software jobs in complex environment. The GPDM approach transforms software cybernetics problems into the kinematics and dynamics of particles in a force-field. The conception, dynamics, algorithm and property of GPDM are discussed. The GPDM approach has many advantages in terms of the high-scale parallelism, multi-objective optimization, multi-type coordination, multi-degree autonomy, multi-granularity coalition, and the ability to deal complex phenomena in distributed software environment

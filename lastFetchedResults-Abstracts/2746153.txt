Target localization based on angle of arrival (AoA) is an important branch of location estimation research. Due to the noisy measurements from sensors and the non-linear inverse trigonometry function, the AoA-based localization induces a non-convex optimization that is difficult to solve with both high speed and accuracy simultaneously. To achieve a fast and accurate algorithm, we propose a convex combination scheme. By introducing a highly accurate linear approximation to the inverse trigonometric function, the objective is converted to a convex function, which can be solved efficiently with linear least-squares approach. The key point of the convex combination scheme is to express the coordinate of the target as the convex combination of a set of virtual anchors around its real position. Simulations demonstrate that the accuracy of this method is very close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound and that the comprehensive performance, including the accuracy and speed, is significantly improved compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

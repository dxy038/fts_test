Intra-frame plays a significant role in controlling video quality for H.264/AVC rate control. In this paper, we present an adaptive current buffer fullness ratio-based intra-frame rate control for H.264/AVC. The proposed algorithm adaptively adjusts the quantization step (QP) of the intra-frame by taking current buffer fullness ratio and scene change into consideration. Experimental results show that compared with JM11.0, the proposed algorithm increases average PSNR up to 2.59 dB and significantly reduces PSNR deviation and frame skipping. It improves objective and subjective reconstructed video qualities.

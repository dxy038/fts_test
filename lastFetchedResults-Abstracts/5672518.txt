With the coordinated development of water eco environment and socio-economy of the Prince Edward river Basin as the objective, the concept of water ecological carrying capacity of river basin and Evaluation index system was proposed. Based on the relationships between demographic, social economy, water resources, water environment and aquatic ecosystems, and the relationships of the water flow, water quality in the districts, the system dynamics simulation model and quantitative model for basin water ecological carrying capacity was established, using the combination method of systematic dynamics with membership degree. After the water ecological carrying capacity of 8 districts wore Calculated, this conclusion was obtained: the water ecological carrying capacity of Natural ecological zone (C Zone) is good (above 0.6), the reservoir ecological zones (E area) and mixed ecological zones (F area) followed by (above 0.4), agro-ecological zones (H, I zone), and urban ecology Area (D, G, J District) was the worst (above 0.3). According to the characteristics of each district, corresponding measures for the improvement of water ecological carrying capacity (water conservation, pollution control, adjust the industrial structure, etc.) wore proposed, whereby which providing the scientific basis for the implementation of the sustainable development strategy.

The main objective of this paper is to analyze the Load Frequency Control(LFC) of a two-area interconnected hydrothermal system considering a Thyristor Controlled Phase Shifter(TCPS) in series with the tie-line . The proposed controller are tested for a two area hydrothermal system considering the practical aspect of the problem such as Deadband and Generation Rate Constraint (GRC) etc. First of all, modeling of the two area hydrothermal system is performed and then there is a installation of TCPS incorporated with Tie-Line. After it, TCPS control scheme is implemented in the given two area power system. Here we consider the ISE (Integral Square Error) as a objective function which is to be minimize and by using optimization technique via Genetic Algorithms, hence, minimize the system error and corresponding integral gain of the system is obtained for stabilization of system frequency deviation as well as net tie-line power flow of the two area hydrothermal system kept within the normal operating range.

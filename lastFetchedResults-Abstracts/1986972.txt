Abstract
Introduction: : Due to the importance of Rifampin on Tuberculosis treatment and the high prevalence of brucellosis and tuberculosis in Iran, it is necessary to replace Rifampin in brucellosis treatment with other drugs that are better tolerated and have fewer side effects.
Methods: This research is a double-blinded clinical trial in which 36 patients were in group 1 prescribed by doxycycline capsule and garlic tablet for 8 weeks plus gentamicin for one week and 36 patients were enrolled as group 2 being prescribed by doxycycline and rifampin for 8 weeks plus gentamicin for one week. The data were collected and analyzed by SPSS version18.
Result: The mean age was 40.2±17.1 in group 1 and 40.1±15.9 in group 2. Treatment failore was 8.8% in group 1 and 7.8%  in group 2. There was no significant difference in rate between two groups (P=0.62). The disease recurrence after 9 months was 14.7% in group 1 and 8.6% in group 2 (p=0.42).
Conclusion: Due to the same effect of garlic and Rifampin in this study and in order to prevent rifampin resistance in tuberculosis patients and its less side effects, it is recommended to replace garlic as an alternative drug in brucellosis treatment.

The implementation of a hybrid fuel cell/battery system is proposed to improve the slow transient response of a fuel cell stack. This system can be used for an autonomous device with quick load variations. A suitable three-port, galvanic isolated, bidirectional power converter is proposed to control the power flow. An energy management method for the proposed three-port circuit is analyzed and implemented. Measurements from a 500-W laboratory prototype are presented to demonstrate the validity of the approach

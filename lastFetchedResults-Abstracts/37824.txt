The objective of this investigation was to compare two biological systems using attachedgrowth biomass, for treatment of leachates generated in a typical municipal solid waste sanitary landfill. A moving-bed biofilm process, which is a relatively new type of biological treatment system, has been examined. It is based on the use of small, free-floating polymeric (polyurethane) elements, while biomass is being grown and attached as biofilm on the surface of these porous carriers. A granular activated carbon (GAC) moving-bed biofilm process was also tested. This method combines both physico-chemical and biological removal mechanisms for the removal of pollutants. The presence of GAC offers a suitable porous media, which is able to adsorb both organic matter and ammonia, as well as to provide an appropriate surface onto which biomass can be attached and grown. A laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was used for the examination of both carriers. The effects of different operation strategies on the efficiency of these biological treatment processes were studied in order to optimize their performance, especially for the removal of nitrogen compounds and of biodegradable organic matter. It has been found that these processes were able to remove nitrogen content almost completely and simultaneously, the removal of organic matter (expressed as BOD5 and COD), color and turbidity were sufficiently achieved.

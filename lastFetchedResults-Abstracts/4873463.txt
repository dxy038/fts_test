A nonlinear control law is proposed to asymptotically stabilize a single machine infinite bus (SMIB) system based on immersion and invariance (I&amp;I) control strategy. The actuator used is a controllable series capacitor (CSC). The SMIB system is described using the nonlinear second order swing equation model, and the CSC is modeled using a first order system. The control objective here is to approximate the complete third order system with a second order dynamics, for which we have an asymptotically stabilizing control law.

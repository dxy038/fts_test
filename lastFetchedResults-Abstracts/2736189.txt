Our analysis of the underlying mechanisms of research organizations focuses on the effects of strong and weak ties on individual research performance. It follows a contingency approach where these effects depend on access to organizational and individual resources. Building on network theory, relationship management literature, and prior research on individual innovative behavior, we suggest interaction effects between the access to networks and the resource supply. Based on merged objective and survey data from 255 surgeons in 18 medical universities and hospitals in the U.S., we are able to show that the effect of networks depends on tie strength, the organization where a researcher is active, and, finally, on his or her innovation-related characteristics. Strong and weak ties both contribute to individual research performance. However, leading-edge researchers with sufficient access to organizational resources will especially profit from strong ties. Their inexperienced colleagues working in hospitals with less research resources should engage in weak ties.

Abstract
Introduction and Objective:
Exam anxiety, if it be severe can also cause health problems for the individuals. The one of mechanisms that is involved in nxiety-related physical diseases is imbalance of antioxidants and oxidants. The aim of this study was to investigate total antioxidants and oxidants in exam anxiety condition.
Materials and Methods:
The present study is a before and after research that was conducted on 48 female students and performed in two stage. In each stage 4ml of blood was taken from each individual. Cortisol, total antioxidants and oxidants were determined in serum. Mean markers of proteins in two stages were compared using paired t-test or Wilcoxon rank test. Correlations between parameters were examined by Pearson Correlation test. The minimal level of significance was set at P < 0.05.
Results
Cortisol and total oxidants levels were significantly higher during the exam period than after vacation (P < 0.001). The level of total antioxidants and oxidative stress index were significantly lower during exam period compared with the post exam period (P < 0.001). In exam period, there was a negative correlation between serum total antioxidant levels and cortisol concentration (r = -0.42, P < 0.01). We found no significant correlation between serum cortisol level with total oxidants in exam period (r=0.275, P < 0.05). 
Discussion
High serum cortisol level in exams period compared with after vacation is indicated that the students experience the anxiety during exam. The high level of total oxidants and low level of total antioxidants during the exam period compared with non-exam period denoted occurrence of oxidative stress in exam anxiety.

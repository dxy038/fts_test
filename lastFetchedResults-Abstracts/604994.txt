Abstract
Strawberry production in Kurdistan province, which produces more than 70 percent of the national production, is important from variety of aspects such as creation of employment and income for rural households. However, production in Kurdistan province has some problems; these had lead to that the production and yield, in this province, are far below the global average. The main objective of this study is "to determine the technical efficiency of different strawberry producers in the city of Sanandaj". For this purpose, the data collected from 129 cultivators by questionnaire in 1388-89 crop years. To achieve the objectives, the Translog production function and the estimation of simultaneous frontier production function and inefficiency have been used. The results showed that technical efficiency of farms of this product is between the range of 0.42 - 0.98, and the mean technical efficiency in about 0.83. The study inefficiency model also showed that the variables of "education", "sponsorship", "experience" and "number of weeding" had a negative effect on inefficiency, and the variables of "number of pieces", "age of plants" and "distance of plants" have a positive effect on the inefficiency.

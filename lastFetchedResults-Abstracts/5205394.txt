The circuit performance of the Phase-shift (PS) and PWM plus phase-shift (PPS) control schemes is compared in this paper to optimize the bidirectional conversion efficiency. The comparison is implemented with the isolated winding-coupled zero voltage switching (ZVS) bidirectional DC-DC converter (BDC). The theoretical analysis, simulation and experimental results show that the PPS control strategy is an optimal case of the PS control when the low-side voltage and high-side voltage is matched. Furthermore, the PPS control can enhance the capability of the power transmission and reduce the current stress of the power switches compared with PS control. Moreover, ZVS operation can be realized from no load to full load with PPS control scheme. However, there is one case in PS control, where ZVS operation is not reached. Finally, the experimental results prove that the efficiency with PPS scheme is higher than that with PS scheme. The conclusions can be extended to other PS and PPS controlled BDCs.

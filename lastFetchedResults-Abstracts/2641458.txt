Objective (s): Health literacy is the capacity and the ability to access to, and understand, health information to maintain and improve. The current study aimed to investigate the relationship between health literacy and postpartum depression among nulliparous pregnant women who referred to health centers in Karaj, Iran.
Methods: A prospective study was carried out on a sample of 348 nulliparous women in third trimester of their pregnancy. They have completed a demographic, a reproductive questionnaire, the Health Literacy Inventory for Adults (HELIA). In addition they have completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as outcome measures at two points in time at baseline and at 8th week after delivery. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between health literacy and depression.
Results: The mean health literacy among women was 67.30(Â±14/66) indicating that 39/6% of women had limited health literacy. The prevalence of postpartum depression was 21.6%. The results of multivariable logistic regression showed that in addition to depression during pregnancy (OR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.08-1.37, P=0.001) and type of delivery (OR for cesarean section for medical reasons: 5.58, 95% CI: 2.79-11.16, P  < 0/001(, health literacy score (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99, P=0.033) was significantly associated with postpartum depression.
Conclusion: The findings suggest that postpartum depression significantly is associated with health literacy in nulliparous women. It seems that promoting health literacy among this population could lead to significant reduction in e postpartum depression.

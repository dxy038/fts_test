The objective of this research is to provide a new model of color imagery which is metrically consistent and differentiable. The differential-geometric approach of the model is: coordinate consistent, metrically consistent and differentiable. None of the variety of color edge detection algorithms in the literature address the differential geometric aspect proposed in the paper

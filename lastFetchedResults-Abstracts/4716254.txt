For the purpose of rarefying the effect of interior perturbations and exterior noise on path tracking performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), a robust control method is introduced. We earn the dynamic equations of an UAV from Euler-Lagrange formulation and convert it into state space representation. In order to achieve the tracking objective, a mixed H<inf>2</inf>/H<inf>&#8734;</inf> controller is utilized to stabilize the movement of a hovering UAV, diminish the influence of internal perturbations and lessen external disturbances. In the end, the simulation results indicate that the UAV successfully follows the reference trajectory. This corroborates that the control strategy is robust and dependable.

Frequent machinery traffic on sloping vineyard influences spatial distribution of soil physical properties. Our objective was to assess the effects of crawler tractor traffic across the slope (20%) on spatial distribution of soil strength and water content of silt loam soil under controlled grass cover and conventionally cultivated vineyard. The experiment was situated on hillside vineyard (NW, Italy) arranged with rows crosswise the slope. The grass covered treatment included periodical mowing and chopping of herbs and the cultivated treatmentâ€”autumn ploughing (18 cm) and spring and summer rotary-hoeing in the vineyard inter-rows (2.7 m). A crawler tractor (2.82 Mg) was used at the same locations across the slope for all tillage and chemical operations. The measurements of soil bulk density, penetration resistance and volumetric water content were done in autumn (after vintage) within the sloping inter-row. The results were analyzed using classic statistics and geostatistics with and without trend. The highest variability was obtained for penetration resistance (CV 56.6%) and the lowest for bulk density (9.6%). In most cases, the semivariograms of the soil parameters were well described by spherical models. The semivariance parameters of all properties measured were influenced by trend. Three-dimensional (3D) maps well identified areas with the highest soil strength in lower crawler ruts being positioned in the upper side of vine row and successively lower strength in upper ruts situated on other side of the same row and inter-rut area. Higher strength in lower than upper ruts was induced by tractor's tilt and resulting higher ground contact pressure. Soil water content in both treatments was the lowest below the upper rut and increased in inter-rut and lower rut areas. The differences in the soil properties between the places within the inter-row were more pronounced in grass covered than in cultivated soil.

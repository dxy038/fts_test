This paper mainly focus on the hazard materials treatment center location problem using the fuzzy multi-objective programming approach. We consider the factor of treating volume of each treatment center into the classical max-min model. The problem is formulated as a bi-objective problem, which is rarely studied previously. Additionally, to provide a more realistic model structure, decision makerÂ´s imprecise aspiration levels for the goals are incorporated into the model through fuzzy modelling approach. In the decision process, a fuzzy goal programming method is developed. We also discuss the computing approach and prove that the fuzzy optimal solution has a good performance.

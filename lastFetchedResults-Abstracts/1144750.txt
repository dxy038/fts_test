A simple method to detect audible echoes is proposed as an objective criterion for room acoustics. This method evaluates the perceptibility of sound reflections that are generated by an impulsive sound source and identifies from reflectograms harmful reflections perceived as echoes. Particularly with this method, the masking effect of reverberation is taken into consideration, which cannot be treated sufficiently by the existing objective criteria. The applicability to room acoustical design is verified by evaluating the impulse responses measured in real halls where audible echoes occurred. It is shown that the proposed method detects audible echoes at an accuracy of more than 90% and would be suitable for practical use.

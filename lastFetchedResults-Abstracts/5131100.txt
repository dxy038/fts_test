The main objective of this paper is to provide a brief and necessary background of dielectrics in the field of space technology. The mobile telephone, TV, Radio, Satellite or any type of modern communication is not possible without one type of antenna or the other and no radar works without an antenna. Antenna is a sensor of electromagnetic waves. Electric and magnetic fields exist in a dielectric material and also penetrate the dielectric material freely. When an electromagnetic wave is incident normally on the surface of a dielectric, reflection and transmission takes place. In this investigation, dielectric polarization studies were made in the liquid dielectric mixtures Epichlorohydrin, p-cresol in benzene using standard methods at 308K.The values of dielectric constant, refractive index and density were measured at different concentrations. The dipolar increment value has been calculated using Huyskens method based on OnsagerÂ´s theory.

Dietary supplements are not subject to the same pre-market approval as conventional drugs, thus the true efficacy and, in cases, safety of these products is not known. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential anti-inflammatory properties of three herbal constituents, apigenin (chamomile), ginsenoside Rb1 (ginseng) and parthenolide (feverfew) on lipopolysaccaharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory cytokine production, and to determine if effects in cell culture could predict results in an intact animal model. Murine macrophage cells and mice were treated with the stimulant LPS and herbal constituents, and resultant culture supernatant and serum, respectively, were evaluated for interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α by ELISA. All three constituents inhibited LPS-induced IL-6 and/or TNF-α production in culture. Inhibition of these two cytokines was observed in mice, but did not display the same patterns of inhibition as cell culture data. The results suggest that all three constituents possessed anti-inflammatory properties, but that cell culture data can only be used to approximate potential effects in animals, and must be confirmed using appropriate animal models.

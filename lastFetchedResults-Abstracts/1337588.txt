This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a constant rate infusion (CRI) of xylazine or xylazine in combination with lidocaine on nociception, sedation, and physiologic values in horses. Six horses were given intravenous (IV) administration of a loading dose (LD) of 0.55 mg/kg of xylazine followed by a CRI of 1.1 mg/kg/hr. The horses were randomly assigned to receive three treatments, on different occasions, administered 10 minutes after initiation of the xylazine CRI, as follows: control, physiologic saline; lidocaine low CRI (LLCRI), lidocaine (LD: 1.3 mg/kg, CRI: 0.025 mg/kg/min); and lidocaine high CRI (LHCRI), lidocaine (LD: 1.3 mg/kg, CRI: 0.05 mg/kg/min). A blinded observer assessed objective and subjective data for 50 minutes during the CRIs. In all treatments, heart and respiratory rates decreased, end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration increased, and moderate to intense sedation was observed, but no significant treatment effect was detected in these variables. Ataxia was significantly higher in LHCRI than in the control treatment at 20 minutes of infusion. Compared with baseline values, nociceptive threshold increased to as much as 79% in the control, 190% in LLCRI, and 158% in LHCRI. Nociceptive threshold was significantly higher in LLCRI (at 10 and 50 minutes) and in LHCRI (at 30 minutes) than in the control treatment. The combination of CRIs of lidocaine with xylazine produced greater increases in nociceptive threshold compared with xylazine alone. The effects of xylazine on sedation and cardiorespiratory variables were not enhanced by the coadministration of lidocaine. The potential to increase ataxia may contraindicate the clinical use of LHCRI, in combination with xylazine, in standing horses.

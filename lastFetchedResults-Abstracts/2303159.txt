ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in Iran with a diverse geographic distribution. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of colorectal cancer and assess the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of survivors in the city of Babol, Iran.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, all new cases of colorectal cancer, recorded by the Cancer Registry Center of Babol, were included for the assessment of the incidence of colorectal cancer during 2007-2012. Clinical and epidemiologic features of patients were investigated via interview in 2013.
FINDINGS: A total of 237 patients were registered during the specified period, although only 120 subjects had survived until 2013. Age-standardized rate was 7.7 per 100,000 people in 2007, which increased to 14.6 in 2012. Overall, 54% of subjects were urban residents, 46% were illiterate, 30% were smokers, 16% used hookah, and 10% consumed opium. Family history of colorectal cancer was reported in 27 patients (22.5%). The average age of survivors was 56.74±14.14 years; about a third of patients were younger than 50 years at the time of diagnosis. The mean interval between the presentation of symptoms and diagnosis was 10±13.3 months, and the most common symptoms of the disease included altered bowel habits, rectorhalgia, abdominal pain, constipation, and weight loss, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The obtained results showed the increased incidence of colorectal cancer in Babol city. Considering the significant number of young people and the long interval between the onset of symptoms and definitive diagnosis, it is recommended that training courses on the warning signs and screening of colorectal cancer be planned.

<p><strong>Objective</strong>: This study investigated the effect of body mass index (BMI) on the success rate of IVF for couples with different causes of infertility.<br /><strong>Materials and methods</strong>: In a cross sectional descriptive- analytic study conducted simultaneously in Mehr IVF center and Vali-e-Asr Reproductive Health Research Center, the success rate of IVF was examined in 396 consecutive women undergoing IVF cycles. Clinical pregnancy rate per first cycle of IVF was evaluated with regard to BMI. SPSS 11 software was used for statistical analyses. Significance level was identified as P&lt; 0.05 in data analysis.<br /><strong>Results</strong>: Women with a BMI of 27 kg/m2 had a significantly lower pregnancy rate compared with normal weight women (BMI 20 and &lt;27 kg/m2), OR = 0.67 (95% CI 0.48-0.94).For male infertility the rate of pregnancy per cycle was significantly lower than unexplained infertility, OR = 0.70 (95% CI 0.57-0.86.) For tubal pathology the rate was slightly lower than unexplained infertility, OR = 0.86 (95% CI 0.70-1.01).<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Overweight unfavorably affects the pregnancy rate after IVF. Infertile couples may improve the outcome of IVF treatment by lifestyle changes.</p>

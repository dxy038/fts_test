We have not properly studied the uses to which catalogs are put by
their users, nor have we attempted until recently to consider empirical
evidence in the construction of cataloging rules. The result is
an oddly rationalized sort of pragmatism inherent in generations
of rules for resource description. This lack of theoretical commitment
in resource description has ethical implications for all of
information organization because it leads to poorly served users of
catalogs. One particularly egregious ethical issue is bibliocentrism.
Beghtol challenges us to engage in applications research to affirm
a theoretical basis, contrasting cultural warrant with ethical warrant.
The importance of cultural warrant in the ethics of knowledge
representation follows closely on Hjørland’s emphasis on activitytheoretic
and domain-specificity. The present study asks whether
schemas for resource description restrict access by constraining
objectivity. The objective is to discover empirically, via case-study
method, some of the ways in which standards for resource description
might present threats to information ethics. The analysis of a
set of specific cases uses bibliographic records analyzed using the
aforementioned lenses: bibliocentrism, activity theory and use, cultural
warrant, and exploitative power. Results show a paradigm
of description that has little reference to potential uses of resources,
raising a specter of unfulfilled expectations. We see the ethical limits
of just this one aspect of resource description.We look toward design
of an ethical, culturally focused, information retrieval paradigm

Building energy performance indicators is the objective need of achieving energy reduction targets and providing decision support for carrying out relevant policies and measures. The article establish accounting frameworks of energy performance index(EPI) based on Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index(LMDI) decomposition technology which considering the activity effect, structure effect, intensity effect of energy consumption, and enumerate various accounting systems in the world. Then analyze the energy consumption of Beijing during 2000 to 2008 by the accounting frameworks. The result shows that the EPI is 0.815 which means the energy efficiency improving 18.5%, the secondary industry plays an important role in the energy efficiency; Moreover, improving in energy intensity has the greatest negative effect on energy consumption.

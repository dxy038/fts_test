Background and Objectives: Dyslipidemia is a common disorder and one of the major causes of the atherosclerosis development and progression in hemodialysis patients.Timely diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemia can reduce mortality and morbidity of cardiovascular disease and protect the remaining function of kidneys in patients withchronic renal failure. This study was performed with the objective of evaluating the frequency of dyslipidemia and its accompanying factors in hemodialysis patients.

Methods: In a descriptive cross-sectional study, 182 patients with chronic renal failure referred to hemodialysis units of Baqiyatallah and Shahid Chamran hospitals, Tehran in 2012 were studied. Fordata collection, in addition to demographic questionnaire, serum levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL and LDL were measured. Data analysis was done using Chi-square, independent t-test, and one-way ANOVA. The significance level was considered to be p < 0.05.

Results: In this research, 8.2% of the patients had hypercholesterolemia, 26.4% hypertriglyceridemia, and 6.8% LDL level more than 130. In half of the patients, serum HDL was less than 35. A significant relationship was observed betweendyslipidemiaand variables of gender (p=0.001), duration of hemodialysis (p=0.004), education level (p=0.005), and weight (p=0.007).

Conclusion: Dyslipidemiahas a high prevalence in hemodialysis patients, especiallypatients with low literacy and obesity. So that, at least one of the components of lipid profilesis abnormalin more than 80% of hemodialysis patients. Therefore, planning to improve life style and provide training on proper nutrition and physical activity is recommended as one of the principles of care in hemodialysis patients.

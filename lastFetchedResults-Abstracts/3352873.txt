This paper reports measuring contractility of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) using a novel cell force sensor, namely, a double-sided micropillar array (DMA) developed for both single cell force measurements using conventional microscopy as well as high-throughput cell force mapping based on the optical moire&#769; effect. The contraction force map of NRVM cultured on DMA was acquired with nanonewton and submicron scale resolution using confocal microscopy. For the moire&#769;-based method, the local average of the cell contraction force was derived from the moire&#769; pattern, which allows mapping cell contraction force using a 20X objective lens, enabling the acquisition of a larger field-of-view than conventional microscopy.

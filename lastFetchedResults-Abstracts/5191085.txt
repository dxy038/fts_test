Thermal power system concepts are studied for emerging unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) applications to obtain extended mission capability within the smallest possible vehicle size. To achieve this objective, all elements of prospective power systems, particularly all propulsive-related subsystems, must be capable of highly integrated packaging. The application of closed Brayton cycle (CBC) power systems to structure the UUV volumetric efficiency problem is described. Various types of thermal heat sources can be integrated with a CBC engine. The key integration component is the interface heat exchanger that links the heat source to the engine. This heat exchanger design takes various forms depending on the characteristics of the heat source. Heat exchanger configurations that are compatible with various heat source options are presented. Results from several UUV conceptual studies are also presented which support the conclusion that highly integrated CBC designs are fully feasible for underwater power systems

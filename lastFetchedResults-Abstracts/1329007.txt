Background & Objective: the present study was undertaken to ascertain the incidence of early, advanced
cancer cervix and its recurrence and role of chemotherapy in locally advanced cancer cervix.
Material and Methods: The present study was conducted in the Departments of Obstetrics &
Gynaecology, Pathology and Radiotherapy and the specimens examined in the Department of
Pathology of Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India from
July 2009 to July 2010. One hundred histologically confirmed carcinoma cervix cases were divided
into two groups. I: Study group of cases receiving different types of chemotherapy and II: Control
group comprised of cases on pre and postoperative radiotherapy and surgery. Patients were staged
and locally advanced inoperable cases (Stage IB-IVA) were given different types of chemotherapy.
Thereafter subjective and objective assessment was made according to World Health Organization
(WHO) criteria of tumor response.
Results: Majority of cases (60.0%) presented in stage IIB of disease by International Federation
of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification. Commonest symptom was postmenopausal
vaginal bleeding, 70.0% cases. 68.0% & 56.0% cases showed complete response (CR) on
chemotherapy and radiotherapy respectively. Stage IIB patients showed the best response with
CR in 70.0% & partial response (PR) in 16.7% cases. Colposcopic evaluation on 12 -18 months
follow up showed 08 to be disease free, with decrease in size of tumor.
Conclusion: Chemotherapy is an effective mode of therapy and can be considered as an adjunct to
surgery or radiotherapy to improve the overall survival of cancer cervix patients.

The aim of a variable step size normalized least-mean-square (VSS-NLMS) algorithm is to try to solve the conflicting requirement of fast convergence and low misadjustment of the NLMS algorithm. Numerous VSS-NLMS algorithms can be found in the literature with a common point for most of them: they may not work very reliably since they depend on several parameters that are not simple to tune in practice. The objective of this letter is twofold. First, we explain a simple and elegant way to derive VSS-NLMS-type algorithms. Second, a new nonparametric VSS-NLMS is proposed that is easy to control and gives good performances in the context of acoustic echo cancellation

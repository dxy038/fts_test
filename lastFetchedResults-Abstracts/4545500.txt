The Hyperspectral Image Analysis Toolbox (HIAT) is a MATLAB<sup>trade</sup> toolbox for the analysis of hyperspectral imagery. HIAT includes a collection of algorithms for processing of hyperspectral and multispectral imagery under the MATLAB environment. The objective of HIAT is to provide a suite of information extraction algorithms to users of hyperspectral and multispectral imagery across different application domains. HIAT has been developed as part of the NSF Bernard M. Gordon Center for Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Solutionware that seeks to develop a repository of reliable and reusable software tools that can be shared by researchers across research domains. HIAT includes feature extraction and selection, supervised and unsupervised classification algorithms, unmixing, and visualization algorithms developed at the UPRM Laboratory for Applied Remote Sensing and Image Processing. A key limitation of the MATLAB environment is its difficulty in managing large images. Here we investigate the use of the recently released MATLAB Jacket Toolbox that allows implementation of MATLAB programs in GPUs. This paper presents a comparison of the CPU implementation with the GPU implementation of different routines of HIAT.

Concentrations of inorganic anions, both as individual species and biotransformation products, in physiological fluids are of strong concern in clinical studies. To date, analytical methodologies have either required different analytical procedures to determine these analytes in plasma and urine, or extensive sample preparation, or unconventional and often expensive detection schemes, or both. A simple and sensitive capillary electrophoresis (CE) method with direct UV detection was developed for the simultaneous determination of iodide, bromide and nitrate in human plasma and urine, with a special focus on reliable quantification of the trace serum iodide. With the latter objective, the method incorporates a transient isotachophoresis (tITP) procedure enabling an efficient on-line preconcentration of iodide (limit of detection, 1.4 μg l−1) as well as other moderately mobile analytes that fall into the tITP range. The analyses of both types of biofluids were performed using an acidic electrolyte system composed of 0.25 mol l−1 sodium chloride and 7.5 mmol l−1 cetyltrimethylammonium chloride at pH 2.2 and 0.5 mol l−1 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonate (pH 6.0) as terminating electrolyte. Relative standard deviations (R.S.D.) below 3.0% and 9.2% were obtained for within-day and between-day precision, respectively. Resolution and quantification of oxalic acid was also feasible under optimized tITP-CE conditions. Sample preparation required only ultrafiltration (serum) and dilution (urine). A number of plasma and urine samples were evaluated with this assay and the iodide, bromide and nitrate concentrations were in the expected clinical concentration ranges.

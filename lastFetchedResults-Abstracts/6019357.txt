This paper describes the evolution of the 200 mm generation of automated material handling systems in IntelÂ´s semiconductor fabrication facilities. We describe the benefits and challenges in implementing and maintaining these systems. The 300 mm generation of fabrication facilities present some new challenges and opportunities for lowering capital and operational cost while providing for better flexibility through automation. We believe that increased standardization and synergistic design of process equipment, building, operational methodologies and automation systems is required for meeting these new challenges. We conclude by presenting some engineering ideas and design management processes that represent work in progress to meet this objective. We hope to generate discussion and motivate applied research in universities on ideas and equipment that would support cost effective proliferation of automated material handling in the semiconductor industry

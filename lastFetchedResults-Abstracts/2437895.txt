This research provides an analytical tool, fuzzy decision support system (FDSS), to find the precedence of jeopardy in occupations spawning shoulder and neck pain (SNP), an important musculoskeletal disorder and the most ubiquitous pain complaint in an occupational environment. FDSS evaluates and prioritizes the relative importance of the imprecise, uncertain and vague nature of risk factors causing occupational SNP. The objective involves derivation of mechanical-, physical- and psychosocial-related risk categories using knowledge acquisition implemented by identifying the risk factors through literature analysis, conventional and concept mapping interviews with expert neurologists, orthopedists, psychologists and physiotherapists. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is applied as an evaluation tool to measure the significance of the risk factors in each occupation. The results indicate that the proposed system supplements SNP diagnosis experts with more precise key decision support information. This assists health care organizations to systematically identify appropriate occupations that grounds high risk for the occurrence of SNP and so the curative practices can be executed effectively.

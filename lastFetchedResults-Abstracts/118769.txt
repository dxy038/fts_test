The objective of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that it is possible to optimize processing conditions using Response Surface Methodology and human measurements, called sensory indicators, directly at the processing line. Chopping during the manufacture of meat emulsion was studied. The independent variables were process parameters: chopping duration (D), speed (S), temperature (T) and pressure (P). The effects of these four variables on a global index called chopping degree (CD) were determined. CD was calculated by the fusion of five sensory indicators via the implementation of the fuzzy sets theory. The statistical analysis showed that D and S had a significant influence on CD. Utilizing an economic compromise, optimum-processing condit

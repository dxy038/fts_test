Dynamical systems are considered where the control consists of the choice among a finite number fixed vector fields, x&#729; = f<sub>i</sub>(x), where i &#8712; {1,..., N} = A. To avoid pathological cases, it is assumed that the usual Lie-algebraic conditions guaranteeing reachability are satisfied. The control is parameterized by the number of switches, m, a "word" of length m + 1 with alphabet A and a sequence of switching times {&#964;1, ... ,&#964;m}. Two regularization schemes are introduced and motivated, replacing the given problem by a smooth control problem, which can be solved by standard numerical optimal control methods. This solution depends on a regularization parameter &#961;, such that if &#961; &#8594; 0, the original objective is recovered. The regularized control is a smooth function, and its quantization to a predetermined set {u1,...,u<sub>N</sub>} gives the approximation of the switching times and the "word". Substituting the word in the original problem, allows an iterative refinement towards the optimal switching times. Impulsive control determines a timing problem. Here a fixed affine system x&#729; = f(x) + g(x)u is considered where the control takes the singular form u(t) = &#931;<sup>N</sup><sub>i=1</sub> u<sub>i</sub>i&#8706;(t -&#964;<sub>i</sub>). The optimization is over the values u<sub>i</sub> and times &#964;<sub>i</sub>. Optimal pulse vaccination as a control of epidemics and the optimal scheduling of chemotherapy in cancer are discussed as applications of optimal timing problems.

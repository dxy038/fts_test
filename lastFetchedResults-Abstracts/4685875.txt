Using well-established techniques of Genetic Programming (GP), we automatically optimize image feature filters over several inputs and within transformation images, improving the Automatic Construction of Tree-Structural Image Transformation (ACTIT) system. Our objective is to also produce optimal solutions in substantially less computation time than require for generating features of ACTIT. We improved the algorithm feature filters in the process through GP, which are expressed by trees in Automatic Construction of Tree-Structural Image Transformation, to reduce computation time. Through our experimentation, we show that our new approach is accurate and requires less computation time by maintaining the feature images in conjunction with the original images.

This paper proposes a simple and practical method for determining the optimal acoustic noise levels of transformers to be replaced in an aged substation. The proposed algorithm is based on a reverse calculation method and Linear Programming using an empirical formula for estimating noise levels at the boundary points around the substation premises. Necessary input parameters are three dimensions of each transformer and distance between transformers and each boundary point. Constraints are derived from the empirical noise level estimation formula and the regulated noise levels on the boundary. In the transformed problem, a sum of transformer noise levels is selected as an objective function to be maximized. The proposed method is successfully tested and verified on a model substation as well as a real primary substation.

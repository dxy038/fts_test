The objective of this study was to investigate the tissue-specific mRNA expression of different cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms,
UDP glucuronsyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) and glutathione-S-transferase (GSTA1) in the different tissues (liver, mammary gland,
lungs, spleen, kidney cortex, heart, masseter muscle and tongue) of cattle, using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR). CYP1A1-like mRNA was expressed in all of the tissues examined, including the liver, with the highest expression level in
the kidney. CYP1A2-, 2E1- and 3A4-like mRNAs were only expressed hepatically. Interestingly, significant expression of CYP2B6-like
mRNA was recorded in the lung tissue, while CYP2C9-like mRNA was expressed in the liver and kidney tissues of the cattle
examined. UGT1A1- and GSTA1-like mRNAs were expressed in all of the examined tissues, except the mammary glands, and the
highest expression levels were recorded in the kidney. The high expression of UGT1A1 in the lung tissue and GSTA1 in the liver
tissue was unique to cattle; this has not been reported for rats or mice. The findings of this study strongly suggest that the liver,
kidneys and lungs of cattle are the major organs contributing to xenobiotics metabolism.

The rapid development of computer network system brings both a great convenience and new security threats for users. Network security problem generally includes network system security and data security. Specifically, it refers to the reliability of network system, confidentiality, integrity and availability of data information in the system. Network security problem exists through all the layers of the computer network, and the network security objective is to maintain the confidentiality, authenticity, integrity, dependability, availability and audit-ability of the network. This paper introduces the network security technologies mainly in detail, including authentication, data encryption technology, firewall technology, intrusion detection system (IDS), antivirus technology and virtual private network (VPN).

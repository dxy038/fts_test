For vehicle comparison from point of view of green gas production it is necessary to add to the green gas production of the vehicle itself also the quantity that was necessary to produce the fuel for internal combustion engine ICE or the electric energy for electric vehicle. Only this attitude is objective. This paper reveals simulation results of CO<sub>2</sub> emission produced by different types of car drives. Although electric vehicles are assumed like &#8220;zero emission vehicles&#8221; their CO<sub>2</sub> path in dependence on the sources and technology of electric energy production (electric energy mix) is here calculated. In paper Hybrid Electric Cars with Combustion Engine driven cars are compared. This paper compares Electric cars with Combustion Engine driven cars.

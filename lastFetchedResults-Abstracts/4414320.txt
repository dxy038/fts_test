This paper presents the implementation of a wall following control for the application of a brain-controlled wheelchair. The control objective is to make electric wheelchair can go forward at a certain distance and at zero angle with a wall. The electric wheelchair is equipped with ultrasonic transducers to detect the distance and the angle between the wheelchair and the wall. The control algorithm is derived using Lyapunov method and the stability of the system is assured. The wheelchair is also combined with adaptive control in order that the desired speed of both motors is achieved and to make the performance of wall following motion more stable. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by experimental results.

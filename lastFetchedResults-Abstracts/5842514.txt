Gytotron are the primary high-power source of millimeter waves. Although the application of electron cyclotron heating of fusion plasmas has been primarily responsible for the gyrotronÂ´s development, many other applications exist, including millimeter-wave ceramic sintering, high-density communications, and high-resolution radar within the atmospheric windows of 35, 94, and 140 GHz. One problem with high-frequency gyrotrons is the strong magnetic fields required to satisfy the fundamental electron cyclotron resonance condition. For example, a 35-kG magnet would ordinarily be needed to generate 94 GHz at the fundamental cyclotron frequency. However, by operating the gyrotron at the sth cyclotron harmonic, the required magnetic field can be decreased by a factor of s. To develop 94-GHz oscillator that is both compact and efficient is the objective of this work.

In this paper we studied the chaotic property that can arise in transmission technique that mostly use in high-speed bidirectional wireless data transfer and mobile data transfer. The spectrum of OFDM carrier in frequency domain is a sinc function, which is Fourier transform of the rectangular pulse. The transmission sensitivity that caused from small change in an initial condition of a system could be explained by a divergent rate of the Lyapunov exponent of OFDM spectrum. The corresponding bifurcation diagram of the Lyapunov exponent is presented. The chaotic behavior of the function was also discussed.

Aim and Background: Helicobacter pylori has been recognized as a major risk factor for the development of gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcers and gastric cancer. Various methods have been known to detect this microorganism and the most common method especially in patients undergoing endoscopy is rapid urease test (RUT), but this test is potential to give false positive and negative results. Therefore, using a rapid, simple but high-precision method is needed to confirm this test in laboratories. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of RUT compared to PCR molecular method for the diagnosis of H.pylori. 
Materials and Methods: This study was carried out on 100 biopsy samples collected from dyspeptic patients attending the endoscopy. The rapid urease test was performed on all samples and the PCR test was conducted with designed primers on glmM gene. Diagnostic values of RUT and PCR were evaluated using SPSS software.
Results: The product of optimized PCR with 201bp length correctly amplified and observed on electrophoreses gel. Evaluation of the selected primers with various DNA demonstrated high accuracy. Sensitivity of the test was 10 CFU with 100% specificity. In this study, 85% of specimens were detected with PCR whereas only 63% of them were detected by the RUT.
Conclusion: In this study, it has been approved that PCR can be used for the diagnosis of H.pylori on clinical specimens because it is highly sensitive, specific and can be used on biopsy samples from RUT

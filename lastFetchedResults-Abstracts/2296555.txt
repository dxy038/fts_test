Farmers believe that forage corn can be planted at later dates than grain corn because harvest of forage does not have to wait until the grain matures completely. The objective of this study was to determine optimum planting date of forage corn in Torbat-e-Jam, Razavi Khorasan province. Experimental design was a split-plot based on randomized complete block with four replications which was conducted in 2011. Planting date treatments in three levels (June 4, June 19 and July 4) were considered as main plots and cultivars [SC700 (late mature), SC604 (intermediate) and TWC370 (early mature)] were considered as sub plots. Results showed that there was a significant difference between planting dates and cultivar treatments for total dry weight, thousand seeds weight, number of leaf m-2 and total yield. The maximum dry weight, number of ear per plant, number of leaf m-2 and total yield were obtained from combination of second planting date (June 19) and cultivar SC700. However, the highest thousand kernel weight was observed from combination of second planting date (June 19) and cultivar TWC370. Overall, the highest mean of the traits was obtained from second planting date.

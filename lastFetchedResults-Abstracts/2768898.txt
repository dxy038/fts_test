In the present work, a cuckoo search optimisation-based approach has been developed to allocate static shunt capacitors along radial distribution networks. The objective function is adopted to minify the system operating cost at different loading conditions and to improve the system voltage profile. In addition to find the optimal location and values of the fixed and switched capacitors in distribution networks with different loading levels using the proposed algorithm. Higher potential buses for capacitor placement are initially identified using power loss index. However, that method has proven less than satisfactory as power loss indices may not always indicate the appropriate placement. At that moment, the proposed approach identifies optimal sizing and placement and takes the final decision for optimum location within the number of buses nominated with minimum number of effective locations and with lesser injected VArs. The overall accuracy and reliability of the approach have been validated and tested on radial distribution systems with differing topologies and of varying sizes and complexities. The results shown by the proposed approach have been found to outperform the results of existing heuristic algorithms found in the literature for the given problem.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between preeclampsia and 3 relatively common mutations that are important in the development of vascular disease and thrombosis; these are similar to conditions observed in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia. Study Design: Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from whole blood or cheek swabs of 281 patients with preeclampsia and 360 control subjects (all white). Control subjects consisted of women who had undergone at least 2 term pregnancies unaffected by preeclampsia. Mutation frequencies among patients with preeclampsia and control subjects were compared by standard χ2 analysis, with P< .05 considered significant. Results: Thirty-three of 281 women with preeclampsia (11.7%) and 22 of 193 women with severe preeclampsia (11.4%) were homozygous for cytosine-to-thymine substitution at nucleotide 677 in the gene for methyltetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), versus 41 of 360 control subjects (11.4%; difference not significant). Forty of 258 women with preeclampsia (15.5%) and 22 of 175 women with severe preeclampsia (12.6%) were heterozygous for the insertion of 68 bases at position 844 in the gene for cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), versus 58 of 332 control subjects (17.5%). Fifteen of 250 women with preeclampsia (6.0%) and 11 of 169 with severe preeclampsia (6.5%) were heterozygous for the Leiden mutation (glycine-to-alanine substitution at nucleotide 1691) in the gene for factor V (F5), versus 12 of 253 control subjects (4.7%; difference not significant). Conclusion: In this white population a missense mutation of MTHFR, an insertion mutation of CBS, and a missense mutation of F5 were not found to be associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia, either independently or in combination.

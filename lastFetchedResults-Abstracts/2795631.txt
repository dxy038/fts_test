This paper proposes a design method for electrical and electronic (E/E) architecture component platforms, with a focus on different manifestations of the (re-)used hardware components. The addressed challenge is to derive an optimized component platform where various manifestations of observed components are reused across different car configurations, models, or even OEM companies. This enables to ponder between the number of component manifestations and other design objectives in a multi-objective fashion. The proposed approach integrates component manifestationsÂ´ reuse in a state-of-the-art hybrid optimization technique, allowing the optimization to directly influence the number of manifestations and, thus, enabling a holistic optimization of the component platform. The proposed technique is applied to a real-world automotive use case.

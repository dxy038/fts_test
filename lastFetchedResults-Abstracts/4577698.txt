A novel Asthma electronic prototype device and its application for the Android smartphone are proposed in this paper. The device can be used to by an asthma patient to track asthma symptoms, triggers, and medications on a daily basis. The patient data can then be automatically shared with his/her doctor and family via an online service. This device can be very useful, efficient and helpful for the suffering patient, since it provides he doctors with precise data anywhere in the world without the need of any intervention by physical therapist. This application will allow doctors to follow their patients passively for medical check. This electronic prototype device consists of a microcontroller with a flow meter detector and a Bluetooth transmitter circuit to send data to the android Smartphone. It may be suited for PC applications, such as windows, by Bluetooth connectivity. Asthma Care Apps can be directly downloaded from the PC to the Smartphone as well. This well designed device will minimize the frustration of teenagers caused by doctor visits, help them live a healthier and a less stressful life. Furthermore, doctors are less disturbed by their patients who may have misread the data. The main objective of this work is to develop a telemedicine system which can manage asthma data for patients in childhood without the need of frequent visits at health care centers. This system includes the development of a multi-functional device that can solve the problem of daily patientÂ´s monitoring. A graphical interface will be added to make it more user friendly for patients of all ages without the need of any external help.

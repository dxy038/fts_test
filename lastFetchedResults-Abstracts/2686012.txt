In this paper, the target tracking problem is investigated for a tracking system with mobile range-only sensors. Being different from most previous studies, both additive and multiplicative noises in measurements are taken into consideration. An optimal coordination strategy, including sensor selection and sensor motion, is proposed to maximize the tracking accuracy. In particular, by fully utilizing the properties of objective function, the search space and variables of the original optimization problem can be significantly reduced. Based on this reduction, three algorithms are designed, respectively, for the following: 1) efficient selection of task sensors; 2) reduction on combinations of task sensors; and 3) efficient search of optimal sensor motion. The performance of the proposed coordination strategy is illustrated by simulations.

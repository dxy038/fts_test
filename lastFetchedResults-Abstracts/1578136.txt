NOAA AVHRR has been used extensively for monitoring vegetation condition and changes across the United States. Integration of crop growth models with MODIS imagery at 250 m resolution from the Terra Satellite potentially offers an opportunity for operational assessment of the crop condition and yield at both field and regional scales. The primary objective of this research was to evaluate the quality of the MODIS 250 m resolution data for retrieval of crop biophysical parameters that could be integrated in crop yield simulation models. A secondary objective was evaluating the potential use of MODIS 250 m resolution data for crop classification. A field study (24 fields) was conducted during the 2000 crop season in McLean County, Illinois, in the U.S. Midwest to evaluate the applicability of the MODIS 8-day, 250 m resolution composite imagery (version 4) for operational assessment of crop condition and yields. Ground-based canopy and leaf reflectance and leaf area index (LAI) measurements were used to calibrate a radiative transfer model to create a look up table (LUT) that was used to simulate LAI. The seasonal trend of MODIS derived LAI was used to find crop model parameters by adjusting the LAI simulated from the climate-based crop yield model. Other intermediate products such as crop phenological events were adjusted from the LAI seasonal profile. Corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) yield simulations were conducted on a 1.6 Ã— 1.6 km2 spatial resolution grid and the results integrated to the county level. The results were within 10% of county yields reported by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS).

The usage of social software and virtual community platforms in particular promises to offer opportunities for customer integration approaches into a company´s value creation activities. Therefore, ideas and innovations generated by members of a virtual community can be analyzed and used in order to enhance the quality of firm´s products and services. However, evaluating economic consequences associated with the set-up, operation, and maintenance of virtual communities on a quantitative basis has widely been neglected in social network research. Thus, the objective of this paper is therefore to develop a measurement framework for the financial performance, including revenues and expenditures of a virtual community platform reflecting specific economic conditions relevant in a certain situation. The measurement framework is then applied to a real life example of the Berlin Stock Exchange, in Germany.

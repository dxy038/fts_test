The project entitled Evaluation of RADARSAT-2 quad-pol data for functional assessment of wetlands (Id6842), developed in the framework of the CSA-ESA SOAR-EU (Science and operational applications research for Europe) aims to contribute to the application development in demonstrating the exploitation of fully polarimetric time-series datasets for the functional assessment of wetlands. The objective of this paper is to address the issue of evaluating fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2 time-series datasets to determine the water cycle dynamics, in order to delineate precisely potential, effective and efficient wetlands.

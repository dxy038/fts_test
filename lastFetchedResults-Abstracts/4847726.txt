In this paper, we consider a special discount where: (1) the price breaks depend on the size of the order quantities, (2) independent products&#194;&#191; sales volume affect the prices and discounts of the other products and (3) all products must be sold as a bundle. In this circumstance, which the buyer wants to buy multi-product and suppliers also offer the special discount, the problem becomes more complicated. To formulate the problem, multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MOMILP) is used to define the optimum quantities among the selected suppliers. The problem includes the three objective functions: to minimize the inverse Total Value of Purchasing (TVP), the total cost and total defect rate, while satisfying capacity and demand requirement constraints. In order to solve the model, a single objective function is used that considers relative importance of the goals. A numerical example is given to illustrate how the multi-objective model is applied.

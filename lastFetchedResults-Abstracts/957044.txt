The objective of this paper is to show how one may design combinatorial libraries a priori by integrating data mining
techniques with physically robust multivariate data. It is shown that large datasets can be developed from relatively small
amounts of experimental and theoretically based information. This involves a process of strategically selecting appropriate
physical based parameters that can be analyzed in a multivariate manner. In this paper we identify for the first time the bandgap
and lattice parameters of nearly 200 stoichiometries of new and yet to be synthesized compound chalcopyrite semiconductors.
The robustness of this ‘‘virtual’’ combinatorial experimentation approach is demonstrated by comparison to band gap
predictions from theoretical studies on a range of compositions for a selected quaternary compound semiconductor.

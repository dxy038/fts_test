Sustainability in construction has become a global issue, especially in the aspect of green house gas emissions. At present, engineers are encountered with more challenges, not only providing the best cost advantage, but also considering environmental impact, and affording the most sustainable solution. Therefore, it is the foremost step for reliable and consistent quantification of air pollutant emissions to implement environmentally sustainable construction operations. The objective of this research is to implement the Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) model to measure the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions released by non-road construction vehicles and equipment during earthwork for building construction, in order to provide the accurate, consistent &amp; realistic quantification of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions at micro level. In the end, a case study is provided to verify the proposed methodology.

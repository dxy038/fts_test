ATM networks support multimedia traffic where diverse services have to be provided and various QoS requirements have to be met. Routing plays an important role in guaranteeing the QoS. However conventional routing will cause a significant overhead when the network size gets very large or rerouting occurs frequently due to the varying link state. The objective of our dynamic routing scheme is to perform more efficient routing over a more effective and simpler topology which is abstracted from the original full topology based on the dynamic link state. Only those links with high probability to satisfy the QoS of the call are included in the effective topology. It is an efficient way to prevent rerouting from occurring too often because the blocking probability over this effective topology is significantly low. A hierarchical routing model is also proposed to further reduce the amount of information that has to be stored and exchanged for routing. We present the simulation results of our dynamic routing scheme along with the hierarchical routing model and its implementation over QUARTS, a simulation testbed for ATM networks.

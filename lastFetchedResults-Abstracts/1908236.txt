The objective of this review was to give an overview of findings concerning quality of life (QOL) in general as well as its domains in survivors of testicular cancer. QOL on the group level was equal to that of men of the same age in the general population. Treatment strategies hardly influenced the QOL. The anxiety level, but not depression, was higher among survivors, while sexual functioning hardly differed from the male population norm. Patients to be treated for testicular cancer should be told about the outlook for good QOL, and the low risk of mental and physical long-term effects.

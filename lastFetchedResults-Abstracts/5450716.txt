Since the classical Kalman filter provides optimal least- squares estimates of all of the states of a linear time-varying system, there is longstanding interest in obtaining simpler filters that estimate only a subset of states. This objective is of particular interest when the system order is extremely large, which occurs for systems arising from discretized partial differential equations.

The conventional DC-DC flyback converter is transformed in an AC-AC one by replacing the primary side transistor and the secondary side diode, by bidirectional switches, and replacing the DC input voltage by an AC one. As a result, an AC output voltage is generated, isolated from the source voltage by a small size high-frequency transformer. The output voltage is regulated by PWM to compensate for the input voltage and load variations. Principle of operation, theoretical analysis, design procedure and example, and simulation results are presented, along with laboratory experimental results. It is demonstrated that the proposed technique is suitable for high-power density isolated AC line voltage regulators

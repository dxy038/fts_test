An irreversible Braysson heat engine cycle model, in which the heat transfer obeys a linear heat transfer law between the working fluid and the external heat reservoirs, with heat resistance, heat leak and internal irreversibility is established in this paper. The analytical expressions of power output, efficiency and ecological objective function are derived. These performance parameters are maximized with respect to the cycle temperatures along with the isobaric temperature ratio. The performance characteristic curves are obtained by numerical calculation. The optimal operating regions of the important parameters are determined.

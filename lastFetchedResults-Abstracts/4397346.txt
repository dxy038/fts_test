Smart grid is the future for the conventional power systems. In Pakistan, many energy projects are completed and some of them are under still in implementation phase. The aim of this paper is to highlight the prosperous developments in energy sector for the smart grid implementation. The basic objective that is targeted is to have sufficient energy production as compared to connected load at the distribution section. We provide a detail overview of the running projects, past projects, and future projects for the smart grid implementation in Pakistan. The first basic step towards smart system is to have sufficient generation than demand of the consumers. Our paper highlights the energy potential in Pakistan and various energy statistics, such as installed capacity.

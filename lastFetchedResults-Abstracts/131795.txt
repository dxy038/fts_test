Introduction & Objective: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of mammography in early detection of cancer In order to decrease its mortality rate, although about 10 to 30% of breast cancers are not detectable by this method.
Materials & Methods: A population of 1000 women over 40 with the complaint of various discomforts in their breasts such as nipple discharge, pain, stiffness sensation and so on underwent this study. Examination of these patients started with clinical examination followed by mammography and complementary sonography if needed. Final diagnosis was achieved on the basis of biopsy and pathology findings.
Results: Findings of this study consisted of 34 cases of benign and 13 cases of malignant masses, with malignancy belonging to the age range 50- 59 (61.5%]. Right breast was involved more than left one and the most prevalent site of occurrence was the upper external quadrant of the breast. Conclusion: Malignancy occurred in patients between 50- 59 years of age. Therefore, it is necessary to perform mammography as a routine procedure in women beyond the age of 40. No significant correlation was found between breast cancer and factors like menarche starting age, number of delivery, breast feeding (lactation) and history of hormone replacement therapy.

A focusing criterion using the discrete cosine transform is described. This criterion may be used for improving an automatic focusing procedure with the aim of performing faster measurement and more objective collection of data in, for example, quality control and pattern recognition. The principle of this criterion and the set of used parameters are given. A discussion of several laboratory experiments is added to show the extended field of implementation of this criterion.

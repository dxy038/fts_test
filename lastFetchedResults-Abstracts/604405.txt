As revealed, 89/9% of the dead neonates were premature and the remaining ones were term (p=0.0001). Most of the dead cases had birth weight under 2.5 KG and died in the first 24h after birth. These neonates were born by cesarean section and were with first and fifth apgar scores below 7. (In all the above-mentioned findings P= 0.0001).

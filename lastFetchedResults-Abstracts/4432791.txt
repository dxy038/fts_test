This paper presents an architecture for autonomous Access Point selection. The architecture tries to ensure high-quality content delivery from user applications&#194;&#191; perspective and is especially useful for on-demand Internet video providers. In the architecture, the Content Server and the Mobile Node co-operatively select the most suitable Access Point. The objective of the selection is to maximize Quality of Experience for the user. The benefit of this approach compared to one in which the MN alone decides the best AP, is that the Content Server can aggregate information from all streaming sessions, and hereby can make more informed AP selection decisions than any of the MNs individually could.

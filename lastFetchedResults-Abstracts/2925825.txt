AMPHION is a generic architecture that is specialized to a particular domain and subroutine library through a domain theory and domain-specific theorem-proving tactics. This paper discusses AMPHION-NAIF, the application of AMPHION to the domain of solar system kinematics as implemented in the SPICELIB subroutine library. The Navigation Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) at NASAÂ´s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is charged with developing software to support the planetary science community in planning and analyzing the observation geometries of solar system bodies in interplanetary scientific missions. The objective of SPICELIB is to enable end-users in the planetary science community to construct their own application programs

The 3D packaging allow to create compact, lightweight and multifunctional electronic packages. They are obtained by stacking of electronic substrates and ensure better performances of all the system. The main constraint generated by these developments is the thermal management of the entire module. According to applications, specific thermal constraints appear and require the implementation of adapted cooling techniques. The objective of this work is to design and develop a 3D electronic module with the high heat dissipative capacities (50 W). With this intention, a thermal study of the 3D system was led in order to optimize the thermal transfer in the module. Interlayer thermal interactions affect significantly the response of the stacked 3D module. An option of cooling of the module is proposed in order to evacuate the required power. Micro heat pipes were retained to evacuate the required power. The potential applications are envisioned in avionics, space and radar sectors

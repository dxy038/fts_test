Objective
We sought to determine whether vitamins C and E could be delivered to the fetal-placental unit through maternal oral supplementation.
Study design
In a randomized, double-blind study, 20 women received a daily prenatal vitamin with or without 400 IU of vitamin E and 500 mg of vitamin C, starting at 35 weeks' gestation. At randomization, a nutritional questionnaire, plasma vitamin C and E and red blood cell (RBC) vitamin E levels were determined. At delivery, concentrations of maternal and fetal plasma vitamin C and E, maternal and fetal RBC vitamin E, amniotic fluid vitamin C, and chorioamnion vitamin E and tensile strength were determined.
Results
Maternal plasma vitamin E levels increased in the supplemented women but not in the control subjects. No changes in maternal vitamin C levels were noted. Maternal plasma vitamin C concentrations at delivery correlated closely with amniotic fluid vitamin C levels. Similarly, maternal plasma vitamin E levels at delivery correlated with the chorioamnion concentration of vitamin E.
Conclusions
Maternal plasma vitamin E levels are increased by oral supplementation. Maternal plasma vitamin C and E concentrations correlate with the concentration of vitamin C in the amniotic fluid and vitamin E in the chorioamnion, respectively.

Background and Objective: The exposures related to the department of radiology can be considered as harmful agent for human. This study was done to assess the partial distribution of the equivalent dose in radiology waiting room in Ardabil, Iran.
Materials and Methods: This descriptive analytical study was done in the radiology department and related waiting rooms of 4 teaching hospital and 3 private radiology sonography centers in Ardabil, Northwest of Iran, during 2011. The variables including type of radiography, the number and condition, staying duration in waiting room were considered for dosimetry. Data were analyzed using SPSS-18 and Chi-Square test.
Results: The lowest radiation dose belong to one specialist radiology sonography center with
0.2±0.002 µS.h-1V, but for each radiography were determined to be 0.00275±0.004 µS.h-1V. The highest radiation dose belong to one specialist radiography sonography center with 0.4±0.045 µS.h-1V and for each radiography was 0.016±0.0006 µS.h-1V. Two teaching hospitals accompanied with three privates centers showed to have radiation dose-rate higher than 0.3 µS.h-1V (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: This study showed that the increasing radiation-dose rate (higher than 0.3 µS.h-1V) in teaching hospitals and private centers can be related to either the unit life or inadepuate of radiological protective shield.

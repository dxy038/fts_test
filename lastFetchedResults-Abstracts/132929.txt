Objective: P19 cells are a mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line capable of differentiation into mature neurons after exposure to retinoic acid (RA). In the present study, the P19 cells, exposed to RA (0.5ÂµM), were differentiated into neuron-like cells. Materials and Methods: The growing cells on bacterial- grade petri dishes spontaneously formed some cellular aggregation in cultures containing RA. 4 days later, the aggregates were transferred into tissue culture grade petri dishes and their morphological changes were evaluated by invert microscopy. Immunocytological analysis was also performed on differentiated cells during 8-11 days of culture.
Results: The obtained data revealed that following the transfer of P19 cells to petri dishes attach to the surface of the dish and after 1-2 days, cells with long processes become evident. The cells were gradually aquire the neuronal cell morphology and until day 10 their numbers increased. In immunocytochemical evaluations on the 8th and 11 th days of the experiment for nestin and synaptophysin, respectively, the presence of these neuronal marker were confirmed.
Conclusion: We have concluded here that P19 cell line is a suitable and inexpensive model system to examine the effects of different agents during neuronal differentiation. It also provides an attractive system to produce in the large scale neuronal cells for the purpose of cell and gene therapy to replace damaged neurons within the central nervous system.

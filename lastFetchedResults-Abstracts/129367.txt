Objective(s): To compare quality of life (QOL) in hemodialysis and renal - transplant receivers. Methods: The sample consists of 40 hemodialysis and 40 renal-transplant receivers aged 20 years old and over admitted to the Soodeh Center in Islamshahr district in Tehran, Iran. All subjects were outpatients and completed the Evans & Cope QOL questionnaire.
Results: The mean score of QOL was 49.1 (SD=14) in hemodialysis and 41.9 (SD=15.5) in renal-transplant receivers indicating a significant difference between two groups (P<0.05).
Conclusion: The findings suggest that QOL score was low for both groups of patients. However, the level of QOL among the renal-transplant receivers was worse than the hemodialysis patients.

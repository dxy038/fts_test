In this paper, an evolutionary algorithm is used for developing a decision support tool to undertake multi-objective job-shop scheduling problems. A modified micro genetic algorithm (MmGA) is adopted to provide optimal solutions according to the Pareto optimality principle in solving multi-objective optimisation problems. MmGA operates with a very small population size to explore a wide search space of function evaluations and to improve the convergence score towards the true Pareto optimal front. To evaluate the effectiveness of the MmGA-based decision support tool, a multi-objective job-shop scheduling problem with actual information from a manufacturing company is deployed. The statistical bootstrap method is used to evaluate the experimental results, and compared with those from the enumeration method. The outcome indicates that the decision support tool is able to achieve those optimal solutions as generated by the enumeration method. In addition, the proposed decision support tool has advantage of achieving the results within a fraction of the time.

EAP-AKA is a secure access protocol in the 3GPP WLAN-3G interconnecting scheme in which 3G user and 3G network are bidirectional authenticated, however the middle-positioned WLAN access network is not authenticated and the 3G-UE master key updating strategy is not proposed. A new protocol which utilizes ID-based encryption and ticket technology to implement master key updating and access network authentication is proposed. A fast authenticated roaming method without participation of 3G network is designed.

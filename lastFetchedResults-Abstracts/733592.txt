Objective.
Despite the increase in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence among Chinese in Asia, there are no data on predictors of CRC screening uptake in this population. This study investigated how knowledge and perceptions about CRC correlated with screening behavior in Singaporean-Chinese.
Methods.

A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out on Singaporean-Chinese at least 50 years old in Queenstown Estate, Singapore between 1/1/2006 and 1/2/2006. A questionnaire administered via face-to-face interviews elicited knowledge, perceptions and screening behavior of subjects.
Results.

The response rate was 72.4%, with 514 completed responses. Expense was the commonest perceived barrier to screening (56.6% agreed), unlike for other populations. Social influence is important, with 67.5% agreeing to the statement “I would go for CRC screening if my family wanted me to”. After excluding confounders, Chinese who had been for fecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening had higher knowledge score (p < 0.001), lower perceived severity (p < 0.01), were more likely to have been influenced by their family/friends to go for screening (p = 0.04) and to have attended screening tests for other diseases (p < 0.001).
Conclusion.

FOBT screening uptake is associated with specific areas of knowledge and perception among Singaporean-Chinese. To increase screening uptake within Chinese populations, clinicians should consider these factors in their approach to patients.

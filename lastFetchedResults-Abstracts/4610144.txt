Robust controller design in presence of disturbance and system parameter uncertainties has been a challenging task. In this paper attitude control of ECP 750 Gyroscope in presence of uncertainties is solved using LMI based multi objective state feedback H<sub>2</sub> /H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controller. The attitude control problem addressed here resembles the formulation of polytopic model of MIMO gyroscope model to cater the parameter uncertainty and subsequent robust controller design using LMI framework is novelty of this work. MATLAB simulation results show better robust attitude control and disturbance rejection.

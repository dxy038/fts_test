In the conventional power system, power flow has a single direction to the line end. With distributed generation connected to the grid, bidirectional power flow can possibly occur depending on output in the 22.9kV distribution power system, which would influence power system management. In order to benefit from dispersed generation which has advantages including assisting power source and load sharing, utilities have to adopt bidirectional protection system. This paper describes the field test of bidirectional protective devices in order to investigate its performance when applied to the bidirectional power system. We have tested in the power system test site of KEPCO and the test offers the foundation for performance verification of bidirectional protective devices in the power system.

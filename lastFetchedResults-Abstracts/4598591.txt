Several metrics have been proposed in literature to assess the quality of 2D images, but the metrics devoted to quality assessment of stereoscopic images are very scarce. Therefore, in this paper, an objective assessment method is proposed to predict the quality level of stereoscopic images. This method assesses stereo images from the perspective of image quality and stereo sense. Experiments demonstrate that the objective assessment method the paper presented gets similar results with the general subjective assessment method. And the method is simple, rapid, convenient and practical.

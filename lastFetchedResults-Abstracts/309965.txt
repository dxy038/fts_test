Objective:
To investigate the effect of α-Tocopherol (α-T) supplementation on S100B elevated serum levels in basketball players' training.
Design:
Blood was obtained from 10 basketball players pre-exercise (group A), post-exercise (group B) and after 30 days on α-T (200 mg/24 h orally) supplementation pre- (group C) and post-training (group D). Blood samples were taken for the evaluation of total antioxidant status (TAS), α-T and catecholamines in plasma and S100B and muscle enzyme levels in serum.
Methods:
TAS, muscle enzymes: creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and S100B protein levels were measured with commercial kits, whereas α-T and catecholamine levels with HPLC methods.
Results:
TAS was found higher in the groups with α-T addition (groups C and D) than in the other ones. On the contrary, CK, LDH and S100B were remarkably lower (116.8 + 9.5 U/L, 427 + 22 U/L, 0.18 + 0.04 μg/L, respectively) in group D than those in group B (286 + 12 U/L, 688 + 26 U/L, 0.28 + 0.06 μg/L, p < 0.001, respectively). S100B levels were negatively correlated with TAS (r = − 0.64, p < 0.001) and positively with CK levels (r = 0.58, p < 0.001).
Conclusions:
α-T supplementation may reduce S100B increased release from muscle and nerves induced by training. S100B serum evaluation may be a useful biomarker for the effect of training on the participation of the neuromuscular system.

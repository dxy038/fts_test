Introduction: Patients with hepatitis C infection who are candidates for renal transplantation, can undergo renal transplantation if hepatitis C is inactive and without any liver cirrhosis. After renal transplantation due to induced immunosupression, hepatitis C virus can be reactivated and cause progression of liver disease as well as kidney transplant involvement (glomerulonephritis, rejection).
Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of renal transplantations in patients with a past history of hepatitis C involvement.
Materials and Methods: This research is a cross-sectional study on 14 patients with a past history of hepatitis C from a total of 60 patients who had passed one year after kidney transplantation, and between 1998- 2001, of 14 patients, 10 people had liver biopsy before transplantation.HCV-RNA was negative in the patients at the time of transplantation and after that, immunosuppressive drugs used were prednisolone, ciclospori, azathioprine, and mycophenolatemophetile.Then, data were analyzed by SPSS.10
Results: One year after transplantation, no detrimental effects were seen in those patients with a past history of hepatitis C on liver and transplanted kidney, life time of patient and graft survival. HCV-RNA was negative. Rejection cases were seen.in 4 casesout of 14 patients with hepatitis C, that was not due to hepatitis C. No glomerulonephritis cases were seen posttransplantation. The mean plasma creatinine was 1.18 mg/dl. No side effects of immunosupressive drugs were seen on liver of these 14 patients. Only two persons among 14 patients died because of cardiovascular problems and cytomegalovirus infection.
Conclusion: This study showed that short- term consequences in our patients with a past history of hepatitis C infection in comparison with those who were not infected with hepatitis C one year post-transplantation, were generally good.

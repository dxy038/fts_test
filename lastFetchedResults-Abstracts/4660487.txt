To improve capacity and system performance of multichannel and multi-interface wireless ad hoc networks, an efficient power control and channel allocation scheme is proposed. In order to mitigate the co-channel interference and appropriately assign channel, the power control scheme and channel assignment optimization scheme are joint to achieve this objective. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach and demonstrate that it can get better performance than other approach in terms of throughput, energy consumption and end-to-end delay.

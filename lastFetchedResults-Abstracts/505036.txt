Background and Objective: Severe menstrual bleeding is a leading cause of poor quality of life and iron deficiency anemia in reproductive aged women. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and acceptability of long-term use of medroxyprogestrone acetate in menorrhagia management. 

Materials and Methods: In a pre-post trial, 44 eligible women were allocated to long term medroxyprogestrone acetate treatment (for 3 consecutive cycles). Changes in duration and amount of bleeding, quality of life and also hemoglobin and ferritin values were checked out and compared before and after treatment.

Results: Medroxyprogestrone acetate reduced mean PBLAC score from 220.15(±74.99) in control cycle to 108.81(±74.98) in third cycle (p < 0.0001). Hemoglobin increased from 12.24(±0.89) to 13.21(±0.88) g/dl and ferritin increased from 13.38(±6.81) to 30.85(±8.51) ng/dl (p < 0/0001). Duration of menstrual bleeding decreased from 8.4(±1.47) days to 8.06(±1.53) days (p=0.001). Medroxyprogestrone acetate reduced mean MQ score from 66.46(±13.82) to 14.13(±7.98) (p < 0.0001). SF-36 quality of life scores increased in all aspects (except for bodily pain) (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion: Our results showed that long term use of MPA is an effective treatment for idiopathic menorrhagia in terms of menstrual blood loss, hematologic indices and quality of life (p < 0.05) and observed complications are not significant. This makes long-term MPA a favored drug choice in idiopathic menorrhagia management in premenopausal women.

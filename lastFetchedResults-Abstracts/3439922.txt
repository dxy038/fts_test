When two or more poorly damped oscillation modes of close-by frequencies are excited, beat phenomena occur. The stability output Fourier transformation (SOFT) technique is extended to analyze such beat phenomena with the objective of determining the frequency components and their damping constants. Comparisons with other numerical techniques for dynamic stability are presented. Further work for the improvement of the optimization fitting scheme for the characteristic frequency spectrum is also outlined

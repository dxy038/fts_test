Objective: To determine the effect of Tai Chi on oxidative stress in a population of elderly Mexican
subjects. Design: It was carried out a quasi-experimental study with a sample of 55 healthy subjects randomly
divided into two age-matched groups: (i) a control group with 23 subjects and (ii) an experimental group with 32
subjects. The experimental group received daily training in Tai Chi for 50 min. Measurements: It was measured
before and after 6-month of exercise period: thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), total antioxidant
status (TAS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Results: It was found that the
experimental group exhibited a statistically significant decrease in glucose levels, total cholesterol, low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), and systolic blood pressure, as well as an increase in SOD and GPx activity and
TAS compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the daily practice of Tai
Chi is useful for reducing OxS in healthy older adults.

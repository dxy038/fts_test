Coffee crop recognition in remote sensing images is a complex task. It poses several challenges due to different spectral responses and texture patterns that can be extracted from coffee regions. This paper presents a novel framework for combining different classifiers using support vector machine technique (SVM), which try to learn with each one of classifiers previews experiences (meta-learning). We investigate the combination of seven learning methods and seven image descriptors aiming at creating low-cost classifiers for coffee crops recognition. The objective is to provide an effective mechanism for coffee crop recognition by fusion of region-based classifiers in remote sensing images. The experiments showed that the proposed framework for fusion of classifiers produces better results than the traditional majority voting fusion approach and all base classifiers tested.

The importance of native cool-season grasses in rangeland ecosystems is due to high adaptability of these species and also their roles in soil conservation, livestock grazing and forage production. For such species, study of seedling emergence and establishment, as critical phases of plant growth, is essential for rangeland improvement and recoveiy practices, in particular in arid and semi- arid regions. The main objective of this research was to evaluate seedling emergence and establishment of seven cool - season grasses under field conditions in Sisab site located at Northern Khorasan. The field seed sowing experiment was carried out using a completely randomized block design with four replicates. For each species, the emergence rate and status of seedling establishment were assessed during one growing season. ANOVA analysis showed a significant differences between various species for seedling emergence, growth and establishment rates (p<0.05).The highest seedling emergence rates on all sites, were recorded for large-seeded grasses such as Agropyron elongation and Secale montanum, (25 and32%, respectively) while the lowest rates were recorded for small-seeded grasses such as Festuca ovina, Dactylis glomerata (1 and 1/8%, respectively). Our findings suggest that seed size might be as the most effective factor on the seedling emergence and establishment of such grasses.

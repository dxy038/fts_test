The objective of this study was digitizing and preparing application and setting plan of Tekirdag Agricultural Faculty Area by using handling type GPS. Three different methods were used in the measurement of application area. These are; 1.) To measure the area and surrounding by using electronic planimeter; 2.) To measure the area by using electronic theodolit; 3.) To measure with GPS, the results of the measurement compared to the deed of real estate value. Electronic planimeter, electronic theodolite and 3 hand type GPS were used. MapSource and Trackmaker software was used to transfer the measurements done with GPS devices to the computer as digitized. ArcGIS 9.0 and ArcView 3D Analyst softwares were used in processing the data transferred into the computer and the three dimensions analyses. The Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) was used to obtain a threedimensional view and to determine the slope of the research area on digitized data. The minimum area was 936 703 m2 from the title deed and the maximum area was 957 434 m2 from the theodolite measurement. The results of the electronic planimeter and GPS measurements were between 941 000 and 947 000 m2.

EMS-API(energy management system- application program interface) standard IEC61970 has realized seamless integration of EMS application software, but IEC61970 standard covers little about microgrid CIM (common information Model). Therefore, CIM in IEC61970 should be extended for the design of microgrid energy management system based on IEC61970 standard.This paper discusses principles and methods of CIM extension, focusing on CIM extension of wind plant and battery energy storage system. it demonstrates a bidirectional energy dispatching model for battery energy storage system and sets up the CIM for photovoltaic power generation system and fuel cell generating system. Based on all this, the CIM for microgrid EMS is forged and then applied to the practical designing of microgrid EMS.

The main objective of the IETF differentiated services (DiffServ) model is to allow the support on the Internet of different levels of service to different sessions and information flows, aggregated in a few number of traffic classes. This model shows some security limitations that are inherent to the DiffServ model. This paper proposes an architecture for authentication, authorization, admission control and accounting (AAAA) of QoS client applications with dynamic identification of sessions and flows, based on the PBN paradigm. The proposal functionalities are described and analyzed in some detail, focusing on a set of extensions to the common information model of the DMTF. The paper ends with the discussion of the main advantages of the proposal over existing solutions

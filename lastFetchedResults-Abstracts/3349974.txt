In this paper, the simulation and manipulation of 6 DOF robot manipulator is presented using the kinematic model and an AR (Augmented reality) environment. In this context, the system is based on a multimodal user interface to overlay virtual objects onto the real world scene. The objective of this work is by providing the right information needed to perform a certain task. The determination of the camera pose in the AR system is solved by using the most popular algorithm in AR applications (ARToolKit). Experiment is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the simulator. The results show that it can satisfy the manipulation in term of accuracy and stability.

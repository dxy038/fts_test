Consider the context of selecting an optimal system from amongst a finite set of competing systems, based on a &#8220;stochastic&#8221; objective function and subject to a single &#8220;stochastic&#8221; constraint. In this setting, and assuming the objective and constraint performance measures have a bivariate normal distribution, we present a characterization of the optimal sampling allocation across systems. Unlike previous work on this topic, the characterized optimal allocations are asymptotically exact and expressed explicitly as a function of the correlation between the performance measures.

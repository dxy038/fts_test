The objective of this work is to present a new approach to the random modeling of complex systems in ElectoMagnetic Compatibility (EMC). This contribution aims to compute high orders statistics and study the impact of parameter uncertainties on various EMC topics including transmission lines, radiation and immunity problems. The agreement between results from the Stochastic Collocation (SC) method and Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations guarantee the SC accuracy and robustness. The combination of SC with computations from analytical and tridimensional numerical models (Finite Difference in Time Domain) underlines its advantages (efficiency, non-intrusive integration).

A primary objective of modern computer systems is to enable a user to program problems whose storage requirements may exceed the system\Â´s capacity, without imposing on him the intricate responsibilities of storage management. Thus, an essential service provided by these computer systems is automatic management of storage (termed "dynamic storage allocation"). There are two important aspects involved in implementing this service: the mechanisms by which it may be provided, and the policies for using the mechanisms. This paper classifies the dynamic storage allocation systems according to the possible ways in which they approach these two aspects.

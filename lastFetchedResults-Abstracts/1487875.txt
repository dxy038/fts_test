Our objective was to evaluate the effect of chitosan on premature browning in refrigerated ground beef patties stored in different packaging systems. Ground beef patties (15% fat) with chitosan (1% w/w) or without chitosan (control) were individually packaged either in vacuum (VP), aerobic packaging (AP), carbon monoxide modified atmosphere packaging (LO-OX; 0.4% CO + 19.6% CO2 + 80% N2), or high-oxygen modified atmosphere packaging (HI-OX; 80% O2 + 20% CO2), and stored for 0, 1, or 3 days at 1 °C. At the conclusion of storage, raw surface redness was evaluated, patties were cooked to internal end-point temperatures of either 66 °C or 71 °C, and internal cooked color was measured. The incorporation of chitosan increased (P &lt; 0.05) the interior redness of patties stored in AP, VP, and LO-OX, but not in HI-OX. The results of the present study suggest that the incorporation of 1% chitosan minimizes premature browning in ground beef patties stored under AP, VP, and LO-OX.

Introduction: The main objective of the present review article was to study the different aspects of reconstructive surgery for posterior urethral defects by reviewing the published articles and presentation of our experiences in the reconstructive urology division at Shohada-e-Tajrish hospital. Materials and Methods: The Medline was searched with the keywords of posterior urethroplasty, end-to-end anastomosis, excisional urethroplasty, anastomotic urethroplasty, pelvic fracture, bulboprostatic anastomosis, and urethral repair. The search was limited to papers published from 1980 to September 2008. We selected the relevant published articles in this database and also presented our experience at our reconstructive urology division. Results: Of over 5000 search results, we selected 38 relevant articles with substantial contribution to the subject. Pelvic fracture due to accidents was the most common etiology of pelvic fracture urethral distraction defect that usually involved the membranous urethra. Surgical treatment of this disorder
with perineal anastomotic urethroplasty was accompanied by a success rate of 82% to 95% in different studies. The most important complications of this surgery include urinary incontinence and impotence; however, the incidence of these complications has been reduced by using new surgical techniques. Conclusion: Complete preoperative assessment, the use of suitable reconstructive techniques, and in particular, the use of flexible cystoscopy can lead to acceptable outcomes of the surgical repair of pelvic fracture urethral distraction defects.

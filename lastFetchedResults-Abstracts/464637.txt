OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to identify genes that exhibit increased expression in the uterus during pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: A differential screen was performed against a pregnant mouse uterus complementary deoxyribonucleic acid library by use of probes derived from pregnant and nonpregnant uterus. Multiple clones related to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-2α gene were isolated. RESULTS: Northern hybridization disclosed that message is present in both the gravid and nongravid uterus, but there is a substantial increase in expression during pregnancy. Expression is not found in a variety of other fetal and adult tissues evaluated (excluding placenta). CONCLUSION: The uterus (or cells present within the uterus) constitutes a major site of in vivo expression for the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-2α gene, and expression of this gene is increased during pregnancy.

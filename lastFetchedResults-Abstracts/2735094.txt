This paper is focused on the reduction of measurement error to obtain a high sensitive sensor. A mathematical model related to mechanical sensitivity is developed as a function of measurement error. This model can improve the measured value (indicated by the vibration sensor) as close as possible to the real value. To achieve this objective, the damping rate is enhanced by making the appropriate choice to reduce and limit the measurement error to a minimum (1%), to increase the measurement accuracy to 99%, and to minimize the uncertainty of the mechanical sensitivity of the vibration sensor to 0.5%. Therefore, in this paper, several parameters are improved and a new accurate, reliable, and sensitive vibration sensor is proposed.

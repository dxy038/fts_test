An objective was set at the very beginning of this project to develop a shadow mask color picture tube which would be less costly to produce. The tube could have no sacrifice in performance when compared to a present day shadow mask color tube. There were three main avenues pursued to attain this objective. One was to reduce the number of parts to produce the tube. The second was to reduce the cost of those parts, and the third was to reduce the cost of assembling and processing those parts into a finished product. The result was a system which has a totally new glass for the envelope of the tube, and a new shadow mask to integrate with that glass. The funnel, panel, and shadow mask were designed to fit a concept which would make them conducive to high speed and automatic assembly and process.

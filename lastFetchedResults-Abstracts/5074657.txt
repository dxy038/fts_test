Current work is a pilot study of long-term research of non-invasive pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurement method in peripheral arteries. The main objective of this study is to determine most appropriate algorithm for detection of pressure wave equiphase point and calculate accurate pulse transit time (PTT) between two pulse waves. To understand which algorithm gives the most accurate values, we decided to compare mathematical methods with manual method. The manual method was used as a reference. As a result, a linear relationship between the reference method and maximum point determination method of pressure wave second derivative was found, also between the reference method and the method using pressure wave adaptive level of 30% and 50%.

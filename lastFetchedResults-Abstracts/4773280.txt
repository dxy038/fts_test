The objective of this research is to analyze, design and develop an enhanced grid portal that able to support collaborative work between users in grids, and able to integrate and access multiple grids simultaneously. This paper will present a study to provide a collaborative environment through a single portal interface to access all resources in grids. The portal will supply the Grid with an appropriate abstraction layer on top of underlying components and services. Based on the study, the use of grid portal can be considered to solve the grid interoperability problem and support usersÂ´ collaboration work as well. The portal can serve as interface to the grid infrastructure. Users can be isolated from grid resources specific details. Some services, i.e. workflow-oriented portal and adaptive resource selection, could be added to enhance current portal technology.

The objective of this study was to investigate if occurrence of clinical disease was related to granulocyte traits in sows. Functional capacity of granulocytes and plasma steroid hormone concentrations were assessed before inoculation with Escherichia coli in the mammary glands in sows at parturition. Blood samples were taken for 3 days approximately 1 week before parturition, and granulocyte migration, phagocytic capacity and expression of CD18 adhesion molecules were determined. Inoculation was done within 36 h before partus. Thereafter, daily thorough clinical examinations were performed including udder health, habitus, appetite and rectal temperature, to assess the severity of disease. Based on the clinical findings four sows were classified as affected and eight as non-affected by clinical mastitis within 48 h after parturition.

ference (p&gt;0.10) in pre-inoculation chemotaxis, phagocytosis or CD18 expression was found between granulocytes from the sows resisting and developing clinical mastitis, respectively. However, there was an effect by the individual sow (p=0.001) on the numbers of granulocytes and white blood cells, and on plasma concentrations of estradiol-17Î² and progesterone. In conclusion, these data does not suggest that impaired chemotaxis or phagocytosis by blood granulocytes contribute to the development of clinical coliform mastitis in the periparturient sow.

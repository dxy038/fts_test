The aim of this paper consists of investigating the switching behaviour of a Fabry-Perot (F-P) active switch by means of an improved beam propagation method based on the method of lines (MoL-BPM). The contribution of the longitudinal charge diffusion and the spreading of the injected current in the active region is considered, too. The reflection of the optical signal on the terminal facets is accounted for by means of the bidirectional version of the MoL-BPM. The F-P switch length is only 200 &#956;m, i.e. less than a fifth of the corresponding traveling wave (TW) switch (1100 &#956;m)

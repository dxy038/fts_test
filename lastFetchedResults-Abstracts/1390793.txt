Development of core muscle strength is important for training and during rehabilitation following injury. A Pessoa training aid (PTA) is a system of ropes and pulleys which is commonly used during equine training and rehabilitation, but there is limited information on its effectiveness. The objective of the study was to determine the effect of the PTA on the temporal, linear and angular kinematics of the working trot. Influence of testing order on effect of a PTA was assessed in four horses. Twelve riding horses were lunged at working trot on a 16 m diameter circle without (WO) and with a PTA (WP) that was set level with the shoulder. Objective measurements were carried out using high-speed motion capture (125 Hz) and inertial measurement units. Subjective video assessment was also undertaken.

 PTA was applied there was a significant reduction in speed, stride length, head angle (P &lt; 0.0001 for all) and lumbosacral angle at maximal hindlimb retraction (P = 0.0028), but no effect on limb joint angles. The highest point of the horse was significantly different between conditions (WO, poll; WP, crest) (P = 0.0010). Dorsoventral displacement of the middle of the back (P â©½ 0.0001) and overall impression grade (P = 0.0002) were significantly greater WP compared with WO. These findings indicated that a PTA may be beneficial for general training and rehabilitation as a method of improving posture, stimulating core muscle activation and improving overall way of going, without increasing the loading of forelimb and hindlimb structures. Further work is warranted to understand the mechanism which induces these changes.

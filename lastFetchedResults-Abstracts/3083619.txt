The current design tries to satisfy only functions defined from specifications without going until the level of knowledge: how designed production system is going to behave throughout its life cycle and how will its user react? We propose an approach allowing to define the behaviour of a production system and that of its user. This approach is based on the notion of the utilization task of the production systems by defining its type, its nature and the conditions of its accomplishment. The performance of these systems depends on the user as same as to the technical system. So our objective is to avoid dangerous situations by improving the design of working situation

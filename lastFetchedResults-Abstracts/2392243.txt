BACKGROUND: The objective of this clinical trial was to assess the effects of probiotic soy milk and
soy milk on anthropometric measures and blood pressure (BP) in type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients.
METHODS: A total of 40 patients with T2D, 35-68 years old, were assigned to two groups in this
randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. The patients in the intervention group
consumed 200 ml/day of probiotic soy milk containing Lactobacillus planetarium A7 and those
in control group consumed 200 ml/day of soy milk for 8 weeks. Anthropometric and BP
measurements were performed according to standard protocols. For detecting within-group
differences paired-sample t-tests was used and analysis of covariance was used for determining
any differences between two groups. (The trial has been registered in the Iranian Registry of
Clinical Trials, identifier: IRCT: IRCT201405265062N8).
RESULTS: In this study, we failed to find any significant changes between probiotic soy milk and
soy milk in term of body mass index (26.65 ± 0.68 vs. 26.33 ± 0.74, P = 0.300) and waist to hip
ratio (1.49 ± 0.08 vs. 1.54 ± 0.1, P = 0.170). Although soy milk did not have any effect on BP,
probiotic soymilk significantly decreased systolic (14.7 ± 0.48 vs. 13.05 ± 0.16, P = 0.001) and
diastolic BP (10 ± 0.7 vs. 9.1 ± 1, P = 0.031).
CONCLUSION: In our study, probiotic soy milk in comparing with soy milk did not have any
beneficial effects on anthropometric measures in these patients. We need more clinical trial for
confirming the effect of probiotic foods on anthropometric measure in diabetic patients.
However, probiotic soy milk decreased systolic and diastolic BP significantly.

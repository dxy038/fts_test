The implementation of cloud computing has attracted computing as a utility and enables penetrative applications from scientific, consumer and business domains. However, this implementation faces energy, power and associated cost concerns. In this paper, we present formulations and solutions for Green Cloud Environments (GCE) to minimize its energy consumption under new models by considering static and dynamic portions of cloud components, to reduce severe environmental impacts. To implement this objective, an in-depth knowledge of energy consumption patterns in cloud environment is necessary. We investigate energy consumption patterns. Specifically, we make use of measurable metrics based on runtime tasks to compare rationally the relation existing between energy consumption and cloud workload and computational tasks, as well as system performance. Our research results can be integrated into cloud computing systems to monitor energy consumption and support static and dynamic system level-optimization.

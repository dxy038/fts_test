Modular Stacked Direct Current (MSDC) transmission and distribution system has been previously proposed for feeding power to distributed offshore oil compressor loads. This paper presents an improved MSDC system by integrating several offshore renewable sources with the existing one. Such a system will be more cost effective and will enable a bidirectional power flow between an onshore and offshore grid. To validate the control philosophy of this improved MSDC system, real-time hardware-in-loop (HIL) simulations are performed. Further, fault mitigation strategies for several offshore converter side faults are also presented. These mitigation strategies are tested using real-time simulations to support the reliability of this improved MSDC system.

Planning processes are strongly influenced by an increased awareness of environmental issues concerned by projected land-use transformations. A research project was carried out to produce climate maps for the region of Basel/Switzerland to enable planning authorities taking care of the urban climate and its interrelations with urban structures. Main focus was given to develop and implement a methodology meeting not only the regional requirements of Basel. The new approach is not depending on subjective criteria or manual interventions and ensures its applicability for other regions. Three basic concepts were developed or improved in this study. A new definition of ‘climatopes’ was introduced, and methods were developed for their digital determination by objective criteria. This definition of climatopes requires adequate information on land-use, which is provided by introducing the concept of ‘areal types'. In contrast to ‘traditional’ land-use classes directly derived from satellite images, areal types are complex aggregates reflecting not only different physical surface properties, but also socioeconomic aspects of land-use. ‘Ventilation classes’ are the second component required to delineate climatopes. They summarize the combined influencing factors of terrain features and land-use structures on wind field and urban ventilation. Their determination is based on topographic information and surface properties derived from a digital terrain model and from land-use data. The spatial distribution of climatopes was computed for Basel. Various quality assessment procedures and the application of climatopes for an automated generation of planning guidelines demonstrate the applicability of the concepts. Climate maps containing the results of the analysis and evaluation of the urban climate of Basel were estimated by the involved planners to be a valuable tool meeting their practical requirements to a high degree.

The remediation of heavy metal contaminated soils is one of the common challenge of researches in many industrial countries. The use of EDTA is one of the common soil-washing methods. In spite of several research conducted on this subject, the optimization of the use of EDTA for heavy metal removal from contaminated soils, specifically soils with relatively high surface area, are not well addressed in the literature.  The main objective of this research is to evaluate the optimization of the use of EDTA in remediation of Pb-contaminated bentonite. To achieve the above mentioned objective, bentonite samples were laboratory contaminated with different concentrations of lead nitrate. After drying the contaminated samples, they were exposed to different concentrations of EDTA. Then, the efficiency of Pb removal from samples were measured. The achieved results show that the quantity of  Pb ions by the application of EDTA is relatively equal to the concentration of applied EDTA. In addition, the quantity of removed Pb is only a function of EDTA/Pb ratio. In other words, such a removal is not dependent to the pH variations cused by different concentrations of Pb or EDTA. This approves that the high buffering capacity of bentonite in comparison to other variables of environment has the minimum impact on the interaction process of EDTA and heavy metal contaminated bentonite.

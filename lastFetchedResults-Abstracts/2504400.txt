Background: Embryo transfer (ET) has traditionally been performed two days after
oocyte retrieval. Delaying transfer from day two to day three or four would allow for
further development of the embryo, might therefore optimize the selection of viable and
best quality embryos for transfer and may be closer to the physiological time of the
entry into the uterus than transfer on day two, and might have a positive effect on
pregnancy outcomes.
Objective: The study aimed to determine whether delayed transfer of embryos from 2
to 3 or 4 days after oocyte retrieval and the pregnancy rate in ICSI (intra cytoplasmic
sperm injection) procedure.
Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study we evaluated infertile couples who
were referred to the Mehr Infertility Institute between 2006 and 2008 for ICSI,
according to the day of embryo transfer. We compared embryo quality, pregnancy rate
and implantation rate among day 2, 3 or 4 of transfers.
Pregnancy rate was confirmed by measurement of B-hCG in serum after 14 days. After
data collection, analysis was carried out with the t-test and chi squared tests by using the
statistical software package, SPSS.16.
Results: The overall clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) reported was 46.6%. The mean age
of women and duration of infertility didn't differ on the day of embryo transfer
(p > 0.05). Overall CPRs were not statistically different for day 2 (50.3%), day 3 (46.5%)
and day 4 (34.8%) transfers respectively, there were no significant differences in the age
of transferred embryos between pregnant and nonpregnant women (p > 0.05).
Conclusion: From the result of the present study there were no statistically significant
differences in pregnancy rates according to the day of embryo transfer.

This paper describes the implementation of a real-time computer control of a DC servomotor. The objective is to illustrate different questions concerning computer control theory and application, and to point out some of the characteristic offered by available methodology in numerical simulation, computer control, and parameter estimation. The program enables to estimate the systemÂ´s parametersusing a recursive least-square algorithm and, subsequently to control the system. The control strategy may be either linear, using state feedback, or nonlinear, implementing the switching curve of an industrial relay. These functions are implemented directly on the system or performed in numerical simulation. Dialogue and graphic display facilities are also included. The program is written in BASIC.

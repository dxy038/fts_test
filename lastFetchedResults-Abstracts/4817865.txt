The objective of this paper is to develop a Power Factor Correction for Single Phase PWM Rectifier. Single phase PWM rectifier is capable of AC to DC supply. The Aim of this work is to minimize total harmonics distortion in current and improvement of power factor of the system as well as improved regulation of DC link. The simulation of single phase PWM Rectifier is done in MATLAB.

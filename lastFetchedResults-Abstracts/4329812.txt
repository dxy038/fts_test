This work analyses a multi-user relay network with orthogonal channel access using OFDMA. For the considered Multiple Access Relay Channel (MARC) the relay performs non-adaptive Decode &amp; Forward (DF) with repetition coding. The objective of this paper is to find a resource allocation (subcarrier and power) which maximises the sum rate. Within this context, different algorithms are proposed which are supposed to be near-optimum. The algorithms will be derived and numerical results for their sum rate performance are presented.

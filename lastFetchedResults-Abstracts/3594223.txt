In CAD systems, it is often required to implement desired behaviors by some available device. The selection of the device that can implement the behavior, and the required interfacing, is usually done by human experts. The interface consists of transformations that may have to be performed on the inputs and outputs of the device. This paper describes an approach to automatically derive the specifications of the deviceÂ´s interface. For sequential circuits, the behaviors are often represented as FSMs, and hence the task is to determine whether the FSM of the desired function can be contained in the FSM of the device, subject to the transformations of the interface. A related objective, addressed in this paper, is to model the behaviors of complex devices in a way that facilitates the analysis.

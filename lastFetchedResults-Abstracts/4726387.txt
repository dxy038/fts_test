Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering, EECE 200, is a required course for all first year students majoring either in Computer and Communications Engineering (CCE) or in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the American University of Beirut (AUB). The objectives of this course are to introduce CCE and ECE students to the various fields in electrical and computer engineering and to the basic computer tools and laboratory instruments, in addition to giving them the opportunity to participate in a group engineering project early in their studies. This paper outlines one of the experiments in which, an inventive approach is outlined where several engineering software tools are introduced in a lab experiment with an objective of illustrating the technical computing environment such as PSPICE and MATLAB. They can be used to integrate computation, visualization, and programming environment in solving circuitry problems. StudentsÂ´ feedback is solicited in addition to faculty members teaching introductory courses in circuits, electronics and systems. Feedbacks received from all is analyzed and reported.

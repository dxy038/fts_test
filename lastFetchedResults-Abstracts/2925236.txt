Sanyo has been developing two types of residential solar-powered air conditioners. One is a unidirectional system, and the other is a bidirectional system. When using a 600 Wp photovoltaic (PV) array for the unidirectional system, the authors confirmed that the system can supply 50% of the power consumed by an air conditioner in summer. They also confirmed that the bidirectional system can feed surplus power back to the commercial power supply from the PV array, and can suppress the input current distortion of the air conditioner. There is little doubt that the introduction and widespread use of these systems will play an important role in reducing the peak power energy requirements in summer and the generation of carbon dioxide

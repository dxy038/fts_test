A new methodology named Evolutionary Artificial Potential Field (EAPF) is proposed for real-time robot path planning. The artificial potential field method is combined with genetic algorithms, to derive optimal potential field functions. The proposed EAPF approach is capable of navigating robot(s) situated among moving obstacles. Potential field functions for obstacles and goal points are also defined. The potential field functions for obstacles contain tunable parameters. The multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is utilized to identify the optimal potential field functions. Fitness functions such as goal-factor, obstacle-factor, smoothness-factor and minimum-pathlength-factor are developed for the MOEA selection criteria. An algorithm named escape-force is introduced to avoid the local minima associated with EAPF. Moving obstacles and moving goal positions were considered to test the robust performance of the proposed methodology. Simulation results show that the proposed methodology is efficient and robust for robot path planning with non-stationary goals and obstacles

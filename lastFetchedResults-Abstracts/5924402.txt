Electromagnetic (EM) fields are hardly noticeable and usually unknown for the general population. This unawareness and imperceptibility can generate distrust among the public, resulting in increased concerns on exposure to the EM radiation. The solution to these problems lies in the EM emission control, taking measurements and having a proper results presentation and communication with the public. Measurements turn the EM emissions into something objective and if presented to the public in an understandable format, they can help in diminishing unawareness and helplessness about the phenomenon of the EM field. As a support for the efforts to timely inform the public about real-time and overall level of EM field in the environment, our research team has started the development of the Serbian electromagnetic field monitoring network - SEMONT, intended for remote, continuous and intelligent, 24/365, broadband monitoring of EM fields. This paper considers the work in progress related to the development and testing of the SEMONT network and its Internet portal for the presentation of measurement results and the exposure assessment of general population.

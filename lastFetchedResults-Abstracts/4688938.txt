The main objective of this study is to discuss the quantificational risk assessment model of urban land reserve planning. Based on the proposed model, the risk of urban land reserve planning in Nanjing was evaluated by using literature data and empirical analysis. The results show that the whole situation of the risk of urban land reserve planning in each district of Nanjing was in bad situation. The proportion of the land area in the larger risk grade was more than 66 percent. The difference of planning risk in each land grade except for the eighth grade was little. It means that the proposed risk assessment model of urban land reserve planning is feasible, providing a favorable reference for the risk assessment model of urban land reserve.

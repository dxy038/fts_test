Guidelines have recommended that a family history of premature coronary heart disease (CHD) warrants screening and preventive efforts, including lifestyle change. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a lifestyle modification program on lipids and novel risk markers in young relatives of patients with premature CHD. In a parallel, randomized, intervention trial, intensified support to quit smoking and dietary modification was compared with general lifestyle advice in 172 men and women aged 18 to 39 years with a total cholesterol of 5 to 8 mmol/L and ≥1 lipid abnormality (high low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, triglycerides or lipoprotein(a), or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). All had a first-degree relative with premature CHD or with hyperlipidemia and other relative(s) with premature CHD, and 40% were daily smokers. After a mean of 8 months, the intervention group reduced the dietary intake of saturated fat and cholesterol compared with controls (p = &lt;0.01). Ten smokers in the intervention group quit, whereas 2 subjects in the control group started and none quit. LDL cholesterol (p = 0.007), oxidized LDL (p = 0.03), and E-selectin (p = 0.02) concentrations were reduced in the intervention group compared with controls. In subjects who quit smoking, concentrations of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 decreased (261 ± 66 to 228 ± 30 ng/ml) compared with that in continuing smokers (308 ± 106 ng/ml to 304 ± 109 ng/ml) (p = 0.05 between groups). These findings indicate that dietary modification and smoking cessation are feasible in young adults with familial premature CHD and document novel mechanisms by which lifestyle modification may reduce CHD risk.

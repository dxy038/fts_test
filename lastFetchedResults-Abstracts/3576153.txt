Many proposals of virtual regular topologies embedded in physical topologies for high-speed wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks do not consider the issue of allowing a variable number of nodes in the network. A solution for embedding a virtual unidirectional incomplete hypercube into a physical topology that does is presented. The proposed solution is a multichannel multihop network which has several elegant features: (a) it allows any number of nodes to be connected to the network, (b) it only requires a minor effort to reconfigure the new interconnection whenever a node is added or deleted for the network, (c) it supports a self-routing strategy, (d) the aggregate throughput of the network increases as more nodes are added, and (e) alternate paths are available which have a comparable distance to the destination as the primary path. The performance of the scheme is comparable to the performance of both the unidirectional hypercube and the bidirectional hypercube

The objective of this study was to evaluate the possibility of using treated industrial by-products as a zinc (Zn) source and compare their Zn availability and efficiency to ZnS04. A greenhouse factorial experiment in a completely randomized block design was conducted with corn (Zea mays L.) in triplicates. Treatments included three Zn sources (ZnS04, IUT-UT in size of < 1 mm and IUT-UT in size of 2-3 mm) at three rates (0, 20 and 40 kg ha"1). The results showed that Zn application both in the form of ZnS04 and treated industrial by-products significantly (P < 0.05) increased the growth and shoot dry matter yield of corn. Shoot dry matter weight of corn in pots that had received IUT- UT was higher compared to those that had received ZnS04. The highest shoot dry matter weight was produced at the IUT-UT treatment in size of < 1 mm. Increased fertilizer rate significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced shoot and root Zn concentration. However, this increase was higher in ZnS04 treatment as compared to the IUT-UT treatments. Application of the IUT-UT caused a significant increase in shoot Fe concentration of corn. Shoot and root Cd concentration in all experimental treatments was less than 0.02 mg kg'1. The results showed that IUT-UT can be used as a slow-release Zn fertilizer with low impurity.

A displacement search algorithm (DSA) is proposed in this paper to perform deformable block matching. A sub-pixel accuracy prediction and two-mode hybrid method is further proposed. The results show that DSA has about 2 dB better than full search. DSA gets better subjective and objective quality with reduced computation than gradient-based search algorithm, and much easier to implement with VLSI.

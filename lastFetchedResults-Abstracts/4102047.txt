This paper proposes a high-performance transformerless single-stage high step-up ac-dc matrix converter based on Cockcroft-Walton (CW) voltage multiplier. Deploying a four-bidirectional-switch matrix converter between the ac source and CW circuit, the proposed converter provides high quality of line conditions, adjustable output voltage, and low output ripple. The matrix converter is operated with two independent frequencies. One of which is associated with power factor correction (PFC) control, and the other is used to set the output frequency of the matrix converter. Moreover, the relationship among the latter frequency, line frequency, and output ripple will be discussed. This paper adopts one-cycle control method to achieve PFC, and a commercial control IC associating with a preprogrammed complex programmable logic device is built as the system controller. The operation principle, control strategy, and design considerations of the proposed converter are all detailed in this paper. A 1.2-kV/500-W laboratory prototype of the proposed converter is built for test, measurement, and evaluation. At full-load condition, the measured power factor, the system efficiency, and the output ripple factor are 99.9%, 90.3%, and 0.3%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate the high performance of the proposed converter and the validity for high step-up ac-dc applications.

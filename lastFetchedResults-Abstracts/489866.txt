Physiological study of wheat varieties under microclimate changes is veiy important to improve of their production in the future. The objective of this research was investigation of some quantitative traits in bread wheat under different levels of carbon dioxide (400 and 900 ppm), ultraviolet radiation (UV A, B, and C) and water deficit (up to 60% of field capacity). Experimental design was factorial arrangement in randomized complete block design with three replications. Results showed that grain yield, chlorophyll percent and maximum quantum efficiency in photosystem II decreased in bread wheat under water deficit when ultraviolet radiation intensity and concentration of carbon dioxide increased. C02 enrichment improved chlorophyll percent at water deficit. Seed number per spike decreased with ultraviolet radiation intensity and water deficit increased. But C02 enrichment increased seed number per spike in each level of ultraviolet radiation. However, Grain yield decreased when water deficit and ultraviolet radiation intensity increased. Grain yield variations were difference under carbon dioxide. At UVA and B radiations without water deficit, bread wheat grain yield decreased with C02 enrichment. At water deficit with C02 enrichment, grain yield increased. C02 enrichment without water deficit decreased chlorophyll percent; while at stress conduction, grain yield increased due to improve chlorophyll percent.

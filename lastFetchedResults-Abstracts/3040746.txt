This paper introduces a new color filter array (CFA) interpolation method for digital still cameras. The proposed interpolation scheme is able to overcome the limitations of existing CFA based image acquisition solutions, and restore color images without introducing false colors, edge blurring or visual artifacts. The method utilizes an edge-sensing mechanism, a color-difference model and a correction step. The employed correction process is useful in highly correlated images, however, in images with globally week correlation variations it is counter productive, therefore, a global control of the correction step is introduced. Simulation studies indicate that the proposed method is computationally efficient and yields excellent performance, in terms of subjective and objective image quality measures, while outperforming state-of-the-art CFA interpolation methods.

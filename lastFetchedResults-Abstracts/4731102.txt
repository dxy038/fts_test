Two airborne SAR systems observed jointly over Japan in October 2000. JPL´s AIRSAR system flew over Japan in the NASA´s Pacific Rim Campaign 2000 (PacRim2). At the same time, the Japanese airborne SAR system (Pi-SAR) has observed the same test area. We are aiming at technical and application objectives. The objective of the joint flight includes cross comparison of the capabilities between two systems. Cross calibration of the L-band between Pi-SAR and AIRSAR at the Tottori sand-dune with corner-reflectors. Various applications such as forestry, vegetation, urban environment, volcano, and oceanography using four-band full-polarimetry are possible to investigate using combination of Pi-SAR and AIRSAR data. Digital elevations derived from interferometry of both systems are compared to investigate the errors by influence of penetration depth. Ground-based experiments for this purpose were carried out at the same time in many areas of Japan

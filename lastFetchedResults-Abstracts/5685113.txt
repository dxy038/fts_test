Fierce competition due to globalization, demand diversity and technological breakthroughs stimulates enterprises to coordinate in a supply chain in order to gain mutual benefits. In such a distributive, autonomous and dynamic business environment, semantic Web services which combines Web services architecture and semantic Web is more adapted to facilitate supply chain coordination than existing information technologies. In this paper, we propose OWL-S as ontology for describing heterogeneous Web services in supply chains and analyze the interaction process, including automated discovery, composition and invocation of semantic Web services, by means of OWL-S. Specifically, we present a framework to facilitate automated composition of semantic Web services based on mediator and bidirectional chaining composition algorithm which is more adaptive, accurate and effective.

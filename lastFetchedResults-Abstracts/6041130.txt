The quiet waters of electromagnetism have been converted into waves by the arrival of winds from metamaterials (MM). They have appeared as a new expression in the theory of classical electromagnetics. In addition many electrical and electronics engineers have pointed out that almost all new applications arising from metamaterial concepts can be understood by using more conventional approaches, that is, without the need to invoke these metamaterial concepts. So, what is new in metamaterials? This paper introduces this new class of materials in brief; however the main objective of this paper is to discuss the applications of metamaterial at microwave frequencies. This is because these materials have opened new dimensions for rapid designing systems and sophisticated fabrication techniques even beyond microwave frequencies.

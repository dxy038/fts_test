Objective:
Several investigations have demonstrated that Rosa damascena has an
inhibitory effect on the hypothalamus and on pituitary system reactivity
in the rat; it has also been shown that the essential oil of Rosa damascena has significant antiepileptic effects on pentylentetrazole (PTZ) induced seizures in rats. We aim ed at assessing the effects of the essential oil of Rosa damascena when used as an adjun ct treatm ent to treat children with refractory seizures
Materials and Methods:
In this double-blind clini cal trial, conducted as a pilot study between April
2004 and March 2005, we administered essential oil of Rosa damascena to sixteen chi ldren with refractory epilepsy as an adjunct therapy, and evaluated its effects.
Results:
16 patients , age range 3-13 years, were enrolled; 56.3% (n=9) girls and
43.8% (n=7) boys. All hasbeen under treatment for 3-6 weeks (baseline phase). They received either the essential oil or placebo for a period of 4 weeks and in between these periods, they took only their pre-existing antiepileptic drugs for two weeks (washout phase).
The mean frequency of seizures in th ose using essential oil, showed
significant decrease ascompared to the controls using placeboes (p=0.00).
Conclusion:
It can be concluded that the essential oil of Rosa Damascena has beneficial antiepileptic effect in children with refractory seizures.

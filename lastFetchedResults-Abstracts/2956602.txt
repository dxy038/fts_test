This paper proposes a rest cost prediction model which estimates the cost of lC testing in a manufacturing environment. The model predicts chip testing cost and quality of test using a set of circuit manufacturing parameters. The objective is to use these circuit parameters which are available at the early stage of the design cycle to determine and optimize manufacturing test cost

The objective of this study was to discuss the effects of spatial information on hydrologic simulation. WinVAST model was applied for hydrologic simulation. Synthetic watershed and scenario designs were discussed in this study. The result shows that both the accuracy of watershed delineation and the completeness of rainfall records can influence hydrologic simulations. Increase to delineation resolution does not always produce improved simulation results, because incomplete rainfall records can result in simulation errors. Therefore, it is significant to determine the optimal resolution of watershed delineation for improving the reliability of hydrologic simulation in a watershed.

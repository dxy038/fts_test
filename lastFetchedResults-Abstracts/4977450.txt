The objective of this work is to investigate the performance of a new inloop filter for video compression, which uses temporal rather than spatial information to improve the quality of reference frames used for prediction. The new filter has been integrated into the H.264/AVC baseline encoder and tested on a wide range of sequences. Experimental results show that the filter achieves a bit rate reduction of up to 12% and more than 4% on average without increasing the complexity of either encoder or decoder significantly.

A new chaotic system is controlled by linear-feedback control method which can confine the chaotic system to its stable period orbit. Applying Routh-Hurwitz criterion, we can get the right feedback parameters. But itÂ´s difficult to get the parameters in the multi-dimensional chaotic system. So we simplify rules to get parametric curve. The choice principle of feedback parameters to attain control objective is proved strictly by combining the linear state feedback method. Numerical simulation shows that this method is feasible and effective.

An optical head composed of an optical module and a biaxial actuator is designed for small form factor drives. This system adopts a finite-conjugate objective lens with numerical aperture 0.65 for 654-nm wavelength. A holographic optical element is used for simplifying the optical configuration which provides a better approach for alignment. The actuator is of a spider-like suspension for the focusing and is of a swing arm for the tracking.

Three cases of widespread sea fog in Lunenburg Bay, Nova Scotia were used to evaluate the
suitability of operational regional GEM forecast fields for inferring advection fog occurrences. Verification
scores suggest that the objective analyses contain significant departures from observations that will affect
model accuracy, given the sensitivity of fog condensation microphysics. Dew point depression (ES) scores
show larger differences compared to temperature, with both influenced by surface characteristics. For
objective analyses and GEM forecasts ES < 2 C seems to match fog satellite images better than the
physical threshold ES Â£ 0 C. In addition the GEM forecasts show a general tendency towards drier
conditions near the surface, therefore reconfiguring GEM to better represent condensation in the boundary
layer is proposed.

Robotics, Virtual Reality, Exoskeleton and Human Machine Interface are fields of growing interest and applications every day. Robotic systems have enormous potential to reduce human exposure to dangerous situations and/or increase human presence in remote locations. Most of industrial robots are usually controlled by a computer or micro controllers to perform systematic sequence of actions stored in its memory. Navigation of autonomous robots involves following trajectories generated by automatic motion planners. For non-autonomous systems, the robotÂ´s trajectories are provided by the operator, either trajectories that are pre-set or fed in an on-line fashion, such as teleoperation. Teleoperation is widely used for the direct control of non-autonomous robots from a remote location. The objective of this paper is to facilitate the controlling process by using human-machine interface techniques instead of predefined limited actions in its memory; this is done in order to be able to control the robot arm remotely to discover the World Wide II mines that are still in the western desert of Egypt.

The scheduling problem of semiconductor manufacturing systems has multiple responses of interest. The objective is to simultaneously optimize these different responses or to find the best-compromised solution. Most previous research in the area of semiconductor manufacturing systems has focused on optimizing a single performance measure. Dabbas and Fowler proposed a modified dispatching approach that combines multiple dispatching criteria into a single rule with the objective of simultaneously optimizing multiple objectives. In this paper, we validate their proposed approach using two different fab models at different levels of complexity: a hypothetical six stage-five machines Mini-Fab model and a full scale wafer fab model adapted from an actual Motorola wafer fab. We also discuss the actual implementation of the proposed dispatching algorithm into a scheduler for daily operation at a Motorola wafer fabrication facility. Results show an average 20% improvement for all responses when using the proposed dispatching approach.

In recent years, various discriminative learning techniques for HMMs have consistently yielded significant benefits in speech recognition. In this paper, we present a novel optimization technique using the minimum classification error (MCE) criterion to optimize the HMM parameters. Unlike maximum mutual information training where an extended Baum-Welch (EBW) algorithm exists to optimize its objective function, for MCE training the original EBW algorithm cannot be directly applied. In this work, we extend the original EBW algorithm and derive a novel method for MCE-based model parameter estimation. Compared with conventional gradient descent methods for MCE learning, the proposed method gives a solid theoretical basis, stable convergence, and it is well suited for the large-scale batch-mode training process essential in large-scale speech recognition and other pattern recognition applications. Evaluation experiments, including model training and speech recognition, are reported on both a small vocabulary task (TI-digits) and a large vocabulary task (WSJ), where the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated. We expect new future applications and success of this novel learning method in general pattern recognition and multimedia processing, in addition to speech and audio processing applications we present in this paper

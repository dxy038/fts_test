Secondary imagery dissemination (SID) is the process of post-collection and electronic dissemination of digital imagery and associated data. SID systems (SIDS) provide exploited, non-original, annotated, anonymous-source imagery from intelligence, fusion, and dissemination centers. Ultra-high frequency (UHF) operation penetrates double-canopy jungle or heavy rain to provide imagery from an INTEL center to highly-mobile tactical users. The evolutionary path of UHF SIDS commenced with a system based on previously-fielded equipment for tactical battlefield commanders receiving intelligence information over tactical related applications (TRAP) data dissemination system (TDDS) receivers. As tactical transceivers appeared in the inventory, SIDS networks migrated to dedicated satellite communications (SATCOM) receivers with embedded cryptography giving users talk-back capability for query or tasking the imagery sensor or data fusion center. In concert with the desire for users to share the scarce resource of available SATCOM channels, the SIDS roadmap is turning to DAMA networks for assignment to a wideband (25 kHz) demand-assigned single-access (DASA) channel for transfer of large, compressed imagery files. The near-term hope of re-mining available UHF SATCOM assets for greater bandwidth appears to be feasible with the advent of continuous phase modulation (CPM). Long-term solutions lie in the plans for the mobile user objective system (MUOS). The key to SIDS interoperability is the ability of mandated image formatting and communication protocols to embrace COTS initiatives

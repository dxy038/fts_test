Black start is the primary procedure deployed for rapid recovery from a complete blackout. For isolated power systems such as the Taiwan power system (TPS), a reliable and efficient black start procedure is more important than interconnected power systems. In this paper, a black start decision-supporting system (BSS) with an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed. BSS can rapidly generate optimal black start strategies according to the updated system data configuration and objective function; furthermore, BSS can automatically simulate the strategies and visualize the results. By applying the BSS to evaluate the black start strategies for TPS, the effectiveness of BSS has been demonstrated. The BSS has been utilized by Taiwan Power Company (TPC) for black start planning with comparison to traditional manual planning. With the aid of BSS, the dispatchers are equipped with more support and the restoration risk can be much alleviated.

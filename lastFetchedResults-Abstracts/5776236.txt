In this paper, we study the traffic signal control problem of an isolated intersection. This problem was motivated when we tried to guide some vehicles to pass an intersection in the background of Intelligent Transportation System. We propose a new signal control method with developed technology of recognizing vehicles. Our objective is to schedule all approaching vehicles to pass this intersection in the shortest duration. We regard this problem as a single machine scheduling problem. The structural properties of this problem are investigated and an efficient branch-and-bound algorithm is proposed. Computational experiments show the efficiency of our algorithm.

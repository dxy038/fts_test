Penetration of distributed generation (DG) units in distribution network has increased rapidly stimulated by reduced
network power loss, improved bus voltage profile, and better power quality. Appropriate size and allocation of DG
units play a significant role to get beneficial effects. The objective of this study is to demonstrate a simple and fast
technique to determine appropriate location and size of DG units. A voltage stability indicator (VSI) is derived which
can quantify the voltage stability conditions of buses in distribution network. According to VSI, vulnerable buses of
the network are arranged rank-wise to form a priority list for allocation of DG units. To determine the size of DG
units, a feed forward artificial neural network is prepared in MATLAB environment (The MathWorks, Inc.,
Massachusetts, USA). The effectiveness of the proposed methodology has been tested on a 52-bus radial
distribution network. After appropriate allocation of DG units, voltage profiles of most of the buses are increased
significantly. The results also indicated that the total loss of the distribution network has reduced by nearly 76.39%,
and voltage stability conditions of buses are improved considerably. Voltage stability conditions of bus-13, bus-36,
and bus-44 are raised by 23.16%, 29.23%, and 37.64% respectively.

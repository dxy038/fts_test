The main objective of the present research is to examine trends change in climatic elements in the north of Iran. The daily data of minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation of 6 stations of the area under study are retrieved from Iranian meteorological organization and the are used to calculate other parameters such as average and range of temperature in seasonal and annual scale. Then, Mann Kendal and T-test methods are used for cal-culating the change in aforementioned climatic parameters on seasonal and annual scale. The results of the research indicate a meaningful increasing trend in minimum, maximum and mean temperature and a meaningful decreasing trend in temperature range. Precipitation on seasonal and annual scale do not have significant trends.

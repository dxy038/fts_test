Bioshale is a project co-funded by the European Commission (FP6 programme) that started in October 2004. The main objective of the Bioshale project is to define innovative biotechnological processes for ‘environmentally-aware’ exploitation of black shale ores. Three black shale deposits have been chosen as targets of the R&amp;D actions. These include one deposit that exists under natural conditions (Talvivaara, Finland), one currently being processed (Lubin, Poland) and one after mining (Mansfeld, Germany).

ack shale ores contain base, precious and ‘high-tech’ and rare metals but also high contents of organic matter that handicap metal recovery by conventional techniques.

mary, the main technical aspects of the work plan are:–
tion of the geological resources &amp; selection of metal-bearing raw materials;

ion of biological consortia to be tested for mineral processing;

ment of hydrometallurgical routes, including bioprocessing, for metals recovery;

cal-economic evaluation of new processes from mining to metal recovery including social and environmental impacts.


rview of the main results of the work in progress by the 13 European partners (from 8 countries) is presented.

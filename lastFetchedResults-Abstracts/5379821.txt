Energy consumption is a major problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) because energy resources of sensors are limited. Several protocols have been created to solve this problem. The main objective of these protocols is to maximize the connectivity and network lifetime. Therefore, the choice of the routing algorithm that delivers packets in a wireless sensor network has to be done in a way to preserve energy. This paper presents a novel adaptive routing algorithm based on image processing algorithm, which utilizes the gradient to select a more energy efficient path.

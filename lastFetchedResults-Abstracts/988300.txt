In this study, spectroscopic and conductometric investigations of the interactions
between oxyphenonium bromide (OXBr) and two dyes; chromotrope 2R (C2R) and
ammonium reineckate (AMRT) are reported. The solubility product constant as well as other
parameters related to the process of precipitating OXBr is premeditated operating the
conductometric procedure. Moreover, contemporary approaches towards equivalence point
localization have been pursued and compared. In this itinerary, the numerical differential
conductivity methods were objective and systematic. However, Boltzmann sigmoid fitting
model was more adequate for data analysis with less errors compared to the conventional and
the differential methods. A molar ratio of (1:1) (OXBr:reagent) complexes in aqueous
solutions have been determined conductometrically.The described procedures allowed the
investigation of OXBr within the range of 3-15 mg using both reagents. Moreover, the
obtained precipitate has been spectroscopically characterized using IR and 1H-NMR. The
proposed conductometric method was applied successively to pharmaceutical formulations
containing OXBr and the results obtained were favorably compared with those obtained using
the reference method

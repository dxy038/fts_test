One of the key challenges of the model-driven paradigm is to define, manage, and maintain traces and relationships between different models and model views, including the code of the system. In the COMBINE, DAIM and CAFE projects, we aim to define a framework supporting the model-driven paradigm. A main part of the framework is a metamodel-based transformation profile, which is aimed at supporting the definition of transformation schemes and being a baseline for transformation execution. Our primary objective is to assist a complete development lifecycle, from business models, via a requirements model, to architecture models, platform models and code, with a framework that helps us in a simple way to define transformations, mappings, and refinements. The framework should provide a usable notation that can be modelled with standard UML tools. The contribution of this paper is a baseline for such a framework.

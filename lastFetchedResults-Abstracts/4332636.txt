This paper presents an LMI (linear matrix inequality) approach to obtain an optimal controller, for a coal-fired power plant. This is an alternative and an extension of the results obtained. The objective considered is a fast tracking of load step changes while keeping the pressure variations constrained. Also a constraint on the control inputs, introducing a new LMI constraint, is taken into account. In the end the performance is well improved, while keeping the control inputs within their limits.

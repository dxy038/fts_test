The objective of our research is the development of fast, noninvasive automated optical technologies for the detection of the molecular-specific signatures of cervical precancers. Potential technologies are evaluated using a five-part paradigm including biological plausibility, technical feasibility, intermediate outcomes, patient acceptance, and societal outcomes. Results of ongoing clinical trials of fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy will be discussed. In addition, the biological basis of each technology is discussed. Because the biologic basis of the technologies differ, a combination of more than one optical approach may provide more accurate assessment of tissue physiological state than would be possible using any one technique alone.

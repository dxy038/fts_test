Summary form only given. As widespread deployment of high-capacity dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) systems is envisioned, achieving efficient shared-path protection, which protects a bandwidth guaranteed connection from a single link (node) failure using a link (node) disjoint pair of active path (AP) and backup path (BP), becomes a key design consideration. We have introduced two parameters (&#949; and &#956;) into the objective function of integer linear programming (ILP) models for dynamic provisioning of restorable, bandwidth guaranteed connections using shared-path protection. By using &#949; (0 &lt; &#949; &lt; 1), we can obtain a lower total bandwidth (TBW) consumption than using &#949; = 1 as in the existing models. In addition, using 1 &#8805; &#956; &gt; 0 can avoid the pitfall of choosing very long backup paths that is common in existing models (where &#956; = 0), thus reducing the BP length and consequently restoration time. One of the pleasantly surprising results is that, by combining an appropriate &#949; (e.g., 0.1) and &#956; (e.g., 0.2), the proposed models can achieve a TBW consumption with shorter BP than the existing ones.

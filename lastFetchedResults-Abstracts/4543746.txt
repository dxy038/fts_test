Despite the growing success of WLAN systems, current spectrum resource allocation algorithms lack flexibility to closely follow the traffic variations and adapt the spectrum allocation in consequence, leading to performance loss. In this article we propose a flexible and powerful distributed spectrum allocation algorithm, called AB-DFSA, able to learn over time and with the objective to maximize the system throughput by using multi-user diversity, and able to quickly adapt the spectrum allocation in consequence. Such an algorithm finds its application in the scope of WLAN systems (e.g., 802.11x)

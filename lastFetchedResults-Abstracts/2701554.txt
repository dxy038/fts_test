A method to extract the pinned photodiode (PPD) physical parameters inside a CMOS image sensor pixel array is presented. The proposed technique is based on the Tan et al. pinning voltage characteristic. This pixel device characterization can be performed directly at the solid-state circuit output without the need of any external test structure. The presented study analyzes the different injection mechanisms involved in the different regimes of the characteristic. It is demonstrated that in addition to the pinning voltage, this fast measurement can be used to retrieve the PPD capacitance, the pixel equilibrium full well capacity, and both the transfer gate threshold voltage and its channel potential at a given gate voltage. An alternative approach is also proposed to extract an objective pinning voltage value from this measurement.

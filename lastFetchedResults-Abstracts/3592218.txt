The temporal characteristics of a standing wave Tm<sup>3+</sup>-doped silica fibre laser are presented. For uni-directional pumping, the output displays the well-known self-pulsation phenomenon, but with bidirectional pumping, a significant increase in the laser stability is observed. A longitudinally uniform population inversion is shown to be of paramount importance to the stability of three-level lasers.

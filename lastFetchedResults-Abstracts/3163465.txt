The transmission network expansion planning model under interval load is built. This model considers the load uncertainty. Its objective is the minimum of investment and its constraints are the network safety under both normal and NR&#785;1 conditions. The interval minimum load cutting theory is used and the interval maximum load cutting number is calculated to judge the safety of transmission expansion planning scheme under interval load. The greedy randomized adaptive search procedure algorithm (GRASP) is used to solve the model. The 6-bus and 77-bus system cases prove the rightness and validity of the method proposed in this paper.

The basic concepts are given of microprogrammable processor emulation in distributed systems used as intelligent node machines in computer networks. The primary purposes of this design investigation are to emulate the processor prototype instruction set of a 16-b prototype IBM 8140 with the basic aim of increasing its performance and to demonstrate the use of microprogrammable bit-slices based on the bipolar microprocessor family Am2900. The goal of the investigation is pure processor emulation without the overall configuration of the terminal station. The objective is to obtain a satisfactory decision, i.e., an optimum balance between the application hardware and the operations execution speed.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

The objective of this paper is to verify through computer simulations the capabilities and limitations of several adaptive and robust controllers. Two different adaptation algorithms are reviewed and applied to a Puma 560 manipulator model. Both compensators consist of a PD type controller in conjunction with an adaptation law, which enables the system to estimate the magnitude of the unknown parameters. Two different trajectory generators are used, and for some simulations the inputs are corrupted with white noise. Performance claims were verified and some limitations of the algorithms were identified.

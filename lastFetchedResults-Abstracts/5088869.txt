The Spanish Association of Telecommunication Engineers (AEIT) is a private non-profit organization that was established 83 years ago. Since it was created, the AEIT has been defending this profession, the telecommunication engineers, and the way engineering has to be done in order to improve quality of communication services, in a direct way, and to develop our society and enhance the economy, in an indirect one. To meet that objective, well prepared professionals who are able to design networks and services were needed. The AEIT has been involved in reaching it. Chronological order will be followed in this paper, completed by some relevant aspects, which will give a general view of all the things that the AEIT has done during its life.

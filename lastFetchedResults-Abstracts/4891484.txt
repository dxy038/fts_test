One way to solve the congestion problem in a deregulated power system is re-dispatching the generation. This paper investigates the impacts of thyristor controlled series capacitor (TCSC) and static VAr compensator (SVC) on this re-dispatch method with the objective of minimizing the total amount of transactions being curtailed. An algorithm of optimal power flow (OPF) to reduce the transaction curtailment through installing TCSC/SVC in the system is proposed in this paper. Both the pool type transaction and the bilateral type transaction can be taken care using this method. This paper also investigates the improvement of total transfer capability (TTC) by using TCSC and SVC with the consideration of transaction patterns. With the increase of TTC, the possibility of congestion occurrence will be reduced. The TTC calculation is solved by OPF. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effect of TCSC/SVC on transaction curtailment and TTC improvements. The test results show that the effect is significant. Finally, this paper suggests some potential future research.

The objective of the present work is to propose a new adaptive wavelet-Galerkin method based on
the lowest-order hat interpolation wavelets. The speci<c application of the present method is made on
the one-dimensional analysis of thin-walled box beam problems exhibiting rapidly varying local end
e=ects. Higher-order interpolation wavelets have been used in the wavelet-collocation setting, but the
lowest-order hat interpolation is applied here <rst and a hat interpolation wavelet-based Galerkin method
is newly formulated. Unlike existing orthogonal or biorthogonal wavelet-based Galerkin methods, the
present method does not require special treatment in dealing with general boundary conditions. Furthermore,
the present method directly works with nodal values and does not require special formula
for the evaluation of system matrices. Though interpolation wavelets do not have any vanishing moment,
an adaptive scheme based on multi-resolution approximations is possible and a preconditioned
conjugate gradient method can be used to enhance numerical e@ciency

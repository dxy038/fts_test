The discontinuation of statin therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes has been associated with an increase of adverse coronary events. Patients who undergo major surgery frequently are not able to take oral medication shortly after surgery. Because there is no intravenous formula for statins, the interruption of statins in the postoperative period is a serious concern. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of perioperative statin withdrawal on postoperative cardiac outcome. Also, the association between outcome and type of statin was studied. In 298 consecutive statin users who underwent major vascular surgery, detailed cardiac histories were obtained, and medication use was noted. Postoperatively, troponin levels were measured on days 1, 3, 7, and 30 and whenever clinically indicated by electrocardiographic changes. End points were postoperative troponin release, myocardial infarction, and a combination of nonfatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. Multivariate analyses and propensity score analyses were performed to assess the influence of type of statin and the discontinuation of statins for these end points. Statin discontinuation was associated with an increased risk for postoperative troponin release (hazard ratio 4.6, 95% confidence interval 2.2 to 9.6) and the combination of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death (hazard ratio 7.5, 95% confidence interval 2.8 to 20.1). Extended-release fluvastatin was associated with fewer perioperative cardiac events compared with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin. In conclusion, the present study showed that statin withdrawal in the perioperative period is associated with an increased risk for perioperative adverse cardiac events. Furthermore, there seemed to be better outcomes in patients who received statins with extended-release formulas.

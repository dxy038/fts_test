Objective
To examine sex differences in birthweight–lipid associations.
Methods and results
Using prospectively collected data on birthweight and non-fasting lipid levels at age 44–45 y from the 1958 British birth cohort (3603 men and 3583 women), sex differences in birthweight–lipid associations were examined.
There were inverse associations between birthweight and total and low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol among women (a 1 kg increase in birthweight was associated with a 0.13 mmol/L reduction in total cholesterol (p < 0.001) and a 0.07 mmol/L reduction in LDL-cholesterol (p = 0.02)) but no associations among men (p = 0.005 and p = 0.01, respectively, for birthweight × sex interactions). There was an inverse association between birthweight and triglycerides of a similar magnitude in both sexes (a 1 kg increase in birthweight was associated with a 7% reduction in triglyceride levels in sex-adjusted models (p < 0.001)). There was no association between birthweight and high-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol. Associations were largely unaltered after adjustment for covariates. Of birthweight, current height and BMI, the latter was the strongest predictor of lipid levels.
Conclusions
The finding of an inverse association between birthweight and triglycerides in both sexes and of inverse associations between birthweight and total and LDL-cholesterol only in women suggests that the mechanisms underlying the associations with birthweight may vary for different lipids.

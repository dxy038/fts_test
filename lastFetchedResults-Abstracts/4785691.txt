With the adoption of Blackboard Collaborate v12 synchronous web-conferencing system by SIM University (UniSIM) in January 2013, this presentation will focus on the recording feature of Collaborate and discuss the possibility of using it along with Classroom Reply and Articulate, the two software systems/tools recommended and recognized by the university´s Educational Technology and Production (ETP) department for the recording of chunked lectures by instructors. In view of the limited availability of the recording studio which is required for Classroom Replay and the limited Articulate licenses available, Collaborate Recording may be considered as an additional option. The objective of this presentation is to promote awareness about Collaborate Recording and discuss the possibility and limitation of using this system for lesson recording. In the context of UniSIM´s video production environment, Collaborate Recording is considered a &#8220;low-tech&#8221; solution in comparison with Classroom Replay which requires the instructor to be physically present at UniSIM´s recording studio for the recording of chunked lectures. Significantly, Collaborate Recording has been found to be an effective tool for learning in a study on synchronous computer-mediated instruction. The key findings are discussed in this paper.

In this paper, the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope mission is introduced. Its primary objective is to perform the hard X-ray all sky survey of high resolution and high sensitivity. The expected angular resolution and position accuracy of the satellite are better than 10′ and 2′, respectively. The preliminary mission design is analyzed. And a new attitude subsystem scheme is presented to meet the high precision demand of attitude determination. A conclusion is drawn that the mission design is feasible. The possible launch of it will significantly advance the astrophysical study.

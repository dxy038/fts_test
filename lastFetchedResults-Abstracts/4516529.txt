This paper describes the integration efforts by Teradyne and Hewlett-Packard to produce the Radio Frequency Analog Digital (RFAD) tester for the B-2 Depot at Tinker AFB. The objective was to combine commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components while meeting the depot´s system-level performance requirements. This paper discusses aspects of the integration effort, including hardware integration and test, software integration, and verification of system specifications. Hardware topics include the use of a matrix switching configuration to provide hybrid digital/analog pins and an RF interface switch matrix to ensure signal integrity at the RF system interface. Software topics include the integration of Teradyne´s ProgramGuide software with Hewlett-Packard´s Visual Engineering Environment (HP VEE) to provide a single, integrated test executive environment. The paper also discusses the self-test and normalization techniques used to ensure signal specifications are met at the RFAD´s interfaces. The conclusion summarizes the challenges of integrating COTS test hardware and software on the scale required by the B-2 Depot, and describes technology that can be applied to a wide range of avionics applications

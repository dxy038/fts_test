Background: Characterization and application of medicinal plants essential oils may be useful in counteracting drug-resistant infections.
Objective: To evaluate the antifungal efficacy of myrtle (Myrtus communis L.) essential oils on oral candidiasis in immunosuppressed rats.
Methods: The essential oil of myrtle was extracted by hydrodistillation method and its components and content were recognized by GC and GC-MS apparatuses. The MIC of essential oil and nystatin was determined by broth macrodilution procedures. Thirty five rats weighting 200 ± 20g was randomly arranged in 5 treatment groups including: (1) placebo group, (2) myrtle essential oil-treated group (2-fold MIC), (3) nystatin-treated group, (4) Non-immunosupressed-infected group, and (5) Immunosupressed-noninfected group. The strong pathogen was isolated from the vaginal secretion of a patient suffering from acute vaginitis. Infection level and therapeutic effects was evaluated by microbiological, histopathological methods and clinical examinations.
Results: Alpha-pinene, limonene, linalool, alpha-terpineol and linaleol acetate were main components of the essential oil. The MIC of the essential oil and nystatin was 2 mg/ml and 4µg/ml against Candida albicans, respectively. Microbiological and histopathological evaluations indicated that the essential oil of Myrtus communis had significant activity against C. albicans (p  <  0.01). Of course, there was still limited area of infection in some region of mocusa in the back of tongues in which it can remain dormantly and result in illness appearing. 
Conclusion: The treatment by myrtle essential oil at concentration of 2 fold MIC was not sufficient to remove completely oral candidiasis in immunosupressed rats. Therefore, it should be evaluated the doses of essential oil more than 2-fold MIC in the formulation in order to the completely eradication of candidiasis.

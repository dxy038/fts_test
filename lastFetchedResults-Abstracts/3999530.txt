THE MATERIALS Subcommittee of the AIEE Magnetic Amplifier Committee was organized principally to set up standards and to encourage the interchange of information on materials used in conjunction with magnetic amplifiers. One of the projects undertaken by the Subcommittee has been the standardization of magnetic tape-wound toroidal-core sizes. To accomplish this objective, a separate Working Group was formed in Nov. 1953 and charged with the responsibility of developing a list of recommended standard nominal sizes for tape-wound toroidal cores. The proposed standards in this report were established by the working group in June 1956, approved by the Materials Subcommittee in July 1956, and adopted by the AIEE Magnetic Amplifier Committee in Nov. 1956.

Background: Infertility with an incidence of about 15% has been considered one of the major burdens on the community and has even been a threat to the continuity of the family life. One of the most prevalent causes of women infertility is ovarian causes particularly PCOS. The objective of this study was to determine the outcome of IVF & ET in women with PCOS in comparison with tubal factor.
Material and Methods: This historical cohort study was performed from 2000 to 2002, in Royan Institute. Our cases consisted of 33 patients with PCOS (without any other causes of infertility)  who  failed  standard  ovulation  induction  treatment  with  clomiphen  citrate  (?6
cycles) and had undergone 33 cycles of IVF & ET. Control group consisted of 76 patients
with only tubal factor infertility. Our study was performed during the first cycle of IVF in two groups, using long protocol with Buserelin (GnRHa and HMG). IVF and ET cycle characteristics were compared using studentâ€™s t-test, ?2 and Fisher's exact test.
Results: The results of this research showed that a statistically significant difference existed in mean age and incidence of OHSS between the two groups. But there were no statistically significant differences in duration of follicular phase, the duration of GnRHa use up to onset of HMG, cyst number after using GnRHa, the percentage of cyst aspiration, HMG ampule consumption, retrieved oocyte, number of embryo per patient, embryo transfer per patient, cycle cancellation and pregnancy rate per embryo transfer in two groups.
Conclusion: The result of this study showed that IVF/ET can be a successful treatment in PCOS patients resistant to other usual treatments and that hormonal disturbance of
PCOs patients had no significant effect on IVF/ET outcome in comparison to patients with tubal factor.


Objective
Children suffering from Cerebral Palsy (CP), exhibit movement limitations and 
physiological abnormalities as compared to normal individuals.
The objective of this study was to assess mechanical efficiency and certain 
cardiovascular indices before and after an exercise-rehabilitation program in 
children with dipelegia spastic cerebral palsy (experimental group) in comparison 
with able-bodied children(controls).
Material and Methods
In this study, 15 spastic cerebral palsy (dipelegic) children participated in an 
exercise-rehabilitation program, three days a week for three months with an 
average 144bpm of heart rate. The mechanical efficiency (net, gross), rest 
and submaximal heart rate and maximal oxygen consumption(VO2max
) were 
measured before (pretest) and after (posttest) exercise program on the cycle 
ergometer according to the Macmaster ergometer protocol. Then control group, 
of 18 normal children underwent the exercise program and were assessed, 
following which results of the 2 groups were compared using SPSS for statistical 
analysis (P < 0.05).
Results
Mechanical efficiency (net, gross) increased significantly in CP patients after the 
exercise-rehabilitation program; reults did not alter significantly for the controls. 
Rest and submaximal heart rate in CP patients decreased significantly after 
exercise program. Maximal oxygen consumption, which remained unchanged 
in patients following the exercise program, was similar in patients and controls 
after the program.
Conclusion
Cerebral palsy patients, because of their high muscle tone, severe degree of 
spasticity, and involuntary movements are physically more incapacitated and 
need more energy than normal able-bodied individuals.Rehabilitation and 
aerobic exercise can be effective in improving their cardiovascular fitness and 
muscle function and increasing their mechanical efficiency

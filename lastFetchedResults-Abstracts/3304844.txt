The two-side optimal Matching between employees and positions is considered in the optimal configuration of human resource in construction enterprise using the two-sided matching theory. Based the two-sided evaluation index system between Employees and Positions, the two-sided matching degree is defined by calculating the distance of evaluation information with ideal value. A multi-objective optimization model is constructed to maximize the two-sided satisfaction degree. Finally, a numerical example of the project managerÂ´s configuration for a construction enterprise is given to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

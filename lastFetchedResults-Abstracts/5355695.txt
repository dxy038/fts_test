Due to the aging population issue and a shortage of health workers around the world, the demand of automatic patient monitoring systems is expected to increase in the near future. Wireless sensor networks have been recently used in many medical applications because of their properties such as low-power consumption, low cost and large network size. The objective of this research is to develop an automatic patient monitoring system to facilitate the real time monitoring of patients. The wireless medical sensor network has been designed and implemented using microcontroller CC2430 from Texas Instruments. Electrocardiogram sensor and triaxis accelerometer are deployed on the sensor node.

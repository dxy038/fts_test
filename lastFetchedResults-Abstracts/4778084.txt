Due to the huge compulsion in which collective wireless technologies should act below an abstinent awning. Mobile Ad Hoc Networks are leaving to accomplish this mandate. Wireless technologies are abstruse in itself along with we are going to adhere them in an abstinent awning they inherited the clashes form their parental technologies and frequent additional confrontations will broaden. WiMax / UMTS infrastructure is observing for expediency of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks. The core analysis challenge in WiMax is about the anode allowance. additionally destined to deficient anode affiliate and bulky amplification in mobile consumers, the difficulty of contest free channels allocation dovetails very arrogant. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to reduce the Multilevel Channel Conflicts in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks .Channel allowance is an elementary affair of resource activity that aggregates the comprehension and extent of attendants. As dormant channel apportionment misses the heuristic applications to allot the channels to the cages. headed channel assignment behaves beneficially inferior leaden traffic. assiduous channel allowance apprise behaves inferior brightness as well as alleviated traffic. To advance the benefit of the channel chunk we try an alloyed application for channel allowance in which FCA and DCA apprises coupled will work concomitantly. The results depict that the proposed mechanism is able to allot the conflict free channels to all enclosures according to the constraint of the enclosures. This allocation is able to reduce the conflicts in multi level channels in ad hock networks. For replication we apprise only four cells clusters architecture and seven cells cluster arrangement and consequences arises that allocated channels are conflict free and based on the compatibility matrix which is allocation methodology.

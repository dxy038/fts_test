Biodegradable polymers have received much attention as materials for reducing environmental problems caused by conventional plastic wastes. In this work, the thermodynamic behavior of binary and ternary systems composed by commercial biodegradable polymers and high-pressure fluids [poly(d,l-lactide) + dimethyl ether, poly(d,l-lactide) + carbon dioxide, poly(d,l-lactide) + chlorodifluoromethane, poly(d,l-lactide) + difluoromethane, poly(d,l-lactide) + trifluoromethane, poly(d,l-lactide) + 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, poly(butylene succinate) + carbon dioxide and poly(d,l-lactide) + dimethyl ether + carbon dioxide] and binary systems formed by commercial biodegradable copolymers and supercritical fluids [poly(butylene succinate-co-butylene adipate) + carbon dioxide] were studied. The Perturbed Chain-SAFT (PC-SAFT) and the Sanchez–Lacombe (SL) non-cubic EoS were used to model the liquid–fluid equilibrium (LFE) for these binary systems, by fitting one temperature-dependent binary interaction parameter. For comparison, the same data were also modeled by using the traditional Peng–Robinson (PR) cubic EoS. The three pure-component parameters of PC-SAFT and SL EoS and two pure-component of PR EoS were regressed by fitting pure-component data (liquid pressure–volume–temperature data for polymers and copolymer and vapor pressure and saturated liquid molar volume for fluids). The estimation of pure-component and binary interaction parameters was performed by using the modified maximum likelihood method with an objective function that includes the cloud point pressure. An excellent agreement was obtained with the PC-SAFT EoS, while the performance of the SL and PR EoS was less satisfactory.

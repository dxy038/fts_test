Background & Aims: As oral lesions could be one of the first clinical signs in HIV infected patients and an indicator of CD4+ decrease, this study was aimed to determine the prevalence of oral soft tissue lesions and their relationship with CD4+ lymphocyte in HIV infected patients.
Materials & Methods: In this analytical-cross-sectional study performed on subjects attending to Imam Khomeyni and Masih Daneshvari hospitals of Tehran, 52 patients with at least 6 months of infection were evaluated. Oral lesions were evaluated according to ECC (European Commision Clearinghouse) and CD4 counts were measured by flow cytometry method. The data were analyzed using Mann Whitney test. 
Results: Out of 52 evaluated patients, 44 males (84.6%) and 8 females (15.4%) with mean age of 34Â±7.77 were participated. 32(61.5%) patients were under HAART, 15(28.8%) used anti tuberculosis medicines and 5 (9.6%) patients received both above mentioned treatment. In this study the most common oral lesions were erythematous Candidiasis (40.4%), angular cheilitis (25%) and rampant caries (23.1%). In the present study, 15 (28.8%) patients had no immunosuppression, 20 (38.5%) and 17 (32.7%) patients had moderate and sever immunosuppression, respectively. In the current study, angular cheilitis were accompanied with sever immunosuppression and rampant caries were related to the mild immunosuppresion. 
Conclusion: According to the results of the present study, except fungal infections including oral erythematous and pseudo membranous candidiasis, other oral manifesation of patients with AIDS or HIV infected patients had no relationship with CD4 counts. However further study in other population is recommended.

The objective of this study was to develop recommendations for an optimal design of piezoelectric transformer (PT) AC/DC converters. The paper presents a comprehensive comparison of the two commonly used rectifier topologies in a PT based power converters: current doubler and voltage doubler rectifiers. The advantages and disadvantages of the two rectifiers were investigated and the range of their applications with respect to output current, voltage, power capability, load resistance etc.-was delineated. Generic parameters are proposed and used to derive normalized and closed form equations that can help choosing a PT for a given set of requirements. Simulation and experimental results were found to be in a good agreement with the derivation of the theoretical analysis.

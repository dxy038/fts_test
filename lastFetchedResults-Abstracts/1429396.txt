Objective
tudy examined differences in temperament and character dimensions of personality between patients with Hwa-byung (HB) and those with major depressive disorder (MDD).

 participants, 96 completed the Korean version of the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised Short (TCI-RS) and the Hwa-byung Scale. We diagnosed participants according to the DSM-IV and the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Hwa-byung. We compared TCI scores between the HB group (with or without MDD; N = 55) and the MDD-only group (N = 41) and correlated them with the total scores on six HB-specific symptoms (global HB severity) on the Hwa-byung Scale.
s
ed to patients with only MDD, patients with HB with or without MDD exhibited significantly higher scores on Impulsiveness; Harm Avoidance (HA) and its subscales of Anticipatory Worry; and Self-Transcendence (ST), with its subscale of Self-Forgetfulness. However, HB patients had lower scores on Self-Directedness, with its subscales of Responsibility, and Self-Acceptance; and Acceptance. Moreover, Global HB Severity had significant, positive correlations with ST, its subscale Self-Forgetfulness, and Anticipatory Worry but negative correlations with Attachment and Compassion.
tions
ta are cross-sectional and self-reported, so they are subject to personal perceptual bias. The number of participants may be too low for us to generalize the results.
sion
results suggest that HB is a different clinical entity from MDD in relation to personality traits, and that symptoms unique to HB are closely correlated with ST.

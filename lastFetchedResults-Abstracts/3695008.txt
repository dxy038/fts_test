Unlike apparent charge, energy is an inherent characteristic of partial discharge (DP) and may be used as an objective criterion for their evaluation. Since energy dissipation is responsible for the damaging effect of discharges, the amount of energy liberated in a PD situation is a suitable estimation of the involved risks. Discharge energy measurement was accomplished using a special and readily made metering circuit, including a correlator unit. Good correlations were found to exist between discharge energy and insulation degradation in simple liquid or solid insulating models.

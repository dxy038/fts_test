The main objective of this study is theoretical and experimental investigation of the surfaces modification of SU8, PDMS, SiO<sub>2</sub> and Si by plasma RF treatment. Physical-chemical reactions at room temperature can be used for the modifications of the surfaces in plasma, by modifying the contact angle, superficial polymerization, or by creating hydrophilic regions and/or hydrophobic on the surfaces in contact with plasma. The argon-plasma annealing was used to generate the hydrophilic surfaces, and plasma of CF<sub>4</sub> or CF<sub>4</sub> with O<sub>2</sub> has been used to create hydrophobic surfaces.

Simultaneous bidirectional signaling provides 6.4 Gb/s/wire with random data on a 22 b point-to-point bus over 15 cm on a PCB. The signaling rate decreases to 2.4 Gb/s/wire over 122 cm through 2 connectors. The I/O circuits have closed-loop slew rate control and are part of a 6.6 M transistor router component that consumes 21 W, packaged in a 31/spl times/31 mm/sup 2/ OLGA substrate.

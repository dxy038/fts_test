Objective: Visual memory is an important cognitive ability, which has
been studied in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). In
such studies meaningful shapes were used more frequently. Since
meaningless shapes provide a better assessment of short term visual
memory, in this study we used them to evaluate visual memory in children
and adolescents with ASDs compared to the normal group .
Methods: Four visual memory tests of Cambridge Neuropsychological
Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) including Paired Associates Learning
(PAL), Pattern Recognition Memory (PRM), Spatial Recognition Memory
(SRM) and Delayed Matching to Sample (DMS) were administered to 15
children and adolescents with ASDs (high functioning autism and
Asperger syndrome) and to 15 normal participants aged 8 to 17,with IQ of
above 70.
Results: Individuals with ASDs performed worse than the normal group
on visual memory tasks. After eliminating IQ as a covariate, no significant
difference was observed between the two groups in terms of visual
memory performance .
Conclusion: It seems that deficits on visual memory tasks in youths with ASDs could be related to their general intellectual abilities.

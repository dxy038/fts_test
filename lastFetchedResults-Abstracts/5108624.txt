The main objective of PFED is that the first network traffic can pass through a more precise forecast, and combined with the probability of packet dropping for more reasonable terms, so this will control the instantaneous queue length in a more stable framework. The second is that flow of non-response to the implementation of effective punishment in order to enhance the fairness algorithm. The third is that will be packet arrival rate under control in the service rate.

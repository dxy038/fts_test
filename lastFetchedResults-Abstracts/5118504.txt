More than two decades, chaos has been attracted many attention from scientists and engineers. Chaotic system phenomenon seems to be random for observers, but it is deterministic for a designer. System of Chaos attractors have been constructed more than a thousand of chaotic patterns. But implementation of chaos in engineering is still needed for real application. For this sake, the research objective is to search for new chaotic applications for Industrial Microwave Heating System without mode-stirring mechanism. The result shows that the performance of the proposed system is better than the conventional system in the rise of temperature. Eventually, the proposed method can be applied in the real application.

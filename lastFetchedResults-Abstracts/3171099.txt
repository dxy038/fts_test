In this paper we focus on WDM-PONs employing directly modulated low cost reflective semiconductor optical amplifiers (RSOAs) with modulation bandwidth around 1 GHz. As in all access networks, cost is a key factor for their implementation which can be minimized by network resource sharing with multiple fixed and wireless services. The objective of this paper is to analyze the feasibility and limitations of transmitting an overlay OFDM wireless signal combined with 1 Gbit/s baseband signal.

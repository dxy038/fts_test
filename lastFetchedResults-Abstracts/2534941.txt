Background  Objective: Endurance activity and quot mediator complex subunit 13quot  significantly influence on structure and tissue of heart. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a long time endurance activity program on quot mediator complex subunit 13quot  gene expression in the left ventricle.

Materials and Methods: 14 rats under controlled conditions were housed and after familiarization randomly were assigned into control and Experimental groups, the experimental group performed an endurance activity program (14 weeks) on motorized treadmill, and then 48 hours after the end of the last session were anesthetized and sacrificed. The left ventricle of the heart was removed. Real time RTPCR method was used to determine the expression levels of quot mediator complex subunit 13quot  gene in the left ventricle. Finally ttest was used to evaluate collected data.

Results: The results of this research showed, physical activity not only influences on heart weight indices, but also it enhances quot mediator complex subunit 13quot gene expression in left ventricle of trained rats.

Conclusions: Given to the effects of endurance activity on the size of left ventricle and its indices, it seems part of these effects were related to quot mediator complex subunit 13quot  gene expression.

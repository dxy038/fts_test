Background: Hyperhomocysteinemia (hhcy) has been considered as a risk factor for several obstetrical complications such as early pregnancy loss, pre-eclampsia and IUGR. Recently its association with infertility has been underscored in IVF failures; however limited information is available about the relationship of hhcy and subfertility.
Objective: To find out the association between unexplained subfertility and hhcy in Pakistani women.
Materials and methods: This observational study was conducted in Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Liaquat University Hospital Hyderabad from 1st April 2008 to 31st March 2009. Study group consisted of all those women who were subfertile for more then one year, have body mass index less than 25, regular menstrual cycle, normal pelvic examination findings and no past history of pelvic inflammatory disease. Exclusion criteria was male factor subfertility, endocrine and ovulatory dysfunction and tubal blockage. Evaluation was done by semen analysis, pelvic ultrasound scan, hystero-salpingography and hormonal assays. Fasting serum levels of homocysteine were determined using a fluorescence polarization immunoassay.
Results: In total, 61 subjects were enrolled in the study including 49 subfertile women and 12 healthy women. Among subfertile women, 39 (80%) were suffering from primary subfertility while 10 (20%) were complaining of secondary subfertility. Majority of the subjects were young, house wives and residents of Hyderabad city. Mean serum fasting homocysteine levels were significantly higher in women suffering from unexplained subfertility as compared to controls (12.8+5.1 versus 9.7+1.7, p-value= 0.04).
Conclusion: Hyperhomocysteinemia was observed in women suffering from unexplained subfertility. However large scale clinical studies are required to confirm the association.

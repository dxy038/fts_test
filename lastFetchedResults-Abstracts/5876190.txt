Leading Finnish telecom research institutions, IDC and VTT, and local industry are starting a new large research project to study the data security of mobile technologies and services in and beyond 3G. Six research areas are included. Radio engineering focuses on parasitic radiation from portable devices and data cables and unwanted coupling through antennas. Field programmable gate arrays are the subject of the second hardware theme which concentrates on linear cryptanalysis and biometric recognition. The goal of the third hardware group is to study data security in optical transport network equipment. The aim of the fourth sub-project is encryption in commercial and military frameworks. This area has two subtopics, studying the security of standard 3G algorithms and of newer cryptographic algorithms with respect to their implementability in 3G. Sub-project five deals with security aspects of the Ubik software architecture. The main objective is to track what kind of security support is required to enable versatile multimedia services and business. Finally, the business aspects related to digital rights management solutions supporting mobility are covered.

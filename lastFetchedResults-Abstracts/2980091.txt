In a collaborative network, retrieval of media objects from corresponding servers introduces many challenges. A major challenge is the multi-objective route establishment requirement, where various QoS and object quality parameters should be simultaneously optimized. This task requires new quality-based routing algorithms. We present optimistic, pessimistic and hybrid algorithms that optimize the media delivery costs while maximizing the quality of the transmitted objects. We also report on simulation results to show the applicability of these algorithms for varying sizes of collaborative networks. These algorithms can be implemented either as sub-application-layer solutions in an information-centric network or as application-layer information sharing/communication protocols between collaborators

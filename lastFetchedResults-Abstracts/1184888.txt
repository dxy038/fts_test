The objective of the paper is to present a mathematical model for analysis of prestressed cable structures with flexible contour beam. The proposed numerical procedures are based on a discrete scheme according to the finite element method. A reliable model of the interaction of the flexible contour beam with the cable network enables the achievement of more efficient solutions in the design analysis. Geometrical nonlinearity is accounted for in the cable net substructure and the contour beam is modelled by linear beam elements. Equations are solved by iterative methods and explicit time integration. The described numerical technique has been employed to model prestressing, static and dynamic behaviour. Theoretical results have been compared to experimental data and used in practical applications.

Objective: This study was carried out to describe the relationship of the mother's physical activity to the pregnancy outcomeMaterial and Methods: A total of 500 healthy women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies were studied. Subjects belonging to high socio economic families from Mysore city, India participated in the study. An activity questionnaire according to WHO was used. Activity score were derived based on Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) per unit body weight using published data. It was then administered to assess physical activity at initial time, 14±2, 28±2 and 38±2 weeks of gestation. Women were classified into very light, light, moderate and heavy activity categories based on their activity pattern.Results: Mean energy intake of women at initial time was 1765 Kcal. This increased by 25%> by the end of pregnancy (38±2 week) period, however energy expenditure was increased by 10%. Correlation computation revealed that higher maternal activity in first as well as second trimester was associated with lower mean birth weight and birth length, while no such effects occurred for third trimester after adjusting for the major confounding factors (P<0.05).Conclusion: It can be concluded that excessive maternal activity during first and second trimesters leads to smaller fetal size in urban affordable families of higher socioeconomic status.

This paper presents a wind tunnel study carried out with the objective of exploring the effect of shape on vortex induced vibrations of trapezoidal box girder bridge decks. It is demonstrated that it is possible to derive a virtually vibration free deck and that the angle between the horizontal bottom plate and the inclined side panes is an important parameter in achieving this goal.

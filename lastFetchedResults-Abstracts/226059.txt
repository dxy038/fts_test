The synthesis of plant-wide control structures has resurfaced as the most important design problem in process control. In this
paper we provide a comparative analysis of various approaches, with an emphasis on how well they address the inherent theoretical
and practical issues associated with the design of such control systems. Starting with a formal statement of the problem, which
corresponds to a multi-objective optimization problem, this paper argues that the central issue to be resolved is the translation of
implicit operating objectives to sets of feedback-controlled variables. The principle of the Optimizing Feedback Control Structures is
proposed as the formal medium for the identi®cation of controlled variables. Furthermore, it is shown that the selection of the best
sets of input (manipulated) and output (measured) variables for the formation of the controllers' structures is governed by classical
control-theoretical aspects, such as; open-loop gains, model uncertainty, and nonminimum-phase process characteristics. Hier-
archical viewing of a plant is proposed as an eective mechanism to contain the complexities of the problem by streamlining the (i) spe-
ci®cation of control objectives at dierent time-scales, (ii) modeling needs and model uncertainties, (iii) selection of measured and
manipulated variables, and (iv) formation of the control structures.

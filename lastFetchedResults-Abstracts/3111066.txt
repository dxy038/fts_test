This paper discusses some practical issues associated with H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controller design based on the results presented by Doyle, Glover, Khargonekar, and Francis (DGKF). First, the optimal H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controller based on these results is discussed from a practical applications point of view. Then, tradeoffs between the H<sub>&#8734;</sub> norm and other performance characteristics, specifically bandwidth and the H<sup>2</sup> norm, are considered. It is shown through example that when the optimal HH<sub>&#8734;</sub> norm is relaxed by only 10-20 percent and the central controller of DGKF is used, significant benefits in both the controller bandwidth and the H<sup>2</sup> norm of the closed-loop system can be achieved. Furthermore, it is shown that the results for the H<sup>2</sup>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> tradeoff compare favorably to a controller designed using the mixed H<sup>2</sup>/H<sub>&#8734;</sub> method developed by Bernstein and Haddad, even for the case in which the controlled output associated with the H<sup>2</sup> objective is different from that associated with the H<sub>&#8734;</sub> objective. Thus, it is demonstrated that other performance criteria, such as controller bandwidth and the H<sup>2</sup> norm of the closed-loop system, can be easily used with the results of DGKF to select a desirable suboptimal H<sub>&#8734;</sub> controller.

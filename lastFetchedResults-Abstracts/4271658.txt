A high frequency deep-tow seismic survey was carried out in the Nankai Trough area in 1996. The objective of the survey was to obtain high resolution seismic sections and velocity profiles of the methane hydrate zone, inferred from the strong BSR events seen on conventional seismic data. A special feature of the survey is that both the source and the streamer cable are towed close to the seabed. This special acquisition geometry requires special data processing to handle the varying source and receiver depths. A CMP floating datum processing sequence was designed which led to high quality sections of the shallow geology. A key step in the processing was devising a residual statics technique to compensate for errors in the measured depths. The processing sequence was applied to a number of lines, totaling 200 km. The quality of the final stack sections was highly variable.

The objective of this study is to define an index for ranking the provinces (states) of our country in terms of transportation facilities. This index which is aimed to represent the potential of transportation facilities in each province , is a dimensionless number .By the potential of transportation facilities we mean factors such as length of highways and railways , number of airports and harbors , the population of vehicles , the tonnage of goods and number of passengers. A mathematical approach rather than a statistical one is suggested this index , as the transportation industry is very vast with different variations , and presentation of mere statistical figures would not be helpful In this regards , three indices are presented , which are hoped to assist the government , investors and the planners in evaluating the transportation facilities of the provinces for their planning purposes.

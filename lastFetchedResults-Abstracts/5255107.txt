This paper aims to develop a decision-making tool that can be used by government agencies in managing emergency rescue supplies and distribution to forge an effective emergency rescue network. Due to geographical differences, there are two kinds of emergency rescue system: with a replenishment source (WS) and without replenishment source (WOS). In this paper, a collaborative replenishment model for coordinating the rescue activities between storage of WS and storage of WOS after the disaster happened by using multi-objective mixed integer programming method is constructed, which features two objectives that minimizing the total costs and the total travel time to improve time-satisfaction during the planning period. The proposed models are solved by using efficiency coefficient method. Finally, results of a numerical simulation are presented and directions are given for future research. Such a collaborative replenishment of emergency rescue network has a better capability to support decision-making of government agencies in both theory and practice.

Objective
This study compares perception about the characteristics of obstetrics-gynecology (OG) of medical students who choose to pursue a residency in OG and those students who choose to enter another specialty.
Study design
Fourth-year medical students were asked to complete a survey addressing their perceptions about OG. Responses were compared of (1) those entering OG to those entering other specialties, (2) those entering OG to those who seriously considered entering OG but chose another discipline, and (3) males to females. Chi-square tests were used for the comparisons.
Results
Of the 267 eligible students, 137 (51.1%) completed the survey. Clerkship satisfaction was rated as high by 88.9% of students choosing OG vs 10.2% (P< .0005) of those who chose another discipline. The emerging predominance of female providers detracted 38.5% of males vs 10.2% of females (P< .0005).
Conclusion
Student perception of an OG clerkship may detract them from pursuing OG as a career.

120 V DC secondary power distribution has been selected for Space Station Freedom. State-of-the art components and subsystems are examined in terms of performance, size, and topology. One of the objectives of this work is to inform the users of Space Station Freedom what is available in power supplies and power control devices. The other objective is to stimulate interest in the component industry so that more focused product development can be started. Based on results of this study, it is estimated that, with some redesign, modifications, and space qualification, many of these components may be applied to Space Station Freedom needs

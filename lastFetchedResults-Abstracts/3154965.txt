The definition of GAM (ground-to-air missile) composite group firing application is given. Based on the analysis of Stackelberg relation to composite group firing application, the Stackelberg decision model of composite group firing application is established. According to the characteristics of Stackelberg decision model, the improved PSO (particle swarm optimization) algorithm which is called immune PSO, is proposed. Furthermore, considering the characteristics of GAM composite group, the objective function of principal decision and sub-decision is deduced. The simulation is given at last, and the counter-air dynamic result of GAM composite group is obtained with its tactical explanation.

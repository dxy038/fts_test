Cu(In,Ga)Se/sub 2//CdS/ZnO cells with efficiencies close to 19% have been obtained with films prepared by coevaporation of the elements. Electrodeposition has the potential to become a suitable method for large production of CIGS solar modules. In this paper, we present the results of an on going collaboration project, between CNRS-ENSCP, EDF (Electricite de France) and SUR (Saint Gobain Recheche) with the support of ADEML. The objective of the project is to develop high-efficiency electrodeposited CIS cells and modules. A proprietary process allows to elaborate cells with different band-gap absorbers. Band-gap materials between 1.00 and 1.5 eV have been achieved. The record cell with an absorber of 1.47 eV yields to an efficiency of 10.2 % (no AR coating, total area 0.1 cm/sup 2/). The short circuit current is 23.2 mA cm/sub 3/, the open circuit voltage is 741 mV and the fill factor is 59.6 %. The properties of this cell are presented.

Summary form only given. In an ad hoc network, a routing protocol which detects a transmission route from a source mobile computer to a destination one is critical due to mobility and limited battery capacity of mobile computers. Here, a communication link between two mobile computers is not always bidirectional, i.e. uni-directional, since transmission power of mobile computers is not the same. Though some ad hoc routing protocols, e.g. DSR, support routing with unidirectional links, multiple flooding* (successive broadcasting) are used and communication overhead is high. We propose a novel routing protocol LBSR supporting unidirectional links and based on combination of a single flooding and multiple unicast message transmissions. In LBSR, route cache mechanism works better than DSR in an environment with unidirectional links. Simulation results show the efficiency of route cache in LBSR.

Land use spatial pattern design has great importance and should be implemented in a way that besides preparing the requirements and objectives, make the resources and potentials be used sufficiently. In this study the optimal area definition and optimal spatial allocation are presented in three main classes of land use, including irrigated agriculture, dry farming and range land in order to increase economic return and decrease erosion by combining goal attainment multi objective optimization and MOLA methods in Queen Sub basin. The optimal area of main uses has been defined using goal attainment multi objective optimization method; and then land use spatial optimization has been allocated based on combination of goal attainment results and the MOLA method. The results showed that in order to achieve the optimal pattern, dry farming area should be decreased the range land as well as the irrigated agriculture area should be increased. Changing from the existing conditions into optimal pattern in which the ratio of irrigated agriculture, dry farming and range land area are respectively 80.15, 2.74 and 17.11 percent in the study area will, have erosion decrease and economic efficiency increase compare to the existing situation. The modeling results showed that by conversion of the current land use pattern into optimal pattern, it would be possible to have 3.6% decreases in the soil erosion and 13.5% increase in economic efficiency.

With increasing traffic density on Iranâ€™s regional corridors, the probability of accident occurrence
has increased accordingly. The main objective of this paper is to develop an ontology-driven
geospatial information system to induct major crash rules for vehicles accident severity prediction
which has the full domain knowledge and logical reasoning ability based on ontology. In the
proposed approach, Geographic Information System (GIS) provides a platform both for spatial
data analysis and for visualizing relationships between spatial and non-spatial data. Furthermore,
the ontology is employed to represent geospatial and attribute domain knowledge related to road,
environment and vehicle. Crash rules are acquired by integrating experts knowledge with the
rules which are extracted using the Separate-and-Conquer rule induction approach. These rules
are transformed to Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) syntax for reasoning in crash severity
estimation engine. To evaluate the proposed method, a system prototype in the Qazvin-Rasht
(Iran) regional transportation corridor as a case study is implemented. The results show that the
proposed approach can efficiently induce major crash rules and predict accident prone vehicles
crash severity with respect to real-time road, driver and environmental information in the vicinity
of vehicle current location.

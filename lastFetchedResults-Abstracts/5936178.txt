Accurate estimation of craniofacial landmarks highly increases the efficiency and speed of diagnosis and treatment monitoring in orthodontics. The application of advanced image processing techniques in recognition and detection of these features is investigated by implementation of a new method in pattern analysis. The major objective of the paper is to develop a suitable system including application of the ISODATA pattern recognition technique together with a fuzzy logic decision making algorithm in order to increase accuracy of the results. More than 96% accuracy is achieved using the technique. The proposed procedure is preferred to previously introduced techniques for which low accuracy of results has been reported when good quality images are used

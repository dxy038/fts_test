We study a group of clustering problems on bipartite and chordal graphs. Our objective is to partition the vertices of a graph into a restricted number of sets so that a prespecified, diameter related, objective function is minimized. We unify a few problems using monotone diameterfunctions defined on sub-partitions of a graph. Among these problems are the following: partition vertices of a graph into a restricted number of subgraphs of bounded diameter, and partition vertices of a graph into a restricted number of subgraphs so the sum of the diameters of the subgraphs is bounded.

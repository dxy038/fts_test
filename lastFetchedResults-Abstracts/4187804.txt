A new double-ended type zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) half-bridge zeta (HBZ) converter employing a double ended rectifier is proposed. The proposed double ended rectifier for HBZ converter provides a bidirectional powering path of the rectifier. Therefore, the improved voltage waveform of rectifier, as a result, reduces the output filter size and voltage stresses of rectifier components. Moreover, it achieves a wide ZVS range by the characteristics of HBZ converter. In addition, to minimize the snubber loss of the secondary, a simple lossless snubber is adopted. The operational principles and characteristics of the proposed converter are to be analyzed and verified experimentally.

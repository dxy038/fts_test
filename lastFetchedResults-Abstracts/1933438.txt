The objective of this study was to examine the follicular fluid biochemical and hormonal changes associated with ovarian follicular cysts in buffalo. Follicular fluid was aspirated from eight cysts and eight preovulatory follicles, and subjected to biochemical and hormonal analyses. Cysts were characterized by a greater (P &lt; 0.01) concentration of nitric oxide and lesser concentrations of ascorbic acid and glucose than that of preovulatory follicles (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.05, respectively). Furthermore, follicular cysts had greater concentrations of progesterone (P &lt; 0.001), triiodothyronine (T3) and cortisol (P &lt; 0.05) and lesser concentrations of insulin (P &lt; 0.001) than preovulatory follicles. The results indicate follicular cysts in buffalo have an altered biochemical and hormonal composition. The alterations include increases in nitric oxide, progesterone, cortisol and T3 concentrations with a concurrent reduction in ascorbic acid, insulin and glucose concentrations. The study suggests that greater progesterone concentrations possibly inhibit the onset of LH surge resulting in formation of follicular cysts in buffalo. In addition, it implies the plausible role of intra-ovarian regulators such as nitric oxide, ascorbic acid and insulin in development of the condition.

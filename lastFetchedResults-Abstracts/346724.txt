Objective: The steady-state somatosensory evoked potentials (S-SEPs) to vibratory stimulation were recorded to characterize their physiological properties.
Methods: Vibratory stimuli were applied to the right palmar surface in 10 normal subjects. A total of 200 responses were recorded from electrodes at 2 cm posterior to C3, Cz and C4 and 2 cm anterior to C3. All responses were Fourier analyzed and the amplitudes of the first (1F) and second (2F) harmonic components were thus obtained. The effects of modulation frequency (5–30 Hz) and stimulus intensity (0.001–0.1 Newton (N)) on S-SEPs were studied.
Results: The amplitudes of 1F and 2F were greatest at the electrode 2 cm posterior to C3, 1F being predominant. The mean 1F amplitudes as a function of modulation frequency showed a bimodal distribution with a trough at 14 Hz and a peak at 21 Hz. The mean 1F amplitudes showed a linear increase of up to 0.05 N and thereafter reached a plateau against the logarithmic stimulus intensity axis.
Conclusion: Vibratory S-SEPs may originate from the primary somatosensory cortex and provide information on the fast-adapting mechanoreceptive afferents. The temporal resonance at 21 Hz places the somatosensory system between the visual and auditory systems.

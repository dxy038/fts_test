ABSTRACT: Seaweeds are potentially excellent sources of highly bioactive secondary metabolites that could represent useful leads in the development of new functional ingredients. They are a large and diverse group of simple, typically autotrophic organisms ranging from unicellular to multicellular forms. Macroalgae (seaweeds) can be classified into three broad groups as red algae, brown algae and green algae, based on their pigmentation. In addition, many reports have been published regarding isolated compounds from seaweeds with various biological activities, demonstrating their ability to produce important metabolites unlike those found in terrestrial species. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the application of different concentrations of seaweed extract in enhancing the growth, yield, quality and nutrient uptake of plants grown in fields, under rain fed conditions.

In this paper, we propose a high efficiency white OLED structure based on the color conversion technique named "side-coupling color-conversion method (SC<sup>3</sup>M)", in which the blue emission from organic layer is laterally transferred to the adjacent orange color-conversion material. Two times higher efficiency is possible compared with an original blue-OLED. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the possibility and high performance of the white-OLED with SC<sub>3</sub>M structure

Explaining the role of logistics management in managing the crisis requires a coherent and functional model design. The model is designed to illustrate the actions of the police logistics in four stages during the crisis ( before start , during, and after ) in order to implement effective risk management is an important step in the logistics crisis management and standardization Police logistical measures are necessary . A way in which all of the requirements and processes of logistics management in a crisis situation in terms of command and control and systems thinking and structured without personal taste , based on documents , is integrated . The main objective of this study is to provide a model for the standardization of police logistic actions in crisis management of natural and effective management of time-based actions. So as to be able to take advantage of logistics management to an appropriate level of situational awareness to qualify level coordination and guidance of logistics services and operational command and control in order to establish effective sustainable security crisis, conveyed by the chain of command, . The research method in this study was library and documentary and exploiting scientific source and the successful experiences of experts. The results of this study led to the correction of the logistics processes of natural disasters , which ultimately based police , police logistics management system ( PICO ) consists of four fundamental principle , inventories and warehousing, positioning troops and equipment , routing and transport , and information management the four stages of the crisis ( to identify or track marks , preparedness and prevention, response inhibition and destruction , improvement and learning ) by applying the appropriate command and control is provided in each of its stages .

Distributed task scheduling in a heterogeneous computing environment is one of the most challenging problems. The optimally mapping of independent tasks onto heterogeneous distributed computing systems is known to be NP-complete. The most common objective function of a distributed task scheduling problem is to reduce the make span and increase the load balancing across the machines. In this paper, we introduce a new scheduling algorithm called, Efficient Algorithm on Heterogeneous Computing System (EAHCS) which balances the load well across the machines and reduces the make span time. In our evaluation study, a number of experiments with various simulation settings have been conducted. The results obtained using the proposed heuristic improves over the existing approaches.

The selective retina therapy (SRT) is a new laser treatment at the fundus of the eye for diseases originating from an altered metabolism in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The objective of the project is the realization of a compact longitudinally diode pumped Yb:YAG laser system for this new therapy. Therefore the laser system has to emit &#956;s-pulses with a repetition rate of 100 Hz in the spectral range of 500-520 nm with pulse energies of 1-2 mJ.

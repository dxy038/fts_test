Objective: The aim of this study was to comparison the effects of strength exercise and balance exercise on risk of fall in older persons living in a local pension. Methods: Thirty six elderly men aged over 60 years old from a local pension in Isfahan (Iran) voluntarily participated in present study. Their static balance was evaluated by Romberg tests. Using Berg questionnaire, the falling risk were evaluated. Strength of lower extremities was assessed by Dynamometer. Then the paticipants were divided into 3 groups. 1) Strength exercise group, 2) Balance exercise group and 3) Control group. Experimental groups underwent an eight weeks (three sessions per week) with their special training program. The control groups did not participate in any training program. The evaluations were repeated after the treatment sessions. Paired t-test was used to compare pretests and posttests in 3 groups. ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test was used for statistical analysis. Pearson correlation was also used to assess any possible correlations between variables (? < 0.05). Results: Falling risk was significantly correlated with muscle strength and balance performance (r=0.58 p=0. 01 and r=0.69 p=0.001 respectively). Also strength exercise reduced the falling risk significantly comrade to the balance training (P=0.01). As was expected, balance training didnâ€™t change the muscle strength of lower extremities (P=0.98). Conclusion: it is recommended that in designing and preparing training programs for older adults, the strength exercises be taken more into account. As a matter of fact that the balance exercises are also simple exercises that can be easily implemented for the elderly,  and that the balance exercises reduce the risk of falls and improve postural control, a combination of strength training and balance exercise are recommended to be considered.

The objective of this study is to establish quantitatively the applicability of different k.p models for zincblende quantum wells. A well known material system of GaAs/AlGaAs QW was used for benchmarking purpose here. The axial approximation in 4&#215;4 and 6&#215;6 is clear winner in terms of accuracy/computational time, while the full angle average model of 8&#215;8 should be reserved for benchmarking purpose.

This paper considers the multi objective robust control for nonlinear systems using multiple model and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Nonlinear system divided to multiple linear model based on piecewise linearization around set points. For each linear model multi objective robust controller is designed to guarantee both system performance and robust stability. To design the robust controller for each linear model, nonlinearity part of system consider as uncertainty of linear system. The advantages of proposed method are that it can reduce the parameter perturbation and nonlinear uncertainty as well as increased the performance of the system. In this work ANFIS is used to make decision and combine the designed controller for each linear model. Simulation result on a nonlinear benchmark plant shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Police stations, as counter police crime prevention are important elements, which are directly involved in providing security to citizens. Quick and timely access to these centers in urban communities is important.The main objective of this research had been the geographical distribution and the optimal location of these centers according to scientific standards and criteria. In this context, taking advantage of the possibilities of GIS and data analysis using standard radius determine the performance of each police station,and finally enjoying the overlap index for Optimal Positioning urban spaces in the city is to build a police station.Digital maps provide spatial data and descriptive data using statistical and field studies have been collected.Then, for each of the factors in positioning of police station, the layers were developed, due to the impact of each criterion and paired comparisons using fuzzy hierarchical analysis of the weight of the layers was calculated using an end with the the results of integrating layers of Ahvaz area to select suitable locations for the deployment of police stations in the 10 categories were classified from very high to very low.The results indicate that, the current distribution of police stations in the study area do not fit and focused more police stations in the city center and the outlying parts of the city are deprived of these centers-have.

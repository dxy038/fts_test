A new E?-shape coupled inductor structure and its magnetic circuit models are presented. The proposed E?-shape coupled inductor structure retains the advantages of high power density and tackles the drawback of high air-gap fringing flux losses in conventional E-shape coupled inductor structure. Besides, the proposed E-shape structure gives the advantages of shorter winding length and more uniform thermal distribution compared with the conventional E-shape structure. The proposed E-shape structure and its magnetic models are successfully simulated by ANSYS and Maxwell 2-D, and implemented to apply to interleaving bidirectional dc/dc converters. The simulated and experimental results show that the proposed E?-shape structure of coupled inductors is superior to the same volume E?-shape structure of coupled inductors in terms of temperature, inductance, losses, inductor ripple currents, and efficiencies. The theoretical prediction and experimental results are in good agreement.

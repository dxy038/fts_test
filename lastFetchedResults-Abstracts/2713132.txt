In this paper, a soft-switching bidirectional dc/dc converter with a LC series resonant circuit is proposed. The proposed converter has been obtained by adding LC series resonant tank in the conventional bidirectional dc/dc converter. The proposed topology performs soft switching at both buck and boost operations. Through the theoretical boost and buck mode analysis, zero voltage switching operation is explained. Moreover, characteristics of the proposed topology are verified with simulation and experimental results.

This work aims to study the hypothesis to use an aeronautical metallic hall as a mode-stirred reverberation chambers in aeronautics. Consequently, the effect of the apertures of the halls is analyzed from experimental and numerical results. In particular, the objective is to study the ability of such a facility to generate an electromagnetic environment equivalent to a reverberation chamber, to obtain a sufficient number of mode stirrer independent positions and to sufficiently store the energy despite the presence of apertures.

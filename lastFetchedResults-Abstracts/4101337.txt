We present an interactive easy-to-use software package, based on an evolutionary algorithm, to perform adaptive anisotropic diffusion speckle filtering for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. As a main difference from other methodologies, there is an integration of a SAR-image human expert who provides a subjective validation to complete the diffusion filter design. We have applied an interactive methodology to a set of SAR images, and we compared the results with those obtained by other speckle reduction filters. The results, through the evaluation of objective global and local quality criteria, show the potential of the proposal.

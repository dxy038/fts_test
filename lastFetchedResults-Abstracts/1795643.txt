In this Letter, we present a pulse scheme for coherent averaging of spin–spin interactions called phase-modulated Lee–Goldburg (PMLG) which is aimed at achieving high-resolution proton NMR spectra in the solid state. Our objective is mainly to discuss the design and execution of this experiment and to show some preliminary experimental results as evidence of the far-reaching potentials of this technique.

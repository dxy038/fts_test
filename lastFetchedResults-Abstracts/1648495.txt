Background and Objective: Imbalance Between antioxidant defensive system and increased production of free radicals leads to oxidative stress that can be effective in making cellular damage and causing some diseases such as diabetes. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of eight-week purslane extract consumption on some peroxidant and antioxidants indicators in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Material and Methods: The Participants were 16 women with type 2 diabetes who had not the history of once a week regular physical activity program, in previous five years. They were randomly divided into two groups of experimental, purslane supplementation for eight weeks, and control. Blood sampling was performed in two stages. 
Results: After eight weeks of purslane consumption, resting levels of MDA, SOD and CAT in Supplementation group showed a significant decrease compared to those of control group.
Conclusion: Purslane consumption can improve peroxidant/antioxidant balance in women with type2 diabetes.

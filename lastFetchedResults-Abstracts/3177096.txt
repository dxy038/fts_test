The number of newly developed Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods grew considerably in the last decades. Although their theoretical foundations are solid, there is still a lack of acceptance and application in the practical field. The objective of this research is the development of a conceptual model of factors that influence MCDM acceptance that serves as a starting point for further research. For this purpose, a broad diversified literature survey was conducted in the discipline of technology adoption and related topics (like human computer interaction) with special focus on MCDM acceptance. The constructs collected within the literature survey were classified based on a qualitative approach which yielded a conceptual model structuring the identified factors according to individual, social, technology-related, task-related and facilitating aspects.

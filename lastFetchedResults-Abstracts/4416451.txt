This paper addresses the problem of robust attitude control design of an indoor micro quadrotor with input delay. This delay may be induced by the data dropout of controller signals. The objective of this paper is to develop a simple robust controller design method for the quadrotor with input delay by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasvokii function. To this end, the nonlinear dynamic model of attitude of the quadrotor is modeled by a parameter uncertain linear system since the fact that both the roll angular speed and the pitch angular speed are bounded. Then, an LMI-based robust controller design method is developed by virtue of the obtained linear uncertain model with input delay and the existing techniques addressing linear uncertain time-delayed systems. The suggested controller can not only achieve the exponential stabilization of attitude of the quadrotor but also satisfy the requirement of a given H<sub>&#8734;</sub> performance. Finally, some numerical simulation results are also provided to illustrate the effectiveness and merit of the proposed design method.

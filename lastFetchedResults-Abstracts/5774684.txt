The reverse supply chain is more and more concerned about because of the improvement of the environmental quality. LCA is a quantitative evaluation method of the environmental effect of a reverse supply chain. The evaluation result can be used as an objective reference in the productive design and recycling disposal and at the same time reduce the negative influence on environment so that it can facilitate the protection of the environment and the establishment of a green supply chain. This article, using the method of case study, focuses on the analysis of the reverse supply chain of the waste lead acid batteries (material recycling) and direct disposal(landfill).Through the analysis of evaluation method of the life cycle, this paper comes to a more environmentally friendly dealing method of the end of life. After an analysis of the different environmental influence in different phases, this paper finds out the main activities that exert a negative influence on environment and provides a direction for the improvement of the environment benefits of the reverse supply chain of the lead acid batteries.

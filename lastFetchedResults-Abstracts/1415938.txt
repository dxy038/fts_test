   The main objective of this paper is to investigate the causal relationship between energy consumption and GDP in MENA countries during the period of 1980-2009.
For this purpose, the generalized method of moments in the framework of dynamic panel data approach is used.
The results of this study reveal that there is unilateral causality from energy consumption to GDP in these countries.
Therefore, based on the finding of this study, not onlylabor and capital but also the energy use can affect the GDP in the MENA countries. In other words, in the countries considered at this study the GDP depends on the energy use.
Hence, in these countries the policy makers should be adopting good policies in order to increase energy consumption. Because in these countries GDP depends on energy consumption  and  its reduction has a negative effect on GDP level and economic growth.

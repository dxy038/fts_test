Imaging techniques in medical field are mainly practised for diagnosing and treatment of diseases as well as surgical operations. Reconstruction of three dimension models using two dimension image slices of CT add to the uniqueness while picturing the internal details of the organ. The three dimensional (3D) visualization of spine relays highly classified details in diagnosing the complications involved. The objective of this paper is to develop an algorithm for stacking the 2D slices to create a 3D output for image guided surgeries. This aims at increasing the operation accuracy and safety during computer aided medical procedures. One such is the spinal fusion processes where only a marginal error is allowed. Also traditional techniques for analyzing tortuous anatomical structures do not provide sufficient details. The rendered output provides a better graphic user interface in aiding physicians. The model of spinal column is mainly reconstructed for identifying Scoliosis, Spondylolisthesis, Spondylolysis and other vertebral deformations.

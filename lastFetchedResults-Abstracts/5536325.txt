Many electrical devices need fast and frequent on and off control which require reliable and long life switches instead of traditional AC contactors, solid state relay. A new composite switch design is presented for the equipments with multiple circuits should be controlled. Based on thermal analysis of bidirectional triode thyristor and magnetic latching relay simulation, the cooling fins could be removed and up to 50 channels could be integrated and encapsulated in a package. The new design also provide RS-232, Modbus and direct link ports for external control which could cut down the cost and simplify the control circuit complexity. The new composite switch is suitable for reactive power compensation and smart distribution network control.

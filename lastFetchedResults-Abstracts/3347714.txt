Dc microgrids including grid-tied inverter, energy storage system, and distributed generations have the advantage of high efficiency as compared to the ac system. Droop control has been realized to suppress the current mismatching among distributed sources. However, the conventional droop control involves distribution loss due to the line impedance. In this paper, a novel droop control is proposed to minimize the distribution loss by adjusting controllable droop coefficient. The control objective of the novel droop control is that energy storage system supplies the most adjacent load with their energy within rated power. Hence, the distribution loss can be minimized significantly by tracking the new reference voltage in order to maintain same output voltage of each converter. Simulation results based on PSCAD/EMTDC are provided to verify proposed droop control method.

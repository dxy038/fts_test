Little is known about the particulate exposure of populations living along major urban roads. The objective of this pilot
study was to explore the small-scale spatial and temporal variability of the absorption coefficient of PM2.5 filters, as a surrogate
for elemental carbon, in relation to levels of PM2.5, at residential sites with varying traffic densities in a large Canadian city.
Concurrent 24-h measurements were performed at four residential sites during 7 weeks. A gradient existed across all four sites
for the absorption coefficient of the filters (and NO2 levels). In contrast, the levels of PM2.5 were quite similar at all sites. The
difference in the filter absorption coefficient of PM2.5 filters, between an urban background and a residential traffic site (with
about 30000 vehicles/day), expressed as a percentage of the background site, was 40%. These results indicate that spatial
variability in PM2.5 absorption coefficient can be observed with traffic intensity on a small scale within a North American city
and suggests that regression modelling approaches similar to those used in European studies could be used to estimate exposure
of the general population to traffic-related particles on a local scale in North America.

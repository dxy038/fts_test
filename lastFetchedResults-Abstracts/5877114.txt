This research reports a high efficiency single phase multi-level inverter by new controlled switch signal which is simply and not complexity that is generated by analog control circuit. The circuit topology of the proposed inverter is based on a conventional full-bridge inverter with one bidirectional auxiliary. The experimental results show the proposed controlled switch signal can increase the efficiency of a single phase multi-level inverter which is 2% higher than the old controlled switch signal [2] at 220 V<sub>AC</sub>output ,92 watts output and 10 kHz switching frequency.

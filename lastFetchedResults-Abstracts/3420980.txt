A new solar cell power supply system is presented, in which the boost type bidirectional dc-dc converter and the simple control circuit with a small monitor solar cell are employed to track the maximum power point of the solar array. It is confirmed by the experiment that the new system has sufficiently precise tracking operation performance and satisfactorily high power efficiency. Also, a comparison of the power efficiencies is made theoretically, as well as experimentally, on the new and the conventional solar cell power supply systems. As a result, it is revealed that the new system is superior to the conventional one in the power efficiency.

In this paper, an improved niching genetic algorithm applying the concept of auto-tuning and detecting traces is proposed for asymmetrical multimodal function optimization. Population size and both (right and left) niche radii of each peak in an asymmetrical objective function can be determined automatically. This method is applied to the numerical examples and the optimal design of interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (IPMSM). Through the comparison between simulation results and experimental ones, the validity of the proposed method is verified.

An advanced public transportation system (APTS) is an important component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) which is a front research field of transportation all over the world. The research content discussed in this paper is a vital premise and basis of implementing APTS. Based on the summarizing optimization theories and methods of transit networks, this paper proposes a new optimization model. In this model, the objective function is to maximize the nonstop passenger flow, the constraints are composed of length and nonlinear coefficient of the transit line, capacity of a single line, and asymmetric coefficient of the section passenger flow etc. A kind of new algorithm derived from insect king, called the Ant Algorithm, is used to solve the model

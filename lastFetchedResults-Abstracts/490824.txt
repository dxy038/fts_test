Background and Objective: Studies showed that consumption of a low-caloric and low-glycemic index diet are associated with a decrease in gene expression in subcutaneous fat tissue. The aim of present study was to determined effect of low-glycemic index diet versus low-fat diet on the body weight, body fat mass and reduction plasma leptin level in obese patients.

Subject and Methods: A randomized controlled trial comprised 46 obese females, ages 18-55 years old, BMI >27, who visited Motahary clinic in Shiraz, Iran. Body weight, BMI, fasting glucose, fasting and post-prandial leptin level were measured at the beginning and at the end of 6 weeks.

Results: Changes in body weight, BMI, waist / hip ratio, fasting glucose and fasting postprandial leptin levels were also significantly reduced in both dietary groups. No significant differences were observed in any parameter measured between the two groups. Conclusion: Low-glycemic index and low-fat diets have comparable effects on leptin level, body fat mass and BMI. Sci Med J 2010;8(4):75-82

This paper presents results of our extensive investigation of OCDMA system performance under the influence of varying transmission link chromatic dispersion. The investigations were carried out using incoherent 2-dimensional wavelength-hopping/time-spreading (2D-WH/TS) OCDMA codes based on picosecond pulses on a 17 km long bidirectional fiber link installed between the Strathclyde and Glasgow University. From the BER data obtained during these studies we showed that a high penalty in terms of system performance can incurred for even small deviation from the link full chromatic dispersion compensation.

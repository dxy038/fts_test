Sound localization has been utilized in many fields. For good performance, sound signal obtained from the microphone has to be well filtered and amplified. Although filtering and amplification can be implemented in digital, analog circuit is needed because of sampling aliasing problem and limitation of computational resources in real-time application. The analog circuit consists of several components. Because all of possible combinations cannot be investigated, evolutionary algorithm (EA) is chosen to find promising solution candidates. In the paper, we built a multi-objective covariance adaptation evolutionary strategy based on decomposition to obtain the component values. Through the experimental results, our proposed algorithm showed good performance.

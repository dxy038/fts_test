The effect of thermal annealing on shot-peened
Type 304 stainless steel has been examined using electron
backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and X-ray diffraction
(XRD). The objective was to evaluate the potential for
surface property control by grain boundary engineering.
The near surface microstructure of shot-peened material
showed a gradual change of the grain boundary character
distribution with depth. Twin (R3) and higher order twin
grain boundaries (R9, R27) identified closer to the shotpeened
surface had significant deviations from their optimum
misorientation. The subsequent application of
annealing treatments caused depth-dependent changes of
the near surface microstructure, with variations in grain
size, low R CSL grain boundary populations and their
deviation from optimum misorientation. Microstructure
developments were dependent on the applied heat treatment,
with the near surface microstructures showing
similarities to microstructures obtained through bulk
thermo-mechanical processing. Shot peening, followed by
annealing, may therefore be used to control the near
surface microstructure of components.

Nonlinear control of a bidirectional boost converter suitable for large-signal applications is presented. The converter is accurately modeled as a second order bilinear system and the conditions established for local stability. The nonlinear control law is implemented by means of one analog divider, standard operational amplifiers and a pulse-width modulator. As a result, the output variable follows proportionally the reference signal, thus allowing the obtention of different types of power waveforms in the converter output

The objective of this case study is to provide insight into a proven alternative implementation methodology, whereby any operational organization primarily consisting of information technology infrastructures, has to implement business process reengineering (BPR) and change management (CM), (or vice versa) against the background of any form of forced intervention. The forced intervention referred to in this case study, being affirmative action. This alternative implementation methodology, not only assures the successful implementation of BPR and CM, but also effectively addresses the forced intervention and guarantees sustained process improvement during the process of change and thereafter

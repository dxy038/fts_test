Simplicity of usage, flexibility of data access, ease of maintenance, time and energy efficiency, and pay as you go policy have increased the usage of cloud computing over traditional computing. Cloud computing should be able to meet the performance expectations of different classes of customers. However, inefficient scheduling algorithms decrease the quality of service experienced by users. To improve quality of service, several scheduling algorithms have been proposed in the literature. However, these scheduling algorithms do not consider heterogeneous servers or different priority classes of customers. Our objective is to satisfy performance expectations of customers by proposing a Heterogeneous Dynamic Dedicated Server Scheduling (h-DDSS) while considering heterogeneous servers and different priority classes of customers. Results show that h-DDSS architecture can provide improved customer throughput and drop rate over homogeneous DDSS in cloud computing. Our proposed scheduling algorithm and related analysis will help cloud service providers build efficient cloud service architectures which are adaptable to homogeneous and heterogeneous environments by considering different types of priority class performances, such as, drop rate, throughput, and utilization.

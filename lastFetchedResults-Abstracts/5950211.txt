Dysplasia is a precancerous disease that tends to convert into carcinoma in-situ if not diagnosed and treated in time. A MEMS (Microelectromechanical System) based microgripper can mechanically diagnose the disease by measuring microscopic changes in cell size, nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio and cell membrane stiffness. The objective of this paper is to present novel MEMS based microgripper with integrated force sensor. A detailed modeling and simulation of this gripping system has been carried out using the design rules of standard MEMS process: SOI-MUMPS (Silicon-on-insulator Multi-User-MEMS-Process) offered by MEMSCAP Inc. The results show the feasibility of using such system to manipulate biological cells. The system is optimized for smaller chip size of 3.76mm&#215;2.86mm operated at low voltage of 30V. A concept of three pronged design is also introduced signifying an active release of the biological cell after manipulation. The microgripper produces a max displacement of 20um and is capable of handling cells of size 10-30um.

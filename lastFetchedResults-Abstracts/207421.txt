Today, privatization of agricultural extension services is recognized as an appropriate approach to compensate for any weakness that the traditional extension system might have. The primary objective of this research was to study the attitude of the national top managers (including general managers, their deputies, and extension managers) of Jihad-e Keshavarzi Organizations (JKO), toward privatization of agricultural extension. Twenty JKOs from 20 provinces were randomly selected for study. A questionnaire was developed to the gather information needed and 107 general managers, deputies, and extension managers were randomly selected for this purpose. A pilot test was conducted on a similar population and reliability coefficients of (A Cronbach Alpha) 81%, and 89% were obtained for the attitude and managerial characteristics of the questionnaire respectively.
The results showed that 93.83% of the subjects had either "positive" or "relatively positive" attitude toward privatization of agricultural extension. The majority of the subjects indicated that privatization of extension could provide a "supplementary means to complement the existing public extension services". A hierarchical regression analysis indicated that the independent variables collectively are responsible for 17.4% (R2 =0.174) of the variation in dependent variables. This indicates that a considerable amount of variances in dependent variables are yet unaccounted for that could be explained by variables that were not investigated in this study (requiring further study).

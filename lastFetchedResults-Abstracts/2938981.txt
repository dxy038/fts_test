A multiobjective optimization of the suspension assemblies of hard disk drives is demonstrated. The natural frequencies of the suspension assembly are treated as objective functions, subject to side constraints of design variables that describe the shape of the suspension. The gradient information in the optimal design is calculated by finite differences, and the sensitivity analyses are performed numerically with respect to design variables. Preloading and air bearing effects are both considered in the optimal design. Moreover, a final solution is determined by the decision maker with additional knowledge and engineering experience

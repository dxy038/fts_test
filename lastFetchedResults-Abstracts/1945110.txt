The main objective of this work is to evaluate the suitability of Hesperaloe funifera which is an alternative raw material, for pulping with soda–anthraquinone to produce pulp and paper. It was studied the influence of operational variables (temperature (155–185 °C), cooking time (20–60 min) and soda concentration (5–15%), with a constant addition of 1% of anthraquinone and a liquid/solid ratio of 8, in soda–anthraquinone cooking of H. funifera on pulps and paper sheets properties obtained. Finally, the cooking liquors were acidified to separate solid fractions that were subjected to pyrolysis and gasification in order to obtain synthesis and fuel gases.

ifera contains little lignin and abundant α-cellulose; this, together with the morphological characteristics of its fibers, makes it a potentially highly useful papermaking raw material.

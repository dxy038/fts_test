The objective of this work was to find relations between organic and inorganic shell components. Crassostrea gigas shells were analysed from live specimens collected at five different stations: the Lima estuary (1), the Ria de Aveiro (2, 3), and the Mondego estuary (4, 5), Portugal. About 30% of the oysters, from stations 1, 2 and 3 had shell-thickness-index values â‰¤10, indicating a severe thickening. Oysters from the Mondego estuary contained mud blisters due to Polydora infestations. Oysters from station 3 had thicker shells and showed a higher Pb content in shell and tissues than oysters from the other stations. Amino-acid composition changed mainly according to the modified protein (jelly-like substance) probably produced by the presence of TBT (tributyltin) in the water; in particular, we observed an increase in glutamic acid and threonine and a decrease in major amino acids such as aspartic acid, serine and glycine. Elemental shell composition was mainly associated with environmental conditions: shells from stations in open areas had higher Li, Cd, Cr and Ca and lower Mn levels than those from semi-enclosed areas (fish farms). Discriminant analyses against the three kinds of shell observed (normal, thick and infested), using chemical elements and amino acids as discriminant variables, showed the infested group to have the biggest differences. There was no correlation between amino-acid and chemical-element patterns in shell composition. Observed changes in amino-acid pattern, probably due to TBT, did not imply a simultaneous change of elemental composition.

An optimization methodology that integrates discrete-event simulation (DES) with a heuristic algorithm is developed to optimize dynamic resource allocation for construction scheduling. This heuristic algorithm is based on the objective of minimizing project duration and would consider activating multiple activities at the same time based on limited quantities of resources. The optimization is implemented through discrete-event simulation that is able to describe complex operational systems through simulation models, without the need to build mathematical models. The effectiveness of the simulation-based optimization is demonstrated through an application, where the impact of the optimized allocation is compared with those of other ones. The proposed methodology provides an alternative to optimize resource flow for scheduling and broadens the application potential of discrete-event simulation in the construction field.

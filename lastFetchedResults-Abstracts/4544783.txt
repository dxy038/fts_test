The objective of this paper is to propose a multi-mode interleaved boost converter for three-phase photovoltaic (PV) power systems with low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability. The proposed interleaved boost converter is able to continuously extract active power from the PV arrays during the grid voltage sag. After the grid voltage returns to its normal condition, the PV inverter can quickly achieve its maximum power point tracking (MPPT) operation. Also, the boost converter with multi-channel interleaved structure can increase power conversion efficiency but decrease input current ripple. Furthermore, the three-phase inverter with the maximum current limitation control can provide maximum reactive power under the allowable current amplitude during the voltage sag as well as output the demanded reactive/rated current ratio to meet different LVRT codes. Experimental results obtained from a 3 kVA prototype circuit demonstrate the performance of the proposed circuit topology.

An image coder, based on the CCITT H261 recommendation for real-time coding and decoding of moving video images, is presented. The coded images include a minor departure from the H261 recommendation as the transmission of video conferencing images is intended for a LAN (Local Area Network) environment. This project extends the coding algorithms to include video images. A secondary objective is the modification of the algorithms to conform precisely to an ISDN transmission environment. The process of implementing the algorithms in occam on a transputer network is discussed. The problems encountered in this process are highlighted, and methods to increase performance are presented

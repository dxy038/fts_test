Heavy metals (Cu, Cd, Pb, Zn) effect on the productivity of forage crops (clover and perennial cereal grasses) and their
accumulation in plants, depending on the concentration of these elements in a soil, has been studied in micro-field experiments
on three types of soil. The principle objective was to determine regularities of heavy metals migration in a soilâ€“plant system
aiming the estimation of permissible levels of heavy metals content in soils with the following elaboration of methods, which
regulate the toxicants transfer to plants. Methods of field experiments, agrochemical and atomic absorption analysis were used.
Results were statistically treated by Statistica 6.0, S-Plus 6. Experimental results have shown that the intensity of heavy metals
accumulation in plants depends on the type of the soil, the species of plants, the physicochemical properties of heavy metals and
their content in the soil. Logarithmic interdependency of heavy metals concentration in soils and their accumulation in plants is
suggested. However, the strong correlation between the different heavy metals concentrations in the various soils and the yield
of crops was not observed. Toxicants accumulation in crops decreased in time.

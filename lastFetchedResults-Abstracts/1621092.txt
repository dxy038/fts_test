We examine the effect of dissipation on the laser control of a process that transforms a state into a superposed state. We consider a two-dimensional double well of a single potential energy surface. In the context of reactivity, the objective of the control is the localization in a given well, for instance the creation of an enantiomeric form whereas for quantum gates, this control corresponds to one of the transformation of the Hadamard gate. The environment is either modelled by coupling few harmonic oscillators (up to five) to the system or by an effective interaction with an Ohmic bath. In the discrete case, dynamics is carried out exactly by using the coupled harmonic adiabatic channels. In the continuous case, Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics are considered. We compare two laser control strategies: the Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) method and the optimal control theory. Analytical estimations for the control by adiabatic passage in a Markovian environment are also derived.

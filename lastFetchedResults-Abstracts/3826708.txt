The Television Allocations Study Organization was established, at the request of the Federal Communications Commission, by five of the major associations in the television industry. The objective of TASO is to make a thorough study of the engineering factors affecting the allocation of channels for television broadcasting. To carry out this task, six engineering panels have been formed. Each is working on a specific phase of the overall problem -- (1) transmitting equipment, (2) receiving equipment, (3) field tests, (4) wave propagation, (5) analysis and theory, and (6) levels of television picture quality. A total of 174 engineers from 92 organizations from all branches of the television industry are serving on TASO panels. The work of the panels is progressing rapidly and it is expected that significant results in the form of reports for the use of the FCC and the television industry will be forthcoming by the middle of next year.

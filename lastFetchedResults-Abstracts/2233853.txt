The objective of this article is to provide datum to engineers on the fatigue behavior of corroded steel plate and the material used in this study was Q235 steel. The effect of corrosion on fatigue behavior of corroded steel was investigated by using Hydraulic Servo Universal Fatigue Testing Machine. The results indicate that the presence of corrosion pits, produced by the method of constant temperature and humidity with prior immersion in saturated NaCl solution for about 2 min, significantly reduces the fatigue life of corroded steel. The relationship between (a) fractal dimension of roughness surface and fatigue life of corroded steel plate, (b) fractal dimension of roughness surface and corrosion ratio, and (c) corrosion ratio and fatigue life of corroded steel plate was also studied. In this paper, the fractal dimension refers to the fractal dimension of roughness surface but not to the fractal dimension of the fracture surfaces. In the end of this paper, the morphology characterization and fractography were also analyzed by using 3D Profiling and stereoscopic microscope, respectively.

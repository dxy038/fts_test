This paper seeks to provide objective and subjective performance analysis for High Efficient Video Coding (HEVC) HM-15.0 reference coder for High Definition and full High Definition test sequences in different picture structures. The HEVC coder is tested for the fixed Quantization Parameter (QP) value, when Main profile with P and hierarchical B pictures, respectively, is used. Simulation results have shown differences in bit-rate and encoding time saving, while SNR is providing quit similarity in output values, when IPPP and IBBB picture formats are compared.

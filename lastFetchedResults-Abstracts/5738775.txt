Polymers currently utilized for tissue engineering applications do not possess surfaces with nanostructured features. In contrast, the tissue that the polymers will regenerate is composed of proteins that have nanometer dimensions. Undoubtedly, the presence of proteins in natural tissue provide for surface roughness values in the nanometer regime. For this reason, the objective of the present study was to design, synthesize, and evaluate (using in vitro cellular models) the ability of poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) as the next generation of more efficient tissue engineering materials. Results provided the first evidence that osteoblasts (bone-forming cells), chondrocytes (cartilage synthesizing cells), aortic smooth muscle cells, and bladder smooth muscle cells adhered and proliferated more on nanostructured compared to conventional PLGA substrates. For this reason, the present results suggest that to enhance tissue regeneration, PLGA should incorporate a high degree of nanostructured surface features.

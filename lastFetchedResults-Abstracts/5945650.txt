A computer code for the evaluation of telemetry system performance has been developed, and its main features are presented. The program represents a major aid in the development, design, and analysis of implantable telemetry systems which involve radio-frequency powered coils for the establishment of bidirectional communication links with implantable tissue stimulators. The program was given the name CCETS, and includes three main models: preprocessing module, solution module, and postprocessing module. The program currently can run on any VAX computer, and can be made available for IBM or compatible microcomputers. The program contains several desirable features which enable the user to efficiently reach his optimum design, verify it, and obtain telemetry performance before laboratory time and effort are spent. The program features are given with examples

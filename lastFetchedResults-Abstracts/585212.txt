Background:Different waysto express angerandits consequencesisallocated toa special place infundamentaland appliedpsychologicalresearch. Constructing and validating a useful scale to measure anger is also another important point.   
Objective:The aim of this research was to make and to find norms of multidimensional anger scale (anger arousal,hostile outlook, external and internal angers and anger-eliciting situations) among high school students.
Method:The theoretical principles of the previous studies werestudied first.Then,the researchers designed a questionnaire based on theframework resulted from studying the achieved resources.After studying the form and content of the raised questions in relation to each of the sub-tests and removing the inappropriate ones, 29 questions were performed for the final performance on a group composed of 400 students (212 males and 188 females) who wereslected by the relative classification and random testing method.
Results:The result of factor analysis by cycle method of Varimex of five factors equaling to 0/88, variance expression paralleling to theoretical principles of the structure were indicated .The sustainability of the questionnaire through Kranbuchalfa 0/87 and testing method-retest 0/81 and correlational results between the first and second performances in the five factors are 0/79(Anger arousal), 0/81(Anger out), 0/77 (Hostile outlook) 0/86(Anger In), 0/83(Anger-Eliciting Situation) respectively.The division method was used to get sure of the sustainability for the two halves 0/85 and 0/82 respectively.The total sustainability of the assumed test was 0/77. After analyzing the data, finding the norms, cut point and interference rate were calculated. The cut point for this test, in proportion with the average and standard deviation was 88/01. According to this cut point, the percent of interference rate 7/2 in the whole sample was 3/8 for the male and 11/2 for the female.
Conclusion: it can be suggested the multidimensional anger scaleis a valid instrument to measure students' anger.

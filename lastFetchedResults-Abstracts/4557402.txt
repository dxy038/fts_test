Bidirectional converters can realize bidirectional power transmission, which functionally equivalent to two unidirectional converters, hence, system size can be significantly reduced and power density can be increased. Based on the requirement of large power difference between bidirectional transmissions in some renewable energy applications, a family of bidirectional DC/DC converter with asymmetrical power transmission capability is proposed. Compared with the conventional one, the proposed bidirectional converter has the following advantages: lower cost, simple circuit topology and control. The potential applications of the proposed bidirectional converter are introduced and the topology derivation process is presented. The operation principle of the proposed bidirectional converter is verified by a 2.5 kW prototype converter.

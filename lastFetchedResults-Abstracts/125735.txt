BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Mammography is an easy, available and noninvasive method that used for screening breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the breast lesions in patients referred to Shahid Beheshti hospital during 1998-1999.
METHODS: This descriptive, analytical and cross-sectional study was performed on 100 patients referred to Shahid Beheshti hospital for mammography during 1998-99. Mammography findings, age, signs when referred, age of primipara and family history were analyzed by Chi-square and t-test.
FINDINGS: In this study, 20 subjects had abnormal mammography and 80 had normal mammography. The mean age of both groups was 39.7±11.02, 31.7±9.83 years, respectively (p<0.05). In histopathology, 7 of 20 patients were with malignant lesions. Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of mammography were 35% and 100%.
CONCLUSION: According to the results, malignancy risk increases with increasing of age. In this study, the most common histopathology finding was invasive intraductaI carcinoma. The most common mammographic finding was mass with ill-defined margins.

Objective- To evaluate greater omentum as an autogenous free graft in enhancing bone healing.
Design- Prospective descriptive trial.
Animals- Ten mongrel adult dogs, 3 to 4 years old and weighing 25.2 to 31 kg, assigned into two equal experimental and control groups (5dogs/group), were used.
Procedures- Mid-shaft osteotomy on right radius was followed by a partial omentectomy in all dogs. A 30x30 mm^2 piece of greater omentum was prepared as a free graft. Then, it was positioned over the osteotomy site in the experimental dogs. After 8 weeks, the dogs were
euthanized and both operated and intact radii were harvested in each dog and subjected to a three-point bending test.
Results- The values of biomechanical parameters in operated bones of both groups were lower than those in intact bones. The percent of reduction in biomechanical values of the operated bones in experimental group was significantly less than control group.
Conclusions and Clinical Relevance- The results of this study suggested that autogenous greater omentum as a free graft could enhance the biomechanical aspects of bone healing in dogs. Application of autogenous greater omentum as a free graft might advantageously
promote fracture healing process in the dogs at risk of developing delayed or nonunion fractures.

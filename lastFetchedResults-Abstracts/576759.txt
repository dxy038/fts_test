Background & Objective: Although ovarian cancer is not common but it is considered as an important cause of death in women. Considering the role of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme in cancer, as well as  the production of prostaglandin E2 in tumor lesions, it seems that COX inhibitors are effective in cancer. The aim of present study was to evaluate the effect of ketoprofen as a non-selective cyclooxygenase enzyme in ovarian cancer in female rats.
Materials & Method:  In this study, female Wistar  rats were used. The animals were divided into five groups: the first group was normal group, the animals of the second group were only injected with (DMBA) 7,12 Dimethylbenz(a) anthracene, the third group received  DMBA + Saline, the other groups were treated with various doses of ketoprofen. In order to induce cancer, DMBA was injected directly into the ovary. The weight ovaries and the histopathological features were evaluated in all groups.
Result:  In this study, tumor weight was reduced extremely  in  ketoprofen receiving groups, so that the weight of ovaries was 0.037±0/004 and 0.033± 0/001 respectively, while,  in the third group the weight was 0.152±0.008. The microscopic slices of ovarian tissues also showed the reduced tumor growth in the ketoprofen receiving groups.
Conclusion: This study confirms the positive effects of ketoprofen in treatment of ovarian cancer but further investigations need to be done

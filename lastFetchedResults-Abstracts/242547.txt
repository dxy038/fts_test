The objective of the present study is to evaluate parameters that characterise the pulsing flow regime in a packed column
operating with the cocurrent downflow of the gas and liquid phases. The paper presents the results of experiments aimed at
determining the effect of the physicochemical properties of the liquid phase and the packing size on the velocity of liquid pulses
travelling along the bed. These results are correlated and compared with the available literature data

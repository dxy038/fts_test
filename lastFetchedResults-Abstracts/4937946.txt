A robust neuro-fuzzy model-following control system is proposed for robot control with torque disturbance and measurement noise. The control objective is obtained by tailoring a nominal adaptation process of weights and a fine tuning mechanism to overcome the equivalent uncertainty. The major difference comparing with previous approaches is that a novel fuzzy system is introduced such that the fuzzy rules are in the form of &#8220;IF situation THEN the control input&#8221; rather than &#8220;IF situation THEN the value of some nonlinear functions&#8221;. Using Lyapunov stability method, the uniform ultimate boundedness of tracking error has been proved

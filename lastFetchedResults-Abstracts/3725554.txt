Sensors based on the ultrasonic, pulse-echo technique for measuring range have been the mainstay for robotic collision avoidance systems. Although these sensors have been successfully applied to both indoor and outdoor mobile robotic applications, certain disadvantages of these systems prompted our investigation of inexpensive sensors that use light to determine the range or presence of targets. A number of commercially available, light-based sensors are analyzed for application in a mobile robotic space application. The objective of the analysis is to develop a cost-effective, light-based ranging sensor for a collision avoidance system for an experimental Mars Rover. This paper presents some results from our investigation

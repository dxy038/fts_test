Objective
tions in the size of the [CAG]n repeats of the AR gene have been described in several types tumors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if there is an association between the AR [CAG]n repeat alleles and the relative risk for head and neck cancer and to analyse microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in these tumors.

d samples of blood and head and neck tumors were evaluated using two methodologies, silver-stained gels to perform the analyses of MSI and LOH, and automated analysis to confirm these results and for genotyping of the AR [CAG]n repeat length. Sixty-nine individuals without cancer were used as a control group for both procedures. The Log-rank test was used to compare overall survival and disease-free survival curves. The Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to determine the [CAG]n repeats as an independent prognostic factor.
s
ts with alleles ≤20 in the male group showed a correlation with lower disease-free survival (P = 0.0325) and with recurrence or metastasis (RR 2.52, CI 95%). In the female group, the allele 2 (longer allele) showed a significant lower mean of [CAG]n repeat when compared to the control group. Microsatellite instability was detected in nine cases in both procedures. In six out of these nine cases, we observed a reduction of the AR [CAG]n repeat length. LOH was detected in one out of 17 women informative for oral cancer in both procedures.
sion
results suggest that short [CAG]n repeat length (≤20) polymorphism is associated with poor prognosis in a subset of male patients with head and neck cancer and that AR gene microsatellite instability is uncommon in these tumors.

In multiprocessor system, efficient scheduling of a parallel program that minimizes the completion time is an important activity in achieving high performance. Objective of the proposed model is to optimize the schedule length, i.e. given a set of tasks, how to complete the final task quickly. A parallel particle swarm optimization algorithm has been applied for this that takes care of Local as well as Global convergence.

Short range wireless is an emerging technology that is deployed to serve an increasing number of research projects and applications in various fields. Location estimation of an object comes on top of them. It is considered a major research for remote sensing, navigation and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Studies show that the location of base stations is of great impact on the position estimation of an object. This research comes as an extension of our previous work on base stations (BSs) location configuration using patterns. A nested squares pattern was suggested, examined and provided the most accurate localization when compared with several placements patterns. In this paper, we investigate the change of our patternÂ´s configurations and its influence on the coverage of BSs. We also propose an objective function for the pattern based on simulations and experimental work.

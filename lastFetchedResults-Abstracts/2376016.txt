Underway current velocity profiles were combined with hydrographic profiles at the entrance to Tongoy Bay, an equatorward facing bay in north-central Chile, with the objective of determining its exchange hydrodynamics. To the west, Tongoy Bay is bounded by Lengua de Vaca Point, a ∼6 km-long northward protruding peninsula. Observations were obtained during three surveys (April 2005, December 2005, May 2009) along cross-bay transects for at least one full day. During the surveys, winds were upwelling-favorable and displayed diurnal variations. Non-tidal (tidally averaged) flows showed a consistent clockwise or southern hemisphere cyclonic, recirculation during the three surveys. This recirculation was likely part of a cyclonic gyre (10–20 km in diameter), not entirely resolved by the surveys, and formed by flow separation off Lengua de Vaca Point. Estimates of the baroclinic pressure gradient, combined with analytical solutions of density-driven and wind-driven flows, indicated that the recirculation in Tongoy Bay was nearly in geostrophic balance. An ageostrophic contribution to the dynamics was related to frictional effects derived from local upwelling-favorable winds. A linear superposition of the analytically derived density-driven and wind-driven exchange resulted in a flow pattern that resembled the observed net exchange flows at the bay mouth.

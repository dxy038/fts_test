In this paper we present Khronos, a framework for Discrete Event Simulation (DES) in Python. Its essential objective is to provide a powerful, general, and easy-to-use tool for simulation programmers/users. In the form of a programming library, Khronos accomplishes a seamless combination of DES with Python, taking advantage of many of the languageÂ´s features in addition to maintaining its generality, power, and simplicity. The final product is a framework which releases the user from the low-level details of DES (e.g., managing the event schedule, simulation clock, or real-time synchronization), also providing base classes for entities/resources, and a flexible set of primitives for describing the dynamic behaviors of these elements. Most importantly, the resulting simulation programs are intuitive to write, and inherently very readable. We highlight the main features of the Khronos library in a tutorial manner, presenting a simple illustrative example.

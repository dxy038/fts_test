Background: Despite some successful dynamic simulation of self-impact double
pendulum (SIDP)-as humanoid robots legs or arms- studies, there is limited information available about the control of one leg locomotion.
Objective: The main goal of this research is to improve the reliability of the
mammalians leg locomotion and building more elaborated models close to the natural
movements, by modeling the swing leg as a SIDP. This paper also presents the control
design for a SIDP by a nonlinear model-based control method. To achieve this goal,
the available data of normal human gait will be taken as the desired trajectories of the
hip and knee joints.
Method: The model is characterized by the constraint that occurs at the knee joint
(the lower joint of the model) in both dynamic modeling and control design. Since
the system dynamics is nonlinear, the MIMO Input-Output Feedback Linearization
method will be employed for control purposes.
Results: The frst constraint in forward impact simulation happens at 0.5 rad where
the speed of the upper link is increased to 2.5 rad/sec. and the speed of the lower link is
reduced to -5 rad/sec. The subsequent constraints occur rather moderately. In the case
of both backward and forward constraints simulation, the backward impact occurs at
-0.5 rad and the speeds of the upper and lower links increase to 2.2 and 1.5 rad/sec.,
respectively.
Conclusion: The designed controller performed suitably well and regulated the
system accurately.

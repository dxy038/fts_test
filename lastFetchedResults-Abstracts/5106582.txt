Networked control has attracted significant amount of interests from both the industry and academic in recent years due to flexible applications and many other advantages. Although various algorithms have been proposed for networked control systems (NCS), most control strategies assume that system model is known dasiaaprioripsila. Then one of the main tasks is to compensate the system dynamics due to network-induced delays and data packet loss. The main objective of this paper is however to identify a suitable model for the system that is suitable for networked control. A novel networked identification scheme is proposed, where an orthogonal least squares (OLS) algorithm is applied to select the model structure. In proposed scheme, a discard-packet strategy is developed which takes into account network-induced delays, data packet out-of-order and data packet loss within one framework, then a cubic spline interpolation method is used to compensate the data loss and improve identification performance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

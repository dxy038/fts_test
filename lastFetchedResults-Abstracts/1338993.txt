Objective: There is some evidence that causal beliefs are related with adherence behaviors. The aim of the present study was to explore the relationship between illness causal beliefs, demographic factors and medication adherence among a group of patients with type 2 diabetes.
Materials and Methods: Ninety-three patients with type 2 diabetes participated in this study using convenience sampling method. The participants completed the subscale of Cause of Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (IPQ) and Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS). To analyze the data, the statistical methods of Pearson correlation coefficient and simultaneous multiple regression analysis were conducted. 
Results: Participants perceived that psychological factors such as stress and emotional state play an important role in their illness. They also perceived that immunity and accident have little part in their illness. Results showed a significant correlation between age and medication adherence (r=-.20, P < 0.05). Furthermore, the findings indicated that the education was not related to adherence. The findings did not show any significant correlation between the component of illness causal beliefs (psychological attribution, risk factors, immunity and chance/accident) and medication adherence. However, medication adherence correlated positively and significantly with illness causal beliefs of God (r=0.24, P < 0.05) and destination (r=0.28, P < 0.01). According to the results of the multiple regression analysis, destination predicted medication adherence (B=34, P < 0.05).
Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of assessment of patients' beliefs about their illness. Understanding patients' illness causal beliefs can help practitioners improve medication adherence.

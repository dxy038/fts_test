In this work, the parameters affecting the declining rate of Khatoonabad's water wells' production have been examined and some method's for their rehabilitation have been proposed. To fulfill this objective, different kinds of physico-chemical and microbial tests have been conducted on the number 10 and 15 water wells:
To interpret the results for step-drawdown test and to estimate of water level and well losses, Jacob's equation have been utilized.
In order to examine the extent of the deposition and corrosion; some samples have been taken from the wells. In addition, to determine the anions and cations concentrations of the water wells quality, temperature and pH have been taken at the sight for tests.
In the biological experiments of the well, three samples were taken from the well during the operation. For SRB and coliform tests, MPN methods were adopted and HAB test was estimated from heterotrophic plate method.
In the step-drawdown test on the number 15 well, a negative value for the gradient have been obtained, which can be justified from the videometry tests. In addition the results obtained from the chemical water analysis for number 10 well, have a good agreement with the videometry tests. Moreover, the results obtained from the biological experiment for number 15 well have a good agreement with the videometry tests, but the Langelier index does not agree with it.
is investigation also revealed that the decline of the capacity of the wells can be resulted from following criteria:
-Decline rate of the water level in aquifer
-The effect of the recent droughts
-Sedimentation of calcium carbonate on the screens
In addition, each well was studies for sedimentation and corrosion using the chemical analysis of the water. Finally, some methods have been proposed for the number 10 and 15 Khatoonabad's water wells.

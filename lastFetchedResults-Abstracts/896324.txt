Objective (s): To explore predictors of the sedentary behavior, this current descriptive, analytical study was developed among a sample of adolescents in Tabriz, Iran.
Methods: Information on adolescent sedentary behaviors including TV viewing, video game playing and physical activity was collected by using A modified version of the Adolescent Physical Activity and Recall Questionnaire (APARQ). In addition an anonymous self-administrated questionnaire used to collect data on demographic characteristics, perceived family support and self-efficacy. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association between sedentary behavior and independent variables including gender, psychosocial predictors and modrate, vigorouse physical activity.
Results: In all 402 adolescent students were studied. The mean age of students was 12.93 (SD=0.49) years; and51.5 % was female. Overall the mean time of sedentary behaviors on adolescents was 193.55 (SD=99.15) minutes/day, this figure for girls and boys were 170.25 (SD=89.20) and 218.25 (SD=103.34) minutes/day (P < 0.001) respectively. The results obtained from multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that male gender (OR=3.01, 95%CI=1.64-4.64, P < 0.001), mother employment (OR=2.36, 95%CI=1.19-4.67, P=0.013), self efficacy (OR=1.10, 95% CI=0.94-0.99, P= 0.006) were the most significant contributing factors to the high level of sedentary behavior on adolescents. Gender, mother employment and low perceived self-efficacy were recognized as the main predictors of attaching to sedentary behaviors.
Conclusion: It seems that sedentary behaviors independent on adolescent physical activity levels are a psycho enviromental problem. Specefic preventive programe should be developed independendly on adolescent moderate, vigrouse physical activity.

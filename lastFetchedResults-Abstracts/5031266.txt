Restoring connectivity subjected to the failure of mobile node(s) is an important research challenge in mobile ad hoc networks. To achieve this objective, a Connectivity Restoration Strategy (CRS) is developed, aiming at restoring the connectivity of mobile network whenever it is partitioned from multiple simultaneous node failures. The proposed strategy is fully distributed and requires only local information of k-hop neighbors. Furthermore, with respect to the fact that connectivity may not be restorable without accessing network-wide information of neighbor status, an extensive investigation of connectivity restorability is conducted through computer simulations.

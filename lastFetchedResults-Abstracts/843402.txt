Based on the topological degree theory, Lyapunov functional method and some analysis techniques, the existence and global exponential stability of the equilibrium point of Cohenâ€“Grossberg bidirectional associative memory neural networks with delays and impulses is first investigated. Two illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.

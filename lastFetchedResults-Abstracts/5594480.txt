This paper presents an approach to the optimal design of a high-speed brushless dc motor (BLDC) based on the Taguchi method. The objective of the optimal design is to increase the efficiency while to reduce the cogging torque of the motor. The process is realized by analysis and simulations with the equivalent magnetic circuit method. The results show that Taguchi methodology is very efficient and an effective approach in design optimization of a high-speed BLDC motor for high performance.

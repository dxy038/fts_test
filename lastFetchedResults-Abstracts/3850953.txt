The objective of the research described in this article is to create individual MR-compatible modules consisting of 1-DoF stages complete with actuators and position encoders for implementation of the closed-loop position control. These modules can connect together to form multi-DoF assemblies that can be located inside the scanner bore near to the patient anatomy that requires the intervention. This avoids the problems associated with remote actuation and transmission mechanisms, considerably reducing the size of the manipulator. As most robots consist of kinematic chains of 1-DoF stages, these modules would be suitable for a wide range of interventions, and their design can be optimized for the procedure for which they are applied to.

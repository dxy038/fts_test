Objective: We sought to determine frequencies of minor morbidities associated with delivery between 32 and 36 weeks’ gestation. Study Design: The study population consisted of all infants delivered between 32 and 36 weeks’ gestation at a tertiary care hospital during 1997. Maternal and neonatal charts were abstracted for maternal history, pregnancy complications, and neonatal demographics comparing complications present at each gestational week. The Student t test, χ2 analysis, and stepwise regression analysis were used to assess statistical significance. Odds ratios were calculated. Results: There were 553 patients eligible for study. There was increased risk of neonatal intensive care unit admission with delivery before 34 weeks’ gestation (P< .04). An increased incidence of feeding difficulties was present before 35 weeks’ gestation (P< .001). Hypothermia remained more frequent until 35 weeks’ gestation (P< .05). Delivery at 35 weeks’ gestation did not increase the mean number of neonatal hospital days. Conclusion: Although the incidences of major morbidities decline after 32 weeks’ gestation, minor morbidities continue up to 35 to 36 weeks’ gestation and may lengthen neonatal hospitalization.

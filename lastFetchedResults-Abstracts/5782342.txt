This paper describes the impact of wind turbine on distribution network fault recovery first, then set assessment model based on Wind power participate in reconstruction. Subsequently, use a new heuristic search algorithm for formation of the initial programs to restore power. Finally, Choose the largest objective function value of the program through the evaluation model, received through an example test method is reasonable and effective. Through an example test, method is reasonable and effective.

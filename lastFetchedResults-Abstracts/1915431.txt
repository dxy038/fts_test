Objective
t the feasibility and safety of salvage laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (sLRP) for recurrent prostate cancer after high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment.
s
en men (median age 61.3 years) fulfilled the criteria of recurrent prostate cancer after HIFU undergoing sLRP with HIFU performed using Ablatherm devices (EDAP TMS, Lyon, France). The median interval from primary treatment and biochemical recurrence was 38 months, and the median serum PSA nadir after primary therapy was 1.05 ng\mL. Perioperative data and functional outcome were recorded for each patient. Complications were recorded and graded according to Clavien scale. The prostatectomy specimens were analyzed for Gleason score, extracapsular extension, and surgical margins. Mean follow-up was 14 months.
s
was no perioperative mortality and no conversion to open surgery was necessary. Mean operation time was 220 minutes, mean blood loss was 150 mL, and none of the patients received any transfusion. On histopathologic evaluation, 8 patients had extracapsular extension (pT3a) and 5 patients had intracapsular disease (pT2b). Positive surgical margins (PSMs) were detected in 2 patients in the pT3a group. Gleason score was 7 (3 + 4) in 6 patients and (4 + 3) in 5 patients. Two patients had a Gleason score of 8. The median time to achieve continence was 6 months. Four patients showed mild incontinence and used 2 pads per day. None of the patients in our series were potent after sLRP.
sion
s feasible for men in whom HIFU has failed but has a higher morbidity rate than primary surgery.

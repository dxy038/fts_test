Objective
Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a chronic, occlusive, cerebrovascular disorder of
unknown pathogenesis, characterized by progressive stenosis of the bilateral
supraclinoid internal carotid arteries, with concomitant formation of tortuous
arterial collateral vessels at the base of the brain, which reconstitute distal
branches of the cerebral circulation. In Japanese, "Moyamoya" means "hazy
puff of smoke" and refers to the angiographic appearance of the abnormal
network of vessels that develop at the base of the brain and basal ganglia to
supply a collateral route of blood flow.
We report here the case of Moyamoya disease in a 5 year-old girl with normal
mentality with a one year history of epilepsy, with Todd's paralysis. This
condition is rare and most patients are diagnosed in childhood. With this report
we aim to underscore the possibility that a usual neurological sign could be
associated with unusual neurological disorders.

This work is the result of the fortunate encounter of a historical research and engineering. It is about the aspects of engineering in the building of a city in the 1960Â´s - Praia Grande and the necessity of providing proper and good internship for students of some engineering schools in a region. These two facts have resulted in a very deep analysis of the regional building market and a structured project that has been developed for two years now with the objective to get for the students of civil engineering programs internships with real value.

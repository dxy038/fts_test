This paper examines the onto-epistemic status
and understanding of contemporary material
culture and of visual art, particularly in the context
of gallery education. It does so through a case
study of the response of 15 year-old school
students in the Czech Republic and in England to
a recent photographic exhibition, I.N.R.I., created
by artists Bettina Rheims and Serge Bramly. It
supports and develops further the proposition
that the tradition grounded in the concept of a
single ‘objective’ interpretation of a work of art
has been significantly undermined by the paradigmatic
change that has taken place in the last
decades. In the course of this process the vocabulary
of signification (e.g. doves, the royal blue,
temptations of Christ, class struggle) inherited
from the age of ideologies and grand narratives
has been significantly weakened. In its place
there emerged the vocabulary of signs born out
of the language of high tech media. It takes the
form of dynamically constituted units identifiable
via daily exposure to techno processes, e.g.
familiar from advertising and networking, at best
mere fragments of traditional narratives. The
recognition of reality is couched in terms of
consumer units originating in objects (e.g.
gadgetry) and object-based practices filling
(indeed constituting) the living place of today.
This shift is particularly apparent among English
young people, brought up in a more consumeroriented
society, and to a lesser degree among
Czechs. This is well in keeping with the concept
of the post-modern ‘empirical spectator’ developed
in recent literature on art and material
culture education.

The objective of this paper was to investigate the performance of recessed single-lap joints with dissimilar adherends through the finite element method. The influence of material and geometric nonlinearity of the adhesive as well as the impact of the recess length was examined in terms of maximum principal stresses. The strength of the joint was obtained as the load to initiate the crack propagation. Results suggested that either adding a spew fillet or considering the adhesive plasticity led to reduced peak stresses at the edge of the adhesive layer. The presence of a spew fillet in the single-lap joint with a recess length of 50% of the overlap length reduced the peak stress concentrations in the adhesive layer by 45.2% and subsequently improved the strength of the joint by 36.3%. Mitigation of stress concentration was observed in cases of an adhesive layer with a smaller recess length. The strength of recessed joints with a gap less than 50% of the overlap length decreased slightly. For the recess length as 70% and 90% of the total overlap length, the strength of the joints reduced 36.4% and 66.3%, respectively. This study suggested a recess of less than 50% of the overlap length may be beneficial for the performance of the joints.

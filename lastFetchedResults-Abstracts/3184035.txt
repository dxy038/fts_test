The work presented in this paper performs a comparison between three types of controllers, namely fuzzy logic controller, fuzzy PI controller and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based tuning of Fuzzy PI controller to control the speed of three phase Switched Reluctance Motor. The main objective is to obtain better performance of the system in stability, without overshoot and minimum settling time in system response under the sudden change in speed of the motor. The performance comparison of all the controllers is done based on their applicability, adoptability, simplicity and controllability. The system is simulated using Matlab/ Simulink GUI environment and the results are discussed. From the discussion of result, it is found that Particle Swarm Optimization based fuzzy PI controllers perform well in providing better settling time and better control of the speed of Switched Reluctance Motor.

In this paper, a macro-level scheduling method is developed to provide high-level planning support for factories with multiple coordinating cells. To model the problem with manageable complexity, detailed operations of a product within a cell are aggregated as a single operation whose processing time is related to the amount of resources allocated. &#8220;Overload variables&#8221; are introduced and penalized in the objective function. The goal is to properly allocate resources, efficiently handle complicated process plans, and coordinate cells to ensure on-time delivery, low working-in-process inventory, and small resource overload. The formulation obtained is &#8220;separable&#8221; and can be effectively decomposed by using Lagrangian relaxation. A combined backward and forward dynamic programming (BFDP) method is developed to solve a product sub-problem after a novel transformation of its process plan. The BFDP is further simplified and solved approximately

The current trend set by service providers of enhancing the degree of provisions in IP networks while maintaining the optimum quality, has promoted many research activities. These activities include those which aim to introduce improved quality of services for popular Internet services and applications. In this paper, quality of services (QoS) of video transmission on differentiated services (DiffServ) with multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) network is being simulated and evaluated by a network simulator, OPNET. The need of integration of MPLS with DiffServ particularly for the video traffic has been demonstrated in the simulation. The objective of this work is to study the influence of the QoS mechanism via DiffServ-MPLS on network parameters such as packet loss, delay and throughput for different video resolutions. The comprehensive study showed general improvement in the throughput and packet loss particularly of video transmission when using DiffServ-aware MPLS network as compared to when only MPLS or DiffServ is employed.

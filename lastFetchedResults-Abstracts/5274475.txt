Nowadays there are vocabularies or languages able to describe concepts and data structures related to road traffic. Nevertheless, this description provides only a syntactic approach and it forgot the semantic knowledge. There not exist vocabularies or ontologies with semantic value that add significance to the vocabulary concepts and their relations. The objective to be reached of this paper is to present the research developed to build a representation scheme of a particular domain: the road traffic, with a well defined semantics. The inclusion of this semantic allows to obtain a formalized knowledge model. This model enables the development of an integrated architecture of traffic information from semantic Web services. The ontologies created in this work are used to describe and add semantic value to the current parameters of the traffic services

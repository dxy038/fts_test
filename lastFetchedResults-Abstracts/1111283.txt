Grain boundary engineering comprises processes by which the relative fractions of so-called special and random grain boundaries in microstructures are manipulated with the objective of improving materials properties such as corrosion, creep resistance, and weldability. One such process also referred to as sequential thermomechanical processing (TMP), consists of moderate strains followed by annealing at relatively high temperatures for short periods of time. These thermomechanical treatments on fcc metals and alloys with low to medium stacking fault energies result in microstructures with high fractions of Σ3n and other special boundaries, as defined by the coincidence site lattice (CSL) model. More importantly, the interconnected networks of random boundaries are significantly modified as a consequence of the processing. The modifications in the grain boundary network have been correlated with post-mortem electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations of the deformed and annealed states of the material. The evolution of the microstructure to a high fraction of Σ3n boundaries is correlated with the decomposition or dissociation of immobile boundaries during annealing. This is evidenced by TEM observations of the decomposition of relatively immobile boundaries into two components, one with very low energy and thus immobile, and the other a highly mobile boundary that migrates into neighboring areas of higher strain levels. The formation of low-energy grain boundaries through this mechanism and its effect on boundary network topology is discussed within the context of grain boundary engineering and linked to known microstructural evolution mechanisms.

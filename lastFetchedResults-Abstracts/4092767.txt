A new method for reliability analysis of power systems is presented in this paper. This method is based on the artificial neural networks (ANNs), which as shown, need short training times. The objective of this paper is presentation of a new method which can solve difficulties of the previous reliability analysis methods, such as low accuracy, complex modelling and large computations. The proposed method is applied for reliability evaluation of generating units and the transmission system. Obtained results from this method for the IEEE reliability test system are mentioned, which confirm the validity of the developed approach. Other advantages of the proposed method for reliability evaluation are also explained

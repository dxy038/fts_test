This paper presents the modular multilevel cascade converter based on double-star chopper-cells, which is intended for grid connection to medium-voltage power systems without using line-frequency transformers. The converter is characterized by a modular arm structure consisting of cascade connection of multiple bidirectional pulsewidth modulation chopper-cells with floating dc capacitors. This arm structure requires voltage-balancing control of all the dc capacitors. However, the voltage control combining an averaging control with an individual-balancing control imposes certain limitations on operating conditions. This paper proposes an arm-balancing control to achieve voltage balancing under all the operating conditions. The validity of the arm-balancing control as well as the theory developed in this paper is confirmed by computer simulation and experiment.

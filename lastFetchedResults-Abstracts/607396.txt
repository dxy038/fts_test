Objective(s): To applicate of regression based path analysis for introduction of the best model of self-monitoring of blood pressure determinants, using BASNEF Model constructs.
Methods: This descriptive analytical study carried out on 150 hypertensive patients referred to a private clinic, which entered in the study with a convenience sampling. The data were collected by interview, using a survey questionnaire which was adapted by the researchers. Before starting the interview, validity and reliability of the scales approved by an experts panel and cronbach alpha. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for the purpose of data entry, manipulation and analysis.
Results: intention and enabling factors had a direct effect on self-monitoring behaviors which enabling factors had the most powerful effect. Subjective norms had indirect effects on self-monitoring behaviors through intention and enabling factors. Attitude had lowest effect on self-monitoring behaviors.
Conclusion: Regarding good power of BASNEF model in predicting that behavior, interventional programs aimed at promoting self monitoring among hypertensive patients with an emphasis on providing enabling factors, and reinforcemet of intention and subjective norms may be effective on hypertention control.

Objective: To determine the validity of serum CA125 levels in differentiating benign and ovarian cancer in patients with ovarian masses, using histopathology as a gold standard. Methodology: In this cross sectional study, blood samples were obtained from 85 women with ovarian masses who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and sent for the assay of serum CA125 levels. They were scheduled for elective surgery at Hayatabad Medical Complex Hospital between 1" April, 2009 and 31st March 2010. Results: Of the 85 women enrolled, ovarian cancer was found in 27 cases (31.8%) and benign ovarian mass in 58 cases (68.2%). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of serum CA125 at the cutoff level of 35 U/mL for prediction of ovarian cancer were 74.14%, 92.5%, 80% respectively; with 95.56% positive predictive value and 62.5% negative predictive value. Conclusion: As stand-alone modality, serum CA125 of more than 35 U/mL in predicting ovarian cancer revealed modest diagnostic accuracy.

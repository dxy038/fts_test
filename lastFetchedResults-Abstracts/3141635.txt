Elevator group control system is a complex, random, multi-objective, non-linear, uncertain decision-making problem. Fuzzy control algorithms are suitable for Elevator group control system because its algorithms are multiobjective. The algorithms optimize the elevator group control harmoniously. Simulation mode of elevator group control system is established in MATLAB in light of the property of elevator group control system and Fuzzy Control Theory in this paper. The advantage of elevator group control system using Fuzzy Control is validated by simulation in MATLAB.

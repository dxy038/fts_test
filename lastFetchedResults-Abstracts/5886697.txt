Active learning provides a powerful mechanism to enhance depth of learning and get learners involved with learning process instead of passively participate in it. And e-learning get popular with the advances of the Internet. The objective of this paper is to design a kind of active e -learning system. In this paper, the design basis including students´ requirements, related experiences and system design engineering are analyzed firstly. And then, we proposed the workflow of the system and designed the function modules of the active e-learning system. The designs focus on students´ activeness and include most active learning function or tools. To test the system effect, we conducted a beginning application in e-commerce course. Related data proved this kind of active e-learning system is welcomed.

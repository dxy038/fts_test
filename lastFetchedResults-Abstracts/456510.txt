Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) transfers phospholipids between lipoproteins, and plays an essential role in HDL metabolism. The regulation of PLTP is poorly understood and recent evidence suggests that PLTP activity increases during acute-phase response. Since type 2 diabetes is associated with chronic subclinical inflammation, the objective is to determine whether inflammation modulates PLTP activity in diabetes. Plasma PLTP activity was assayed by measuring the transfer of radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine from liposomes to HDL and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) by immunoturbidimetric assay in 280 type 2 diabetic patients and 105 controls. Plasma PLTP activity (2364 ± 651 nmol/ml/h versus 1880 ± 586 nmol/ml/h in control, mean ± S.D., P < 0.01) and CRP (1.64 (0.89–3.23) mg/l versus 0.99 (0.53–2.33) mg/l, median (interquartile range), P < 0.01) were increased in diabetic subjects. PLTP activity correlated significantly with age, BMI, HbA1c, log(CRP) and apolipoprotein AI and B in diabetic subjects. General linear model analysis showed that only apolipoprotein AI, age, BMI and log(CRP) were independent determinants of PLTP activity. In conclusion, PLTP activity is increased in diabetes and apolipoprotein AI is a major determinant of PLTP activity. There is also an independent association between CRP and PLTP activity, suggesting that subclinical inflammation may influence PLTP activity in diabetes.

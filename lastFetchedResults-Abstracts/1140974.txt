The objective of this study was to evaluate the qualities of Chinese sausages where part of the fat was substituted with yams (Dioscorea alata) during manufacturing and then the sausages were stored at 4 °C. Four treatments of Chinese sausages were manufactured by replacing pork backfat with 0%, 5%, 10% and 15% yams. After manufacturing, sausages were vacuum-packaged and stored at 4 °C for 21 days. The results showed that the moisture contents of the products significantly (P < 0.05) increased when more yams were added, while the crude fat content significantly (P < 0.05) decreased. The yam-added samples had higher water holding capacity and water activity than the control but no significant (P > 0.05) difference in pH values were observed. Samples with more yams added had lower TBA, L∗ and a∗ color values and higher VBN values. The products with 5% yams added had no significant (P > 0.05) difference in color, flavor, hardness, juiciness, and overall acceptability when comparing with the control. Based on the results of overall acceptability, it can be concluded that yams can be used as a fat replacer in the manufacture of Chinese sausages up to a level of 5%. Such a replacement results in the production of Chinese sausages with about 22% less fat content.

This paper presents the design of nonlinear servo system using fuzzy method. The objective of the simulation is to show that the developed control method using fuzzy method can stabilize the nonlinear servo system. The nonlinear servo system will be divided into small area of the operating point, and treated as a collection of local linear servo systems using Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. Feedback co-efficient of each local linear servo system has been calculated using Hikita Method. Fuzzy method has been applied to each local linear servo system and combines it as new control law. The simulations have been done to nonlinear mass-spring-damper system to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

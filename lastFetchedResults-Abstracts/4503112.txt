This work presents a dual converter employed as a rectifier with power factor regulation and bidirectional power flow. The active and reactive power flowing into the converter is controlled using an optimized direct power control algorithm. The multilevel structure of the converter is exploited to control the voltage level in each sub converter by selecting the modulation method from one commonly found in the literature, with the option of clamping one of the sub converters. These modulation methods are used to control the power taken by each sub converter, providing limited DC link voltage regulation. The system is first simulated in SIMULINK and the results were experimentally validated using a digital signal processor (DSP) based test rig.

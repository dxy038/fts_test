Various approaches may be taken to respond the ever-changing environment in our world. These approaches are usable merely when the alignment in organizations is implemented as a significant and fundamental principle. From the objective point of view, this study is a causal research, since it tries to explain one of the main causes of export performance improvement. From the result standpoint, this research is a developmental one as it works out a strategic model for exports. Moreover, strategically speaking, this study is a regarded as a survey. The method of data gathering for export performance is external secondary data namely Industrial Management Organizationâ€™s reports on IMI100 while for determining the degree of strategic alignment, the Strategic Reference Points (SRP's) theory is applied. The results show that: (1) there is a positive and high correlation between strategic alignment and export performance. Moreover, vertical alignment has a direct influence on export performance while the horizontal alignment and products group exert moderating influences. (2) The influence of vertical alignments in the export performance is higher.

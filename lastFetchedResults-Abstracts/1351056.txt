Background: The present study compared the effectiveness of Family-Based DOTS (FB-DOTS) versus Professional-Family Mix DOTS (PFM-DOTS) in smear positive tuberculosis (TB) patients.
Methods: This semi-experimental study was performed in Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases Research Center of Tabriz in 2011-2012, among 57 TB patients recruited into either FB-DOTS or PFM-DOTS groups. At the baseline of the study, knowledge of both patients and their supervisors were assessed while at the end point, smear and culture of sputum, quality of life, knowledge and satis-faction of the patients along with the knowledge and satisfaction of their super-visors were assessed.
Results: The difference for sputum smear negative (culture) was 16.2 (4.8%) and 7.7(6.9%) for the PFM-DOTS in comparison with FB DOTS by the end of the second and forth months of treatment, respectively. A significant difference was observed between the two groups in relation to knowledge, satisfaction (patients and supervisors) and all four domains of quality of life: physical health (P=0.036), psychological health (P < 0.001), social relations (P=0.026) and environmental health (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: The PFM-DOTS treatment strategy in which health experts follow the patients in their homes seems to be among most appropriate strategies in treating TB.

The IEC 61850 standard allows for a structured grid automation system where critical tasks like grid protections, renewable energy sources management, synchronized measurements, and monitoring applications share the communication network. So far, the use of IEC 61850 has been mainly limited to the primary substations, but more interesting could be the coordinated actions between primary and secondary substations in order to quickly react to faults and to reduce service downtimes for final customers. Unfortunately, the communication networks between primary and secondary substations are today only partially deployed. Considering this context, the broadband power line over medium voltage grid (MV-BPL) could be a suitable solution for closing the communication gaps between substations that use IEC 61850. The main objective of this paper is to present the outcomes of the first phase of a project whose final goal is the implementation in real grids of distribution grid automation based on IEC 61850. A new and comprehensive set of experiments on a real (and in service) medium voltage grid in Italy has been designed and carried out. The practicability of IEC 61850 communication over the distribution grid is assessed comparing the time characteristics of the MV-BPL against the transfer time classes of the IEC 61850, determining which IEC 61850 services may be transported over MV-BPL. The experimental long-term analysis highlights that more than 90% of the service requests are transferred on the network with a round-trip time lower than 40 ms even in the case of four hops, a time which is compatible with the IEC 61850 fast automatic interactions on MV grid.

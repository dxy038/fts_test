Contrast enhancement is one of the most challenging and interesting areas of image processing because of its attractive objective. The performance evaluation of contrast enhancement algorithm is usually user defined and also depends on the image quality and application i.e., different images requires different types of algorithm to enhance. This paper deals with a new contrast enhancement algorithm, which maps elements from pixel plane to membership plane and to enhancement/transform plane. Shortcomings of existing contrast enhancement techniques are rectified with the help of a mathematical tool called `Fuzzy setÂ´. These fuzzy sets can be moulded to manage the uncertainty and/or vagueness associated with images. To evaluate the performance, this new algorithm is applied on different images and few evaluation parameters are calculated, which proves the improvement over any other existing contrast enhancement techniques based on fuzzy sets.

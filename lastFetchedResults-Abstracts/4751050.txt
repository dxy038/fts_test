A novel power electronics energy management system for hybrid electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) is designed using a bidirectional switched capacitor (SC) DC/DC Luo converter. The controller uses the voltage-lift technique and presents a low output ripple, high power density, high efficiency, high voltage gain, and simple structure. A detailed efficiency modeling and analysis is also presented to support the claims.

Summary from only given. Among the numerous prospects opened by the development of hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (hc-pcf) is laser guidance of atoms and particles. we report the first observation of particle guidance in hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (hc-pcf). A cw argon ion laser of about 200 mW operating at 514.5 nm is focused by a 4 x objective and directed vertically on the particles and coupled to the fundamental mode of an hc-pcf.

This paper presents different control strategies based on Adaptive Notch Filters applied to a Hybrid Active Power Compensator. The objective is to improve the compensation characteristics of a capacitor bank when the reactive power consumption is variable. In such cases, the appropriate identification of the reactive power, especially when the system is nonsinusoidal and unbalanced is essential. Considering this fact different control strategies have been evaluated to single and three phase system. These control strategies use Adaptive Notch Filters with frequency estimator to identify, in real time, the fundamental component of the voltage and current in order to quantify and compensate the system reactive power.

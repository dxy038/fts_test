This paper presents an economic comparison between HVAC and HVDC transmission systems for an offshore wind farm with 500 MW installed power. Both transmission systems will be compared in terms of energy losses and total investment costs. The main objective is to obtain optimal tradeoffs between these criteria when different distances to shore are considered.

With proper management of water and soil and applying advanced techniques, can
enhance and optimize water use efficiency. The uses of alternative water holding
amendments will become more important over time, especially in regions in reduced
water availability. Hydrogels or superabsorbent polymers may have great potential in
restoration and reclamation projects where opportunity for irrigation is limited and thus
storing more water available for plant establishment is critical The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Stockosorb polymer on soil water retention
characteristic curve (WRC) and awailable water content The Stockosorb polymere in
two levels, 4 and 6 g/kg, were mixed with three soil textures, sandy loam, silty clay
loam and clay and water retention curve s were obtained under different pressures. The
results showed that for each texture, Stockosorb caused the volumetric water content
(Î¸v) to increase. The results of the statistical analysis showed that there is significant
difference between samples containing Stockosorb and the control (without polymers).
Available water content increases 2,1 fold of control in sandy loam and 1,3 fold in silty
clay, with hydrogel application of 8 g/kg, while there was no significant differences in
clay soil containing polymers

The MIMIC Phase I program2 has funded the development of test software that has been designed for automated testing of a broad range of MMICs device types (amplifiers, mixers, phase shifters, multiple pole switches, oscillators, etc.). The test software is an integrated RF/microwave measurement package that allows automated on-wafer, carrier, and module level testing. The objective of the development was to create software that would improve the efficiency of testing MMICs and MMIC-based subsystems, thereby reducing test costs to military systems. This objective was accomplished. The software is easy-to-learn and easy-to-use, but "intelligent" enough to be able to automatically control the measurements of complex MMICs. The software program has been named "AutoTEST", and it has been written for personal computer instrument controllers.

The objective of this paper is to determine a simple controller for street lighting application using an energy shaping method (Passivity-Based Control (PBC)). The idea is to supply such lights with clean electricity and isolated from the network. To answer this problem, one solution consists on the association of photovoltaic (PV) panel and battery. Battery can store energy from PV panel during the day and give it back during the night. First, the system model is presented then Port-Controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) form is written. This form allows to exhibit system characteristics and to simplify the stability proof. Then the control law is deduced using passivity theory and simulation results are shown. Contrary to PI or hysteresis control usually applied for these systems, here no sensor device is used for the control.

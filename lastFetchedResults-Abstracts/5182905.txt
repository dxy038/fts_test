An improved version of a conventional two-core bidirectional transductor is reported. The design of an astatic measuring system based on the transductor is described. The system can be used to measure large DC currents with high accuracy. The system has a very small static measurement error and good following performance, and it is relatively unaffected by disturbances, such as the slight fluctuation of the voltage of the power supply.&lt;<etx>&gt;</etx>

Measuring the value of reliability with the load interruption cost, this paper proposes a single objective model, which provides a quantitative coordination between the economy and reliability. To this non-convex master-slave optimal decision problem with both discrete and continuous variables, the tabu search is used to solve the master problem of schedules, and the linear programming is applied to solve the slave problem of stochastic N-1 economic dispatch at each time interval. According to the difference between units and transmission lines, this paper gives four searching strategies and compares their efficiency with IEEE 30 bus system. Numerical results shows the model and algorithm are effective.

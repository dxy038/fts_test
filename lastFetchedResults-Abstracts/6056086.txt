The fuzzy control is an intelligent control method relying upon the fuzzy set theory, fuzzy variables, and logic deduction. It can imitate the process of human decision inference in behavior, so it is more consistent with the fuzziness and human awareness, understanding, decision of objective thing. This paper selects the washing machine as the control object, bases on the washer control principle, introduces the fuzzy decision process, especially studies the fuzzy control theory with three inputs and two outputs and sets up the fuzzy rules, at last, gives the fuzzy decision of the control and the results of simulation.

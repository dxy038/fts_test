The synthetic anti-Boophilus microplus vaccine SBm7462 derived from the tick intestinal protein, Bm86, induced a protective immune response when emulsified in saponin and used in cattle. Using a mice model, and with the objective of improving the vaccine by continual peptide release, it was encapsulated in PLGA 50:50 microspheres and inoculated in BALB/c mice to assess the immunological response by detection of anti-peptide IgGs. Comparative studies were made with the peptide emulsified in saponin and with another synthetic vaccine, and the microsphere/peptide was characterized for efficiency of encapsulation, in vitro release profile, morphology, size, peptide integrity after encapsulation and stability in different pHs. The findings showed that saponin enhances a better immune response from SBm7462 and that the PLGA 50:50 microspheres are suitable for use with this peptide.

An optical limiting-amplified multiwavelength dispersion compensator (LDC), incorporating with multiple chirped fiber gratings and a common bidirectional erbium-doped fiber amplifier, for 10 Gb/s DWDM systems is proposed and demonstrated. The LDC provides simultaneous dispersion compensation and limiting amplification of multiple DWDM signals. A high constant channel output power of 16.4 dBm and low power penalty of less than 0.3 dB over an input signal dynamic range of -17 to 0 dBm can be obtained for this LDC in a 10 Gb/s two-wavelength 80-km conventional single-mode fiber system.

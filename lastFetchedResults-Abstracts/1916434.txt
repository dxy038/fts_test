BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Vascular ring is a rare congenital heart defect that double aortic arch is the most common type of it. Patients with double aortic arch can be asymptomatic or have non-specific symptoms such as respiratory distress, swallowing disorder and failure to thrive. Thus the clinical diagnosis is difficult. Given the high prevalence of respiratory distress signs in children that commonly are related to respiratory infection, we describe two cases with respiratory distress that they was diagnosed with vascular rings. 
CASES: The first patient was an 8 month old infant presented with respiratory distress and dysphagia, in barium swallow, pressure effect on esophageal was seen and after echocardiography and CT angiography, double aortic arch was confirmed. The second patient was 4 months old infant with a history of frequent hospitalizations due to respiratory infections and inappropriate weight gain that her barium swallow radiograph was suspected for vascular problem and double aortic arch was confirmed by echocardiography and angiography. In both patients, respiratory symptoms improved after surgery and their weight gain returned to normal.
CONCLUSION: In patients with respiratory distress, especially with upper airways involvements who do not respond to conventional treatment, barium swallow x-ray study and echocardiography is recommended to rule out the vascular rings.

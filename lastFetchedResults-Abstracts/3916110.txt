The paper concerns fault detection by applying a random input sequence simultaneously to a circuit under test and to a reference circuit. The objective is to determine the length of the input sequence to be applied, to obtain a given detection quality (detection probability). The paper gives a summary of the results which have been obtained for combined circuits, memories, SSI, and MSI sequential circuits.

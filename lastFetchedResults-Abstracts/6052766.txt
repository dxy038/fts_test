Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay networks can be utilized to deploy massive Internet overlay services such as multicast, content distribution, file sharing, etc. efficiently without any underlying network support. The crucial step to meet this objective is to design network-aware overlay network topologies connecting all nodes that offer promising properties in terms of excellent communication quality. We exploit the underlying network locality and proximity of the nodes for overlay routing and node placement strategy. In this paper, we describe in greater specific details our network-aware SuperPeers-Peers geometric overlay network hierarchy and study its communication quality in a massive scale network environment. We evaluate our proposal using ten massive scale networks each consisting of 100,000 nodes. Our experimental results show high communication efficiency, quality and performance.

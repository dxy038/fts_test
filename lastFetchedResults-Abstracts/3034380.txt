We study the construction of an Electronic Government oriented geographic information service system. Firstly we describe the objective to construct the system that is to improve the efficiency, benefit and scientificity of government management and decision-making. Secondly we state the system architecture in detail, which is mainly comprised of three layers, i.e. the SDI (Spatial Data Infrastructure) layer, the geographic information share layer, and the application layer. Each layer can be divided into two modules, i.e. "hardware module" and "software module". The "hardware module" includes geographic data, software system, network infrastructure, etc. The "software module" includes policies, laws, data standards, technology specifications about the service content, etc. Thirdly we discuss the system realization and application in "Digital Fujian" of China. As a practical application example in third layer, we take the "Forest Resource Management System" to illustrate the application of geographic information service system for the Electronic Government in Fujian province of China. The system includes three levels, i.e. the county level, the regional level and the province level, which are connected by network. The three levels implement different government actions with the support of geographic information services.

We illustrate how the (Auto:I, LSP:T) constrained iterative speech enhancement algorithm can be extended to provide improved performance in colored noise environments. The modified algorithm, referred to as noise adaptive (Auto:I, LSP:T), operates on subband signal components in which the terminating iteration is adjusted based on the a posteriori estimate of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in each signal subband. The enhanced speech is formulated as a combined estimate from individual signal subband estimators. The algorithm is shown to improve objective speech quality in additive noise environments over the traditional constrained iterative (Auto:I, LSP:T) enhancement formulation

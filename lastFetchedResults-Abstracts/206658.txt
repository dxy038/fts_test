The principal objective of this research is study of the causes affecting the losses of semi-hard wood rooted of olive using quantitative evaluation method of the growth parameters. In this regard semi-hard wood rooted cutting of olive, zard cv. in four soil composition beds which were disinfected with two different concentrations of Captan have been selected to measure and compare the growth stages of low, medium and high density-roots in spring and fall. In addition the number and length of main and secondary branches of the seedlings and the cutting diameter and length were exactly measured in 15 day -intervals during the course of experiment and finally the number of rooted and not rooted semi-hard wood cutting were determined and the reasons for (he losses of cutting, using the growth parameters comparison methods, were evaluated. The results of this study show that there are significant differences in the multi - variable regression analysis model in forward step by method and the roots, prior to supplying their own nutrients, should have sufficient reserved materials to feed the initial roots and branches. It appeared that to creat suitable conditions for the constant vegetative growth of the young plants, the exictence of factors, like photosynthesis efficiency, the amount of N and Ca and growth regulating factors are inevitable.

The objective of the present study was to study variability in the salivary proteins of 20 Panstrongylus megistus populations from different ecotopes and verify whether this variability influenced the intensity of the response to specific anti-saliva antibodies. Electrophoretic analysis of P. megistus saliva showed a complex protein composition and great interpopulation variability. A higher concentration of bands was observed in the 17–29 kDa region. The phenogram constructed from the electrophoretic profiles of the P. megistus study populations revealed the existence of two main groups. However, there was no evident relationship between these groups and geographical regions, ecotopes or hosts. Saliva inoculated by P. megistus during feeding elicited production of low level of anti-saliva antibodies in rabbit. The homologous and heterologous salivary proteins were recognised by serum of rabbit sensitised with saliva from only one population. Qualitative and quantitative differences were observed for recognised bands in the saliva of all eight populations studied by Western blot analysis. The most recognised bands were those of greatest molecular weight (68.0–97.4 kDa).

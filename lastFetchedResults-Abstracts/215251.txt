Tuberculosis of the breast is an extremely rare disease, which is still present and is also
misdiagnosed with carcinoma or bacterial abscesses. In this study, we reported on eight patients
with mammary tuberculosis during a four-year period. The main signs and symptoms of the
patients included a painful tender lump in the breast (n=4), a painless lump in the breast (n=3), a
lump with sinus (n=1), a sinus without lump (n=1), and an ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy
(n=1). The diagnosis was confirmed by fine-needle aspiration cytology or histology. Antitubercular
therapy was the therapeutic mainstay. Surgical intervention was reserved for aspiration of cold
abscesses, and excision of residual sinuses and masses.

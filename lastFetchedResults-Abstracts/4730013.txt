It is very important to keep power system stable when carry through reactive power optimization. A multi-objective reactive power optimization model based on &#194;&#191;-domination algorithm is presented. It calculates voltage stability and load power margin by L indicator and primal-dual interior point nonlinear programming respectively, which can assess voltage stability quickly and completely and provide operators more important information. Simulation results of IEEE 14, 30 and 118 nodes systems show that the approach is right and efficient.

Medical image classification is a significant research area that receives growing attention from both the research community and medicine industry. It addresses the problem of diagnosis, analysis and teaching purposes in medicine. For these several medical imaging modalities and applications based on data mining techniques have been proposed and developed. Thus, the primary objective of medical image classification is not only to achieve good accuracy but to understand which parts of anatomy are affected by the disease to help clinicians in early diagnosis of the pathology and in learning the progression of a disease. This furnishes motivation from the advancement in data mining techniques and particularly in soft set, to propose a classification algorithm based on the notions of soft set theory. As a result, a new framework for medical imaging classification consisting of six phases namely: data acquisition, data pre-processing, data partition, soft set classifier, data analysis and performance evolution is presented.

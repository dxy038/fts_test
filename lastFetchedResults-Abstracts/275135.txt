Passive myocardial material properties have been measured previously by subjecting test samples of myocardium to in vitro load-deformation analysis or, in the intact heart, by pressure-volume relationships. A new method for determining passive material properties, described in this paper, couples a p-version finite element model of the heart, a nonlinear optimization algorithm and a dense set of transmural measured strains that could be obtained in the intact heart by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiofrequency tissue tagging. Unknown material parameters for a nonlinear, nonhomogeneous material law are determined by solving an inverse boundary value problem. An objective function relating the least-squares difference of model-predicted and measured strains is minimized with respect to the unknown material parameters using a novel optimization algorithm that utilizes forward finite element solutions to calculate derivatives of model-predicted strains with respect to the material parameters.
Test cases incorporating several salient features of the inverse material identification problem for the heart are formulated to test the performance of the inverse algorithm in typical experimental conditions. Known true material parameters can be determined to within a small tolerance and random noise is shown not to affect the stability of the inverse solution appreciably. On the basis of these validation experiments, we conclude that the inverse material identification problem for the heart can be extended to solve for unknown material parameters that describe in vivo myocardial material behavior.

This paper describes a design and implementation of SPI interface model which is used for a SoC chip. The objective of this design is to realize expediently communicate between SoC chip and peripheral equipment. The paper analyses the sequence of SPI protocol, describes the design project of implement SPI logical function. Besides, the design is compatible with the SPI protocal and the function is also expanded, finally achieves powerful in function. After testbench and FPGA verification, the SoC chip that used this SPI model had been successfully processed. The test results indicate that the SPI interface controllerÂ´s function and performance are all achieve design target, many communication tests indicate the design is reliable in performance.

GenLOT coding has been shown an effective technique for seismic data compression, especially when compared to block-based algorithms (such as JPEG), or to wavelets. The transforms remove statistical redundancy and permit efficient compression, when used with advanced encoding techniques, such as the embedded zerotree coding framework. We derive a model for seismic data based on auto-regressive processes. This model is used to design GenLOT filter banks optimized for seismic data, using objective optimization criteria.

This paper presents the problem of bounded synthesizability of formal specifications in the context of three party systems, consisting of a machine, its environment and a controller. The overall objective is to determine whether it is possible to synthesize both the machine and its controller for a given Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specification over the signals in the machine and the controller interfaces.

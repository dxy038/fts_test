This paper addresses the problem of energy consumption in the Metropolitan Area Networks that employ Carrier Grade Ethernet. The objective is to minimize the energy consumption of nodes and links, managing the traffic through the Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP), where the spanning trees are appropriately chosen from a given set and matched with the traffic demands. We present a modelling framework, a resolution approach and comment on the different features that affect energy performance.

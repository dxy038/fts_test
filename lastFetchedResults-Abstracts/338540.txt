Objective
The major aim of the study was to establish a murine model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with B-1 cells derived from a New Zealand white mouse.
Material and Methods
Malignant B-1 cells (named CLL-RT cells) derived from a New Zealand white mouse were injected into the peritoneal cavity of severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Upon follow-up of recipient mice, the lymphomas showed characteristics similar to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with Ritcher's transformation.
Results
Blood samples from the recipient mice showed that CLL-RT cells increased rapidly in peripheral blood after 5 weeks. Serum interleukin-10 also increased significantly in recipient mice, as in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. These CLL-RT cells showed a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio. These cells could metastasize via circulation in the recipients and form diffuse lymphomas in various tissues. These aggressive and diffuse lymphomas were similar to Ritcher's transformation of human CLL. The cell surface antigens of the spleen and peritoneal resident cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The CLL-RT cells constantly expressed surface immunoglobulins M and G, and CD5, CD19, B220, and CD40 molecules. They did not express any CD11b, CD3, MAC-3, CD23, NK1.1, or H-2Kd molecules.
Conclusions
The characteristics of our animal model are very similar to human CLL. This animal system could be an ideal model for the human disease. We believe the animal model would be valuable in therapeutic studies and aid in the identification of the specific genetic alleles associated with the disease.

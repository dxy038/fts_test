Background and purpose: Corrosion is a physicochemical reaction between metal and its
surrounding that lead to changing in water quality. Corrosion causes to solve the pipelines that release the
pollutants in the water. The objective of this study was to assess the scale formation and corrosion of
drinking water supplies in Yasuj (Iran) in 2012
Materials and methods: This research was a descriptive and cross-sectional study.
Experiments were conducted according to standard methods for water and wastewater experiment in the
Water and Wastewater Co. The data were analyzed by using of Excel and Water Stability analyzer
softwares. The results were compared with national and international standards.
Results: The results showed that the calcium and TDS contents are not in the recommended
range of national and WHO standards. The Langelier Index ranged from -0.91 to -0.43 in summer and -
0.66 to -0.25 in the winter. The average of Rayznr index was 8.61±0.23 and 8.48±0.07 in the summer and
the winter, respectively. The average of aggression, Puckorius and Larson indexes were 11.58, 8.13 and
0.29 respectively, which indicates the most of water supplies don’t tend to scale formation, however tend
to mild corrosion.
Conclusion: The results showed that water supplies of Yasuj city was mild corrosive. Therefore
water quality should be control. Also water pipelines should be preserved with several modes of corrosion
inhibition.

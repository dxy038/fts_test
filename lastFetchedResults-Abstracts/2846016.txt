The objective of this paper is to present how the filter geometry optimization for the electromagnetic interference suppression will lead to the improvement of its performances. In order to determine the optimal geometry of these filters, the authors developed and implemented an optimal design program intended to determine the optimal configuration of the structure for the case in which the parasitic effects are minimal. So, in the first part of the paper the design program developed by the authors will be presented and in the second part the effect of the filter geometry optimization on the structural parasitic capacitance minimization is determined. The paper will be ended with final conclusions.

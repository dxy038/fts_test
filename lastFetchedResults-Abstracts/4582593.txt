This paper presents the control of one cell of a modular single-phase power electronics transformer with active functions for meeting the smart grid concept. In this way, the converter could be used not only as a conventional transformer but also for grid such as reactive power, harmonic elimination and energy storage. The topology of the cell is composed by a bidirectional converter with three stages: a half bridge in the input stage, a dual half bridge in the middle stage and a half bridge in the output stage. Volume, modularity, flexibility, functionalities and cost are better in comparison with the conventional transformer and also more suitable for the smart grid scenario. The control algorithms are based on the dq theory for single-phase systems. A bidirectional converter has been connected to the secondary side for providing energy storage capabilities. The cell plus energy storage converter has been simulated to determine the performance. The obtained results are depicted and discussed.

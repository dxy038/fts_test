This paper has considered three basic approaches in moral conceptualization which include the approach of consistency, the appceptualization which include the approach of consistency, the approach of cosequentialism and the approach of caring, based moral and viewed their application in moral education. This triple division, araised by Hainz(1998), can be considered as summary of various views in moral conceptualization, which was previously set forth as mental ethic against objective or trait ethics. Hainz's view is of especial characteristic in which they have much overlaps despite of their conceptual differences in moral education. This subject is the core of this view at the end it was concluded that there is no inherent conflict between virtue centered ethic and principles of ethic and rule-based ethic.

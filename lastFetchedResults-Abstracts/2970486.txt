In the paper, our high performance significance-linked connected component analysis (SLCCA) image compression algorithm is extended to three-dimensional wavelet coding resulting in a highly efficient and scalable video codec termed 3DSLCCA. Advantageous features of 3DSLCCA include low computational complexity, rate, spatial, temporal, and SNR scalability, and prevention of error propagation at the price of acceptable degradation in both objective and subjective quality when compared to the state-of-the-art H.263 standard

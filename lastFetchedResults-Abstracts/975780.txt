
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Postoperative ileus is accompanied by increased hospital stay, pain, abdominal distention, inability to begin feeding and eventually delayed recovery. Chewing gum can cause gastric stimulation and the secretion of gastric and digestive juices that lead to weakness and stimulate eating and consequently, this increases peristaltic movements of the bowel that may accelerate the ileus recovery. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of gum chewing after cesarean-delivery on return of bowel function in women.
METHODS: This randomized clinical trial study was performed on 100 patients after cesarean delivery. They were randomly allocated to two groups: gum-chewing group (n=50) and control group (n=50). The patients in the gum-chewing group chewed sugar free gum as soon as consciousness 3 times daily for 1 hour each time until discharge. Control group received routine care after surgery. Patients' demographic characteristics, surgery duration, time to first flatus, time to first bowel movement, time to first defecation, time to first feeling of hungry were compared between the two groups.	
FINDINGS: In both groups type of anesthesia, age, gestational age, pre and post operative care, period of being NPO, parity, surgery type and duration of surgery, serum intake were the same. All patients in gum-chewing group tolerated the gum without any side effects. The first passage of flatus (24.83 ±6.39 vs. 29.95±9.70 hours), time to first defecation (30.60±5.85 vs. 38.42±8.95 hours) time to first bowel movement (21.85±7.76 vs. 26.13±9.56 hours) and time to first hungry (11.79±6.05 vs. 14.52±7.60 hours), were significantly lower in the gum-chewing group in compared to control group.
CONCLUSION: Gum chewing speeds recovery after cesarean-delivery. Gum chewing is considered an inexpensive and helpful method in postoperative care following caesarean.

In this paper we study infinite horizon convex problems of Lagrange in which
hereditary effects in the state are present. The objective functional in these
problems is an improper integral defined over the time interval w0,q`.. Dictated
by applications arising in mathematical economics we do not assume a priori that
these improper integrals converge and therefore we consider overtaking optimal
solutions. This concept arose in the economics literature in the 1960s. We extend
known results for the analogous nondelay problem providing sufficient conditions
for the existence of an overtaking optimal solution. Our proof rests on the
assumption that a particular delay differential inclusion enjoys a strong asymptotic
stability property called property S... Examples are given to indicate the applicability
of these results.

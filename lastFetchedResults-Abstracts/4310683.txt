Identifying facial expressions of human beings by a computer is an interesting research work. Here a method based on feed forward neural networks is described for facial expression identification with the objective of developing an intelligent system. Four principal emotions - happy, sad, surprise along with neutral are identified by the proposed system. The performance obtained by the neural network 0.0198 against a goal of 0.0200.

Abstract
Background: Improvements in culture media formulations have led to an increase
in the ability of sheep embryo in culture throughout the preimplantation period.
Objective: This study was carried out to evaluate the effects of various
concentrations of MEM vitamins during in vitro maturation of sheep oocytes and
subsequent embryo development.
Materials and Methods: Sheep ovaries were collected from a slaughterhouse and
transported to the laboratory. Oocytes were matured in SOF medium supplemented
with, eCG, hCG and EGF in various concentrations of MEM vitamins (control, 0.5,
1 and 1.5? ) for 24h. The cumulus oocyte compelex (COCs) were co-incubated with
epididymal spermatozoa of post mortem rams in synthetic oviduct fluid fertilization
(SOFF) medium with 10% heat inactivated estrous sheep serum for 18h. Embryos
were cultured in synthetic oviduct fluid culture 1 (SOFC1) medium for 48h followed
by cultured in synthetic oviduct fluid culture 2 (SOFC2) medium for six days.
Results: Addition of 0.5 and 1 ? MEM vitamins significantly increased (P <  0.05)
overall blastocyst development (21.62% and 22.33%; respectively) compared with
1.5?MEM vitamins (15.59%), but there was no difference between control, 0.5 and
1?MEM vitamins in the percentage of embryos successfully developing to the
blastocyst stage (19.50%, 21.62% and 22.33% respectively).
Conclusion: It seems that addition of 1.5 ? of MEM vitamins has detrimental effect
on blastocyst rate.

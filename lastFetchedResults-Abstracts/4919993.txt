We consider the joint rate and power control problem in a wireless data traffic relay model with fading channels. An optimization problem is formulated in terms of power and rate selection, and link transmission scheduling. The objective is to seek high aggregate utility of the relay node when taking into account buffer load management and power savings. The optimal solution is computed by a two layer dynamic programming algorithm which leads to optimal power, rate and transmission time allocation at the wireless links

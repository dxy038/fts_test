The objective of this work is to investigate the thermal conduction phenomena in transversely isotropic geomaterials or
rock-like composites with arbitrary oriented ellipsoı¨dal inhomogeneities of low aspect ratio. Based on the evaluation of the
Green function, we provide here new expressions for the interaction tensor whose knowledge permits to obtain the concentration
tensor of the polarization field used itself to evaluate the effective thermal conductivity tensor by homogenization.
Some particular cases of the obtained general solution are equally presented, in order to validate the developed
formalism. The obtained results are next used to study the effect of matrix anisotropy, pores systems and microstructure-
related parameters on the overall effective thermal conductivity in transversely isotropic rocks. A two-step homogenization
scheme is developed for the prediction of the initial anisotropy effects and to test the ability of the proposed model
in the evaluation of effective thermal conductivity. With the help of an Orientation Distribution Function (ODF) the
anisotropy due to the pore systems is also accounted. Numerical applications and comparisons with available experimental
data are finally carried out for a partially saturated Opalinus clay and an argillite which are both composed of an argillaceous
matrix and multiple solid minerals constituents.

Soft War is a series of violent, deliberate and planned actions that cause a change to occur in cultural identity, and fundamental attitudes and values, and inculcate the idea that the political model believed by people in a political system to be plausible is ineffective. In using soft war against their enemies, states resort to different means and tools, among which media play the most important role in the process of behavioral models and decision making, and ultimately social-cultural identities. One of the modern media the use of which has been recently paid attention is the mobile and its message sending capability, namely SMS. This research takes into consideration the soft war and the role SMS plays as a sweeping and social medium in such a war directed at changing national behavior and social identity, and explains how this media has come to play a role on the political arena of Iran. It employs an analytical-explanatory method, emphasizing on library documents. In accordance to the research results, firstly SMS has the capability of playing an active role in political events and developments, and of implementing the objective sought by soft war as a media tool. Secondly, in addition to the relevant and widely cited evidence in the case of implementing the project of soft war and cultural invasion against the Islamic Republic of Iran, the developing sense of non-belonging to the social system in the identity of the Iranian society, and the implementation of the policy of audience phantasm in the countryâ€™s internal atmosphere has established the grounds required by SMS to play a role as one of the tools of soft war against our country.

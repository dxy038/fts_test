Product Conceptual Design phase is the most important period, the process of scheme generation can be regarded as a progress of optimization in a state space. In this process, there are often conflicts between multiple objectives and multiple constraints, we can only produce a compromise set. Based on Technology Identification Evaluation and Selection method (TIES), constructing the mapping relations from different functional principles combination to design objectives, we applied the improved Non-dominated sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to multi-objective optimization, so as to make it more suitable for the characteristics of combinatorial optimization, forming the pareto frontier of design space, facilitating the experts to make selection based on different target orientation.

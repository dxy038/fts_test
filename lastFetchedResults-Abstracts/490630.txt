Introduction: Vitamin D3 deficiency seems to be associated with the induction and development of patients infected with M tuberculosis to tuberculosis disease.
Materials & methods: In this case- control study, 45 patients with tuberculosis beside another 45 people without any TB history were selected. All the patients and the control group were compared with each other for vitamin D3 level by RIA (radioimmunoassay) method. Then, results were analyzed by t-test and analyze & variance in spssl 1/1.
Findings: The mean and SD of vitamin D3 level were (M=12.25, SD=9.98) and (M= 24.68, SD= 19.22) (P=0)among patients and the control group, respectively. 39(86.66%) patients and 26(57.77%) control members had a vitamin D3 level of below 20ng/ml. 28(62.22%) patients had tuberculosis in warm seasons, (summer P=0/007)& (fall, P=0/02) & (winter, P=0/08).
Conclusion: There was a significant association between previous vitamin D3 deficiency and tuberculosis. Further more, tuberculosis frequently occurred in warm seasons.

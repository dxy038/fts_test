Objective:The aim of this research wasto examine the impact of instructional multimediaon learning and retention of mathematics of fourth grade educable mentally retarded girl students of elementary schools in the Arak city.
Method: The quasi-experimental research method has been used. The statistical population  include all fourth grade educable mentally retarded students of elementary schools in the Arak city and  the sample included all the statistical population , that  were randomly assigned into an experimental and a control group.

Both groups underwent the post test, anda secondpost test was performed to measurethe retention after a two weeks time.
Results: The statistical analysis was descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings showed that learning and retention rates of students in the experimental group as compared with the control group were significantly increased. 
Conclusion and recommendations: Overall, the results of the research showthe excellence of learning and retention rates of students who had received training through multimedia software. Based on the results, it can be recommended that instructional multimedia can be useful in teaching and learning of mathematics for this group of students.

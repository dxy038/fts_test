The objective of this study was to evaluate the production of hydrogen in a two-stage CSTR system – both reactors having the same volume – and compare its performance with a conventional one-stage process. The lab-scale two-stage and one-stage systems were operated at five pHs and five hydraulic retention time (HRTs). The maximum volumetric hydrogen productivity and yield obtained with the two-stage system were 5.8 mmol L−1 h−1 and 2.7 mol H2 mol glucose−1, respectively, at an HRT of 12 h and pH 5.5. Overall, the two-stage system showed, at steady state, a better performance that the one-stage system for all the evaluated pHs. However, a comparison between the one-stage system, operating at 6 h of HRT, and the first reactor of the two-stage system at the same HRT did not show any significant difference, highlighting the positive impact of having a two-stage process. The determination of the ratio between the experimental measured H2 in the gas phase and the theoretical H2 generated in the liquid phase (discrepancy factor) indicated that an important part of the hydrogen produced in the first reactor was transferred into the second reactor instead of being desorbed in the headspace. Therefore, the improving of hydrogen production in the two-stage system is rather attributed to the increased transfer of hydrogen from liquid to gas than an actual total hydrogen production increase.

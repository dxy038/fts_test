Family functioning is an important aspect of the family environment that influences the physical, social and emotional wellbeing of its members. The main objective of this study is to compare drug abuse pattern with the family function among the patients referring to treatment centers. This study compared the pattern of drug abuse with the family function among 100 individuals who referred to treatment centers of Tabriz Welfare Organization in 2010. In order to collect data, the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale- Revised (FACES III) and Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10) were used besides asking questions based on DSM-IV criteria to find the pattern of drug abuse. The data were analyzed using multi-factor analysis of variance. The results showed that there was a significant difference between pattern of use and family cohesion. Also, chronic users scored lower than occasional and recurrent users on the measure of family cohesion. However, no significant difference was found on the measure of family adaptability with the pattern of use.The findings of the research indicated that family function differs according to the patterns of use. Therefore, using structural-strategic family therapy is necessary to imrove family functioning.

Big Data technologies like Hadoop have become an important part of the enterprise IT ecosystem. TPC Express Benchmark&#8482;HS (TPCx-HS) was developed to provide an objective measure of hardware, operating system and commercial Apache Hadoop File System API compatible software distributions, and to provide the industry with verifiable performance, price-performance, and availability and energy efficiency metrics. The benchmark models a continuous system availability of 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

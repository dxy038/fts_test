In its role as a national bibliographic agency, the Bibliografia
Nazionale Italiana (BNI) has never been in a position to fulfill
what should be one of its main functions: authority control. Despite the
creation of various committees, studies, and projects, and the close relationship
between the BNI and the Servizio Bibliotecario Nazionale
(SBN), no plan of action with regard to authority control, whether
shared or developed in consultation, has been produced to date. Recently,
a significant result was achieved: the specification of the new
BNI/UNIMARC database, structured according to authority control
principles. And in collaboration with the Region of Tuscany, a project
for control of access points destined for the users and librarians of thatregion is in progress, providing the opportunity to initiate the systematic
control of BNI access points. The BNI is now in a position to begin to realize
the first objective recommended by the IFLA Working Group on an International
Authority System more than twenty years ago: to establish
authority headings, including cross-references, for its bibliographic
records. [Article copies available for a fee from The Haworth Document Delivery

This paper describes several major optimization techniques, such as FDTD-simulated annealing (SA), FEM-Genetic algorithms (GA), and FD-TD-particle swarm optimization (PSO) and frequency domain FEM-PSO used for high-frequency electromagnetics and their applications in smart mobile terminal antenna (SMTA) design. Two SMTAs, a dielectric embedded electronically switched multi-beam (DE-ESMB) antenna and a dielectric embedded electronically steerable passive array radiator (DE-ESPAR) antenna, were successfully developed by using these multi-objective optimization techniques. The design considerations and rules based on computational electromagnetics and optimization techniques are explored for the practical application of dielectric embedded SMTAs.

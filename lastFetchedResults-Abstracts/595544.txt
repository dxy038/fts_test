A detailed history and physical examination with special emphasis on previous gynecological and obstetrical events was recorded. All these patients underwent routine investigations like HB%, CBC, Urianalysis, renal function test and viral profile with ultrasonography of the abdomen & pelvis. Intravenous Urography(IVU) was offered to those patients who had upper tract dilatation on ultrasonography. Preliminary cystoscopy and Vaginoscopy was performed in all patients to diagnose VVF and plan the surgical approach. Result: The mean age was 39.07(+10.031)years.

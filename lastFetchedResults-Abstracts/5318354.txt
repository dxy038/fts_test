The objective of the research presented was to reliably compute induced electric fields and currents in a realistic human model with a high resolution for exposures to 60 Hz electric and magnetic fields. All computations were for an anatomically-derived human full-body model discretized into a set of 3.6 mm cubes. For electric field induction a hybrid method was used. In this method a new quasi-static FDTD formulation was used to compute the fields with the lower resolution of 7.2 mm. The electric field at the body surface was then used to compute the surface charge density. The charge densities from the FDTD were interpolated onto a 3.6 mm grid and used as the source of the body interior potentials and electric fields in the scalar potential finite difference method (SPFD). For magnetic induction the SPFD method was used with the magnetic vector potential as the source. Organ average, organ maximum and spatial maps of the induced electric and current density fields were obtained. These dosimetric data for 30 different organs and tissues can be analyzed from various perspectives

The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of resolution cell size of a SAR image for bare agricultural soil monitoring. In order to achieve this objective, we propose to use Ground Based (GB) SAR experiments, in which the specific levels of surface roughness and soil moisture are set deliberately. In these investigations, we propose to study the backscattering coefficients &#963;<sub>HH</sub>, &#963;<sub>HV</sub> for different surface roughness values regarding multi-resolution. The results we obtained with our GB-SAR system (called PoSAR for Pocket SAR) are in agreement with previous experiments on indoor SAR measurements (JRC dataset).

This paper shows an effective methodology to parallelize DNSSEC using an algorithmic skeleton library: Skandium. DNSSEC is the Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions. DNSSEC provides a set of backward compatible extensions to the DNS that secure the domain name resolution process. The application of these extensions to a domain zone introduces new CPU intensive tasks, where parallelism can be applied to reduce the digital signing time. The high-level abstractions offered by algorithmic skeletons provide a simple way for non-parallel programmers to address parallel programming. The objective of this paper is to show how algorithmic skeletons can be used to successfully parallelize a real world problem, DNSSEC, on a multi-core hardware.

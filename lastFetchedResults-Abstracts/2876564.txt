The objective of this paper is to design and develop a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent-based approach for power system restoration. We describe a multiple bus electrical power system (multi-bus power system) as a market environment that consists of BDI bus agents representing two different characters, consumer and producer. These bus agents are able to balance the power system between power generation and load consumption while consumers explore the market and trade the power resource with producers. In addition, the power system will be naturally and efficiently split into power branches by the bus agents. When a fault occurs in the system, the bus agents can maximize the capacity of the served loads or minimize the loss of power loads (when load shedding may be the only option) in a timely manner. The proposed BDI multi-agent approach can be applied to any size or structure of the multi-bus power systems. It is shown from our simulation and results comparison that the proposed approach becomes more effective and efficient when the scale of the multi-bus power system expands.

Background and Objective: Nesfatin-1 is a 82-amino acid peptide recently discovered in the brain which is derived from nucleobindin2 (NUCB), a protein that is highly conserved across mammalian species. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of endurance training with and without Magnolia officinalis extract on resting level of liver nesfatin-1, glycogen and TAC in male rats.

Materials and Methods: Twenty eight adult male Wistar rats (6–8 weeks old, 128–154 g) were used for this study. Animals were randomly divided into four groups including: saline-control, magnolia-control, saline-training and magnolia-training. The training group was exercised for 6 weeks (at 25 m/min, 0% grade, for 60 min/day, 5 days/week). The extract was orally administered for 4 weeks. Rats were sacrificed 72 h after the last session of exercise under a 4-h fasting.

Results: Liver nesfatin-1 concentration was significantly higher in magnolia-training group when compared with the saline-training group and this increase was accompanied by a significantly higher liver of glycogen content in magnolia-training group when compared with magnolia-control and saline-training groups. Liver TAC concentration in the magnolia-training group was also significantly higher than the other groups. 

Conclusion: There was a significant and positive correlation between liver glycogen and nesfatin-1, indicating an effect of liver glycogen changes on liver nesfatin-1 concentration and a possible role of nesfatin-1 in energy homeostasis and Magnolia officinalis extract supplementation with endurance training can improve liver antioxidant capacity

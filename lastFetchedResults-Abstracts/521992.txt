Objective: This study assessed the effect of paradox in family therapy. Paradox, as a therapeutic tool, has been developed by a number of therapists, especially Mara Selvini Palazzoli. Method: This study benefited from the Milan Systems Approach to family. Two clients (both females) were selected for this study. These two girls were the symptomatic members of their families. The families participated in 16 sessions of the therapies. Then, they were followed up for two years. All the family members filled the FAD and BDI questionnaires prior to the therapy, in the tenth session, after the therapy and three months later. Results: Results showed that in appropriate cases paradox had a satisfactory outcome. This method reduced the symptomatic behavior, and affected family system as a whole and also helped the family system to become more practical and functional. Case #1 was depressed and on medication for four years prior to the start of the family therapy. Two years later, she recovered and got married. Case #2, was also depressed. After the therapy, she did not need to take medication; she finished high school and entered university. Conclusion: Paradox is a powerful tool for family therapy. It is a creative and critical solution for long-term illnesses. However, we should keep in mind that this technique should be used as the last option in the course of family therapy and only after other techniques failed to be effective. Caution should be taken when using this technique in therapy.

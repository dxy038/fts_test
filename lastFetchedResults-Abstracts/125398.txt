Objective: This study was done to survey hemodynamic effects of Dihydroergotamine (DHE) during spinal anesthesia and detection of the optimal IV dose.
Material and Methods: In this clinical study the hemodynamic effects of three dose of DHE (5,10,15mcg/kg) were evaluated in 90 patients who were schedule for elective inguinal herniorraphy under spinal anesthesia. Patients were randomly divided in 3 groups. All were in class land 2 ASA and aged 40-60 yrs. Non-invasive diastolic and systolic blood pressure and heart rate of patients, before and after spinal anesthesia and after IV injection of DHE every 3 minutes were recorded. During this period the patients did not received IV fluid.
Results: All three dose of DHE treated diastolic and systolic hypotension due to spinal anesthesia, (p<0.0001). A dose of Smcg/kg increased blood pressure near to that before spinal anesthesia. A dose of 10 mcg/kg increased diastolic and systolic pressure up to 7% and 8% baseline respectively. A dose of I5 mcg/kg increased diastolic and systolic pressure up to 13% and 15% baseline respectively (p<0.0001).
Conclusion: According to the above findings DHE is effective for treatment of hypotension during the spinal anesthesia and this effect is not dependent on Iv fluid administration a dose of 5-10 mcgikg is suggested.

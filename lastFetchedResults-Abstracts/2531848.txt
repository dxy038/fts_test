The Middle Jurassic scilisiclastic doposit has a good exposure in the East of the Binaload Zone and composed of conglomerate, sandstone and high amounts of fine grained sediments. The lower and upper boundaries of section are sharp respectively with Mashhad phylite and limestone. In this study lithofacies analysis in order to interpretation depositional environment and the origin of tectonic setting of Jurassic silisiclastic deposits in Binaload Zone were investigated in Baze hoz section, soth of Mashhad. Relying on the facies characteristics and stratal geometries the silisiclastic succession are divided into 10 lithofacies in the 160 meter thick. lithofacies are classified into 4 categories including coarse grain (Gcm,Gmm,Gh,Gp), medium grain (Sh, Sr,Sm), fine grain (Fl,Fm) and biochemical (C). Â Based on the following evidence, the Jurassic silisiclasic sediments have been deposited in Delta river system: Sedimentary facies: coarsening upward deposit, coal deposite, Leave fossils, syneresis crack and unidirectional sedimentary structures such as ripplemark, cross bedding, lack of Bidirectional structure. Petrographic studies led to the identification 6 petrofacies conglomerate and sandstone. Plotted data on Qt, F, L diagram, indicate recycled orogene for this deposits. Also plot data on Basu and Q, F, L diagrams, respectively shows low to medium grade metamorphic and hiumid climatic condition for sandstones of Jurassic sediments for these deposits at the time of formation. According to Turan and Iran clash pages and closing the PaleoTethys Sea in NE Iran Jurassic sediments in the study area composed of erosion of upland areas. These results indicate a wet weather conditions.

This paper discusses the application of an ac side
active filter in HVDC schemes involving capacitor commutated
converters. A suitable topology and control algorithm is selected
to achieve the necessary objective of filtering the lower order
characteristic harmonics. The dependence of the filterâ€™s rating
on parameters such as the extent of de-tuning of its passive
elements is investigated. The performance of this filter in a
capacitor commutated converter application is evaluated using an
electromagnetic transient simulation program.

Objective: To study the roles of afferent sensory inputs in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and of muscle length in the modulation of the jaw-stretch reflex in humans.
Methods: Reflexes were evoked in both the masseter and temporalis muscles under standardized conditions in 11 young women. The study was performed in two sessions; experimental conditions were jaw gape and injection of local anesthetics. For jaw gape, 4, 14, and 24 mm were used in random order. One milliliter TMJ injections (carbocaine, 10 mg/ml, versus isotonic saline, 0.9%) were given in a randomized, double blind manner. When a participant received carbocaine during the first session, isotonic saline was injected during the second one. A total of 480 reflexes were evoked in every participant.
Results: No significant differences were found between carbocaine and isotonic saline. ANOVA and post hoc paired t tests did show, however, a significant effect of jaw gape for the left masseter and anterior temporalis muscles, with the 14 mm gape having the highest amplitude.
Conclusions: Blocking the afferent sensory input (including the mechanoreceptors) from the TMJ seems to have no influence on the sensitivity of the human jaw-stretch reflex. Instead, muscle spindles are the most likely receptors to be responsible for the reflex modulation that was observed in the present study.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis B vaccination is one of the effective way to prevent and control this disease With regard to its importance in children and intervention of different factors in vaccine efficacy, this study was done to determine the role of birth weight in production of anti HBS after routine programming of vaccination in our country.
METHODS: This analytical study was performed on 120 children under 7 years old who referred to Amirkola children hospital during 2000-2001. They were divided into two groups: low birth weight or 2500gr (group A) and normal birth weight or more than 2500gr (group B).
FINDINGS: From all studied children, 40 cases were in group A (25 males and 15 females) and 80 cases were in group B (43 males, 35 females and 2 children were excluded). Mean age was almost the same in both groups. In group A, 36 cases (90%) had protective levels of AntiHBS(> I 0mIu/ml) and in 4 cases (10%), AntiHBS levels were less. In group B, the protective levels of AntiHBS had been produced in all of the children (p= 0.012). But, there was not a significant difference between protective levels of AntiHBS in group A and expected response in children (95%). The mean of AntiHBS levels in group A was 182.1+ 45.1 mIu/mL and in group B was 334.7 + 41.4 mlu/mL (p=0.014).
CONCLUSION: The protective levels of AntiHBS in low birth weight group were lower than normal birth weight group. Since, there was not a significant difference between this response in LBW and ideal response in children, it is recommended to continue routine vaccination in LBW like normal birth weight infants.

The objective of the work is to evaluate the contribution of flexibilities in the feet of a bipedal robot during a dynamic walk. The two major effects are the diminution of the intensity of the normal force when the heel touches the ground and the increase of the phase of double support allowing a better stability of the system. Another notable effect is the analogy between the passive flexion amplitude of the tiptoes and the measured results of human subjects

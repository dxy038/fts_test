Static Var compensator (SVC) is normally used in power system to improve voltage profile and reduce system power losses. In this paper, a relatively new optimization technique named as the improved harmony search algorithm (IHS) is applied to determine optimal location and size of SVC devices in a transmission network. A multi-criterion objective function comprising of both operational objectives and investment costs is considered. The results on the 57-bus test system showed that the IHS algorithm give lower power loss and better voltage improvement compared to the particle swarm optimization technique in solving the SVC placement and sizing problem.

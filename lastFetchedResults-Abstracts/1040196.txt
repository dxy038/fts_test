The experimental true strain–true stress data from isothermal hot compression tests on a Gleeble-1500D thermal simulation machine, across a wide range of temperatures (1173–1373 K) and strain rates (1.5 × 10−3–1.5 × 10−2 s−1), were employed to study the deformation behavior and develop constitutive equations of 20CrMo alloy continuous casting billet steel. The objective was to obtain the relational expression for deformation activation energy and material constants as a function of true strain and the constitutive equation for high temperature deformation of 20CrMo based on the hyperbolic sine form model. A correlation coefficient of 0.988 and an average absolute relative error between the experimental and the calculated flow stress of 8.40% have been obtained. This indicates that the constitutive equations can be used to accurately predict the flow behavior of 20CrMo alloy steel continuous casting billet during high temperature deformation.

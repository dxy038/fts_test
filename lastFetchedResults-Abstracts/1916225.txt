Objective
cidate clinicopathologic independent prognostic factors for intravesical recurrence after laparoscopic nephroureterectomy for primary upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UUT-UC).
s and materials
tudy included 212 consecutive patients clinically diagnosed as localized UUT-UC and treated by retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephroureterectomy between January 2002 and October 2010, after exclusion of those with a previous or concurrent history of bladder cancer. The clinicopathologic features, risk factors, and intravesical recurrence–free survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses by Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to identify independent risk factors for intravesical tumor recurrence.
s
 patients, 64/212 (30.2%) developed subsequent intravesical recurrence during a median follow-up period of 39 months (range 7–78 months). Among them, 56/64 (87.5%) developed recurrent bladder cancer within 2 years after the surgery for UUT-UC, and the median interval between surgery and intravesical recurrence was 14 months (range 7–51 months). Multifocal tumors, renal insufficiency, and immunosuppression were determined as risk factors for intravesical recurrence by univariate analysis. However, by multivariate analyses, multifocality (hazard ratio = 2.060, P = 0.006) and immunosuppression (hazard ratio = 1.915, P = 0.037) were identified as independent predictors for the development of recurrent bladder cancer.
sions
cidence of intravesical recurrence after laparoscopic nephroureterectomy for UUT-UC is high, and most subsequent bladder cancers recur within 2 years after surgery. Tumor multifocality and immunosuppression are significant independent risk factors in developing initial intravesical recurrence after laparoscopic surgery for primary UUT-UC.

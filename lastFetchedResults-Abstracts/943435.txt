    Evaluation of bull frozen-thawed spermatozoa is valuable to determination of fertility rate. The objective of this study was to determination of relationship between motility and vital staining with reaction rate of frozen-thawed bull sperm to hypoosmol solutions and determination of the best medium and dilution for evaluation of plasma membrane of bull frozen sperm. In this study we have examined the motility and lived sperms rate, we have used of distilled water, dextrose-NaCl and NaCl medium with 50, 75, 100 and 300 mOsm/L dilutions. For the present study we have bought 30 Holestian bull frozen-thawed sperm payote. The examinations of Indian ink, vital staining, motility and hypoosmotic test were used to evaluate the payotes. The results have showed that proportion of reacted sperm to DW more than other solutions (p < 0.05). Proportion of reacted sperm to hypoosmol solutions were more than isoosmol solution (p < 0.05). proportion of reacted sperm to 50 mOsmol/L of dextrose-NaCl was more than other hypoosmol solutions with no significant differences (p > 0.05). In conclusion,  this study demonstrated that distilled water can efficiently use for evaluation of the functional integrity of the plasma membrane of frozenâ€“thawed bull sperm and 50 mOsmol/L of dextrose-NaCl was a good hypoosmotic media to evaluate plasma membrane of frozen sperm. Based on the results, the positive correlation was observed between motility and hypoosmotic Swelling test but no correlation between hypoosmotic Swelling test and lived sperm rates. So, motility and hypoosmotic Swelling test are valuable examinations for evaluation of bull frozen-thawed sperms.

Emulation of static converters/electrical machines/sensors (CMS) is an interesting approach to complete validation of digital control units and to perform diagnostic function. However to be impressive, the emulator have to run in real time in order to reproduce exactly the physical system functioning. Classical systems seem not to be adapted to this application. So, in this paper the authors propose a new design of emulation system using multiprocessor machines and they present specific structures retained for the real time emulator of a chopper/DC machine/sensor system. The objective of this work is to give an alternative to the classical system in emulation design where real time processing is required

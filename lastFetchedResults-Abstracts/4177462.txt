The electric utility industry is investigating methods for controlling the customer demand for power. The present techniques involve denying power to selected appliances. The author proposes a novel strategy for appliance control using a home automation communications network. The objective is to allow continued appliance operation during energy shortages. The appliances would operate at reduced modes of power consumption while still providing some services to the customer with minimum inconvenience. It is concluded that effective energy management for residential applications can be achieved by the appropriate combination of the following: existing products modified for home automation: microcontrollers engineered for continuous residential use: clever software with attention to the user interface: and home automation standards for communications and connectors

The aim of the present paper is to study the Green's function in orthotropic thermoelastic diffusion media. With this objective, firstly the two-dimensional general solution in orthotropic thermoelastic diffusion media is derived. On the basis of general solution, the Green's function for a steady point heat source in the interior of semi-infinite orthotropic thermoelastic diffusion material is constructed by four newly introduced harmonic functions. The components of displacement, stress, temperature distribution and mass concentration are expressed in terms of elementary functions. From the present investigation, a special case of interest is also deduced, to depict the effect of diffusion on components of stress and temperature distribution.

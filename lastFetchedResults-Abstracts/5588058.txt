In this paper, the problem of the multi-user uplink scheduling in cognitive radio cellular network (CogCell) is investigated. The objective is to maximize the system throughput, while protecting the QoS of primary user (PU) from being affected by secondary user (SU). Here, PU´s QoS is represented by its signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) outage probability. It is equivalent to say that SU can increase its transmit power to enhance the system performance as long as PU´s SINR outage probability does not exceed the predefined threshold. So the first scheduling algorithm is proposed to maximize the system throughput through utilizing the multi-user diversity. Different from the first algorithm which does not take the fairness among SUs into account, the second scheduling algorithm with considering proportional fairness among SUs is proposed. It is shown to provide a satisfactory tradeoff between maximizing the system throughput and achieving fairness among SUs. Finally, these proposed algorithms are validated through extensive simulations.

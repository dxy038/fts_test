Time-domain reconstruction of a two-dimensional dielectric cylinder by using real-coded genetic algorithm is presented in this paper. Scattering from the dielectric cylinder is solved by using finite-difference time-domain method (FDTD). The dielectric cylinder is represented by a set of geometrical and constitutive parameters. The electromagnetic inverse scattering problem is to retrieve these parameters given the measured time-domain scattered electric fields on finite receivers. It is cast into an optimization problem by defining the objective function as the relative error between the measured and simulated time-domain scattered electric fields on finite receivers. The optimization problem is then solved by using the real-coded genetic algorithm. Good agreement is observed between true profiles and numerically reconstructed ones

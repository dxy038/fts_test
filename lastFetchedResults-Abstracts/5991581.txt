Robot curve tracking is used in many aspects of industry, such as automatic welding and incising. In this paper, the technique of structure light triangulation is used for camera calibration of curve tracking system at first, and then an improved curve detection algorithm is presented. This algorithm adopts an extended chain code template. The discrete sampling point sequence of curve can be obtained by using this one, and the burr on the curve can be wiped off effectively by adjusting the size of chain code template automatically. The experiment results show that the improved chain code algorithm can measure and identify the curve more quickly and accurately, and implement the objective of curve tracking.

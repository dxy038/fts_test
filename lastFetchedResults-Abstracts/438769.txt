Background.
Elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance as a consequence of cardiopulmonary bypass may lead to failure of single-ventricle palliation. We reviewed our experience with aprotinin, a nonspecific serine protease inhibitor, to determine whether it could ameliorate the inflammatory effects of cardiopulmonary bypass and improve outcome of single-ventricle palliation.
Methods.

Forty-six consecutive patients undergoing single-ventricle palliation using cardiopulmonary bypass were reviewed retrospectively. Aprotinin was used in 8 of 30 bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt and 10 of 16 Fontan procedures.
Results.

Aprotinin use was associated with a decrease in the early postoperative transpulmonary gradient among patients undergoing Fontan and bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt procedures. The bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt aprotinin group had a higher oxygen saturation and a decrease in quantity and duration of thoracic drainage. Among patients receiving aprotinin there were no episodes of mediastinitis, thrombus formation, or renal failure.
Conclusions.

Aprotinin use in single-ventricle palliation was associated with decreased transpulmonary gradient and increased oxygen saturation consistent with decreased pulmonary vascular resistance. This retrospective study suggests that aprotinin has a favorable impact on the early postoperative course of single-ventricle palliation.

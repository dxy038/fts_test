The analytic hierarchy process based performance evaluation for trajectories is analyzed in this paper, including the hierarchical evaluation system along with the ascent, cruise and descent phases, the judgment matrixes and the consistency check. The orthogonal design based evaluation for trajectory optimization algorithms is proposed, which can simulate the variable environment of flight and obtain multiple assessment results of optimization algorithms by selecting the trajectory optimization initial parameters as the orthogonal design factors reasonably. Moreover, we score and rank the optimization algorithms based on the quality ratio and Euclidean distance. The proposed assessment route is more objective and reasonable compared with the classical method. This approach is also very concise and easy to use. Preliminary simulation results indicate that the proposed technique can settle a proper order for different algorithms with a rational scoring agree with the engineering practical results effectively.

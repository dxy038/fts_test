To solve the problem that uncertainty information is difficult to quantify in the information system risk analysis process, a risk analysis algorithm using cloud model is presented. In this method, cloud model theory is applied to analyze factor system of risk assessment based on domain experts; a model of information system risk analysis is constructed by combining qualitative analysis and quantitative calculation. Finally, an instance of the risk analysis approach based on the model is validated, which demonstrates the rationality and objective of the model. So it provides a new method for security risk assessment in the information systems.

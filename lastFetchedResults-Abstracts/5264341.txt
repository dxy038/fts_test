This paper summarizes a cost benefit analysis performed to assess the potential impact, in terms of cost and other measures, of structural health monitoring capabilities on operators of commercial transports. Amongst the topics discussed are: real-time (or near real-time) characterization of structural condition and integrity; improved processes and procedures for aircraft life-cycle management and maintenance; feedback of real-time dynamic flight information related to aircraft structural integrity to enable flight control and recovery; and capabilities for reading, translating, processing, and analyzing data generated by embedded sensor, instrumentation, and control systems. The purpose of the analysis was to provide an objective basis for: identifying economic, engineering, operational, and logistical considerations for effective decision-making relative to technology development and implementation; balancing the relevant investment cost against these considerations; identifying where cost savings and positive return on investment can be realized; encouraging up-front user input and involvement in planning and implementation; minimizing the impact, cost, and risk of future implementation and integration; and capitalizing on cost-effective technology insertion opportunities

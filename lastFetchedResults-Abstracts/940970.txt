The Oslo Airport at Fornebu was closed in 1998 after 60 years of operation. An area of 3.1 km2 was made available for one of
Norway’s biggest property development projects. Plans include 6000 residences and 20,000 workplaces. Fornebu is situated on a
peninsula in the Oslo Fjord just outside the city of Oslo and is regarded as a very attractive area for both urbanisation and
recreation. The residential area located centrally at Fornebu surrounds a centrally located park area. In the planning process, there
was an expressed interest in using water as a life-giving element within the vegetation structure of the park. In Norway, stormwater
in urban areas has traditionally been collected and transported in pipe systems to adjacent watercourses. However, there is an
increasing interest in alternative ‘‘green’’ solutions for the management of stormwater. The paper presents a concept for sustainable
stormwater management at Fornebu. A main objective is to improve the recreational and ecological value of stormwater while
achieving a cost-effective solution. This objective is reached by replacing conventional urban drainage pipes with swales, filter
strips, wetlands and ponds as collection, storage and treatment systems designed for natural processes. The paper thereby
addresses integrated systems for stormwater management by approaching nature’s way and sustainable development principles.

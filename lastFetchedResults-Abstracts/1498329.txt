Heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) are parts of the major energy consumption in a building. Conventional heating and cooling systems are having an impact on carbon dioxide emissions, as well as on security of energy supply. In this regard, one of the attempts taken by researchers is the development of solar heating and cooling technologies. The objective of this paper is to review the passive solar technologies for space heating and cooling. The reviews were discussed according to the working mechanisms, i.e. buoyancy and evaporative effects. The advantages, limitations and challenges of the technologies have been highlighted and the future research needs in these areas have also been suggested.

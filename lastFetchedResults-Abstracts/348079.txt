Objective: To investigate whether the periodic EEG patterns seen in healthy and sick full term neonates (tracé alternant and burst suppression, respectively) have different frequency characteristics.
Methods: Burst episodes were selected from the EEGs of 9 healthy and 9 post-asphyctic full-term neonates and subjected to power spectrum analysis. Powers in two bands were estimated; 0–4 and 4–30 Hz, designated low- and high-frequency activity, respectively (LFA, HFA). The spectral edge frequency (SEF) was also assessed.
Results: In bursts, the LFA power was lower in periods of burst suppression as compared to those of tracé alternant. The parameter that best discriminated between the groups was the relative amount of low- and high-frequency activity. The SEF parameter had a low sensitivity to the group differences. In healthy neonates, the LFA power was higher over the posterior right as compared to the posterior left region.
Conclusions: Spectral power of low frequencies differs significantly between the burst episodes of healthy and sick neonates.
Significance: These results can be used when monitoring cerebral function in neonates.

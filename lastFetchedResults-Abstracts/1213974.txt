Catalytic combustion of toluene on Cu-Mn/MCM-41 catalyst was performed in tubular flow reactor operated at atmospheric pressure. The effect of catalyst pre-treatment temperatures on the catalytic activity and stability was investigated. Some reaction variables, such as inlet concentration of toluene and oxygen, reaction temperatures and space velocities were varied over wide ranges, and the influence of different reaction conditions on toluene conversion was discussed. It is showed that the catalytic activity was significantly affected by calcination temperatures between 300 and 800 Â°C, and oxygen concentration, toluene concentration and space velocity are all key experimental factors to optimize the toluene combustion activities. The objective of this study was to investigate catalytic properties of Cu-Mn/MCM-41 catalysts prepared at different calcination temperatures, in order to obtain additional information to prepare an efficient and highly active catalyst at low temperature.

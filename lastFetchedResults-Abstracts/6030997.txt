This paper describes an approach to master/slave network synchronization based on bidirectional message exchanges without the use of timestamps. Rather than the usual approach of exchanging digital timestamps through a dedicated synchronization protocol, an approach is described in which synchronization information is conveyed implicitly at the physical layer through the timing of the master node&#191;s responses to the slave nodes. This approach can reduce overhead and allow the embedding of synchronization functions in existing network traffic. A timestamp-free synchronization protocol is described and its performance is quantified in the presence of delay estimation error and stochastic local oscillator dynamics. A filtering framework is also developed to allow each slave node to accurately infer and correct local clock drifts from multiple noisy clock offset estimates. Based on fundamental delay estimation bounds for narrowband signals, numerical results show that synchronization among the slave nodes can be achieved quickly and that the resulting steady-state accuracy can be sufficient to support distributed transmission techniques requiring carrier phase alignment, e.g. distributed beamforming.

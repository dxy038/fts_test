An automated optimization method by the integration of the response-surface method and an optimization algorithm is presented to control springback of stamping parts. In order to minimize both objective functions of springback and thickness deformation simultaneously, a multi-objective genetic algorithm is applied to find all the optimal solutions at one run instead of transforming multi-objective functions into a single objective function. The response-surface model is employed as a fast analysis tool to surrogate the time-consuming finite-element procedure in the iterations of the multi-objective genetic algorithm. An example is studied to illustrate the application of the approach proposed, and it is concluded that the proposed method is more efficient than the traditional manual finite-element procedure and the ‘trial and error’ approach for springback controlling.

This paper proposes a methodology for optimizing resource allocations within a real-time information system, given the availability constraints. In essence, the methodology reformulates the availability constraints into a state transition matrix. The state probabilities, computed from the transition matrix, form a portion of the input to the optimizing algorithm. This algorithm optimizes an arbitrary objective function of system resources, subject to the reformulated availability constraints.

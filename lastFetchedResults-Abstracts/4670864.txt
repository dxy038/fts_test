For wireless sensor network specialized in distributed detection application, communication power of each sensor should dedicate to improve the total detection performance of the system and its utilization should be energy efficient. There is a balance point for communication power. Above the point, it is difficult to improve the system´s detection performance. Below it, it is easy to improve system´s detection performance by increasing the communication power of sensor node. Therefore, a method was given to guide the seeking of the balance point. Specifically, the objective is to determine the balance point according to the variations of global probability of detection versus channel SNR and allocate the communication power of each node according to the point. Numerical simulation shows that the method is practical and feasible.

This paper has objective to develop a 42V cooling fan system adopting a 42V BLDC fan motor with metal powdered core for hybrid electric vehicle. So, the influence on a motor design by metal powder is described and the powder is applied as a direct replacement of lamination core. The motor also has been redesigned to take an advantage of the powdered core for improving their performance on the same volume. For the design, the dynamic analysis considering the local magnetic saturation of the stator and the driving pattern by PWM driving circuit is performed based on the coupled finite element analysis with rotor dynamic equations. Also, developed motor and drive circuit is applied to the cooling fan system and compared with simulation results. From the analysis results, it must be noted that the developed type has great advantage over the conventional type toward trend of higher torque per a volume and higher efficiency.

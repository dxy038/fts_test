This paper presents an object-oriented approach for creating multi-region non-manifold models with NURBS. The main motivation is that the geometry and shape of realistic engineering objects are intrinsically complex, usually composed by several materials and regions. Therefore, automatic and/or adaptive meshing algorithms have become revealed themselves quite useful to increase the reliability of the procedures of a FEM numerical analysis. The present approach is concerned with two aspects of 3D FEM simulation: geometric modeling, with automatic multi-region detection, and support to automatic finite element mesh generation. The final objective is to use geometric models directly in numerical applications

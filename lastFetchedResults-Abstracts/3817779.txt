The objective of this paper is to collect and analyze data that can be used to model mode- and different route-choice paradigms using same subjects and same experiment. In this paper, the authors estimated five models to address driversÂ´ diversion, compliance, and route choice. In addition, the effect of advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) on the mode choice is also considered. A travel simulator was used as a dynamic data collection tool. The simulator uses a realistic network, two modes of travel, real historical volumes, and different weather conditions. It provides five different levels of traffic information/advice, one at a time, and collects dynamic mode choices and pretrip (long-term) and en-route (short-term) route choices. The binomial and multinomial generalized extreme equations (BGEE and MGEE) were used to account for the correlation between repeated choices made by the same subject. In addition, MGEE accounts for the correlation between alternatives in multidimensional route-choice models. The modeling results showed that travel time and familiarity with the device that provides the information had significant effects on the first four models. It is shown that developing in-vehicle information devices may lead to a less transit usage in some cases; this indicates a potential drawback of this technology. Expressway users are shown as the most travel-time savers who would divert if they are guided to a less-travel-time alternative. The number of traffic signals on the normal and advised routes affects the diversion from the normal route and compliance with the pretrip advised route. This paper underlines the importance of modeling correlation, if it exists, in mode/route-choice data

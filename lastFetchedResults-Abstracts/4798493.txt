Gradient projection technique has been widely used in kinematic control of redundant robot. In this paper, a novel objective function of joint velocity and position is designed for use in gradient projection technique to avoid obstacles and joint limits. The homogeneous solution component of inverse kinematics generated by this method contains one component with magnitude proportional to joint velocity. This feature makes faster joint motions approaching obstacles and joint limits in time. Simulations demonstrate the validity of performance criteria and effectiveness of the kinematic control method.

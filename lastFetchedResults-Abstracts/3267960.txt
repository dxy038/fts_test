Reliable co-channel bidirectional transmission in wireless networks is moving towards reality by employing the emerging full-duplex (FD) technology. Enhanced by FD-capable nodes, a future wireless network can be made up merely with pairs of bidirectional communicating nodes where each pair occupies a block of orthogonal resource to avoid interference, referred to as pure-FD system. In this paper, we derive close-form expressions for the pure-FD system models with or without Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) noise. Adopting the weighted sum-rate maximization algorithm and using simulations with MATLAB, we give simulation results of pure-FDÂ´s rate boundaries with joint optimization of power and bandwidth, and get the &#8220;FD workable area&#8221; where FD outperforms HD. Conventional frequency-division half-duplex(HD) system is present for comparison. Simulation results show that the rate boundary for FD system strongly depends on the self-interference attenuation capability of node, and there is a critical level where pure-FD performs the same with HD which is shown in our simulation. Besides, the simulation results with EVM show that the attenuation capability before baseband severely affects the rate boundary.

Introduction & Objective: Pruritus is one of the most common skin lesions of renal patients. Its prevalence among dialysis patients is between 10 to 20 percent. The main cause of itching in these patients is unknown and various medications are prescribed to patients. The purpose of this study is assessing of response to treatment of cromolyn sodium gel 4% and comparison to pimecrolimus cream 1% in patients with end stage renal disease.
Materials & Methods: This study was conducted as a randomized single blind study in 60 ESRD patients randomly divided to two groups of 30 each and a group treated with cromolyn sodium gel 4% and another group treated with pimecrolimus cream %1 for 8 weeks two times a day starting immediately after dialysis. Patient's pruritus levels was determined 9 times (before the start of the study and at the end of each week after for eight weeks) using a Visual Analogue Scale.
Results: The mean score of pruritus in the group receiving cromolyn sodium gel 4% was assessed 9/4±5/1 and 3/1±5/4 before and after the medication, respectively (P < 0/0101). And, in the group receiving pimecrolimus cream %1 was detected 9/1±5/3 and 5/7±3/2, respectively (P < 0/0101). About drug side effect, 3 patients of cromolyn sodium group and 5 patients of pimecrolimus group had complained of erythema and burning sensation.
Conclusion: According to this study, cromolyn sodium gel 4% to be an effective drug compared to pimecrolimus cream %1 in reduction of pruritus among ESRD patients undergoing dialysis.

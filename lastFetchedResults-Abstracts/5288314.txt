This paper compares L-band measurements from three different experiments in areas covered by grass. The main objective is to assess soil moisture retrievals based on the L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere model (L-MEB) used by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission (SMOS). Results indicate that over grass the vegetation is isotropic to the microwave propagation at horizontal polarisation, while at vertical polarisation non-zero scattering is observed for all the grass data sets. Surface soil moisture is retrieved with enough accuracy for all data sets as long as the soil roughness and litter emission are calibrated beforehand. The study also highlights the importance of detecting strong attenuation by wet vegetation and litter due to rainfall interception. We show that strong rainfall interception can be flagged using a microwave polarisation index.

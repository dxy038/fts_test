Through three cycles of radar data collection at Venus that ended in September 1992, the Magellan mission has collected radar image data covering over 99% of the Venusian planet surface. The data reduction process of deriving image data from radar signal data has been performed primarily on the Primary SAR Processor (PSP) at the Magellan Radar Data Processing Facility (MRDPF). The MRDPF is currently scheduled for de-commissioning in September 1993 after completing its third year of SAR data processing operations. The Magellan UNIX-based SAR Processor (USP) was developed with the objective of preserving Magellan data processing capability. The USP development was a clear departure from utilizing custom-built hardware for SAR processor implementation. It followed the current trend in SAR processor development in utilizing commercial concurrent processing technology and parallel computing machinery. The USP development is presented with discussions focused on algorithm enhancements made possible by the removal of hardware constraints and pertinent implementation considerations that affected throughput and image quality

Background: Garlic is one of the medicinal plants, which is efficate in treatment of mild hypertension and lipid profiles.
Objective: Along this study allicin content and botanical traits are evaluated in pre-planting stage.
Method: Bulb mean weight; clove mean weight and clove number per bulb were the evaluated morphological characters. Allicin content evaluation was done by HPLC. The correlation existed between evaluated characters were analyzed.
Results: We found that all samples were rich in allicin with values higher than pharmaceutical grade (4.5 mg/g). This study showed that ecological conditions had not detectable relation with allicin content. A cluster analysis of data was performed based on morphological characters and allicin content.
Conclusion: In general we did not detect significant relationship between genetic diversity and geographical origins, which suggests that probably the genetic factors have more influence than ecology.

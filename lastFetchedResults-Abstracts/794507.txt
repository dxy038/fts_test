A robust induction motor control should provide the desired performance in the face of both plant model and controller model uncertainty. In a recent work, Bottura and co-workers, using the field orientation principle, introduced a representation of a nonlinear time-varying induction motor model that admits robust induction motor controller synthesis in the linear H∞H∞ framework. The present work considers the use of the approach of Bottura et al. for attaining robust performance of the main operating modes–tracking and disturbance rejection–of an induction motor control system under implementation constraints on the control signal magnitude. This approach requires two distinct mode-specific controllers with gains that cannot be bridged without considerable performance degradation. To address this problem, a multi-objective hybrid control design methodology is developed that employs the corresponding mode-specific controller in each mode, and organizes a rapid and smooth steady-state switching, or transfer, between these controllers to permit sequencing of the operating modes, as necessary. Simulation shows that the technique proposed yields controllers with performance minimally affected by an imprecise modeling of an induction motor, as well as a reduced cost controller implementation throughout the entire induction motor operating sequence.

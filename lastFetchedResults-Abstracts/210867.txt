The primary objective of this study wus to compare the effect of two types (!!
neoprene knee sleeves (soft or support and rigid or stabilizer) on knee joint posnion
sense after A.C.L Reconstruction (BPTB method) Joint position sense was assessed
by electro -- goniometry using aClive joint angle replication test during open kinetic
elwin in sitting position. The 30 ~ .15 0 and 60 0 knee flexion wert:' used as large!
angles. Eleven /nan (with averge age ]0. N±-I. 6 years and wetgh! 7j±Y kg) pel:!ornlll7g
unilateral A.C.L reconstruction were tested before wearing neoprene knee sleeve,
ajit!r 30 minuets with neoprene knee sleeves. and finaliy after removal 0.1 the knee
'sleeve. These tests were performed in separate occasiolls within 2-1 hours with sojt
neoprene knee sleeves (support), with rigid neoprene knee sleeves (stahili:er) and
without neoprene knee sleeves (control test). The absolute difference between //IL'
target and reproduced angles. over the five attempts (average asbolute d?ffel'l.!ncf!
(AAD)) was calculated The results showed that rigid neoprene knee slcevvs
[stabilizer} significantly improved knee joint position sense on 30 D orknee j!C:T/OI1 111
involved limb during the entire interval of use (p<O 05). This improvement in knee
joint position sense was not seen when the rigid neoprene knee sleeves (stahi!I:!!r)
were removed.

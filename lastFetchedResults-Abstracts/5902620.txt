Nowadays, Indoor Positioning Systems capitalize on the existing wireless local area network infrastructure and are very popular and attractive. However, most systems only focus on the network deployment for positioning but overlook that the original purpose of these WLAN infrastructures is providing the required connectivity. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach where WLAN planning and positioning error reduction are modeled as an optimization problem and tackled together during the WLAN planning process. A Mono-objective algorithm called Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) is implemented. The simulations results demonstrate that this approach is highly efficient in solving the indoor positioning optimization problem.

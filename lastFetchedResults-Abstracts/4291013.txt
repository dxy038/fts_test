The aim of the paper is to present a modelling framework for design and justification of guide path layout for unit load automated guided vehicle systems (AGVS). The modelling framework proposes an integrated analysis which is based on three-step layout design which includes optimization, computer simulation and economic analysis. For the first step, a zero-one integer programming formulation designs an optimal unidirectional or mixed AGVS guide path layout. The objective is the minimization of the total distance travelled by vehicles (loaded and empty) plus fixed equipment costs. The second step uses simulation and evaluates the effect of traffic flow pattern on the system performance criteria as well as it supplies more realistic data to perform an economic analysis concerning the operating costs. Based on the total cost concept, the third step utilizes an economic analysis to determine which alternative is preferred. The application of the modelling framework is demonstrated using an example. Suggestions for the AGVS layout choice depending on the performance and financial analysis are presented

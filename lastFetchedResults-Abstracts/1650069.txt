 The major problem of the present article is to investigate relation between Epistemological Behaviorism and objectivity. Can we believe in the one and set aside the foundational attitude to knowledge, but nevertheless we preserve the other and claim that the inquiry is answerable to the world. In this article, McDowell’s positive answer to this question is considered. In this respect, McDowell’s  ideas along two axes are put forward: negative ideas stating his critical analysis about the mistaken conceptions, involved in Rorty’s ideas, that are led to the denial of objective knowledge and the confirmation of solidarity; and positive ideas showing his specific attitude to world, mental occurrences, impressions the world makes on us, perceptual experience, the actualization and the exercise of conceptual capacities, the position of experience in the order of justification, and objective knowledge. McDowell’s procedure to prove how our intellectual activity can make us answerable to reality, and how our thinking puts us in possession of objective knowledge is the new one which is not based on the traditional conception of knowledge. But, for him, to deny the foundational attitude to knowledge is not to deny objectivity and cognitive relation with world.

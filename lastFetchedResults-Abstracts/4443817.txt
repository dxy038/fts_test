The basic requirement on a third generation mobile system is to support universal high quality voice service as well as a wide range of data services, including data file transfer and high bit-rate services. The Code Division Testbed (CODIT) project is a research project within the European RACE programme that has the objective to explore the potential of CDMA for a future third generation mobile system like FPLMTS or UMTS. The main activities of the project are: To establish an advanced system concept based on CDMA including advanced radio technologies (radio interface, radio transceivers, etc.) and advanced radio subsystem architecture (micro and picocells, macro diversity, fast and soft handover, frequency management, radio network planning, etc.). To design and build a system demonstrator (testbed) comprising test mobile stations, radio base stations and a radio network controller. To validate the system concept in laboratory and field test, as well as with simulations. The results will be used to improve the concept and to compare with other radio access techniques. The project duration was from February 1992 to December 1994. During 1992 the basis for the system concept was established. The design and manufacture of the testbed were to take place during 1993 and lab and field tests to be performed 1994

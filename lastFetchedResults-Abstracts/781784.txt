Background and Objective: For many years, a large number of studies showed that zinc has major role in biosynthesis, storage and function of insulin. The aim of this study is assessment of effects of zinc supplementation on glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes
Subjects and Methods: Body mass index (BMI), serum levels of zinc and HbA1c of 29 patients with type 1 diabetes at baseline were measured. Then patients received 50 mg/day elemental zinc for 3 months. At the end of the treatment period serum levels of zinc and HbA1c were investigated again.
Results: After treatment, mean serum zinc level did not differ significantly with before levels. But the mean HbA1c levels from 8.5±.7 reached to 8.1 ± .7 after treatment with zinc supplementation (P < .001). HbA1c levels decrease mainly occured in women with a BMI  <  25 and men with BMI  >  25. As The higher the BMI, the percentage of reduction in HbA1c level was lower.
Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that administration of zinc can reduce the levels of HbA1c in patients with type 1 diabetes. However, this effects is dependent upon both gender and BMI of the patient.

Objective (s): The purpose of this intervention was to evaluate a theory-driven instructional multimedia about exercise behavior and health-related physical fitness among women in Tehran, Iran.
Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial. In all a random sample of 130 women who were living in institutional houses in Tehran, Iran (2014) participated in the study. We designed ‘Women and Active Life’ self-taught multimedia based on the expanded theory of planned behavior (TPB) using the Flash and ActionScript3 software. This multimedia consisted of a menu with six principal actions (particularly educational sessions). The expected outcomes were analyzed at baseline, 3 and 6 months post-intervention. 
Results: Administering educational package was conducive in increasing and sustaining all outcome measures including the developed TPB constructs, cardiopulmonary fitness, muscular strength/endurance and flexibility in the experimental group at 3 and 6 months post-education, respectively (P < 0.001). Additionally we observed that body fat percentage, waist to hip ratio and body mass index reduced and retained (P < 0.001). However, no significant changes occurred in aforesaid variables in the control group (P > 0.05).
Conclusion: Utilizing new technologies such as interactive multimedia grounded on the expended TPB led to improved exercise behavior, aerobic/muscular fitness and body composition in women.

Recent programs such as NASAÂ´s Runway Incursion Prevention System (RIPS) have placed newly developed airport surveillance systems and technology at Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) International airport for testing in an attempt to develop systems that will reduce the risk of runway incursions. The primary objective of the RIPS test conducted in October 2000 at DFW was to assess and validate the performance of communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) infrastructure technologies and incursion alerting systems for preventing runway incursion. The test included analysis of both ground systems and the Surface Traffic Information Systems-Broadcast (STIS-B) data link

GPS tracking has many uses in today´s world; the system can be used for children tracking, asset, car or any equipment tracking and as spy equipment. This paper presents an accurate and reliable real time tracking system using GPS (global positioning system) and GSM (global system for mobile communication) services, which was designed and implemented successfully in university of Khartoum labs. The system permits localization of a portable tracked unit and transmitting the position to the tracking centre. The GPS tracking system consists of portable tracked device attached to a person, vehicle or any asset, and the tracking center where the portable device´s location should be monitored. The mobile tracked device receives its coordinates from the GPS and sends these coordinates as SMS via GSM modem to the tracking centre, which is simply a personal computer with many interface programs to display the location on Google maps using free version of Google Maps APIs (application programming interfaces). The testing shows that The system meets its objective of being low-cost, accurate, real time and adaptive for various applications.

Cow’s milk allergy is one of the most common food allergies in childhood. Beta- lactoglobulin (β-  Lg) is  a dominant  allergen in  cow’s milk. Hydrolysis is  known as  an effective method to reduce the allergenicity of proteins. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare the allergenicity of β-Lg and its hydrolysates using an animal model.
Twenty four BALB/c mice were divided into three groups and subcutaneously injected with native bovine β-Lg and its hydrolysates on days 0, 7 and 14. During the sensitization period, a number of systemic anaphylactic indicators were observed in mice sensitized by β- Lg compared to those sensitized by hydrolysates of β-Lg.
Mice sensitized by hydrolysates of β-Lg showed a significantly lower spleen lymphocyte proliferation level than that sensitized by intact β-Lg. Antibody levels of β-Lg-specific IgE in serum induced by native β-Lg were significantly high. Plasma histamine levels were also evaluated  and  showed  the  same  trend  as  IgE.  Moreover,  the  hydrolysates  of  β-Lg significantly down-regulated IL-4 and IL-5 secretions in serum.
These results suggested that enzymatic hydrolysis could reduce the allergenicity of β-Lg.

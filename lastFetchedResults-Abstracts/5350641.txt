This paper explores a Battery/Ultracapacitor Energy Storage System (BUCESS) for navy application. A new configuration of the battery and ultracapacitor combined system is introduced for propulsion system and pulse power loads. A dual active bridge (DAB) topology is selected to control the bidirectional power flow through phase shifting for charging and discharging batteries and ultracapacitors. High-frequency switching devices are selected to achieve dc-dc conversion at high voltage and high power levels. A 500V-1kV BUCESS is designed and analyzed to investigate 100kW transmission for batteries and 1MW for ultracapacitors both in charging and discharging modes.

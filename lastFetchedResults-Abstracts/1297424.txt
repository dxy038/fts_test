In this paper we propose a new method to determine the exact nadir (minimum) criterion values over the efficient set in multiple objective linear programming (MOLP). The basic idea of the method is to determine, for each criterion, the region of the weight space associated with the efficient solutions that have a value in that criterion below the minimum already known (by default, the minimum in the payoff table). If this region is empty, the nadir value has been found. Otherwise, a new efficient solution is computed using a weight vector picked from the delimited region and a new iteration is performed. The method is able to find the nadir values in MOLP problems with any number of objective functions, although the computational effort increases significantly with the number of objectives. Computational experiments are described and discussed, comparing two slightly different versions of the method.

In this paper a novel technique is proposed with which the optimal Degree of Hybridization (DOH) can be found with very little computational effort. This technique combines PSO algorithm and HEV simulation tool and its objective is to optimize both the fuel economy and vehicle performance and minimize the emissions, including HC, CO for a hybrid electric vehicle. Advanced VehIcle SimulatOR (ADVISOR) software is used as the vehicle simulation tool. Needed simulations have been carried out on the Toyota Prius which its model is available in the ADVISOR. The results obtained from simulations, prove the validity and efficiency of the proposed technique.

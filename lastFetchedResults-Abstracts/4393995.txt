Energy consumption for cellular communication is increasingly gaining importance in smartphone battery lifetime as the bandwidth of wireless communication and the demand for mobile traffic increase. For energy-efficient cellular communication, we tackle two energy characteristics of cellular networks: (1) transmission energy highly varies upon channel condition, and (2) transmission of a packet accompanies unnecessary tail energy waste. Under the objective of transmitting packets when the best channel is provided as well as a number of packets are accumulated, we propose a new mobile collaboration framework &#8220;PhonePool&#8221; that aggregates smart devices across multiple cellular providers. Compared to the standalone operation, even without a buffering delay, PhonePool allows better channel and reduces more tail energy in a statistical point of view. To maximize the energy benefit while maintaining the fairness among the nodes in collaboration, we further develop a dynamic programming framework providing the optimal algorithm of PhonePool and its approximated heuristic. Trace-driven simulations on our experimental HSPA/EVDO/LTE network traces show that PhonePool of 5 devices achieves up to 42% of energy reduction.
